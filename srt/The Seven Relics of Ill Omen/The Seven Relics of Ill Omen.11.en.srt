5
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:10,620
Zhama,

6
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,660
the mule cart lantern
are like will-o'-the-wisps.

7
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:13,740
Out here in the middle of nowhere.

8
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,820
Scared us to death.

9
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,580
So that's Qiju Village up ahead?

10
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:18,500
Yeah.

11
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,900
But I heard the village was deserted?

12
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,860
Most folks moved to town years ago.

13
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,060
But the elders who've lived
in the mountains all their lives

14
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,380
prefer to stay.

15
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:27,740
Like my mom.

16
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,300
She's used to mountain spring water

17
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,420
and can't stand the tap water.

18
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,740
See, I come by every couple weeks

19
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,220
to drop off supplies.

20
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,540
And stay with her for a few days.

21
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,100
Then we're lucky.

22
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,620
Just got here and ran into you,

23
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,980
even hitched a ride.

24
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,140
So

25
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,180
what brings you out here?

26
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,620
You've got relatives here, right?

27
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:47,620
Oh, by the way,

28
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,980
we just ran into some crazy geezer.

29
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:50,900
Gave us a real fright.

30
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,540
He kept babbling about savage.

31
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,380
That's Mr. Suonan
from the next village.

32
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,700
He went into the mountains
and saw a savage a few years back.

33
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,020
That scared him out of his mind.

34
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,460
Are there actually savages around here?

35
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,180
No. Absolutely no.

36
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,580
That's just folklore.

37
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,340
After what happened to Mr. Suonan,

38
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,660
the government sent a team
to investigate.

39
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,180
No savages at all.

40
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,740
If they were real,

41
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,980
this place would've been famous by now.

42
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,540
This is a shortcut.

43
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,300
Only available for oxcarts.

44
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,340
We'll reach the village soon.

45
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,500
Stop trying!

46
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:33,940
No signal out here.

47
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,340
I have something very urgent

48
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,660
to contact my friends. What should I do?

49
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,820
Go out.

50
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,180
Where you can drive, there's signal.

51
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,580
Is your mule cart heading out
tomorrow morning?

52
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,660
Here's the number.

53
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,660
Could you help me contact them?

54
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,300
The mule just got here. It's tired.

55
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,540
It needs rest.

56
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,700
You need rest.

57
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,100
So does it.

58
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,340
Then I'll hire someone?

59
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,620
How much

60
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,700
are you offering?

61
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,060
A hundred?

62
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,180
Yeah.

63
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,340
I'll give you two hundred.

64
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,140
Just help me contact them.

65
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:10,780
Then I'll do it.

66
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,580
I ate my fill tonight.

67
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,300
I've got strength.

68
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,100
I'll leave at first light tomorrow.

69
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,340
Alright.

70
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,780
Here's the number.

71
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,220
Sure.

72
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,300
My master's phone is still switched off.

73
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,300
Can't get through to Miss Rich either.

74
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,340
Best-case scenario?

75
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,980
Bad signal in the mountains.

76
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,660
Well, worst-case...

77
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,820
No. Don't even think it.

78
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,060
Forget it.

79
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,540
Luo Ren, we need to hurry.

80
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,380
I saw a shadow in the cart today.

81
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,700
Looked just like a Sunny Doll.

82
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,180
Vision again?

83
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,300
Yes.

84
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,740
Then ignore it.

85
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,980
Pingting's safe now.

86
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,980
No one wants anything to do

87
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:01,900
with that cursed relic of ill omen.

88
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:04,620
What?

89
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,540
You're going into Yueliang Mountain?

90
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,420
Why?

91
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,060
Is there any problem?

92
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,820
Rainy season now.

93
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,020
Roads are rough.

94
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,500
And you are an elderly man.

95
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,940
With two young girls?

96
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,900
Plus, rumors say

97
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,340
there are savages in there.

98
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,420
Thought you said no savages?

99
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,380
No one's seen them.

100
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,460
But the stories persist.

101
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,580
Locals avoid the mountain.

102
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,820
Few dare to go in.

103
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,340
So

104
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,740
even without savages,

105
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,580
there are still beasts, I guess.

106
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,300
Relax.

107
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,220
I've been there before.

108
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,060
No savages. No beasts.

109
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,940
Just rumors.

110
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,820
Rumors don't scare us.

111
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,140
Hongsha.

112
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,740
Back to the room.

113
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:49,780
No, thanks.

114
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,700
I'm good.

115
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,580
I'm getting old.

116
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,260
This thing keeps me up at night.

117
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,980
Let's head back.

118
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,100
I'll go out.

119
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,820
Madam, I'll have some.

120
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,980
There's more if you want.

121
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,780
There's more if you want.

122
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,700
My mom means

123
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:18,660
you can ask for more

124
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:19,660
if you want.

125
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,100
No, this is plenty.

126
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,700
My mom likes you.

127
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,300
Keep it.

128
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:35,980
Thank you.

129
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:36,980
My mom's amazing.

130
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,260
The colored cords she weaves
possess power.

131
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,300
They can help
with romantic relationships.

132
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,940
Help with romantic relationships?

133
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,180
Back in the day,

134
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,980
couples in these mountains
would visit a Taoist nun

135
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,900
to see if they were well-matched
before marrying.

136
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,740
My mom's ancestors were great shamans.

137
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:49,900
Truly powerful.

138
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,180
I know you city folk

139
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,220
might not put much stock
in our old ways.

140
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,940
So does checking a match

141
00:05:59,180 --> 00:05:59,900
require both people,

142
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,580
or just one?

143
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,460
Just one.

144
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:04,980
But do you have something

145
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,820
he gave you?

146
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,020
If you do, then we can do that.

147
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,780
Here.

148
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,220
May Yueliang Mountain bring you blessings.

149
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:55,900
Well?

150
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,980
I had a feeling.

151
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,180
Not a good match?

152
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,300
These will fill you up on the road.

153
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,140
And mark your trail,

154
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,060
or you'll lose your way.

155
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:16,740
Got it.

156
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:17,620
Also,

157
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,500
there's an abandoned village halfway.

158
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,780
You can shelter there.

159
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:21,900
Our hunters stay there

160
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,380
when they can't make it back in a day.

161
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,180
I know.

162
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,220
You know?

163
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,180
My mom says that village

164
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,540
was cleared out twenty years ago.

165
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:29,500
You've been there?

166
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,740
I heard it from...

167
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:32,740
Mom.

168
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,260
My mom prepared these for you.

169
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,300
Yueliang Mountain sees a lot of rain.

170
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,140
Her woven bamboo hats
work better than umbrellas.

171
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:40,860
Thank you.

172
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,220
Here, Grandpa.

173
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:46,940
I'm leaving right away

174
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:47,940
and make good time.

175
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,060
I'll make sure

176
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,620
to contact your friends.

177
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:51,980
Thank you.

178
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,100
Don't dwell too much

179
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,500
on last night.

180
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,020
My mom's visions

181
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,140
aren't always right.

182
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,580
My mom just said

183
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,060
she couldn't fully see through it.

184
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,100
She said there's another you.

185
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,500
But the one that remains in the end

186
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,620
isn't the same

187
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,740
as the you now.

188
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:12,820
What's "right" or not?

189
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,020
Don't dilly-dally. Let's go.

190
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:15,820
Be safe.

191
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,460
Bye, Madam.

192
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,180
She said

193
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,340
there's another you.

194
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,300
But the one that remains in the end

195
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,260
isn't the same

196
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,340
as the you now.

197
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,900
What are you doing?

198
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,380
Marking the trail.

199
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,660
We'll need it

200
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,460
to find our way back.

201
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,700
We're here.

202
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,340
The village is just ahead.

203
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,100
Hurry.

204
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,220
What's wrong?

205
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,940
Nothing. Keep moving.

206
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,900
What's that hanging there?

207
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,180
That's a Sunny Doll.

208
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,060
For praying for clear weather.

209
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,540
It's a local custom.

210
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,300
Almost every household has one.

211
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:18,860
Sunny Doll?

212
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,780
Why does that sound so familiar?

213
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,900
The relic of ill omen?

214
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,180
Remote mountains, village,

215
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,700
raining, and Sunny Doll.

216
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,740
Now everything adds up.

217
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,420
We can't be that unlucky

218
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,740
to run into the relic of ill omen again,
can we?

219
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:12,900
Eat first.

220
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,020
Let's eat first?

221
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,620
Whatever we've stumbled into,

222
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,020
we'll face it better

223
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,300
on full stomachs.

224
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,020
Fair point.

225
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,780
Grandpa, let's eat.

226
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,900
Thought that fifty thousand
would be easy money.

227
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,900
Nothing but fear and sweat.

228
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,740
Every penny earned through hard work.

229
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,860
Doubt this water's even safe.

230
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,060
I just got through on the phone

231
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,060
when you said you'd arrived.

232
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,140
That scared me.

233
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,900
Thought you were all

234
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,940
playing a prank on me.

235
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,380
So Mu Dai and the others are fine?

236
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:14,860
Apart from that madman,

237
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,060
nothing else happened?

238
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,060
Hey,

239
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,020
how many times do I have to tell you?

240
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,700
Relax. All's well.

241
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,060
Eat.

242
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,820
Still a day's gap, though.

243
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,660
Just walk faster tomorrow.

244
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,260
They're just women and an elderly man.

245
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,540
You'll catch up

246
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,580
with full stomachs.

247
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:39,900
But don't travel at night.

248
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,260
Too dangerous.

249
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,180
You'll get lost.

250
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:45,940
Mom,

251
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,140
do you want some porridge?

252
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,620
By the way, Zhama.

253
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:01,860
No savages, right?

254
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,060
Didn't they say his clothes

255
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,180
were torn to shreds

256
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,860
when they found Mr. Suonan?

257
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,140
And he was screaming
about savages eating people?

258
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,740
Female savage, huh?

259
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,100
He was raving mad.

260
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:12,900
Nonsense.

261
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,900
Sounded convincing to me.

262
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,020
Pretty credible.

263
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,420
See? You're buying into it already.

264
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,980
The more rumors spread,

265
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,100
the wilder they get.

266
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,300
What's so funny?

267
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,180
Your eyes have narrowed to slits.

268
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,340
Spit it out.

269
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,980
You may not come here in vain.

270
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,060
Might end up a mountain bridegroom.

271
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,220
Right, Luo?

272
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,060
Think about it.

273
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,300
You're skilled in combat.

274
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,700
And I'm strong.

275
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,420
But this guy? Skinny arms, twig legs.

276
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,780
What'll you do if a female savage
really shows up?

277
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,100
Yeah, right.

278
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,180
Let me tell you,

279
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,580
these twig legs?

280
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,100
She won't like them.

281
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,980
She'll want your type, strong guy.

282
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,580
You're laughing too?

283
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:56,740
You...

284
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,460
My ring fell in.

285
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,580
I'll get it.

286
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,860
There, the ring.

287
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,620
Fished a Sunny Doll out of the well?

288
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,660
You already pulled it out.

289
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,620
Might as well bring it over.

290
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,460
Maybe we'll discover something.

291
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,940
Since when are you so brave?

292
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,260
You go get it then.

293
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,260
It's right by the well.

294
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,180
I'm freaked out.

295
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,620
Me too.

296
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,660
Hauling that bucket up nearly killed me.

297
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,020
You're just picking it up.

298
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,100
A quick sprint.

299
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:38,580
Mu Dai,

300
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,700
I'm your boss now.

301
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,340
You're the employee.

302
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,100
Since when can an employee

303
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,460
direct the boss?

304
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,220
Mu Dai, Mu Dai.

305
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,260
It is a Sunny Doll.

306
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,380
Just like Luo described.

307
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,620
But the craftsmanship...

308
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,220
A bit shoddy.

309
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,900
Even my work's better than this.

310
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,540
But who made it?

311
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,940
What are you two doing?

312
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,500
Mu Dai fished a Sunny Doll
out of the well.

313
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,580
Why mess with children's toys?

314
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:35,980
Mu Dai.

315
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,860
Please stay here alone for now.

316
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,500
Hongsha and I need to discuss

317
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:41,620
family matters.

318
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,460
- Alright.
- Hongsha.

319
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:44,540
Come on.

320
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:47,940
Wait for me.

321
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,340
What are you staring at?

322
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:01,860
Grandpa,

323
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,980
can you stop being so wary of Mu Dai?

324
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,020
She's my closest friend.

325
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,220
How am I supposed to

326
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,380
if you keep this up?

327
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,620
What do you know?

328
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,020
This treasure hunt

329
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,740
might be my last.

330
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,220
Your uncle's dead.

331
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,020
Who knows

332
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,620
how long I have left?

333
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:36,620
Grandpa, please don't say that.

334
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,820
Why do you think

335
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,300
I'd come all the way here?

336
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,380
For you.

337
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,220
They say we reap

338
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,540
what our ancestors sow.

339
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,860
I'm just here to help you

340
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,620
lay a solid groundwork.

341
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,580
I went to great lengths

342
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,700
to hide this gem well.

343
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,300
I don't use it lightly.

344
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,660
It's only for emergencies.

345
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,660
Some things

346
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,260
in this trade can't be shared.

347
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,140
Fierce competition,

348
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,220
scarce opportunities.

349
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,460
When you find a gem well,

350
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:33,580
you're afraid
it'll be discovered by others.

351
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,180
So you'd resort to an ancient method.

352
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:40,940
You use human vitality
to suppress the treasure's aura.

353
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,460
Only then can it be concealed tightly,

354
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,260
and others won't be able to find it.

355
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:03,780
The sun's out.

356
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,100
A good omen.

357
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:07,580
Let's go.

358
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,500
Mu Dai,

359
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:10,980
what are you looking for?

360
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:11,820
Move.

361
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,380
Hurry.

362
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:15,900
Let's go.

363
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,820
That Sunny Doll.

364
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,620
Now of all times?

365
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,060
You're still hung up on a doll?

366
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,020
Go.

367
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:23,980
Move.

368
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,300
Let's go.

369
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,420
Where did the Sunny Doll go?

370
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,900
What, is it strange?

371
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,860
Yes.

372
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,380
After we brought it back yesterday,

373
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,380
no one touched it.

374
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,060
There were only a few of us in the room.

375
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,900
How could it just disappear?

376
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,260
Did it move on its...

377
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,620
What's wrong, Grandpa?

378
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,380
Why stop?

379
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,140
This is it.

380
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,420
Here?

381
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:16,940
Can't you feel it?

382
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,140
The energy here

383
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,140
is different.

384
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,820
What energy?

385
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,780
What exactly can your grandpa see?

386
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,820
I don't know

387
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:33,940
the specifics.

388
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,300
But my uncle once told me

389
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,340
the range
of the electromagnetic spectrum is vast.

390
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,180
The range that human eyes can perceive

391
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,060
is roughly from 400 to 700 nanometers.

392
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,700
The parts we can't see isn't empty.

393
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,620
It's just that we can't perceive them.

394
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,100
Right here. Start digging.

395
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,340
Don't touch this!

396
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,380
This is

397
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,740
a Yan family matter.

398
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,380
Outsiders shouldn't interfere.

399
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,540
You've got good martial arts skills.

400
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:44,980
Go up there and keep watch.

401
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,340
Back in the day, treasure hunts

402
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,220
always attracted vultures.

403
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,580
We'd better be on guard.

404
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,300
Go.

405
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,180
Hongsha.

406
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,660
Hongsha!

407
00:21:59,060 --> 00:21:59,660
Come here.

408
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:05,700
Hongsha.

409
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:07,860
Hongsha!

410
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,220
Come here.

411
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:24,060
Use human vitality
to suppress the treasure's aura.

412
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,740
Take it.

413
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,060
Take it!

414
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:32,980
Take it.

415
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:42,700
Dig here.

416
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:44,740
Hurry.

417
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,860
Gently.

418
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,900
Tall trees, saplings, crooked trunks,

419
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,820
and ochre-colored trees.

420
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,660
What's the big deal about these?

421
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:16,860
Grandpa, I...

422
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,020
I can't keep digging.

423
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,420
I'm too scared.

424
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,380
Dig. Keep digging.

425
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,180
No!

426
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,700
If I could do it myself,
would I need you?

427
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:25,580
Dig!

428
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:26,820
I won't!

429
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,460
I'm not digging. I refuse!

430
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:33,820
Hongsha.

431
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,380
What? Are you tired?

432
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:37,940
Well,

433
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,820
let me dig.

434
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,260
No! Don't.

435
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,020
Why not?

436
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,180
Don't dig.

437
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:44,940
Why?

438
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,980
There's a corpse down there!

439
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,420
Hongsha!

440
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:57,620
How could there be a corpse here?

441
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:58,980
What's going on?

442
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,700
You've been protecting us all the way.

443
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,740
You're practically one of us.

444
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,420
It doesn't matter if I tell you.

445
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,060
Well,

446
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,380
it was my own greed.

447
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:24,000
Back then, we formed
a treasure-hunting squad

448
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,740
to explore the well.

449
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,860
Among all the members,

450
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,340
I was the only one who could read
the treasure's aura.

451
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,180
After scouting several mountains,

452
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,340
I found it

453
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,540
right here.

454
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,820
A perfect well.

455
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,380
The treasure's aura
was extremely strong.

456
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,300
And

457
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,460
there was a corpse inside.

458
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,100
Normally,

459
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,580
a corpse's vitality

460
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,580
should've suppressed
the treasure's aura.

461
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,500
Yet it didn't.

462
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:00,420
It's evident how strong
the treasure's aura is.

463
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,980
Maybe too much time had passed.

464
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,700
The corpse had decayed to bones.

465
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,300
Its vitality faded.

466
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,060
So it couldn't suppress
the treasure's aura.

467
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,660
So I got greedy.

468
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,020
I told the them

469
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,780
the well was a dud.

470
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,460
And they just bought it.

471
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,620
Gem well?

472
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,740
Nine out of ten are empty.

473
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,740
If we had just left then

474
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,540
without doing anything,

475
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,620
it actually would have been fine.

476
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,340
But

477
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,300
what if another expert passed by?

478
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,580
They'd notice it.

479
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,340
I had to hide it properly.

480
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,100
I needed to come up with a plan.

481
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,180
Just then,

482
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,060
one of the members suffered
from acclimatization problems

483
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,140
and died of a sudden illness.

484
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,300
So I buried him right in here.

485
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,580
Fresh corpses have strong vitality.

486
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,620
It could suppress the treasure's aura.

487
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:58,260
An old, vile practice
among treasure hunters.

488
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,220
Vile!

489
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,620
It's absolutely...

490
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,780
Only fools would believe
in that nonsense.

491
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,300
Shut up!

492
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,140
Hongsha.

493
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,500
Who do you think I did all this for?

494
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,780
For you youngsters!

495
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,340
You youngsters

496
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,820
are so disappointing.

497
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,900
You've made me have to...

498
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,020
Maybe...

499
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,660
Maybe it's because I'm getting old.

500
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,460
I regret what I did more every day.

501
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,420
So this trip isn't just

502
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,820
about leaving Hongsha
something valuable.

503
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,180
It's about laying my friend

504
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,740
to rest properly.

505
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,500
After we take the treasure,

506
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,300
we'll send his family their share.

507
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,820
Your grandpa's right.

508
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,300
But

509
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,700
I'm afraid of corpses too.

510
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,580
It's up to you whether we dig or not.

511
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,300
My master often says

512
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,820
that it's all about fate

513
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,460
when one meets someone

514
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,860
and does something somewhere.

515
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,100
Since we're here,

516
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,340
we bury him right.

517
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,100
Call it karma.

518
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:39,460
What's wrong?

519
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,340
Someone's here.

520
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:45,780
There's someone nearby.

521
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:46,620
How many?

522
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,380
Let me see.

523
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,340
They're hiding behind the trees.

524
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,180
Can't tell.

525
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,340
How many?

526
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,380
I don't see anyone now.

527
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,260
Probably ran.

528
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,940
Too far to chase.

529
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,380
Treasure poachers.

530
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,700
Here to snatch the treasure.

531
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,700
Stop humming.

532
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,540
You'll attract things

533
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,380
with that noise.

534
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,940
Morale boost for the march.

535
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,420
Morale?

536
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,260
So annoying.

537
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:28,660
Come over here.

538
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:33,940
Found it.

539
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:34,860
This mark

540
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:35,940
is different

541
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:36,700
from the ones we saw.

542
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,740
When we carve marks,

543
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,340
we usually do it at chest-height.

544
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,540
Given Mu Dai's height,

545
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,060
it's impossible for her
to reach this high.

546
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,900
And look, this carving is so deep.

547
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,220
Neither of us

548
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,260
could've made them.

549
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,060
Something's wrong in this mountain.

550
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,140
There are others

551
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,740
besides Mu Dai and her group.

552
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,500
Let's go find the marks Mu Dai made.

553
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,420
Careful. Here's the knife.

554
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,180
For me?

555
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,540
I'll leave my back to you.

556
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:28,540
Mu Dai!

557
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,300
The cave

558
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,060
is right below.

559
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,660
Get the ropes.

560
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,540
They're in your red bag.

561
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,380
Two of them.

562
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,300
Tie them tight.

563
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:11,900
On the count of three,

564
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,340
you two pull together.

565
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:16,860
One.

566
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,060
Two.

567
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,380
Three.

568
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:04,820
The...

569
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,380
The bones are gone.

570
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,700
Really.

571
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,100
Give me the rope.

572
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,620
I'll go down and take a look.

573
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,460
No, Grandpa.

574
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:34,860
Grandpa!

575
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,980
What was that?

576
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:47,820
Mu Dai!

577
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:18,740
You saw it too, right?

578
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,500
That thing with the fur.

579
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,060
Had to be two meters tall.

580
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,380
That's the savage, isn't it, Mu Dai?

581
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,780
Probably.

582
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,260
Such a huge size.

583
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,540
And it ambushed us.

584
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,340
Ordinary beasts can't do that.

585
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,780
Are we even safe here?

586
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,820
Get down!

587
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,780
Don't let him chase after us.

588
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,060
No, it had to be in the well.

589
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,660
How could the corpse just disappear?

590
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,380
Please, just forget

591
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,100
the well, Grandpa.

592
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,740
We just saw a savage!

593
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:51,940
Sir,

594
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,300
could someone else

595
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,180
have found the well

596
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,740
and removed the corpse?

597
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:58,860
Impossible.

598
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,220
I hid that well

599
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,420
so well.

600
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,900
Others simply couldn't find it.

601
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,540
And

602
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,540
even if they removed the corpse,

603
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,100
why would they

604
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,860
restore the well to its original state?

605
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,180
Who knows.

606
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,540
Your companion died of an illness.

607
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,740
Maybe he wasn't fully dead.

608
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,380
So he climbed out.

609
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:22,780
No way!

610
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,420
She had her throat cut.

611
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,260
Bled out all over that well.

612
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:28,220
How could she have just...?

613
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,380
Grandpa.

614
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,940
You said he died of an illness.

615
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,540
Where are you going?

616
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,220
To take a leak.

617
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,820
I'll go with you.

618
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:03,940
It's not safe for you to go alone.

619
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,340
No need.

620
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,980
How am I supposed to piss
with you there?

621
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:08,740
Don't worry.

622
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,260
You two stay here.

623
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:29,980
Mu Dai.

624
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:32,900
My grandpa killed someone.

625
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,420
Didn't he?

626
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:37,900
He killed someone.

627
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,540
Maybe it's not what we think.

628
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,220
I'm not stupid.

629
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,420
He killed someone.

630
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:51,700
He is

631
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:54,660
a murderer.

632
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,900
It's raining outside.

633
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:05,500
Hongsha,

634
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,700
your grandpa's still out there.

635
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,620
Let's check on him.

636
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:08,820
Why bother?

637
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,020
He'll be fine.

638
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,340
He can even kill people.

639
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,820
Is this lamp about to be broken?

640
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,140
Sir?

641
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:41,140
What's wrong?

642
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,380
What was that noise?

643
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,060
Grandpa, get inside!

644
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,300
Grandpa!

645
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:08,540

646
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:10,740

Mu Dai.

673
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,220
Are you okay?

674
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,140
What a thrilling night.

675
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,620
Let's add an egg for my master

676
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,300
to calm and nourish her.

677
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,740
You swiped this
from Zhama's place, didn't you?

678
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:17,980
What else did you swipe?

679
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,060
Just toss it all in.

680
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,820
Savages might carry bacteria.

681
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,340
I'll give you a shot later.

682
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,100
You're really prepared.

683
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:52,780
Obviously.

684
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,540
You're in the deep mountains.

685
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,500
Even without beasts,

686
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,140
there's tetanus

687
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,900
from falls.

688
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,460
I've checked your luggage.

689
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,540
No medicine.

690
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,220
No proper weapons.

691
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,580
But you do have plenty of food.

692
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,180
What are you here for?

693
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,380
A vacation?

694
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,260
Enough.

695
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,460
I'll check the noodles.

696
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:22,620
Hongsha.

697
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,900
We need to talk later.

698
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:28,940
Almost done.

699
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,300
Oh no, Chubby,

700
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,140
I've never seen Luo Ren this pissed.

701
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,780
Is he going to kill me?

702
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:45,540
You get an egg too.

703
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,540
Don't be mad at Hongsha.

704
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:51,860
It's not her fault.

705
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:57,340
Does it still hurt?

706
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:00,820
Let me see.

707
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,300
What's wrong?

708
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,420
Lower your head and let me see.

709
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,660
That savage dragged me by the hair

710
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,740
for a while.

711
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,860
Is it a strain?

712
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:10,740
Let me check.

713
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,300
It's quite bad.

714
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:17,700
What?

715
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,220
This patch

716
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,060
might not recover.

717
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:21,980
You'll have

718
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,780
a bald spot this big.

719
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:24,540
Bald?

720
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:26,740
I'm going bald?

721
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:27,500
It's okay.

722
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,580
Smart heads stay bare.

723
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:30,420
If you go bald,

724
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,740
it means you're getting smarter.

725
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:32,900
Normally,

726
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,780
you can just cover it up
with the hair on the sides.

727
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,380
If that doesn't work, just wear a hat.

728
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,220
Why are you crying?

729
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,300
I was just kidding.

730
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:48,980
You're not bald.

731
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,060
You...

732
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,700
