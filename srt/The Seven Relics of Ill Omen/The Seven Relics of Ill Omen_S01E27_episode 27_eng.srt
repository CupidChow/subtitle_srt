1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,940
 

2
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:24,100



3
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,390
   

4
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,020
 

5
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,985
 

6
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,500
Senior Master.

7
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,480
Why are you shouting?

8
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,960
Have you found anything?

9
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,580
Looks like they got in by climbing over the wall.

10
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,200
See, I told you.

11
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,800
You'd be back within half an hour.

12
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,380
- Senior Master.
- It's getting late.

13
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,860
Let's all get some rest early.

14
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,560
Senior Master.

15
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,100
What is it?

16
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,540
Do you think he's skilled in martial arts?

17
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,260
He's got some talent.

18
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,540
Let me put it this way.

19
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,900
On this entire journey,
I haven't seen anyone more skilled than him.

20
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:10,779
And I've never seen Luo this anxious before.

21
00:02:10,779 --> 00:02:16,340
Think about it, an opponent who could make him lose control must be formidable.

22
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,660
We should take this seriously.

23
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,760
Do you know about Heisha?

24
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,940
Heisha?

25
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:29,460
I've been there before, made some friends, and I've also got some stories.

26
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,000
I'll tell you about them some other time.

27
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,220
What about Leopard?

28
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,740
Leopard?

29
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,620
That name doesn't ring a bell.

30
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,500
Sounds like an up-and-comer.

31
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,560
It's not that I won't help you.

32
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,740
Circumstances won't allow it.

33
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:54,140
At sunrise tomorrow, when the fog clears, I'll take you into the mountains.

34
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,220
One more thing.

35
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:00,300
No one enters my master's room.

36
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,480
Otherwise, get out of here.

37
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,360
Now get some rest.

38
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,340
What kind of mess is this?

39
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,380
Have you no shame?

40
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,640
Don't you dare run!

41
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:42,700
 Oh no. Mr. Zhang said if Free
clucks again tonight, he'll slaughter it. 

42
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,740
Outrageous.

43
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,540
- What kind of person does this?
- Free. Free?

44
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,180
Snaring cats and dogs is bad enough,
but now chickens?

45
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,940
- What's wrong, Mr. Zhang?
- So ill-mannered. Don't you dare run!

46
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,060
Who was it?

47
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,340
Look at this.

48
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,940
Rice?

49
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,380
Why does it smell like alcohol?

50
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,760
Drunken rice.

51
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,640
Country folk use it to trap birds and chickens.

52
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,180
That chicken you brought here isn't even rare.

53
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,700
Why are so many people after it?

54
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,460
Free. Are you okay, Free?

55
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,880
You poor little thing.

56
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,340
Mr. Zhang, stop scaring Free.

57
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,820
Look, what a good chicken it is.

58
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,620
Won't even take handouts. Right?

59
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,213
Good chicken.

60
00:04:23,213 --> 00:04:26,973
When I see Chubby, I'll make sure to praise you.

61
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,900
You're such a poor little thing.

62
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,000
Luo!

63
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,880
Senior Master!

64
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,140
What is this all about?

65
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:42,000
You couldn't find her, and now you've lost me too.

66
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,140
What's the use of running so fast?

67
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,720
In the end, I found her.

68
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,160
Grandmaster!

69
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,421
Master!

70
00:05:43,421 --> 00:05:45,880
Luo!

71
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,480
Senior Master!

72
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,280
Master.

73
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,180
Mu Dai.

74
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,980
Where's Mu Dai?

75
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,760
Mu Dai!

76
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,420
- Master!
- Mu Dai!

77
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,540
Master!

78
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,240
Mu Dai!

79
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,000
Master!

80
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,940
Mu Dai!

81
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,100
Master!

82
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,540
 Long time no see. 

83
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,400
- Where's Mu Dai? 
 -  So you don't want to catch up with your old friend, 

84
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,860
 just worried about your little sweetheart? 

85
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,060
I'm asking you, where is Mu Dai?

86
00:06:55,935 --> 00:06:58,926
 She's fine. Just crying and cursing. 

87
00:06:58,926 --> 00:07:01,860
 But don't worry. I have a good temper. 

88
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,300
 I won't kill her with a single blow. 

89
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,460
 That would be no fun, right? 

90
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,100
You killed Master, didn't you?

91
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,245
Oh? That old lady looking for death?

92
00:07:11,245 --> 00:07:15,668
 Well, she's so old and she doesn't have much time left anyway. 

93
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:17,200
What do you want?

94
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,520
 What do I want? 

95
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,040
 Have you ever heard the saying? 

96
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,081
 A beautiful woman dies twice. 

97
00:07:24,081 --> 00:07:27,000
 One is when her beauty fades. 

98
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,460
 And the other is when her life comes to an end. 

99
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:34,700
 Luo, you took one of my eyes. 

100
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,420
 You've already killed me once. 

101
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,921
Where is she?

102
00:07:38,921 --> 00:07:40,880
 I have no idea. 

103
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,820
 Maybe I'll find out when we meet. 

104
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,980
Where is she?

105
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,400
 Your place is nice. 

106
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,580
 Just across the street
from your little angel's bar. 

107
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,400
 You do make a lot of boring and weird friends. 

108
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,580
 Why do they have a chicken? 

109
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,980
 You'd better get home now. 

110
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,620
 I don't like your chick. 

111
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,620
 She has sparkling eyes. 

112
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:06,920
 Not like mine, with a poor black hole. 

113
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,336
Put Mu Dai on the phone!

114
00:08:09,336 --> 00:08:15,500
 Come on, Luo, you're the last person in the world who gets to tell me what to do. 

115
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,100
Was that person on the phone

116
00:08:30,048 --> 00:08:32,468
called Leopard?

117
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,520
Let's go.

118
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,540
To Lixi.

119
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:42,360
You two go ahead.

120
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,440
I'll handle Master's funeral arrangements,

121
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,200
then catch up with you.

122
00:09:13,025 --> 00:09:14,640
 

123
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,080
 

124
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,720
 

125
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,740
I...

126
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,680
Luo.

127
00:09:48,549 --> 00:09:51,480
-  Hello, Luo Ren.  
 - Leopard took Mu Dai hostage,

128
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,540
killed her master, and wants to meet me in Lixi.

129
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,700
 Keep an eye on the bar.
Don't let anything happen to them. 

130
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,500
 

131
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,620
Got it. Don't worry.

132
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,860
That chicken almost got stolen last night.

133
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,660
What chicken? Is it my pet?

134
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,660
What kind of people are these?

135
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,020
Why are they targeting a chicken?

136
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,620
Probably Leopard's men.

137
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,740
They've always liked playing mind games.

138
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,640
Luo Ren, be careful.

139
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,740
Is this Wan Feng Huo?

140
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,860
I need you to look into someone. Money isn't an issue.

141
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,540
She's not in the country.

142
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,100
I know how your network works.

143
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,660
If there are people there, you can find intel.

144
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,720
The location is Old Heisha Island.

145
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,500
No one knows her real name. Her code name is Leopard.

146
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,900
Her organization collapsed a year and a half ago.

147
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,400
I want all the information about her.

148
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,020
Going back three generations if possible.

149
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,800
The sooner, the better. Make it urgent.

150
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,560
Are you saying Mu Dai was...?

151
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,640
Don't say it out loud.

152
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,360
Mr. Zhang and Madam Hong might hear.

153
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:04,380
Luo Ren, so we're in danger here too?

154
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,820
Yes.

155
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,280
That's why I asked Madam Hong to arrange for Aoki to stay.

156
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,260
He was my ally back in Heisha.

157
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,740
He's highly skilled.

158
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,680
He can protect you all.

159
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:20,020
Also, don't let Mr. Zhang and Madam Hong go out.

160
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,020
I'll guard my place myself.

161
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,360
After all, the relic of ill omen is there.

162
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,740
What about Mu Dai?

163
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,720
I'm still figuring that out.

164
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,780
- Senior. 
 -  I'm on my way. 

165
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,640
 I had a friend handle matters in Youwu Town. 

166
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,160
 He just told me
the autopsy results for Master are out. 

167
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,840
 Something's off. 

168
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,620
How so?

169
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,240
 Master wasn't murdered. 

170
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,840
 She died of a natural cause. 

171
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,400
 The cause was the depletion of her strength. 

172
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,140
 It can't be treated as a homicide case. 

173
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,280
Then the wounds on her body...?

174
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,920
 They were added after her death. 

175
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,500
 I was too distraught to notice the blood loss. 

176
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,980
Right. There wasn't much bleeding.

177
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,400
So Master wasn't killed by Leopard?

178
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,900
 Even if she didn't do it, she must
have added the wounds afterward. 

179
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,100
 It's unclear now. 

180
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,820
 We'll talk more when I get to Lixi. 

181
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,200
Hey, Mu Dai.

182
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,419
 Ren. 

183
00:12:28,419 --> 00:12:30,440
Why would Leopard let you call?

184
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,540
 Leopard? I haven't seen her. 

185
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,780
What?

186
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,257
Where is everyone? The house is empty.

187
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,080
- You're home?
- Yes.

188
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,500
It's pitch black here. Where did you all go?

189
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,547
Stay put. I'm coming to you.

190
00:12:43,547 --> 00:12:45,347
 Where's Master? 

191
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:48,040
Master?

192
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,240
You are...

193
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,734
In Youwu Town?

194
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,440
Someone's outside.

195
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,840
A woman.

196
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,113
- Leopard. 
 - Leopard?

197
00:13:06,113 --> 00:13:08,275
 Mu Dai, hide. 

198
00:13:08,275 --> 00:13:09,696
 Or run. 

199
00:13:09,696 --> 00:13:11,626
Is she strong?

200
00:13:11,626 --> 00:13:15,514
Luo Ren, I don't think I can get away.

201
00:13:15,514 --> 00:13:17,220
I'll have to fight my way out.

202
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,185
Listen to me. Don't hang up.

203
00:13:20,185 --> 00:13:22,185
Strike first. Don't hold back.

204
00:13:22,185 --> 00:13:24,205
 Watch for a gun. 

205
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,580
Luo Ren, I can't beat her.

206
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:34,241
Mu Dai. Mu Dai!

207
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,040
Mu Dai.

208
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,910
 Luo. 

209
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,755
 Things would have been very good. 

210
00:14:44,755 --> 00:14:46,616
 I would be thankful to you. 

211
00:14:46,616 --> 00:14:48,501
 It was very foggy last night. 

212
00:14:48,501 --> 00:14:51,262
 And the mountain road was hard to navigate. 

213
00:14:51,262 --> 00:14:53,831
 I couldn't find your little angel anywhere. 

214
00:14:53,831 --> 00:14:58,360
But you've been very cooperative and... Cleared the place.

215
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,052
Everyone out in a day.

216
00:15:00,052 --> 00:15:02,881
-  Impressed... 
- If you dare hurt her,

217
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,180
I'll kill you.

218
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:10,592
 Luo.  I can't wait to see you.

219
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:05,176
Where's my master?

220
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:11,357
Dead.

221
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,438
 

222
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:48,540
 Master said the mountains and rivers here 

223
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,960
 were arranged long ago by an expert, 

224
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,840
 forming a natural maze. 

225
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,970
 Follow the silver-eyed bats, and you won't lose your way. 

226
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:01,751
 Go in tonight, and come out tomorrow night. 

227
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:29,985
 Both Master, Grandmaster, and I have been stuck at the first gate all our lives. 

228
00:17:29,985 --> 00:17:34,170
 Only when the messenger brings the key can the second gate be opened. 

229
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,820
 If you never see it in your lifetime, 

230
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:45,460
 take on a reliable disciple
and pass this duty down. 

231
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,861
Fresh. Just out of the oven!

232
00:17:53,861 --> 00:17:55,781
Take it easy.

233
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,520
Come and have a look.

234
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,320
A bucket of oil, please.

235
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,350
Fresh sesame oil.

236
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,980
Here you go.

237
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,760
Sweet and delicious.

238
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,440
Some rice, please.

239
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,880
- One kilo of rice, please. 
 - Alright.

240
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:20,470
Take a look.

241
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,866
Here. There you go.

242
00:18:24,866 --> 00:18:27,286
Take care.

243
00:18:27,286 --> 00:18:29,340
How about some?

244
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,220
Get some spiced fruits.

245
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,440
Sure, just this?

246
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,500
- Yes, that's it.
- Sure.

247
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,660
Take a look if you're interested!

248
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,680
These are all new arrivals.

249
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,320
Two of these, please.

250
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,420
I know what you're trying to say.

251
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,480
Why don't we go home and have a meal first?

252
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,280
Ma!

253
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,400
I'm about to leave.

254
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,900
Okay.

255
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,840
- Someone got hit!
- What?

256
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,960
Ma.

257
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:16,380
Ma! Ma! Ma!

258
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,040
Is he alright?

259
00:19:23,033 --> 00:19:25,380
It's okay. Hang in there.

260
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,480
I'm calling an ambulance.

261
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,220
I'll...

262
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:36,020
Will someone call an ambulance?

263
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,180
Can someone call an ambulance?

264
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:41,840
Please, someone calls an ambulance!

265
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,980
Thank you!

266
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,420
- No signal here either.
- Stay strong.

267
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,848
Hold on there. The ambulance will be here soon.

268
00:19:47,848 --> 00:19:49,449
Kun.

269
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,600
I'm afraid I can't make it.

270
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,304
The secret can't die with... With me.

271
00:19:56,304 --> 00:19:57,660
You have to deliver the message.

272
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,780
Half of the map

273
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:04,180
was burned in the war.

274
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,670
The key.

275
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:08,820
And the other half... The key

276
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:13,040
is in the family genealogy...

277
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,880
The family genealogy.

278
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:19,560
Mr. Yin. Mr. Yin.

279
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,640
Mr. Yin.

280
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,200
Why isn't the ambulance here yet?

281
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,842
 

282
00:20:41,842 --> 00:20:43,600
Please succeed.

283
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,140
May everything go smoothly.

284
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,120
Let it go smoothly.

285
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,800
Uncle! Uncle! Uncle, hang in there!

286
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,120
Who is Yin Si Ma's family member?

287
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,280
Doctor, he's my uncle.

288
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,200
His life is out of danger. But whether
he wakes up depends on his will to survive.

289
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,280
We'll send him to the ICU.

290
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,240
Only one family member
can stay to sign for the ICU.

291
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,560
Mr. Shen, I'll stay to sign.

292
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,680
You go home and pack some clothes for my uncle.

293
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,800
Alright? Thank you.

294
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,580
So Yin Er Ma was originally named Yin Si Ma?

295
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,900
By family hierarchy,
my uncle's name should've been Si Ma.

296
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,580
But he didn't like it, so he changed it.

297
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,020
But there's no difference. They're both numbers.

298
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,960
Thank you.

299
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,520
No problem.

300
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,820
You have to pull through.

301
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,840
 

302
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:24,010
The secret can't die with... With me.

303
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,440
You have to deliver the message.

304
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,940
Half of the map was burned in the war.

305
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,380
The key. The family genealogy.

306
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,380
The family genealogy.

307
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,000
Half?

308
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,560
A key?

309
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,760
There's a key in the family genealogy?

310
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,360
 I found something. 

311
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,380
 Leopard's ancestral home is in Xiacheng Town, southeast of Jiang Province. 

312
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,680
- Xiacheng Town? 
 -  Yes. 

313
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,980
 Her grandfather's generation
crossed the sea to the south. 

314
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:46,040
 Their ancestral home was demolished long ago. 

315
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,600
 A community center was built on the original site. 

316
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,820
 I took some photos. 

317
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,940
 I'm sending them to you first. 

318
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,820
 We'll keep digging for more. 

319
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:04,310
 

320
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,720
Boss, she woke up.

321
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,520
Did you sleep well?

322
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,700
How did my master die?

323
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:30,440
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine.

324
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,200
Nine stab wounds in total.

325
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,940
I killed her.

326
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,580
Show yourself.

327
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,701
I heard you have some kind of mental issue.

328
00:27:18,701 --> 00:27:22,120
Like you always cry
when you're upset like a willful girl.

329
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:26,100
Then your Madam Hong has to babysit you.

330
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,113
Are you going to cry now?

331
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,440
Depends on my mood.

332
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,160
Looking at your face kills the mood.

333
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,180
What are you looking at?

334
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:54,540
Memorizing your face.

335
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:57,080
If I live, I won't let you go.

336
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,720
If I die, I'll haunt you as a ghost.

337
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,820
What a sharp tone.

338
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:12,220
Your master was a real fighter.

339
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:15,160
Quite admirable actually.

340
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:19,300
I've never seen anyone like her.

341
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:24,820
Most people can't handle it
to take my hits that much.

342
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:29,260
So what do you want now?

343
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:37,700
Luo has been annoyingly screwing up my business and my money too.

344
00:28:40,334 --> 00:28:42,775
I'd love to work with him.

345
00:28:42,775 --> 00:28:44,980
He makes money doing security work.

346
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:48,300
So helping me out is just another job.

347
00:28:48,949 --> 00:28:52,984
At the end of the day,
he completely let me down.

348
00:28:52,984 --> 00:28:56,404
He made me become what I look like right now.

349
00:28:57,581 --> 00:29:00,221
So you're going to kill him?

350
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,220
Just kill him?

351
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,641
You're so naive.

352
00:29:16,641 --> 00:29:20,022
It will only take a stab or a bullet,
and then he will be free.

353
00:29:20,022 --> 00:29:21,947
But what about me?

354
00:29:21,947 --> 00:29:24,246
Living like this for the future?

355
00:29:24,246 --> 00:29:26,090
Who the hell do I turn to?

356
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,500
Do you know why I'm called Leopard?

357
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,300
No. Don't care.

358
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,780
Not interested.

359
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:40,120
My dream is to have a cheetah as my pet.

360
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,680
You know every cheetah trainer said that thing.

361
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:47,100
That it can't be tamed as a pet.

362
00:29:47,739 --> 00:29:49,300
I don't believe it.

363
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,920
And then.

364
00:29:51,877 --> 00:29:54,492
Here, have a look.

365
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:56,412
This...

366
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:07,261
This is exactly how she repaid me.

367
00:30:07,261 --> 00:30:08,360
But it's fine.

368
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,680
I pulled out her claws, teeth, cut her tongue

369
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:14,960
and had a vet operate on it to reshape the bones in her mouth.

370
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,800
You asked me what I want to do with Luo Ren.

371
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,321
I don't want him dead at all.

372
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:24,382
I just want to pull out his claws and teeth

373
00:30:24,382 --> 00:30:28,322
and make him my favorite pet dog.

374
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,680
He won't.

375
00:30:35,517 --> 00:30:37,477
Really?

376
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:41,371
Now you don't know me well enough.

377
00:30:41,371 --> 00:30:45,556
The only reason he's still breathing is because I let him.

378
00:30:45,556 --> 00:30:48,480
He has no idea

379
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,580
what cards I'm holding in my hand.

380
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:19,560
Master, please have some tea.

381
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,920
Hello?

382
00:33:29,665 --> 00:33:31,224
I've arrived in Lixi.

383
00:33:31,224 --> 00:33:34,249
 Based on what I know about Leopard, she'll come for me soon. 

384
00:33:34,249 --> 00:33:36,146
 We'll stay put and react accordingly. 

385
00:33:36,146 --> 00:33:39,171
I think I'm better off in the shadows.

386
00:33:39,171 --> 00:33:41,620
We'll coordinate, one in the open
and one in hiding.

387
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:45,093
Alright. We'll keep in touch when there's news.

388
00:33:45,093 --> 00:33:46,773
Any updates?

389
00:33:48,101 --> 00:33:50,041
Not ideal.

390
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,180
I need to ask you a favor.

391
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:01,154
Leopard may act in the next couple of days.

392
00:34:01,154 --> 00:34:04,375
I want you to take charge. I'll follow your lead.

393
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,710
Why?

394
00:34:11,653 --> 00:34:14,000
Mu Dai is in their hands.

395
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,980
I'm worried I won't be able to stay level-headed.

396
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,680
Luo.

397
00:34:23,609 --> 00:34:26,463
Has Leopard beaten the fight out of you?

398
00:34:26,463 --> 00:34:32,064
There's Tasha, nine other mates, and now your girlfriend.

399
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:34,933
You've lost to Leopard too many times.

400
00:34:34,933 --> 00:34:37,093
You just refuse to admit it.

401
00:34:39,241 --> 00:34:40,901
You're scared.

402
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,240
Fine.

403
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,280
I'll agree.

404
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,521
But there's something you should know.

405
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:54,101
My revenge mission to Heisha is for my mates.

406
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,200
In my plan,

407
00:35:01,038 --> 00:35:03,418
as long as Leopard dies,

408
00:35:04,467 --> 00:35:06,767
your girlfriend can be sacrificed.

409
00:35:08,168 --> 00:35:09,868
What did you say?

410
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,740
What?

411
00:35:16,357 --> 00:35:17,798
Got a problem with that?

412
00:35:17,798 --> 00:35:20,129
She's your woman.

413
00:35:20,129 --> 00:35:21,480
It's got nothing to do with me.

414
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,200
Save her yourself.

415
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:30,325
Fine. I'll do it myself.

416
00:35:59,421 --> 00:36:02,189
So you're the seventh one?

417
00:36:02,189 --> 00:36:08,445
They say the seven relics of ill omen unite as one, and the last one is the leader.

418
00:36:08,445 --> 00:36:12,345
What makes the seventh one so special?

419
00:36:13,234 --> 00:36:15,334
Enough questions.

420
00:36:15,934 --> 00:36:18,334
Just do as I say.

421
00:36:22,475 --> 00:36:24,707
Do as you say?

422
00:36:24,707 --> 00:36:26,822
Interesting.

423
00:36:26,822 --> 00:36:33,717
My whole life has been about
others following my orders.

424
00:36:33,717 --> 00:36:37,080
The only ones who've ever given me orders

425
00:36:37,681 --> 00:36:40,121
are dead.

426
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:49,920
Free, I heard you were almost caught.

427
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,920
I'm sorry for dragging you into this
without your consent.

428
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:57,590
You don't hate me, do you?

429
00:37:00,574 --> 00:37:03,854
Sometimes, I even hate myself.

430
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:10,040
There are so much I can't help with at all.

431
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:22,300
I called Mu Dai last night, but she didn't answer.

432
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:25,020
No idea how her master is doing.

433
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:28,160
I guess she's busy helping her master.

434
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,851
After all, she's her last disciple.

435
00:37:30,851 --> 00:37:31,900
Right.

436
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:36,300
Let her stay there for a few more days, and fulfill her filial duty, right?

437
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,321
Cao, aren't you hungry?

438
00:37:45,321 --> 00:37:47,021
Come and eat.

439
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:59,140
 
 Still no leads on Mu Dai. 

440
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,020
 

441
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:08,166
 Leopard's ancestor committed
a major crime in Xiacheng Town. 

442
00:38:08,166 --> 00:38:09,531
 Later, on a snowy day,  
  

443
00:38:09,531 --> 00:38:11,900
 he was captured by five martial artists of the Plum Blossom Sect. 

444
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,420
 So it's called the "Snow Plum Case".   
  

445
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,336
Truly shocking.

446
00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:20,418
Five martial artists from Xiacheng Town?

447
00:38:20,418 --> 00:38:21,739
Also five people?

448
00:38:21,739 --> 00:38:25,722
 Exactly. There are also five
kneeling figurines in the cave of Cao Village. 

449
00:38:25,722 --> 00:38:27,575
 The two events happened around the same time. 

450
00:38:27,575 --> 00:38:30,180
 I have a strong hunch those five
from Plum Blossom Sect 

451
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,860
 were the five kneeling figurines. 

452
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,960
 Leopard's ancestor was truly wicked. 

453
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,900
 He might've even been a follower
of the Star Lord. 

454
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:39,700
 Or, going deeper, he might even be the Star Lord himself. 

455
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,040
Focus on your supplies and get back soon.

456
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,660
You've really confused me.

457
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:46,680
Perhaps back then, there were people like us,

458
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:51,300
chasing the relics of ill omen from one place to another.

459
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:55,580
Then did they succeed?

460
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:59,000
What kind of question is that? If they had,
we wouldn't be dealing with this now.

461
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,540
Not necessarily.

462
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,860
Maybe they did succeed.

463
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:06,420
But for some reason, the relics of ill omen reemerged later.

464
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:10,026
Even if they failed, they must have gotten further than we have.

465
00:39:10,026 --> 00:39:13,780
At the very least,
they secured the sixth relic of ill omen.

466
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,195
- Hello? 
 -  Luo, don't hang up. 

467
00:39:21,195 --> 00:39:22,600
 Act normal. 

468
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:26,540
 Walk out of the bar, call me, and don't let anyone notice anything. 

469
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,860
 Don't even try to wink or signal. 

470
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,640
 I'm watching you right now. 

471
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:36,180
 If you do anything stupid, I'll give a stab to your little angel in return. 

472
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,680
- I'm going to pick up a package. 
 - And...

473
00:39:41,985 --> 00:39:44,105
Don't wait for me to have dinner.

474
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,819
Speak.

475
00:39:51,819 --> 00:39:54,980
 Luo, it's time to meet. 

476
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:58,452
 I prepared a gift for you. 

477
00:39:58,452 --> 00:39:59,813
Where's Mu Dai?

478
00:39:59,813 --> 00:40:03,232
I mean, all I want is to see you.

479
00:40:03,232 --> 00:40:06,352
That's not too much to ask, is it?

480
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,760
 

481
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:18,848
 Long time no see, Luo. 

482
00:40:18,848 --> 00:40:24,389
 I asked your girl if there was a memorable spot for you two around here. 

483
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:29,120
 And here we are. 

484
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,439
Mu Dai.

485
00:40:30,439 --> 00:40:31,600
-  Look around. 
- Mu Dai!

486
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,272
 I just gave you the hint. 

487
00:40:33,272 --> 00:40:35,600
Must be easy for you, huh?

488
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,420
 Hurry up. 

489
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,000
 
Leopard.

490
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,620
It's there.

491
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:23,530



492
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:27,520
song title

493
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:32,060
 ♫ The sky splits the dawn's horizon ♫ 

494
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:36,440
 ♫ Telling me the end ♫ 

495
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:40,697
 ♫ Is about to gently appear ♫ 

496
00:41:40,697 --> 00:41:47,340
♫  Like a whisper in my mind,  ♫ ♫  a fleeting touch across my face  ♫

497
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:52,780
 ♫ And I remain in darkness ♫ 

498
00:41:53,694 --> 00:41:59,200
 ♫ Every hand has two sides ♫ 

499
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,040
 ♫ One offers blessings ♫

00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:05,313
 ♫ One waits in silence ♫ 

501
00:42:05,313 --> 00:42:10,560
 ♫ This game has no ending ♫ 

502
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:17,020
 ♫ Following the traces left behind ♫ 

503
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:19,540
 ♫ If you were me ♫ 

504
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:26,900
 ♫ You'd understand every tear of mine ♫ 

505
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:28,780
 ♫ The reason they fall ♫ 

506
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:31,382
 ♫ If I were you ♫ 

507
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:38,440
 ♫ I'd feel each breath you take ♫ 

508
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,760
 ♫ Then we'd move forward ♫ 

509
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:45,280
 ♫ The sky splits the dawn's horizon ♫ 

510
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:49,580
 ♫ Telling me the end ♫ 

511
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:53,940
 ♫ Is about to gently appear ♫ 

512
00:42:53,940 --> 00:43:00,840
♫  Like a whisper in my mind,  ♫ ♫  a fleeting touch across my face  ♫

513
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,961
 ♫ And I remain in darkness ♫ 

514
00:43:03,961 --> 00:43:08,480
 ♫ The sky splits the dawn's horizon ♫ 

515
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,760
 ♫ Telling me the end ♫ 

516
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:17,180
 ♫ Is about to gently appear ♫ 

517
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:24,220
♫  Like a whisper in my mind,  ♫ ♫  a fleeting touch across my face  ♫

518
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:30,320
 ♫ And I remain in darkness ♫ 

519
00:43:39,047 --> 00:43:43,620
 ♫ The sky splits the dawn's horizon ♫ 

520
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:47,820
 ♫ Telling me the end ♫ 

521
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:52,240
 ♫ Is about to gently appear ♫ 

522
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:59,380
♫  Like a whisper in my mind,  ♫ ♫  a fleeting touch across my face  ♫

523
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:04,180
 ♫ And I remain in darkness ♫
