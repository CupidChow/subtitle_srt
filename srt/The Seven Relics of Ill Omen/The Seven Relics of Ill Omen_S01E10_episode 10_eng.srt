1
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,440
   

2
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:24,940



3
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,460
   

4
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,000
   

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
   

6
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,600
   

7
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,460
As it turns out, visions are meaningful.

8
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:25,320
You should be asking for his forgiveness, not mine.

9
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,860
But why would they give us hints?

10
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,020
True.

11
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,180
That didn't help them.

12
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,560
The clue led to the capture of the second Relic of Ill Omen.

13
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,580
Well... Everything in this world is interconnected.

14
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:41,180
I suspect the relics of ill omen might be connected too.

15
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,380
So far, we've deciphered two ancient characters.

16
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,740
One is "blade."

17
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,460
The other is "water."

18
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,020
The characters on the relics of ill omen

19
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,500
seem to show how they cause harm.

20
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,700
Water can't contain them at all.

21
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,920
Is there anything in this world that can actually trap them?

22
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,440
Um... cement?

23
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,961
Blood. My blood.

24
00:02:01,961 --> 00:02:05,781
I was... Yes, and Luo Ren.

25
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,180
Seems my blood worked too.

26
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,460
Yes.

27
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,540
Let's give it a try.

28
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,660
Radishie's goes first.

29
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,820
Here we go.

30
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,260
There it is!

31
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,420
Good.

32
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,300
The second one is from Thirteen.

33
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:02,060
Mine? I'm sure it'll work.

34
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,900
Congrats, your blood is useful.

35
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,500
The third one is from Chubby.

36
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,860
Come on.

37
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,560
It's not working.

38
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,323
Master Shen, I can try again tomorrow morning on an empty stomach.

39
00:03:33,323 --> 00:03:34,340
My blood might be too thick.

40
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,100
Brother Cao, do you have high cholesterol?

41
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,860
Get lost.

42
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,700
Hey, it's working now.

43
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,892
And our newcomer...

44
00:03:50,892 --> 00:03:52,980
Yan Hong Sha.

45
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,860
Oh, "Yan." That's two fires.

46
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,260
Firey's blood.

47
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,680
Why does this image look so familiar?

48
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,460
It's three chickens fighting a dog.

49
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,700
Am I right?

50
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,540
I'm frightened by your ignorance.

51
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,100
Those are three birds.

52
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,680
The one with a crest and three tails is Feng, a male phoenix.

53
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,140
The one with two tails and no crest is Huang, a female phoenix.

54
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,580
The remaining one is Luan.

55
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,020
It's recorded in ancient books

56
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,940
that "Colored in five hues, it represents the herald of dawn."

57
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,940
"The dawn announcer... is the rooster."

58
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,140
Isn't that still a chicken?

59
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,100
It looks like one, but it's not.

60
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,820
This is almost complete.

61
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,540
Is my blood still needed?

62
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,180
It's been drawn. Might as well try.

63
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,180
Pocketty's blood.

64
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,420
Hey, think about it.

65
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,500
We always thought the shadow of water

66
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,400
was three chickens standing on a wooden rack.

67
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,440
But maybe that's not the case.

68
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,920
The wooden rack might actually be the relic of ill omen.

69
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:22,080
And the three chickens are the Feng, Huang, and Luan Master Shen mentioned.

70
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,560
It's the shadow of water.

71
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,820
Why is it on fire?

72
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,820
Why a dog again?

73
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,060
The first shadow of water also had a dog.

74
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,860
Does the dog have some special meaning?

75
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,860
Her clothes look like they are from over a century ago.

76
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,940
And this place here.

77
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,380
This architectural style is also from over a hundred years ago.

78
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:59,860
The two shadows of water seem to be telling a story from long ago.

79
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,200
But it probably has nothing to do with us now.

80
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,860
Mu Kun, Ping Ting.

81
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,480
Based on the experiment,

82
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,180
any of you with a matching blood type with Ping Ting should do.

83
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,940
Then, we'll transfuse your blood into her body.

84
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:19,980
That should force the relic of ill omen to come out.

85
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,380
Ping Ting.

86
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,460
Ping Ting.

87
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,400
Ping Ting.

88
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,460
Ping Ting! Ping Ting!

89
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,160
Ping Ting!

90
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,860
Ping Ting.

91
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,940
I'll see you.

92
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,900
Oh, right, Mu Dai, get yourself a new phone.

93
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,200
We'll set up a group chat.

94
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,440
I came up with the group name.

95
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,820
"Phoenix Squad."

96
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,460
Isn't it good?

97
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,160
Let's go.

98
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,220
How can this rich girl pick such a tacky name?

99
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,840
Really doesn't live up to her money.

100
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,480
- See you, Uncle Zhang. 
 - Uncle Zhang, see you next time.

101
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,620
See you.

102
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,660
Bye-bye.

103
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,900
Uncle Zhang, I didn't mean to do it.

104
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,100
All right. Get right back to work.

105
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,140
Uncle Zhang, I was right to go, wasn't I?

106
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,700
You're back.

107
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,100
Uncle Zhang, I'm a little tired.

108
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,720
I'll go upstairs for a quick rest and come back down to help.

109
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,140
   

110
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:25,680
I didn't expect you two to run into each other even in Hepu.

111
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,660
Yes.

112
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,140
Is it just me overthinking things?

113
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:33,880
Mu Dai didn't seem very spirited after she came back.

114
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,900
Uncle Zhang.

115
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:46,940
Did Mu Dai often suddenly forget things?

116
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:53,540
Like she does something and then forgets it just like that?

117
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,620
 Back when we fought the clam, I kept calling for you. 

118
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,280
 Why didn't you respond? 

119
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,860
 Did you? 

120
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,460
 I did. 

121
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:05,020
 You seemed like a completely different person. 

122
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:08,520
 No... I wasn't. 

123
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,980
Possible.

124
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,660
Once she drinks too much,

125
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,260
she gets crazy and starts acting wild.

126
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:19,660
- Wait... 
 - But when she sobers up, she forgets everything.

127
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,860
So, better not let her drink too much.

128
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,580
Or you'll see her make a fool of herself.

129
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:25,240
 Mom, wait for me, don't go. 

130
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,400
 Mom! 

131
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,380
   

132
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,700
 Back when we fought the clam, I kept calling for you. 

133
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,240
 Why didn't you respond? 

134
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,820
 Did you? 

135
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,340
 I did. 

136
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:18,100
   

137
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,760
 Debts must be paid. That's only right. 

138
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,660
 No need for the reminder. 

139
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,120
 You said the same thing last time. 

140
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,200
You said your son would come back with the money.

141
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,000
Guess what?

142
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,240
He came back lying in an urn.

143
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,560
We sympathized with your grief and didn't ask for money at the funeral.

144
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,340
But you can't just take advantage of our kindness.

145
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,046
I've got property.

146
00:11:50,046 --> 00:11:52,120
I know you do. 
    

147
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,320
That's why I've been so polite to you.

148
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,020
But your son gambled big and ran up massive debt.

149
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,880
The property won't cover it.

150
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,940
It won't.

151
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,020
But have you not thought

152
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:10,760
the Yan family may have some valuable stones tucked away?

153
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,760
Great. That's what I wanted to hear.

154
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,920
If you're ready to hand them over, this will be much easier.

155
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,280
I will clear the debts within two months.

156
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,520
But you didn't keep the promises you made before.

157
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,660
I really don't have much faith left.

158
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:32,200
By the rules, I'll be taking this with me.

159
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,700
Let's go.

160
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,440
Lengquan?

161
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,720
Why does this place look so familiar?

162
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,540
- "Look" familiar? 
 - When the relic of ill omen possessed Ping Ting,

163
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,680
she was humming folk tunes from Lengquan.

164
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,060
It does look familiar. To my ear.

165
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,780
All right, whatever you say.

166
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,760
The earliest stories I recorded about the relics of ill omen

167
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,080
were collected around Lengquan.

168
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,280
In studying the relics of ill omen, Lengquan is an unavoidable stop.

169
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,880
So lately, I've gone through the local materials again.

170
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,500
These are the murals from Lengquan.

171
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,420
Take a closer look. Look carefully.

172
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,560
This style of painting somehow

173
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,060
resembles the Feng, Huang, and Luan from the shadows of water, right?

174
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,400
Am I right?

175
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,640
If you insist on saying that, I... I'll go with it.

176
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,820
Yes.

177
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,460
Since everyone thinks so, practice will lead us to real understanding.

178
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,361
I think it's time we took a trip to Lengquan.

179
00:13:30,361 --> 00:13:33,440
Wait, who agreed?

180
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,280
- Why are we suddenly going? 
 - I haven't... finished yet.

181
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,200
Are you okay?

182
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,660
Here's a reminder.

183
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,020
Be extra careful during this time.

184
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:46,080
Whenever possible, stay in a group.

185
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,600
What do you mean?

186
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,100
Be careful.

187
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,960
Who knows how many more relics of ill omen there are?

188
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,900
You can keep that.

189
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,400
What?

190
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,160
Oh, right.

191
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,960
During this time, hold your hands, okay?

192
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,080
Spooky.

193
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,080
Scares me.

194
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,820
How is this, Mu Dai?

195
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,400
Have you been watching me?

196
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,500
You came to my house this time not just to pick up your paycheck, right?

197
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,300
Was it about your split personality thing?

198
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,060
I'm telling you, I think you're just overthinking it.

199
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,760
There's no such thing as a split personality.

200
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,820
You were just overly frightened and then forgot things.

201
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,540
So, I'm that fragile, huh?

202
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:49,380
All of you were fine. I'm the only one who forgets things.

203
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:53,300
Even if you have a split personality, there's nothing to worry about.

204
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,500
She didn't hurt you and even helped you out of danger.

205
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,900
Isn't that a good thing?

206
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,780
Is it?

207
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:04,420
Looking back, I’m glad I didn’t end up with Luo Ren.

208
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,780
If he found out, I can't imagine what would happen.

209
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,580
Ping Ting.

210
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,600
Luo Ren.

211
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,120
I think there's still something wrong with her.

212
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:30,060
She's much better.

213
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,600
Yes, indeed.

214
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,860
She doesn't eat people anymore.

215
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,580
Brother Luo, where were we?

216
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,760
You and Uncle Zheng are opening a restaurant?

217
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,720
Keep it down.

218
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,860
People are watching.

219
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,060
Yes.

220
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,840
Good.

221
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,300
This is good.

222
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,160
And how is that good?

223
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,700
Are you open to investment?

224
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,700
I'd like to buy in.

225
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,900
I'll think about it.

226
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,400
Great.

227
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,160
Trying to get a share for nothing, huh?

228
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,880
Come on. Am I that kind of person?

229
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,040
I may have no money, but I've got pearls.

230
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,920
 A pearl? 

231
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,820
 I didn't notice it, but there are quite a few in here. 

232
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,260
 Of course. Did you see how big that clam was? 

233
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,500
 There have to be pearls. 

234
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,520
 I'll have someone collect them. We can each have one. 

235
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,700
 There'll be enough for everyone. 

236
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,940
- We'll all have pearls. For real. 
 - Pearls?

237
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,320
We can all be shareholders.

238
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,320
Brother Luo, I should be grateful to be working here.

239
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,880
But every day, people just call me by "Excuse me." And I'm like, "Yes?"

240
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,160
It's nothing to look forward to.

241
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,480
If I become a shareholder, they'll call me "Chairman." And I'll be like, "Yes?"

242
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,040
Just imagine that.

243
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,032
- Excuse me. 
 - Fair.

244
00:16:48,032 --> 00:16:49,640
Yes?

245
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,100
Yes?

246
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,540
Don't you think Chubby is inspiring?

247
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,860
Inspiring?

248
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,600
Him?

249
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,400
His pockets are cleaner than his face.

250
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,380
How much could those pearls even be worth?

251
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,740
And he wants a share?

252
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,780
You call that inspiring?

253
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,740
That's daydreaming.

254
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,740
Right, call it daydreaming.

255
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,740
At least he dares to.

256
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:41,080
I used to think his dreams were just talk.

257
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,240
I didn't expect him to actually stick with them.

258
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,840
You see, he said he'd stop being a bum, and he did.

259
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,000
He said he'd learn martial arts, and he found a master.

260
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,320
He said he'd make money, and now he's working all over.

261
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,960
Don't you find that admirable?

262
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,740
Yes.

263
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,620
I know the past is like a quagmire.

264
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,380
It drags you down.

265
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,560
But I think if you keep moving ahead,

266
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,480
things will change.

267
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,020
Fine. Since you've got time to lecture me on life advice,

268
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,020
why not worry about your own stuff?

269
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,545
What stuff?

270
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:34,860
You think I didn't notice?

271
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:40,900
Since the fight with the clam, you and Boss Lady Dai have been acting weird, haven't you?

272
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,180
Here, Ping Ting.

273
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,440
This is for you.

274
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:08,200
If you offend someone, just be humble.

275
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,200
Give them a gift. Say something nice.

276
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,300
Is it that hard?

277
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,220
Try harder.

278
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,520
I'm about to go check out the storefront.

279
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,260
If it works, I'll have Uncle Zheng follow up with you.

280
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,620
Okay.

281
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,700
 If you offend someone, just be humble. 

282
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,740
 Give them a gift. Say something nice. 

283
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,000
   

284
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,740
Hello, Sir.

285
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,960
Looking for something?

286
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,720
A gift or for yourself?

287
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,680
Just browsing.

288
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,140
All items here are unique, one-of-a-kind singles.

289
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,240
My shop is called Lianyan,

290
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,720
meaning it collects all the beautiful things of women.

291
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,260
Let me show you something special.

292
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,680
This is the Garment of Amorousness.

293
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,200
It's embroidered with a man and woman,

294
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,740
symbolizing togetherness and happiness.

295
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,960
Why do they not have faces? It's a bit creepy.

296
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,200
Because in ancient times, unmarried women made this for themselves.

297
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,220
They didn't know what their future husbands would look like,

298
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,360
so they left their face empty.

299
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,340
After marriage, they'd add the facial features once they saw their husband.

300
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:15,680
You can buy this for your girlfriend and have her embroider your face on it.

301
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:19,680
But never mind if you're single.

302
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,680
I'll pass. The symbolism isn't great.

303
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,440
Like a blind marriage where you don't even know their face.

304
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,260
It's kind of miserable.

305
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,760
You like this?

306
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,880
Not really.

307
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,480
Would you be interested

308
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,760
in seeing my shop's most treasured item?

309
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,460
Most treasured?

310
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,380
Lian Shu.

311
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,800
Luo Ren.

312
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,040
It surely is treasured.

313
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,460
The price is steep.

314
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,960
This pair is called the forbidden shoes.

315
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,520
Do you know why they have bells?

316
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,200
For the sound?

317
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,760
No.

318
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:49,840
The bells are there to remind women to walk with grace.

319
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,440
Only if she walks stably enough that the bells don't make a sound,

320
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,140
can she truly be considered graceful.

321
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:05,380
This pair is Lotus Blooms with Every Step.

322
00:23:06,996 --> 00:23:10,280
As you walk, power falls with each step.

323
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:15,200
The lotus design then leaves a clear print on the ground.

324
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,660
Each step blooms a lotus.

325
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,580
188,000 for the two pairs?

326
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,100
No, that's for one pair.

327
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,740
But even if someone's willing to pay, I might not sell.

328
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,880
I'm waiting for a fated buyer.

329
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,300
A fated pervert, you mean?

330
00:23:49,633 --> 00:23:51,933
Or a fated...

331
00:23:52,944 --> 00:23:54,964
object-fetishist.

332
00:23:55,816 --> 00:23:59,136
Folk culture researchers don't count, of course.

333
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:05,240
Miss Lian, you're a woman, and yet you praise this stuff?

334
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:09,360
Aren't these shackles for ancient women?

335
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,680
And you put them on display like treasure?

336
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:16,580
Things like this should stay buried in a coffin.

337
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:22,860
Mr. Luo, it seems you lack even the most basic courtesy and respect.

338
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:26,240
Yes. I could tell you'd wanted me gone.

339
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,080
I'll see myself out.

340
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,280
   

341
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:52,100
 Luo Ren, emergency. Come back now.  
    

342
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,960
We've weathered storms, haven't we?

343
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,500
This little challenge won't stop us.

344
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,260
A small restaurant business is just a piece of cake.

345
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:06,200
As long as we work hard together and give it our all,

346
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,060
we'll be at the top of the field.

347
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,720
- Sure. 
 - It's our own business.

348
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,180
- Let's do our best. 
 - I'm supporting your dream, Brother Cao.

349
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:17,360
- Come on. It's our dream. 
 - Sure.

350
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,260
The second important topic...

351
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,800
Get a seat. It's the shareholders' meeting.

352
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,920
"Emergency"?

353
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,780
We're in urgent need of money.

354
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:29,520
Time is money. Come on.

355
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,440
The second on the list.

356
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,980
Let's come up with a name.

357
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:37,000
Well, here's my humble opinion.

358
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,485
Shoot.

359
00:25:38,485 --> 00:25:40,180
Dancing Phoenix.

360
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,760
Oh, my. What a tacky name.

361
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,160
Even my grandpa wouldn't use a name like that. Seriously.

362
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,020
I actually think it's a good name.

363
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,520
Right, Brother Cao?

364
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,780
Backing me up for once, huh?

365
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:56,080
How about "Phoenix Pavilion"?

366
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,600
We're the Phoenix Squad, after all.

367
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,560
Sounds good to me. I like it.

368
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,280
I'll go with my master's choice.

369
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,500
I'll follow Boss Lady Dai.

370
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,240
Okay. Phoenix Pavilion sounds good.

371
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,820
Okay. We've got the name.

372
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:18,000
Here's to Phoenix Pavilion's successful opening.

373
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,060
- And prosperity. 
 - A successful opening.

374
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,040
A successful opening!

375
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:26,160
And let's wish Mu Dai and me a triumphant mission.

376
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,300
You got it.

377
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,160
Bring on the meat.

378
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,880
The bowls are all here.

379
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,480
So, my part is done, right?

380
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,945
- I'll take off now. 
 - Okay.

381
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,140
Is this gig...

382
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,280
from Mr. Yan?

383
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:53,400
Yes. He paid extra this time, starting from 50 grand.

384
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,400
Oh, sorry.

385
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,160
I just finished the chore and didn't see you.

386
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,060
He's opening his private gem well.

387
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,150
Is he short on money lately?

388
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:11,160
I don't think so.

389
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,180
How could he lack money with his big family business?

390
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,320
He's an old-school treasure hunter.

391
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:27,080
The treasures he keeps to himself are only for emergencies.

392
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:31,400
If he's opening a new well, something must have happened.

393
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,200
Seems he's trying to leave things behind for Hong Sha.

394
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,080
My guess is since he's getting old, and his son suddenly died,

395
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,480
he's rushing to make arrangements for Hong Sha.

396
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,300
- What? I'm doing things here. 
 - Some chicken stuff.

397
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,300
What the heck?

398
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,720
Where is the exact location?

399
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,200
That's what I'm getting to.

400
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,640
I'm speechless with the old guy.

401
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,980
He told me it's in Nanling. And what is that?

402
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,940
It spans several provinces.

403
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:03,380
I asked him to give me some specifics, at least a location.

404
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,440
Guess what he said?

405
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,840
 I can't tell you the exact location. 

406
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,320
 It's the rule of treasure hunting. 

407
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,600
Even with Hong Sha's help, you couldn't get anything out of him.

408
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,160
In the end, he mentioned it was somewhere near Pu Zhai.

409
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,500
Ask more, and he clams up.

410
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,000
Let him be.

411
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,640
He even tried to fool you with Nanling.

412
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,960
Nanling and Pu Zhai are not even in the same region.

413
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,000
Exactly.

414
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,280
That guy is kind of a pain.

415
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,400
I think so.

416
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,660
But Hong Sha kept apologizing, saying "Sorry, Mu Dai."

417
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:38,760
"My grandpa's always like that, acting all mysterious."

418
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,160
"I can't help it either."

419
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:44,560
Well, probably he does respect the rules.

420
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,500
Don't you think?

421
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,880
Mu Dai.

422
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,020
Where's my kitty hair tie?

423
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,440
I'll go see if Hong Sha has it.

424
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,860
Hurry back after the job's done. 
    

425
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:15,560
We've got the ribbon to cut and a ton of other stuff to deal with.

426
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,500
All right. We'll open the business when I get back.

427
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,040
Thirteen, she's leaving. Say something.

428
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,920
Where's there to say between me and her?

429
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,240
Let's work well together.

430
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,260
Um... We're making money together.

431
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,960
- Stay united. 
 - Yes, yes.

432
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,500
And set your phone to auto-send your location every hour,

433
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,400
so I can keep track of where you are.

434
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,440
Here's a gift for you.

435
00:29:41,189 --> 00:29:43,730
- Take it. 
 - A gift?

436
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:48,320
You lost your dagger when saving me.

437
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,820
I've got money now, so here's a new one.

438
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,320
Thank you.

439
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,060
Luo Ren.

440
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,200
Lian Shu?

441
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,240
What?

442
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,880
Didn't expect me to say hello?

443
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,000
We got to know each other, after all.

444
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,720
These pastries are really good.

445
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,640
Try one.

446
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,180
I'm good. I ate.

447
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,700
Hello, I'm Lian Shu.

448
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,885
I own the shop called Lianyan over there.

449
00:30:23,885 --> 00:30:26,585
Hello, I'm Mu Dai.

450
00:30:26,585 --> 00:30:28,740
Luo Ren came to my shop to pick up things.

451
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,140
- We talked for quite a while. 
 - What?

452
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,340
He's got unique taste.

453
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:36,640
So, I figure his friends must be interesting people.

454
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,260
Yes, his friends...

455
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,300
Stop by my shop sometime.

456
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,300
I'll make you tea.

457
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,180
Our restaurant is opening too.

458
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,800
You're welcome to come over.

459
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,700
Sure.

460
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,820
- Okay. 
 - It's about time, huh?

461
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,660
Mu Dai.

462
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,040
Shut the door.

463
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,180
Master.

464
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,520
Thank you.

465
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,360
Take care of yourself, Chubby.

466
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,200
Goodbye.

467
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:55,420
Restaurant co-owner, future business tycoon,

468
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,860
learning martial arts like a star,

469
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:59,520
I was born to stand out.

470
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,140
Brother Cao.

471
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,480
Aw, my waist. What?

472
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,980
Did you hear the thunder?

473
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,860
Thunder?

474
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,540
No.

475
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,460
Are you imagining things?

476
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,780
 Another vision. 

477
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:19,600
 Is there a new relic of ill omen? 

478
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,420
 Thirteen-Thousand saw a vision again. 

479
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,240
 There must have been a new relic of ill omen. 

480
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,280
 Uncle Kun said not to split up. 

481
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,520
 You and Hong Sha need to look out for each other. 

482
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,000
 Heavy rain, deep mountains, and a village. 

483
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,720
 The clues are vague. 

484
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,399
 We'll probably keep seeing more visions, right? 

485
00:32:49,399 --> 00:32:50,680
Pretty much.

486
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,280
 If anything happens, let me know right away. 

487
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,381
Don't get me started.

488
00:32:54,381 --> 00:32:56,706
Hong Sha's phone got confiscated by her grandpa.

489
00:32:56,706 --> 00:32:58,187
He said it's "the rules."

490
00:32:58,187 --> 00:33:00,588
I'm not his family, so he couldn't really get my phone.

491
00:33:00,588 --> 00:33:02,269
But I can't push it too far.

492
00:33:02,269 --> 00:33:03,420
I've got my phone on silent.

493
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,440
I'm making this call in secret.

494
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,360
 Where are you now? 

495
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,500
On a mountain road.

496
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,620
Has he not told you where?

497
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,920
 He's tight-lipped. 

498
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,120
 I can't force it out of him. 

499
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,200
 I'll see how it goes. 

500
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,540
Change your auto-location setting.

501
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:21,720
Make it update every 30 minutes starting now.

502
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:25,800
   

503
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,760
Starting from where you are, it's all mountains whichever way you go.

504
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,840
Once you're in the mountains, the GPS isn't reliable.

505
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:36,040
 Listen, if you see any signposts, take a picture and send it to me. 

506
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,120
 Just in case. 

507
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,760
Okay.

508
00:33:40,613 --> 00:33:43,277
Mu Dai, keep in contact.

509
00:33:43,277 --> 00:33:45,237
Be very careful.

510
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:09,180
   

511
00:34:12,109 --> 00:34:15,049
My God, what kind of road is this?

512
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:19,360
Calm down. Drive carefully.

513
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:33,960
I talked with the landlord.

514
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,080
The rent's not an issue.

515
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:38,640
- Sorry, a second. 
 - It's spacious inside too.

516
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,540
 I think I just saw a vision.  
    

517
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,000
 Can't call right now. 

518
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:47,761
 What kind of vision was it?  
    

519
00:34:47,761 --> 00:34:50,360
 Was it the same as what Thirteen-Thousand saw? 

520
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,820
 No, I suddenly saw a shadow outside the window.  
    

521
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:55,580
 Looked like a person. 

522
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,260
 Was it a man or a woman? Ancient or modern?  
    

523
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,540
 Not entirely sure. Probably modern.  
    

524
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,396
 Can you be more specific?  
    

525
00:35:03,396 --> 00:35:04,560
 What's the person's build? 

526
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,040
 Were they standing or sitting? 

527
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,480
 Facing front or sideways? 

528
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:11,360
 The person was standing and holding something long in one hand.  
    

529
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,240
 The other arm was carrying... 

530
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,340
 Carrying what?  
    

531
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,360
 A basket.  
    

532
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,960
 You said she was holding something long.  
    

533
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,480
 Was it a broom? 

534
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,460
 Yes.  
    

535
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,620
 You like this? 

536
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,960
 Stay alert. I'll be back with an update.  
    

537
00:35:46,149 --> 00:35:49,829
Luo Ren. I thought you...

538
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,420
You want this?

539
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,420
What's the meaning behind it?

540
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,760
Meaning?

541
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,440
This is called Sunny Doll.

542
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,040
It dates back to ancient times.

543
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,840
 People used it to pray for the rain to stop and for the sky to clear. 

544
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,620
 In the north, it's called "Sky-Sweeping Doll." 

545
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,700
 Sunny Doll? 

546
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,440
 Is this what it looks like?  
    

547
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,000
 Not quite. 

548
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,481
 Some hold the broom high, others let it hang low. 

549
00:36:20,481 --> 00:36:21,864
 It's region-specific. 

550
00:36:21,864 --> 00:36:23,013
 There's no standard look. 

551
00:36:23,013 --> 00:36:26,074
So, where's yours from?

552
00:36:26,074 --> 00:36:28,694
Can't remember the exact place.

553
00:36:29,629 --> 00:36:31,410
Somewhere with lots of rain for sure.

554
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:35,107
People want to sweep away the rain deity when it rains too much.

555
00:36:35,107 --> 00:36:37,740
 Sweep away the rain deity? 

556
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,960
 Thirteen-Thousand saw heavy rain too. 

557
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:45,160
 Seems like this relic of ill omen is in a mountainous, rainy place. 

558
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,360
Why are we stopping? We haven't arrived.

559
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:59,180
Sir, there's no road ahead.

560
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,320
Brother Luo!

561
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,280
I saw a vision.

562
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,480
It's a well.

563
00:37:45,075 --> 00:37:46,120
   

564
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,820
   

565
00:38:00,584 --> 00:38:04,385
Grandpa, are you sure you remember the way?

566
00:38:04,385 --> 00:38:06,400
- Yes. 
 - But it's already dark.

567
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,657
When are we going to get there?

568
00:38:08,657 --> 00:38:10,878
Almost there.

569
00:38:10,878 --> 00:38:12,560
Just follow me.

570
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,400
Mountains, rain, a village, and a well.

571
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,061
None of this helps.

572
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:19,060
What village doesn't have a well?

573
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:22,280
You tell me. The doll was creepy though.

574
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,820
Oh, my.

575
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,560
You've got guts.

576
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,740
A doll?

577
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,140
- No, wait. 
 - Isn't it a doll?

578
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:32,740
You call the corpse a doll?

579
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,960
A corpse?

580
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,560
Yes.

581
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,040
Wait, no.

582
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,440
Cao Yan Hua.

583
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,220
We're not seeing the same well.

584
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,140
What was yours like?

585
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:46,640
In a forest, a clearing in the middle, there's a well.

586
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,720
Real spooky.

587
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:50,660
Filled with stones and a corpse.

588
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:51,860
Stones?

589
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,340
Yes.

590
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:56,180
 He's an old-school treasure hunter. 

591
00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:01,560
 If he's opening a new well, something must have happened. 

592
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,540
A gemstone well?

593
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,861
- Hey, Luo Ren. 
 - You're in danger over there.

594
00:39:20,861 --> 00:39:21,920
Don't go into that gem well.

595
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,460
There's a relic of ill omen.

596
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,620
What did you say?

597
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,767
Your signal's bad.

598
00:39:25,767 --> 00:39:27,740
Mu Dai, wait for me.

599
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,680
We'll be right there.

600
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,101
Right what?

601
00:39:31,101 --> 00:39:32,282
Slow down, Grandpa.

602
00:39:32,282 --> 00:39:34,662
It's a rough road.

603
00:39:46,311 --> 00:39:48,900
Grandpa!

604
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,040
What?

605
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,540
Pack up, hurry!

606
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:03,200
- Pack up. 
 - Pack up.

607
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,905
You're a paid bodyguard.

608
00:40:13,905 --> 00:40:16,120
Do your job.

609
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,925
If that had been a wild beast, I would have died by now.

610
00:40:19,925 --> 00:40:21,725
Grandpa.

611
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,760
Let's go.

612
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:40,421
Mu Dai, please don't take it personally.

613
00:40:40,421 --> 00:40:42,386
That's what my grandpa is, a grumpy old man.

614
00:40:42,386 --> 00:40:44,460
He doesn't really mean that.

615
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,880
It's okay. I didn't do my job well.

616
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,580
Let's go.

617
00:40:50,080 --> 00:41:00,000



618
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,680
What is it, Grandpa?

619
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,720
I hear something.

620
00:41:18,638 --> 00:41:20,218
Is that...

621
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,020
Is that a will-o'-the-wisp?

622
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,993
Don't talk nonsense.

623
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,660
Chubby, we just got back, and now we're leaving again.

624
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,400
What should we tell Uncle Zhang?

625
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,380
If he finds out, he will chop us up.

626
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:39,960
He won't actually kill you,

627
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,640
but if my master and Hong Sha run into a relic of ill omen,

628
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,620
they could die. We'll take his yelling.

629
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:45,780
Hurry up.

630
00:41:46,975 --> 00:41:51,100
   

631
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:55,350
   

632
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:08,300

00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:24,160
♫  The sky splits the dawn's horizon  ♫

660
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:28,480
♫  It's telling me the end  ♫

661
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,850
♫  (The end) Is about to gently appear  ♫

662
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:39,920
♫  Like a whisper in my mind, a fleeting touch across my face  ♫

663
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:44,810
♫  Yet I find myself in the dark  ♫
