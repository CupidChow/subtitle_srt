00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,060
Senior Master.

6
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,380
Why are you shouting?

7
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,860
Have you found anything?

8
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,380
Looks like they got in
by climbing over the wall.

9
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,740
See, I told you.

10
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,900
You'd be back within half an hour.

11
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,340
- Senior Master.
- It's getting late.

12
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,420
Let's all get some rest early.

13
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,660
Senior Master.

14
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:51,900
What is it?

15
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:53,940
Do you think

16
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,740
he's skilled in martial arts?

17
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,420
He's got some talent.

18
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,300
Let me put it this way.

19
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,340
On this entire journey,

20
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,980
I haven't seen anyone
more skilled than him.

21
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,100
And I've never seen Luo

22
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,820
this anxious before.

23
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,580
Think about it,

24
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,980
any opponent who could lose control

25
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,020
must be formidable.

26
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,540
We should take this seriously.

27
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,860
Do you know about Heisha?

28
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,580
Heisha?

29
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,420
I've been there before,

30
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,260
made some friends,

31
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,020
and I've also got some stories.

32
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,900
I'll tell you about them
some other time.

33
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,940
What about Leopard?

34
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,220
Leopard?

35
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,380
That name doesn't ring a bell.

36
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,540
Sounds like

37
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,500
an up-and-comer.

38
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,220
It's not that I won't help you.

39
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,900
Circumstances won't allow it.

40
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,780
At sunrise tomorrow,
when the fog clears,

41
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,500
I'll take you into the mountains.

42
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,420
One more thing.

43
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,740
No one

44
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,940
enters my master's room.

45
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,580
Otherwise, get out of here.

46
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,460
Now get some rest.

47
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,820
What kind of mess is this?

48
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,260
Have you no shame?

49
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,540
Don't you dare run!

50
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,380
Oh no.

51
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,540
Mr. Zhang said

52
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,940
if Free clucks again tonight,

53
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,100
he'll slaughter it.

54
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,740
Outrageous.

55
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,700
- What kind of person does this?
- Free.

56
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,300
Free?

57
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,500
Snaring cats and dogs is bad enough,
but now chickens?

58
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:49,740
What's wrong, Mr. Zhang?

59
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,340
So ill-mannered. Don't you dare run!

60
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,540
Who was it?

61
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:53,980
Look at this.

62
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:54,940
Rice?

63
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,380
Why does it smell like alcohol?

64
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,660
Drunken rice.

65
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,220
Country folk use it
to trap birds and chickens.

66
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,260
That chicken you brought here

67
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,940
isn't even rare.

68
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,700
Why are so many people after it?

69
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,380
Free.

70
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,740
Are you okay, Free?

71
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,380
You poor little thing.

72
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,540
Mr. Zhang,

73
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,340
stop scaring Free.

74
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,820
Look, what a good chicken it is.

75
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,700
Won't even take handouts. Right?

76
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,380
Good chicken.

77
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,660
When I see Chubby,

78
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,220
I'll make sure to praise you.

79
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,940
You're such a poor little thing.

80
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,100

81
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,980
Senior Master!

82
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,620
What is this all about?

83
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,100
You couldn't find her,

84
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,100
and now you've lost me too.

85
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,340
What's the use of running so fast?

86
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,620
In the end, I found her.

87
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,060
Grandmaster!

88
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,740

89

93
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:13,980
Where's Mu Dai?

94
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:16,860
Mu Dai!

95
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,660
Master!

96
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,580
Mu Dai!

97

103

Where's Mu Dai?

104
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,500
So you don't wanna catch up
with your old friend,

105
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,820
just worried
about your little sweetheart?

106
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,060
I'm asking you, where is Mu Dai?

107
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,180
She's fine.

108
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,900
Just crying and cursing.

109
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,580
But don't worry. I have a good temper.

110
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,100
I won't kill her with a single blow.

111
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,980
That would be no fun, right?

112
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,780
You killed Master, didn't you?

113
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,020
Oh? That old lady looking for death?

114
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,780
Well, she's so old

115
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,380
and she doesn't have
much time left anyway.

116
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,900
What do you want?

117
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,980
What do I want?

118
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,140
Have you ever heard the saying?

119
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,800
A beautiful woman dies twice.

120
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,800
One is when her beauty fades.

121
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,020
And the other is when her life
comes to an end.

122
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,140
Luo,

123
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,700
you took one of my eyes.

124
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,860
You've already killed me once.

125
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,300
Where is she?

126
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,420
I have no idea.

127
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,740

from your little angel's bar.

131
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,740
You do make a lot of

132
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,260
boring and weird friends.

133
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,580
Why do they have a chicken?

134
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,900
You'd better get home now.

135
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,980
Cuz I don't like your chick.

136
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,500
She has sparkling eyes.

137
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,940
Not like mine,

163

got stolen last night.

167
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,340
Why are they targeting a chicken?

168
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,180
Probably Leopard's men.

169

I need you to look into someone.

174

Money isn't an issue.

175
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,940
She's not in the country.

you can find intel.

191
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,780
so we're in danger here too?

192
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,020
Yes.

193
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,780
That's why I asked Madam Hong

194
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,940
to arrange for Aoki to stay.

195
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,020
He was my ally back in Heisha.

196
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,180
He's highly skilled.

197
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,780
He can protect you all.

198
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:16,700
Also,

199
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,900
don't let Mr. Zhang and Madam Hong
go out recently.

200
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,460
I'll guard my place myself.

201
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,860
After all,
the relic of ill omen is there.

202
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,380
What about Mu Dai?

203
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,820
I'm still figuring that out.

204
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,260
Senior.

205
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,620
I'm on my way.

206
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,980
I had a friend handle matters
in Youwu Town.

207
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,580
He just told me

208
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,220
the autopsy results for Master are out.

209
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:42,940
Something's off.

210
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,340
How so?

211
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,100
Master wasn't murdered.

212
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,380
She died of a natural cause.

213
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,180
The cause was the depletion
of her strength.

214
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,020
It can't be treated as a homicide case.

215
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,420
Then the wounds on her body...?

216
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,380
They were added after her death.

217
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,380
I was too distraught

218
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,420
to notice the blood loss.

219
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,140
Right.

220
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,060
There wasn't much bleeding.

221
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,260
So Master wasn't killed by Leopard?

222
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,380
Even if she didn't do it,

223
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,900
she must have added
the wounds afterward.

224
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,060
It's unclear now.

225
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,820
We'll talk more when I get to Lixi.

226
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,300
Hey, Mu Dai.

227
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,060
Ren.

228
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,980
Why would Leopard let you call?

229
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,140
Leopard?

230
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,100
I haven't seen her.

231
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,340
What?

232
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,700
Where is everyone?

233
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,140
The house is empty.

234
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,060
You're home?

235
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:38,940
Yeah.

236
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,300
It's pitch black here.

237
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,380
Where did you all go?

238
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,980
Stay put. I'm coming to you.

239
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,460
Where's Master?

240
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,140
Master?

241
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,340
You are

242
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:53,860
in Youwu Town?

243
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,540
Someone's outside.

244
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,820
A woman.

245
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,620
Leopard.

246
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:05,980
Leopard?

247
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,700
Mu Dai, hide.

248
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,380
Or run.

249
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,700
Is she strong?

250
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,340
Luo Ren,

251
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,500
I don't think I can get away.

252
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,700
I'll have to fight my way out.

253
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,100
Listen to me.

254
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,820
Don't hang up.

255
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,940
Strike first. Don't hold back.

256
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,100
Watch for a gun.

257
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,660
Luo Ren, I can't beat her.

258
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,700
Mu Dai.

259
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,340
Mu Dai!

260
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,220
Mu Dai.

261
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:41,740
Luo,

262
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,740
things have been very good.

263
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,460
I would be thankful to you.

264
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,660
It was very foggy last night.

265
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,740
And the mountain road
was hard to navigate.

266
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,580
I couldn't find
your little angel anywhere.

267
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,060
But you've been very cooperative and...

268
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,980
Cleared the place.

269
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,900
Everyone out in a day.

270
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,900
If you dare hurt her,

271
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,340
I'll kill you.

272
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:06,900
Luo,

273
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,700
I can't wait to see you.

274
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,140
Where's my master?

275
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,460
Dead.

276
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:32,460
[One day ago]

277
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,420
Master said

278
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,900
the mountains and rivers here

279
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,660
were arranged long ago by an expert,

280
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,940
forming a natural maze.

281
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,180
Follow the silver-eyed bats,

282
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,700
and you won't lose your way.

283
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,220
Go in tonight,

284
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,820
and come out tomorrow night.

285
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,700
Both Master,

286
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,340
Grandmaster, and I

287
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,180
have been stuck at the first gate
all our lives.

288
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,820
Only when the messenger brings the key

289
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,180
can the second gate be opened.

290
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,340
If you never see it in your lifetime,

291
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:42,060
take on a reliable disciple

292
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,580
and pass this duty down.

293
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,900
Fresh. Just out of the oven!

294
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,860
Take it easy.

295
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,540
Come and have a look.

296
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,900
A bucket of oil, please.

297
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,220
Fresh sesame oil.

298
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,900
Here you go.

299
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,580
Sweet and delicious.

300
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,420
Some rice, please.

301
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,420
One kilo of rice, please.

302
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,140
Alright.

303
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,660
Take a look.

304
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:22,620
Here.

305
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,340
There you go.

306
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:25,860
Take care.

307
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,660
How about some?

308
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,420
Get some spiced fruits.

309
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,460
Sure, just this?

310
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,460
Yeah, that's it.

311
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,140
Sure.

312
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,740
Take a look if you're interested!

313
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,700
These are all new arrivals.

314
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,700
Two of these, please.

315
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,740
I know what you're trying to say.

316
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,700
Why don't we go home
and have a meal first?

317
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,300
Ma!

318
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,420
I'm about to leave.

319
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,020
Okay.

320
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,340
Someone got hit!

321
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:07,860
What?

322
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:10,980
Ma.

323
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:12,740
Ma!

324
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,260
Ma!

325
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,500
Ma!

326
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:20,860
Is he alright?

327
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,860
It's okay. Hang in there.

328
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,700
I'm calling an ambulance.

329
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,340
I'll...

330
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,820
Will someone call an ambulance?

331
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,260
Can someone call an ambulance?

332
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,340
Please,

333
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,620
someone calls an ambulance!

334
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:42,940
Thank you!

335
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:44,700
No signal here either.

336
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,500
Stay strong.

337
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,380
Hold on there.

338
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,620
The ambulance will be here soon.

339
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,580
Kun.

340
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,620
I'm afraid I can't make it.

341
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,020
The secret can't die

342
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,620
with me.

343
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,220
You have to deliver the message.

344
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,900
Half of the map

345
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,860
was burned

346
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,540
in the war.

347
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,060
The key.

348
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,900
And the other half...

349
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,500
The key

350
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,980
is in the family genealogy...

351
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:13,900
The family genealogy.

352
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,380
Mr. Yin.

353
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:18,820
Mr. Yin.

354
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,860
Mr. Yin.

355
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:33,220
Why isn't the ambulance here yet?

356
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,860
[In Operation]

357
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,300
Please succeed.

358
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,060
May everything go smoothly.

359
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,540
Let it go smoothly.

360
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:51,860
Uncle!

361
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:52,860
Uncle!

362
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:53,820
Uncle, hang in there!

363
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,860
Who is Yin Sima's family member?

364
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,620
Doctor, he's my uncle.

365
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,220
His life is out of danger.

366
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,180
But whether he wakes up

367
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,580
depends on his will to survive.

368
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,260
We'll send him to the ICU.

369
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,220
Only one family member can stay

370
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,460
to sign for the ICU.

371
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,420
Mr. Shen,

372
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,580
I'll stay to sign.

373
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,100
You go home and pack some clothes
for my uncle.

374
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,340
Alright? Thank you.

375
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,300
So Yin Erma
was originally named Yin Sima?

376
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,620
By family hierarchy,

377
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,740
my uncle's name should've been Sima.

378
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,500
But he didn't like it, so he changed it.

379
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,300
But there's no difference.
They're both numbers.

380
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,740
Thank you.

No problem.

Half of the map

A key?

395
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,780
There's a key in the family genealogy?

396
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,660
I found something.

397
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,380
Leopard's ancestral home
is in Xiacheng Town,

398
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,380

Yes.

Her grandfather's generation
crossed the sea to the south.

402
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,940
Their ancestral home
was demolished long ago.

I heard you have
some kind of mental issue.

417
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,660

418
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,820
when you're upset like a willful girl.

419
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,540
Then your Madam Hong has to babysit you.

420
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,140
Are you gonna cry now?

421
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,940
Depends on my mood.

422
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,740
Looking at your face

423
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,380
kills the mood.

424
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,620
What are you looking at?

425
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,580
Memorizing your face.

426
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,620
If I live, I won't let you go.

427
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,700
If I die, I'll haunt you as a ghost.

428
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,060
What a sharp tone.

429
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,700
Your master was a real fighter.

430
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,300
Quite admirable actually.

431
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,620
I've never seen anyone like her.

432
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,540
Most people

433
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:24,060
can't handle it
to take my hits that much.

434
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,300
So what do you want now?

435
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,340
Luo has been ruining,
you know, my business

436
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,780
and my money too.

437
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,460
I'd love to work with him.

438
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,180
He makes money doing security work.

439
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:47,500
So helping me out is just another job.

440
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,500
At the end of the day,
he completely let me down.

441
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,500
He made me become
what I look like right now.

442
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,380
So you're going to kill him?

443
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,300
Just kill him?

444
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,940
You're so naive.

445
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,420
It will only

446
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:20,020
take a stab or a bullet,
and then he will be free.

447
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,300
But what about me?

448
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,740

449
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,380

451
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,140
No. Don't care.

452
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,420
Not interested.

453
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:39,260
My dream is to have a cheetah as my pet.

454
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:43,100
You know every cheetah trainer
said that thing.

455
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:46,140
That it can't be tamed as a pet.

456
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:48,860
I don't believe it.

457
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,060
And then.

458
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,620
Here, have a look.

459
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:55,340
This...

460
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:07,020
This is exactly how she repaid me.

461
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,300
But it's fine.

462
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,180
I pulled out her claws, teeth,

463
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:10,820
cut her tongue

464
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,200
and had a vet operate on it

465
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,380
to reshape the bones in her mouth.

466
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,540
You asked me what I want to do
with Luo Ren.

467
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,540
I don't want him dead at all.

468
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:24,220
I just wanna pull out
his claws and teeth

469
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:27,500
and make him my favorite pet dog.

470
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,620
He won't.

471
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,580
Really?

472
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:41,100
Now you don't know me well enough.

473
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,580
The only reason he's still breathing

474
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,340
is because I let him.

475
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,100
He has no idea

476
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:51,620

00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,900
Based on what I know about Leopard,

481
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,340
she'll come for me soon.

482
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,860

483
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,100

I'm better off in the shadows.

485
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,180
We'll coordinate,

486
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,660

I need to ask you a favor.

492
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:58,940
Leopard may act

493

494
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,180
I want you to take charge.

495
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,460
I'll follow your lead.

496
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:07,860
Why?

497
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:12,900
Mu Dai is in their hands.

498
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:14,740
I'm worried

499
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,020
I won't be able to stay level-headed.

You've lost to Leopard too many times.

506

as long as Leopard dies,

515
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,940
your girlfriend can be sacrificed.

516
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:08,940
What did you say?

517
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:14,980

Interesting.

No idea how her master is doing.

I guess she's busy helping her master.

00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,380
Exactly.

569
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,860
There are also five kneeling figurines

570
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,260
in the cave of Cao Village.

571
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,100
The two events happened
around the same time.

572
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,860
I have a strong hunch

573
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,220
those five from Plum Blossom Sect

574
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,580
were the five kneeling figurines.

575
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,940
Leopard's ancestor was truly wicked.

576
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,820
He might've even been a follower
of the Star Lord.

577
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,740
Or, going deeper,

578
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,620
he might even be the Star Lord himself.

579
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:40,980
Focus on your supplies

580
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:41,940
and get back soon.

581
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,460
You've really confused me.

582
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,340
Perhaps back then,
there were people like us,

583
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,740
chasing the relics of ill omen

584
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,340
from one place to another.

585
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,020
Then did they succeed?

586
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:56,500
What kind of question is that?

587
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,500
If they had,

588
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,380
we wouldn't be dealing with this now.

589
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:59,780
Not necessarily.

590
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,660
Maybe they did succeed.

591
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,700
But for some reason,

592
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,300
the relics of ill omen reemerged later.

593
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,580
Even if they failed,

594
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,660
they must have gotten further
than we have.

595
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:10,860
At the very least,

596
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,820
they secured
the sixth relic of ill omen.

597
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,220
Hello?

598
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,220
Luo, don't hang up.

00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:24,180
Look out of the bar

601
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,140
and don't let anyone notice anything.

602
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,180
Don't even try to wink

603
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:28,900
or signal.

604
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,540
I'm watching you right now.

605

If you do anything stupid,

606
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,380
I'll give a stab
to your little angel in return.

607
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,180
I'm going to pick up a package.

608

609
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,180
Don't wait for me to have dinner.

610

Speak.

611

Luo,

612
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,380
it's time to meet.

613
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:55,820
I prepared

614
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,060
a gift for you.

615

Where's Mu Dai?

616
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,060
I mean,

617
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:03,180
all I want is to see you.

618
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:05,300
That's not too much to ask, is it?

Long time no see, Luo.

I asked your girl

622
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,060
if there was

623
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,460
a memorable spot for you two
around here.

624
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:28,020

- Look around.
- Mu Dai!

627
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:35,340
I just gave you the hint.
Must be easy for you, huh?

628
