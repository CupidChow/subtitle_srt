Here.

00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,700

What now?

00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,340
What should we do?

12
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,460
Close the door.

She got such strength

60
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,540
that she pulled me in directly
through the iron gate.

61
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,300
And me.

00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,700

00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,020
He threw a knife like that.

66
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,860
It feels like a haunted house right now.

67
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,540
It was mutton
that the old man gave us, right?

68
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,580
I've had it anyway.

00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,340
Thank you for just now.

Did you get hurt?

75
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,380
Alright.

76
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,780
That stuff is stuck here.

77
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,980
Pingting is safe now.

78
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,780
I've finished my business here.

79
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,020
Pack your things.

80
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,180
We'll go back to Lixi.

81
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,700
Let's go.

82
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,260
Let's fly back, shall we?

83
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,060
Keep an eye on it for me.

84
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,220
Thank you.

85
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:21,940
He left it to us?

86
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,620
Your knife.

87
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,780
Thank you just now.

88
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:52,900
No need.

89
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,940
It was yours in the first place.

90
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,260
It's useless for me to keep it.

91
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,740
I didn't tell you

92
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,340
because

93
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:09,700
if I had,

94
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,860
you would've definitely objected.

95
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,380
Pingting is my cousin.

96
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,540
I can't just

97
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,740
watch her suffer.

98
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,020
I thought the relic of ill omen
wouldn't work immediately

99
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,220
when it took possession of me.

100
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,620
And my willpower was stronger
than that of Pingting.

101
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,620
So it couldn't control me easily.

102
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,260
You cry a lot, don't you?

103
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,100
I have a reason to cry.

104
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,220
It's so hasty and reckless

105
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,660
for you to do so.

106
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,740
After death, the relic will detach.

107
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,180
That's only an assumption by Mighty Kun.

108
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,940
How dare you gamble

109
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,260
with both Pingting's life and yours?

110
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,260
What if Pingting...

111
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:01,860
I know.

112
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,300
It's my mistake.

113
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,380
And also,

114
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,860
how could you make sure
you wouldn't be controlled?

115
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,180
If you had been controlled,

116
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,980
your power would have been
much greater than hers,

117
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:13,980
you know?

118
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,220
Anyway, as your friend,

119
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,300
I have to tell you

120
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,980
that your behavior today...

121
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,140
Your sloppy attitude

122
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,020
towards life was so...

123
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:22,780
I'm sorry.

124
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,940
It was so wrong.

125
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,020
I know.

126
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:33,700
As for the incident today,

127
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,140
it was indeed my problem.

128
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,780
The responsibility is on me.

129
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,740
Can you stay for some more days?

130
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,060
Although the relic
has been trapped in water,

131
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,540
I don't think

132
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,820
it will stay like that.

133
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,740
Let's call Mighty Kun later

134
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,740
for his opinion, okay?

135
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,220
Please don't be mad.

136
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,820
Thirteen-Thousand is still downstairs,

137
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,900
watching over the relic.

138
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,620
I owe them an explanation

139
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,460
on this matter.

140
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,300
Please stop packing.

141
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,020
So the relic of ill omen
really exists?

142
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:00,940
You guys can

143
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,620
take a moment to digest it.

144
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:06,980
Digest?

145
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,940
Did he mean something else?

146
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:10,860
Mutton?

147
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,420
So you've known everything?

148
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,300
Is there anything you'd like to say?

149
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,460
I don't have anything to say.

150
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,220
Then I have a question.

151
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,740
There's a friend of mine.

152
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,540
She met a guy and then...

153
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,660
By the way, they are just friends.

154
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,300
When that guy was chatting with her,

155
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,300
he suddenly touched her hair like this.

156
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,140
What do you think

157
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,140
this means?

158
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,580
Is there anything dirty

159
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,940
like dandruff or whatever

160
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,700
on your friend's head,

161
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,740
so he removed it?

162
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,780
That's not it.

163
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,180
As I remember, no.

164
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,940
A friend of yours, huh?

165
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,140
So Luo Ren touched your hair.

166
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,300
She said a friend sent her...

167
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,940
What's with the hair? Gosh.

168
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:00,900
I know

169
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,060
you'd think it was me.

170
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,060
But it was indeed my friend.

171
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:05,820
Come on.

172
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,980
Don't take us as fools, okay?

173
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,180
I can tell everything

174
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,460
from your expression.

175
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,060
Only a fool would believe you.

176
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:14,940
It must be Luo Ren.

177
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,420
Chubby.

178
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:18,980
Hit him.

179
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,020
Hit him?

180
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,060
Beat him, and you can be my disciple.

181
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,020
Master.

182
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,340
It's understandable, right?

183
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,580
I was

184
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,860
in a rush to have a master.

185
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,860
It was just a joke.

186
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,780
Don't you know how heavy you are?

187
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,220
You went too far!

188
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,500
Come on. You didn't spare me either.

189
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,860
Look how you scratched me.

190
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,060
See this?

191
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,900
I was lucky to break your defense.

192
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:57,940
It's in place now.

193
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,300
I feel fine now.

194
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,180
Good.

195
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,500
I can talk normally now.

196
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,100
Mu Dai.

197
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,740
What's the matter? What's this about?

198
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:12,980
Let's go.

199
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,780
Are you recording it?

200
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:14,580
Right.

201
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,300
What are you going to do?

202
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,660
Mr. Shen wants a real-time video call.

203
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,260
It's...

204
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,980
You just uncovered it like that?

205
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,980
If it's really going to come out,

206
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,380
do you think the plastic wrap
can stop it?

207
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,700
You're right.

208
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,020
Yeah.

209
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,780
Just now, didn't you see

210
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,740
a flash of light above?

211
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,420
Don't scare me.

212
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,540
Is it a shadow?

213
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,580
I did see it.

214
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,060
It couldn't be a shadow.

215
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,020
I'll turn off the lights.

216
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,260
I don't get it.

217
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,980
What kind of light is this?

218
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,860
It can't be captured by the camera.

219
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,780
And it's not the same
as last time.

220
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,100
It's got strokes,

221
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,420
like a painting.

222
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,340
Does the painting mean anything?

223
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,420
I'll get a pen.

224
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,340
I've done drawing.

225
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,740
It's finally done.

226
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,500
How's the drawing?

227
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,460
Well...

228
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,700
So you spent the whole night
and this is what you drew?

229
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,180
Hey, what do you mean?

230
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,460
I was drawing

231
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,380
without the lights.

232
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,380
I couldn't even see the paper.

233
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,580
This is pretty good
under the circumstances.

234
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,300
What does this mean?

235
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,460
Are these three chickens?

236
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,300
Is this a wolf?

237
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,860
More like a dog.

238
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,660
What does it mean by chickens and dogs?

239
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,100
I don't know.

240
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,180
It's quite obvious.

241
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,660
The relic of ill omen got caught by us

242
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,300
and bore hatred in its heart.

243
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,180
How evil it is!

244
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,700
We are three men and one woman.

245
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,300
It drew three chickens and one dog.

246
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,020
What does it mean?

247
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:43,940
It was cursing at us.

248
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:45,780
Could it be?

249
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,500
It cursed at us for the whole night?

250
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,620
Seriously?

251
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:56,420
It's 4K HD

252
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,460
with bulletproof glass.

253
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,220
The water temperature is controllable.

254
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:03,620
Its monitor can be
connected via Bluetooth.

255
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,660
My goodness.

256
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,100
What a luxurious dwelling
you're providing it!

257
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,300
The point is, it's sturdy.

258
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,420
Although it got still in the water,

259
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,660
we can't be sure whether it's faking it

260
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,700
and for how long it will keep still.

261
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,460
We can't let our guards down.

262
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,540
OK.

263
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,020
But you must have spent a fortune.

264
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:22,860
Lady Dai.

265
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:23,740
Oh, my.

266
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,260
Mr. Zhang asked

267
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,140
when you would go back.

268
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,420
He's almost going mad.

269
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,300
Tomorrow or after.

270
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,860
The day with the best flight deals.

271
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,460
She said tomorrow or after.

272
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,780
See which day has the best flight deals.

273
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,060
Its new home?

274
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,860
You treat it really well.

275
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,780
The money is worth it though.

276
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,780
Are you leaving tomorrow?

277
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,180
We're almost done.

278
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,780
And you're pretty busy.

279
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,980
We should go back.

280
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,700
I see.

281
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,660
How about I treat you guys
to lunch tomorrow?

282
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,900
Thanks to you these days,

283
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:55,980
things are solved.

284
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,620
It's just a pity

285
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,100
that I didn't get to show you around.

286
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,420
How about this?

287
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,580
Would you like to go
to the desert at night?

288
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,860
There will be a bonfire
and camel riding.

289
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:06,980
That's great!

290
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,260
I love deserts and camels.

291
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,260
Me, too.

292
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:10,980
Right?

293
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,180
You love deserts and camels?

294
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,340
Camels are very seductive.

295
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,060
Cao.

296
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,820
You don't like camels.

297
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,780
Why?

298
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,820
Tell me, how many eyes
does a camel have?

299
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:22,620
Two.

300
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,620
And how many humps does it have?

301
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,460
Two.

302
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,300
And how many nostrils?

303
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,300
Two.

304
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,700
How many people can ride on it?

305
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,740
I don't like camels.

306
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,260
I hate camels!

307
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,180
- It's okay.
- Then...

308
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,420
- Let's play something else.
- Neither of them wants to go.

309
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,300
Are we still going?

310
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,340
Well...

311
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,580
Do you want to go?

312
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,660
It's so great now.

313
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,540
After the relic incident was settled,

314
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,060
I feel much more relaxed.

315
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,420
It's over, I guess.

316
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,700
But for me,

317
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,460
it's more important than anything

318
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,460
that Pingting gets better.

319
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,340
I'm not interested

320
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,620
in the relic of ill omen at all.

321
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,020
So I guess for both of us,

322
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,700
it is over now.

323
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,140
I wonder when we'll meet again.

324
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,100
I'm sorry.

325
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,540
I planned to drive you back.

326
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,540
But the doctor told me

327
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,780
Pingting should have treatment
in a major hospital as soon as possible.

328
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,420
It's alright.

329
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,900
Pingting's matter is more important.

330
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:51,780
Mu Dai.

331
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,260
I suppose we're good friends now.

332
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,820
If you have something on your mind,

333
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,060
you can tell me.

334
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,660
Since we are very good friends,

335
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,180
Sure I'll feel down

336
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,020
since we are about to separate.

337
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,980
After that,

338
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,700
we might not be able to meet again

339
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,420
for many years.

340
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,060
You just said

341
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,420
you didn't know
when we would meet again.

342
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,060
You said it so easily.

343
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,300
Wait, I didn't say

344
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,780
that we wouldn't see each other again.

345
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,420
I meant

346
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,180
I didn't know when we would meet.

347
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,420
Is there a difference?

348
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,020
Sure, it's different.

349
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,100
So

350
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,620
you still want to see me?

351
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,500
Do you want to see me?

352
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,540
Sure.

353
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,940
Then I do as well.

354
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,860
You even set a condition.

355
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:46,780
What if I don't want to?

356
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,740
Then I don't want to, either.

357
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,780
Why would I want to if you don't?

358
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,220
The doctor told me

359
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,020
that Pingting

360
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,660
couldn't have a good recuperation
in Xiaoshang River.

361
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,540
We have to go to the south.

362
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,820
The moment he said that,

363
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:08,980
I thought of Lixi.

364
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,340
You know,

365
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,060
I rented a house in Lixi.

366
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,780
I am considering
whether to renew my lease.

367
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,860
But I don't want to be a nuisance.

368
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,420
Someone might say,

369
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,460
"Luo Ren, why are you here again?"

370
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,860
But now, it's fine.

371
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,700
Since both of us want to meet,

372
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,180
then, Lady Dai,

373
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,700
please help me take care of the house.

374
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,380
When Pingting gets the treatment,

375
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,260
let's go back together, okay?

376
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,700
In this case, I'll reluctantly

377
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,740
help you take care of it
when I'm not busy.

378
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,380
Why do the visions show
the roof corner of the ancestral hall?

379
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:27,260
[Half a month later]

380
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,060
Please let me have this.

381
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:54,580
Please...

382
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,380
What's this?

383
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,580
Why am I seeing this?

384
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,340
I must be working too hard.

385
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,940
I've even seen the vision.

386
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,160
[Keep up the good work]

387
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,260
We're back to Lixi.

388
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,740
Mighty Kun happened to plan
to come over.

389
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,060
I'll pick him up at the station.

390
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,460
Really, when?

391
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,380
Right now.

392
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,740
Then why didn't you say it earlier?

393
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,620
I would've gone with you.

394
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,740
Wouldn't it be the same
if you saw him later?

395
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,860
How can that be the same?

396
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,860
That's Mr. Kun.

397
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:01,900
Who wouldn't want to be the first

398
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,980
to meet such an interesting man?

399
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,260
I was the one who knew him first.

400
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,060
Why did you get to see him before me?

401
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,300
Tell me about it.

402
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,620
What does Mr. Kun look like?

403
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,900
I haven't seen him yet.

404
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,260
Is he dashing,

405
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,340
individualistic,

406
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,500
handsome and otherworldly?

407
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:21,980
Mu Dai.

408
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,500
What you are talking about
is not Mighty Kun,

409
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,460
but the male protagonist
of an idol drama.

410
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,300
Maybe I'm right.

411
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,820
Is he there?

412
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:32,860
Radishie.

413
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,380
When you're in a bad mood,

414
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,740
you can get a little fried food.

415
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,900
Have some if you want.

416
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:56,700
You...

417
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,980
Are you Mr. Kun?

418
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,420
Pocketty.

419
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,100
Come on.

420
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,260
This must be grasped by hand.

421
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:06,980
If you use chopsticks,

422
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,180
it would be less delicious.

423
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,580
With a knife and fork,
it would taste even worse.

424
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,900
Come on. Grasp one.

425
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:20,900
OK.

426
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,100
He is skinny.

427
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,100
I'd say he vomits in a car.

428
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,460
He doesn't look like an explorer

429
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,900
who braves wind and rain.

430
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,340
Cao.

431
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,500
You've been with me for so long.

432
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,780
Don't you know what it's called

433
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,500
lean and strong?

434
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,260
You're so chubby.

435
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,340
Of course, you think others are skinny.

436
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,140
If Mr. Kun is as chubby as you,

437
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,180
how can he explore?

438
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,180
Will he even be able to move?

439
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,380
Look at yourself...

440
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,180
If I may ask,

441
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,660
where is the shadow in water
you just mentioned?

442
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,100
Is it still there?

443
00:24:59,100 --> 00:24:59,860
Can you see it now?

444
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,380
It's on the surface of the water.

445
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,380
Where?

446
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:05,900
That's it.

447
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:06,620
It appeared.

448
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,300
It flashed for a moment.

449
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,500
Where's it?

450
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,020
Mr. Kun.

451
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,100
Several of them flashed.

452
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,300
Haven't you seen any of them?

453
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,460
I didn't see any.

454
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:21,980
Where exactly

455
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,060
is the shadow in the water
you mentioned?

456
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,500
How about you change the direction

457
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,380
and look from this side?

458
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,780
This man is miserable.

459
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,340
He has a skinny body
and a poor eyesight.

460
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,260
Is it just Mr. Kun who can't see it?

461
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,180
Or rather

462
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,940
only we can see it?

463
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,260
No way.

464
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,740
Maybe he doesn't have feelings for me.

465
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,020
A line of little folks.

466
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,580
Radishie saw them.

467
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,780
Pocketty saw them.

468
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,180
Chubby saw them.

469
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:32,740
And Thirteen?

470
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,740
I didn't see them.

471
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,660
I guess

472
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,580
it won't be long
before you can see them.

473
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,420
Now it seems

474
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,540
there are two consequences
after subduing the relic.

475
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,580
The water shadow in the fish tank,

476
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,980
and the visions that each of you saw.

477
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,540
I have an idea.

478
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,900
We caught the relic of ill omen, right?

479
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,180
It bears anger inside.

480
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,940
That's why it plays confusing tricks

481
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,940
to put mental pressure on us.

482
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,900
Anyway, just leave it alone.

483
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:03,860
Who would you ignore?

484
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,300
Mr. Zheng.

485
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,540
Hello, everyone.

486
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,460
Come on.

487
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,100
Slowly.

488
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,580
Mr. Zheng.

489
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,300
A little gift from the bar.

490
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,260
Thank you.

491
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,260
Welcome to Lixi.

492
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,580
My share is in there, too.

493
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,580
Thank you.

494
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,780
Ren.

495
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,660
Pingting.

496
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:23,940
That's not him.

497
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,540
You've mistaken the person.

498
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,060
Ren.

499
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,620
I'll show you a treasure.

500
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,420
Come here.

501
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,540
- Come on.
- Okay.

502
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:31,660
Luo Ren.

503
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,660
Everybody, sit down.

504
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,100
Please stay for dinner.

505
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,940
I'll make some pancakes

506
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,460
for you to have a taste.

507
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,180
Enjoy your meal here.

508
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,220
I'm just here to talk to Mr. Kun
about something.

509
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,140
I still have work to do.

510
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,220
Mr. Kun.

511
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,180
I have to go now.

512
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,820
Stay for some breakfast.

513
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,220
Scallion pancakes...

514
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:00,980
Mr. Zheng.

515
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,580
I've got some work to do at the bar.

516
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,380
I'll go now.

517
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,020
Take care.

518
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,060
Bye.

519
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:07,900
Luo.

520
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,820
Did you somehow offend my master?

521
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,500
Murderer!

522
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,460
I'm really sorry.

523
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,820
Did you get scalded?

524
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:26,620
I...

525
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,740
You...

526
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,340
What are you doing?

527
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,580
It's not me.

528
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,060
I don't know what's going on.

529
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,620
Luckily, the soup wasn't hot.

530
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,100
Did she do it?

531
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,380
Forget it.

532
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,620
Don't be afraid, I'll take care of it.

533
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,420
Forget it, Ren.

534
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,140
I'll deal with it. Don't worry.

535
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,580
I said forget it!

536
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,660
I'm sorry.

537
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,140
Mu Dai.

538
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,700
I want to take a bath.

539
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,660
It's okay, come home with me.

540
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,780
Do you want to talk

541
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,260
about what just happened?

542
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:45,860
Luo Ren.

543
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,540
What do you do?

544
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,060
Don't you have to work?

545
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:51,820
Right.

546
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,620
You are from a rich family.

547
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,660
I stayed in Old Heisha Island

548
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,580
for three or four years.

549
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,300
Old Heisha Island?

550
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:14,300
Isn't that a war-torn area abroad?

551
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,380
It had serious security issues.

552
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,660
Heavy security was needed.

553
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:20,580
I was employed

554
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,460
by a security center of a hotel group.

555
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,980
Wasn't that the same situation as mine?

556
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:27,180
When I asked my senior
to help me get a job,

557
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,220
it was also for a bodyguard position.

558
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,460
If you think we were
in the same industry,

559
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:34,660
I guess you can say that.

560
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,180
All right.

561
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,660
I'm done with my story. It's your turn.

562
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,260
You were

563
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,380
adopted by Huo Zihong in childhood.

564
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,460
Do you remember
what happened before that?

565
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,260
You can't do that.

566
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,940
I remember only a little.

567
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,020
I was abandoned by my mother.

568
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:10,940
I can't remember what she looked like.

569
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,380
I only remember that she took me away.

570
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,780
She walked with a sway

571
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,700
in her red high heels.

572
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,420
I kept staring at her feet,

573
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,620
afraid that she'd fall.

574
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,900
Later, she took me

575
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,820
to the gate of a welfare home

576
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,100
and gave me a peach.

577
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:33,900
Then she left.

578
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,820
I kept waiting for her.

579
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,060
At that time,

580
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,540
I just heard the story
of Kong Rong sharing pears.

581
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,900
So I thought

582
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,500
when she came back,
I'd give her the peach.

583
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:50,340
She would know
I was well-behaved and filial.

584
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,660
She would definitely be happy.

585
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:57,580
And then?

586
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,820
Later, I was taken in
by the welfare home.

587
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:06,220
I never ate that peach

588
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,460
until it...

589
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:09,900
got completely rotten

590
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,540
and thrown in the trash.

591
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:15,060
After that, I get allergies
as soon as I eat peaches.

592
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:20,860
After chatting,

593
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,740
don't you think we're quite alike?

594
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,540
We are in the same industry

595
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:27,180
and we have similar families.

596
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,100
That's true.

597
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:35,020
We feel sorry for each other.

598
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,500
We should have a toast.

599
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,700
Even if we don't have wine?

600
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,020
Wine doesn't matter.

601
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,380
Our mood does.

602
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,420
Right.

603
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,180
Then we should drink like this.

604
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,060
I'll use a bowl.

605
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:19,380
[Destiny Bar]

606
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,700
Thank you for your support
of my research.

607
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,380
There are only two things
that you wouldn't let me do.

608
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,700
This

609
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,220
and that.

610
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,580
Am I here for nothing?

611
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,020
Your research is too radical.

612
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,380
Can we take our time?

613
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,660
How to do that?

614
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,300
For example,

615
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,100
taking a little water sample
of the relic for research

616
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,140
is okay.

617
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:37,900
Very good.

618
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,300
But what do you mean

619
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,500
by heating it
and adding salt and vinegar?

620
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,420
Do you think it's appropriate?

621
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,060
Then how about

622
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,500
adding some liquor, chilies

623
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,300
and Huangjiu to stimulate it?

624
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,140
Maybe...

625
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,500
How about I make you a hotpot?

626
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,380
This way.

627
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,140
Where are you going?

628
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:56,980
Here.

629
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:57,940
Here!

630
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,300
It went inside.

631
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,860
Pingting, here.

632
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:01,860
Drink it.

633
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,340
Pingting, have some water.

634
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,220
Let me do it, Mr. Zheng.

635
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,940
Alright.

636
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,340
Don't let her choke.

637
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:09,300
Rest assured.

638
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:10,700
Pingting.

639
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:11,980
Pingting.

640
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,900
Here, have some water.

641
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:16,380
You're so patient, young man.

642
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,460
No wonder Pingting likes you.

643
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,740
You're not like Ren.

644
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,580
I have no idea
what he's doing all day long.

645
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,500
You're targeting me obviously.

646
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,900
You've got two glasses there.

647
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:29,980
I drank this one.

648
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:33,700
Pingting.

649
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:38,740
Ren.

650
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,540
What's wrong?

651
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:41,980
Ren.

652
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,620
Can you buy me a doll?

653
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,580
Lots of dolls.

654
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:47,700
OK.

655
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,340
I'll bring some to you next time.

656
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:55,700
There!

657
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,900
Pingting already has two dolls.

658
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,140
And you are buying her more?

659
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,140
You can't spoil her like this, can you?

660
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:10,780
Mr. Zheng.

661
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,620
Maybe when Pingting recovers,

662
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,020
she won't need these dolls.

663
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:14,940
Just do as she asks now.

664
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,340
Listen to me...

665
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:33,500
Pingting.

666
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,660
You got more dolls?

667
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,060
That's great.

668
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,740
All are here now.

669
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,260
All!

670
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:13,780
Mr. Kun.

671
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,620
Isn't the relic of ill omen
still in that fish tank?

672
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,660
We all misunderstood.

673
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,740
The human skin
is not the relic of ill omen.

674
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,860
That's just part of human tissue
being brought out

675
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:24,980
when the relic leaves the body.

676
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,100
We've never seen

677
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,740
what the relic of ill omen is like.

678
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:29,420
Then...

679
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,820
Will it return to Pingting again?

680
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,980
Judging from her status now,
it's very likely.

681
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:38,260
Seems it can't be controlled by water.

682
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,380
So what do we do now?

683
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:41,980
Is there no other way to solve this?

684
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,500
At such a critical time,

685
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,780
we should keep calm in mind,

686
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:45,580
right?

687
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,820
Look for all possible breakthroughs.

688
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:50,220
The relic of ill omen is next level.

689
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,300
How can there be a breakthrough?

690
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,100
There is.

691
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,300
Have you forgotten

692
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,580
that except for Thirteen,

693
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,820
the three of you all
saw a line of folks.

694
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,420
That was a message released
by the relic of ill omen

695
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,380
that only you guys

696
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,780
can receive.

697
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,340
It must have its meaning.

698
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,060
I don't believe it can send us

699
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,260
any good information.

700
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,020
Right.

701
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,860
It must be one of its tricks,

702
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,340
some passive information.

703
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,820
Even if it's a trick,

704
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:18,860
that's the only clue

705
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,260
we have so far.

706
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,100
Look, you can decide whether to explore

707
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,220
this clue or not.

708
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,340
Alright...

709
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,860
The first one is a man riding an animal.

710
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,220
The second is a phoenix.

711
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,580
The third is a lion.

712
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:32,820
The last one

713
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,260
is a monkey with wings.

714
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,660
They seem like tile cats.

715
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,100
Tile cats?

716
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,540
On the roofs of many old houses in Lixi,

717
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,660
there are tile cat statues
to attract blessing and suppress evil.

718
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,500
They look exactly like them.

719
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:48,460
One row...

720
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,460
Divine beasts on the roof ridges,

721
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,820
Immortals Leading the Way.

722
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,380
Immortals leading the way?

723
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:58,260
You guys are so lacking in knowledge.

724
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,860
When people built houses in the past,

725
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,820
they would always build cornices.

726
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,740
Immortals Leading the Way
is the most common kind.

727
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,580
Buildings decorated with the style

728
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,100
of Immortals Leading the Way

729
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,060
are everywhere in the country.

730
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,100
It's hard to specify.

731
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,220
There's a distinctive point

732
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,660
in your visions.

733
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,460
That hand.

734
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:20,420
Right.

735
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:24,620
This winged monkey is called Hangshi.

736
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:25,660
In Mu Dai's vision,

737
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,300
it was snatched by a hand.

738
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,300
So you should be looking
for Immortals Leading the Way

739
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,380
without a Hangshi.

740
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:32,460
A missing monkey

741
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,180
doesn't make it much easier to find.

742
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,620
It helps a lot.

743
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:38,060
It will be so obvious.

744
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:40,180
You guys can go back now.

745
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:41,700
I need

746
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,580
to take measures here

747
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,700
in case Pingting gets out
to hurt someone.

748
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:54,540
Go now.

749
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,260
What should we do?

750
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,980
The water can't suppress
the relic of ill omen.

751
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:30,020
Where can we find
the Immortals Leading the Way?

752
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,100
Master.

753
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,060
Pingting is pitiful.

754
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:34,860
That's right.

755
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:37,100
Luo said measures should be taken.

756
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,260
I guess he'll seal the doors
and windows again.

757
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:41,860
Maybe sedative?

758
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:44,540
He might even tie her up,

759
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:45,340
lest she harm herself.

760
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,060
Indeed.

761
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:49,500
Where are you going?

762
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,500
Watch where you are going!

763
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:57,500
- Are you blind?
- Luo Ren.

764
00:41:58,860 --> 00:41:59,420
Luo Ren!

765
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:02,460
Luo Ren!

766
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:10,460
Luo Ren!

767
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:11,940
Thirteen-Thousand, what are you doing?

768
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:21,740
Mind the store.

769
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:32,660
Luo Ren.

770
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:34,340
You gave her this stuff again!

771
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:35,540
Thirteen-Thousand.

772
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:41,860
Yeah.

773
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:44,140
Besides this,

774
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,620
I'll also set cameras inside and out,

775
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,180
reinforcing doors and windows.

776
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:50,300
Or to make it safer,

777
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,180
I'll find a way to make her unconscious,

778
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,140
and keep her alive
with nutritional injections.

779
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:56,420
Luo Ren.

780
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:57,900
She's your cousin.

781
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:59,020
She's a human being!

782
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,300
If she goes to kill others

783
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:01,380
like my uncle,

784
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:03,540
would you still dare to say this?

785
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:04,780
Shush, don't wake Pingting up.

786
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:06,700
Let go of each other.

787
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:19,700
From now on,

788
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,460
don't come over here.

789
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,820
Only by finding clues
of the Immortals Leading the Way

790
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,500
can we possibly save Pingting.

791
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:45,180
Let's go, Thirteen-Thousand.

792
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:46,580
Let's go.

793
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:47,980
Immortals Leading the Way...

794
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:51,500
