1
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,840
 

2
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:18,030



3
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:03,410
   

4
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,000
   

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,980
   

6
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,740
Chubby.

7
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,310
Chubby?

8
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,900
Chubby!

9
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,870
Luo. Luo!

10
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,750
Help! Someone help me!

11
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,150
No, Qing Shan, put the knife down.

12
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,170
- Stay back. 
 - Drop the knife!

13
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,300
Just leave if you can't find your friends.

14
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,040
Why insist on throwing your life away?

15
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,870
But my friends are here.

16
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,430
How can I just leave?

17
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,160
It wouldn't be right if I left, right?

18
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,390
How about this?

19
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:25,970
Is it too late for me to leave now?

20
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,360
Where is he?

21
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,820
Over there.

22
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,450
Where's Mu Dai?

23
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,555
They're all dead.

24
00:04:56,555 --> 00:04:58,215
What?

25
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,600
Say that again.

26
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,380
Where's Mu Dai?

27
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,170
I'll say it again.

28
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:11,290
They're all dead.

29
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,410
One was crushed into a pulp with rocks,

30
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:17,000
and the other was buried alive.

31
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,320
 Ya Feng. 

32
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,473
Luo Ren.

33
00:05:52,473 --> 00:05:53,896
Relax your body and don't move.

34
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:56,116
Or the dagger won't hold much longer.

35
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,500
Mu Dai, climb up.

36
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,200
Mu Dai, there's rope in my bag.

37
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,180
Take it out and tie it around my waist.

38
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,730
Okay.

39
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,480
You go down first.

40
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,600
Why do you think Ya Feng took a liking to Qing Shan?

41
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,560
She always said she wanted to marry someone rich.

42
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,160
Who knows?

43
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,420
Maybe she got tired of playing around and wanted to settle down with a decent man.

44
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,746
You know what? I heard Ya Feng came on to Qing Shan.

45
00:07:05,746 --> 00:07:07,400
Really?

46
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,380
What does she see in him?

47
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,420
Did Qing Shan cast some kind of spell on her?

48
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,640
Does it hurt?

49
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,700
If it does, look away.

50
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,640
What's wrong?

51
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,820
Will my fingers break?

52
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,140
No.

53
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,360
There.

54
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,700
You always come prepared with all the right gear.

55
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,360
Old habit.

56
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,340
Better safe than sorry.

57
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:11,140
This new bandaging feels much better.

58
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,540
Looks like they're wearing little hats now.

59
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,075
That hurts.

60
00:08:17,075 --> 00:08:19,160
They really saved us this time.

61
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,160
When we get back, I'm going to pamper them with hand cream every day.

62
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,500
And maybe even get a nice manicure.

63
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,840
Mu Dai.

64
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,360
Thank you for saving me earlier.

65
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,900
If it weren't for you,

66
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,020
I might have fallen to my death.

67
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,080
See?

68
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,680
I can save you, too, right?

69
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,320
I can protect you as well, can't I?

70
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,700
Don't mention it.

71
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:00,565
Luo Ren, I just hope nothing ever happens to you.

72
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,000
How did you fall down here?

73
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,800
Me?

74
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,960
I heard someone screaming for help.

75
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,420
 Then, I was lured here. 

76
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,320
 I saw Chubby tied up, with something in his mouth. 

77
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,060
That's when I knew someone was in the cave.

78
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,680
I tried to hit him with a rock.

79
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,400
 He was hiding behind that rock. 

80
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,800
 The moment I aimed, the ground gave way beneath me. 

81
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,440
Same old trick.

82
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,085
So, this whole thing was staged by Qing Shan.

83
00:09:33,085 --> 00:09:35,400
Ya Feng is his accomplice.

84
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,960
Ya Feng?

85
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,520
Earlier, Qing Shan dragged Ya Feng in at knife point.

86
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,180
I saved Ya Feng.

87
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,740
And guess what?

88
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,360
She's the one who pushed me down.

89
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,460
Then, could they...

90
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,740
Chubby is still up there.

91
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,380
Why would Qing Shan go this far to hurt us?

92
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,140
We've never done anything to him.

93
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,200
And Chubby is his cousin.

94
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,800
What do you think?

95
00:10:01,736 --> 00:10:03,716
The relic of ill omen.

96
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,960
I tested Ya Feng with blood.

97
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,000
 She didn't react. 

98
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,960
Qing Shan probably didn't use the power of the relic of ill omen

99
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,960
to control her mind.

100
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,440
Maybe just simple brainwashing.

101
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,060
What about Chubby?

102
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,340
Do you think they'll hurt him?

103
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,480
Don't worry.

104
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,540
Right now, he's probably the safest one.

105
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:27,780
The pitfall trap he set for us was meant to kill.

106
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:32,489
But with him, so far, it's just restraints.

107
00:10:32,489 --> 00:10:36,129
Maybe he's sparing him out of family ties.

108
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,760
But right now,

109
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,299
I'm most worried about Thirteen-Thousand.

110
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:45,699
What if he...

111
00:10:47,857 --> 00:10:49,598
I was just saying.

112
00:10:49,598 --> 00:10:51,980
I just feel like we're trapped here with no way out,

113
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,300
and no way to save him.

114
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,080
What if we never get out?

115
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,440
Don't lose hope.

116
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,720
Think about it.

117
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,800
Even stuck in this hopeless place, you're still fighting to survive.

118
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,960
I believe they're doing the same.

119
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,920
Don't forget, we still have Hong Sha.

120
00:11:16,252 --> 00:11:19,100
Thank you. Thank you.

121
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:23,200
Excuse me, how much farther is it to Cao Village?

122
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,140
Cao Village?

123
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,900
It rained heavily last night.

124
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,660
The road collapsed.

125
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,720
Just go straight along this path.

126
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,560
It should take about two hours.

127
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,920
- Two hours? 
 - Two hours?

128
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,960
Yes.

129
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,225
That's way too far.

130
00:11:39,225 --> 00:11:40,400
Shouldn't have come.

131
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,260
Right?

132
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:57,560
Sir, where's the collapsed road you just talked about?

133
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,320
I'd like to ask if I can climb over the mountain to get into the village?

134
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,640
- Climb over the mountain? 
 - Yes.

135
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,040
Young lady, you've got some nerve.

136
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,320
That's so dangerous.

137
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,080
It rained heavily last night.

138
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,560
There could be falling rocks everywhere.

139
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,720
Better stick to the main road.

140
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,440
It's safer.

141
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,800
Would I get lost taking the mountain path?

142
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,080
Not really.

143
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,440
Height gives you perspective.

144
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,200
If you lose your way, just climb to the highest point.

145
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,520
You'll spot Cao Village for sure.

146
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,240
Got it, thanks.

147
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,820
Be careful.

148
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,780
Someone was buried by the mudslide.

149
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,740
Thirteen-Thousand?

150
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,480
Thirteen-Thousand.

151
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,880
Thirteen-Thousand!

152
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,440
Thirteen-Thousand!

153
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,920
Thirteen-Thousand.

154
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,760
Thirteen-Thousand!

155
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,400
Thirteen-Thousand.

156
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,540
Oh, my gosh.

157
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,280
You're awake.

158
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,720
Are you all right?

159
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,400
How are you feeling?

160
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,320
Just survived a brush with death,

161
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,720
only to wake up to this horror scene.

162
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,320
Almost scared me to death again.

163
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,760
Got any water?

164
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,300
Yes.

165
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,580
Easy, easy.

166
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,040
What are you doing here?

167
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,880
Luo Ren called, saying you'd all lost contact.

168
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,040
He entered the village yesterday.

169
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,200
Now I can't reach him either.

170
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,880
I hadn't even arrived yet. I'd just entered the village and met you halfway.

171
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,440
Right. Qing Shan... Something's wrong with Qing Shan.

172
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:37,860
The relic of ill omen might be inside him.

173
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,280
 Boss Lady Dai? 

174
00:18:53,462 --> 00:18:55,262
 Boss Lady Dai? 

175
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,480
Look at you, completely useless in a fight.

176
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,180
The relic of ill omen might be inside him.

177
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,080
I couldn't go head-to-head with him.

178
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,680
I had to rely on brains instead.

179
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,280
What brilliant strategy did you use?

180
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,725
I... Such as cutting his power base,

181
00:19:31,725 --> 00:19:35,640
substituting crucial parts, and making a secret move.

182
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,280
I...

183
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,240
Ah, forget it.

184
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,180
I played dead.

185
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:52,760
 I tried climbing out later, but I was too weak and got buried again. 

186
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:58,400
So, when you woke up and found yourself in Luo Ren's car, were you overjoyed?

187
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,200
 Thirteen-Thousand. 

188
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,900
 Hang in there. 

189
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,800
 Please don't die. 

190
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,400
 Thirteen-Thousand! 

191
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,700
 Thirteen-Thousand! 

192
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,120
Not really.

193
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,654
What do you mean, "not really"?

194
00:22:05,654 --> 00:22:08,819
Who in their right mind would be overjoyed to see themselves

195
00:22:08,819 --> 00:22:10,185
in such a creepy look after waking up?

196
00:22:10,185 --> 00:22:12,960
I even thought I'd gone to heaven and been mummified.

197
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,080
And Fiery, no offense, but your bandaging skills...

198
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,940
Dockworkers packing cargo do a neater job than this.

199
00:22:20,733 --> 00:22:21,960
Don't hit me. Don't.

200
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,980
Everything hurts. Spare me.

201
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,920
See?

202
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,500
If I don't teach you a lesson, the heavens will.

203
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,360
Yes, I'm sloppy. You're the meticulous one.

204
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,960
The most meticulous.

205
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,660
Then, unwrap it and do it yourself.

206
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,680
You're amazing at this. The best.

207
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,420
I love your bandaging style.

208
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,600
Thinking back now,

209
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:03,005
Boss Lady Dai probably got into trouble the day she lost contact with Luo Ren.

210
00:23:03,005 --> 00:23:05,440
So what do we do now?

211
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,926
- Call the police? 
 - With what evidence?

212
00:23:08,926 --> 00:23:10,967
Everyone in Cao Village will side with Qing Shan.

213
00:23:10,967 --> 00:23:13,065
Who'd believe the two of us?

214
00:23:13,065 --> 00:23:16,106
Our top priority is finding Luo Ren.

215
00:23:16,106 --> 00:23:18,540
Are you sure the relic of ill omen is inside Qing Shan?

216
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:22,160
Not a hundred percent, but he's definitely up to no good.

217
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,980
And doesn't this feel different from before?

218
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,100
Like we've been set up.

219
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:31,240
First, Chubby was lured back to Cao Village by a letter, and then went missing.

220
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,540
Then, Boss Lady Dai and I came looking for him.

221
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,320
All we did was buy some insurance.

222
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,880
We didn't piss anyone off, yet someone's trying to kill us.

223
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,320
Now Boss Lady Dai's missing too.

224
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,260
Then, Luo Ren went into the village to look for us.

225
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,980
He also went missing.

226
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,760
Lucky for you. You didn't go straight into Cao Village.

227
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,780
Or you'd have been fooled by Qing Shan's innocent face

228
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:53,880
and ended up just like the others, missing.

229
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:09,000
I'm setting an alarm.

230
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,480
Is that necessary?

231
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,580
Dark, confined spaces can cloud your judgment

232
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,879
and push you toward emotional collapse.

233
00:24:16,879 --> 00:24:19,320
That's why keeping a routine matters.

234
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,500
I've already checked all the spots you just looked for.

235
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,600
The only way out is up there.

236
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,360
Really?

237
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,240
I'm starving.

238
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Tighten your belt will make you feel less hungry.

239
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,540
Try this.

240
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,120
Sure.

241
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,540
It's really much comfier than lying on the ground.

242
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:50,220
But aren't the mesh holes a bit too big?

243
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,340
What if I fall through?

244
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,920
Did I say this was for you?

245
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,440
It's not for me?

246
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,080
Then, where do I sleep?

247
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,680
Here.

248
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,545
We'll sleep together?

249
00:25:07,545 --> 00:25:10,410
Auntie Hong always taught me that girls shouldn't stay out overnight,

250
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:13,360
let alone sleep next to boys.

251
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,340
Suit yourself.

252
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:24,380
But desperate times call for flexible rules.

253
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,940
Do you like soup dumplings?

254
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,500
The ones with shrimp filling.

255
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,820
With a touch of crab roe.

256
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,980
Juicy filling wrapped in thin skin. Slurp up the soup through a straw.

257
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,640
Delicious.

258
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:59,060
I want to have roast duck.

259
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:02,400
Crispy skin and tender meat.

260
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,040
Stop.

261
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,120
Now you're making me hungry.

262
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,280
Just sleep.

263
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:11,560
Maybe there'll be food tomorrow.

264
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,720
You're treating me like a kid.

265
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,880
My poor stomach.

266
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,520
It's never been this empty in my life.

267
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,100
Let me see.

268
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,360
Does it hurt?

269
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:43,232
Luo Ren. Don't take advantage of the situation.

270
00:26:45,429 --> 00:26:48,960
♫  Our eyes meet, fighting back tears  ♫

271
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,600
Fine, I won't.

272
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,200
Now sleep.

273
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,360
♫  Together we brave the storms of adversity, oh ~  ♫

274
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,880
This rope bed is perfect in every way.

275
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,540
If only the ropes were a bit softer.

276
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:04,048
They hurt my head.

277
00:27:04,048 --> 00:27:06,060
♫  This unpredictable fate  ♫

278
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,740
Lift your head.

279
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,900
♫  (Fate) Is like a cliff of thorns  ♫

280
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,391
♫  But we'll press onward through the pain  ♫

281
00:27:13,391 --> 00:27:15,145
Better now?

282
00:27:16,565 --> 00:27:17,951
Sleep.

283
00:27:17,951 --> 00:27:23,831
♫  In our future, I believe, I believe, I believe love's horizon awaits  ♫

284
00:27:24,807 --> 00:27:26,940
♫  I just want to slowly love you with all my hope, oh ~  ♫

285
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,160
   

286
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:37,160
♫  Through all the time we've spent together  ♫

287
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,400
♫  And countless memories  ♫

288
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,540
Why are you looking at me like that?

289
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,480
Mu Dai, you know what?

290
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,940
You snored and drooled when you were sleeping last night.

291
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,820
What?

292
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:57,420
- That's nonsense. 
 - Really.

293
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,380
Never mind. I'll stop teasing you.

294
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,460
Get up and stretch a bit.

295
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:06,360
Time to eat.

296
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,420
You're making empty promises.

297
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,400
Where's the food?

298
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,620
Close your eyes.

299
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,500
Don't peek.

300
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,900
Open your mouth.

301
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,540
- Chocolate? 
 - A little snack won't fill you up.

302
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,740
But it's better than nothing.

303
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,740
Then, why didn't you bring it out last night?

304
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,900
I was starving back then.

305
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,940
We don't know how long we'll be trapped here.

306
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,120
Of course, we need to ration.

307
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,740
Fine.

308
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,220
Did you eat any?

309
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,660
I did.

310
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:57,580
Did you sleep well last night?

311
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,400
Not bad.

312
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,900
Sleeping on ropes beats sleeping in water.

313
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,720
In water?

314
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,140
It rained the night before last.

315
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:10,100
I woke up in the middle of the night only to find myself lying in a puddle.

316
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,280
Luckily, the water receded after the rain stopped.

317
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,280
Did the water recede quickly?

318
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,320
The water here came from seepage.

319
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,580
This place is all soil.

320
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:40,380
And there probably aren't many rocks underneath.

321
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,040
That's why the water could seep through so fast.

322
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,280
This cave goes deep.

323
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:52,740
Judging by the mountain's height, it should be close to the surface.

324
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:56,231
If it's all soil below, that means...

325
00:29:56,714 --> 00:29:58,180
- We can dig. 
 - Dig what?

326
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,180
A path.

327
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,980
A tunnel?

328
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,600
How many years would that take?

329
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,480
Are we really going to dig?

330
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,780
Yes.

331
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,560
Hello.

332
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,280
Hi.

333
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,360
Hello.

334
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,420
And you are...

335
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:49,820
Is this Jenny Cao's place?

336
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,322
- You mean Jin Hua? 
 - Yes.

337
00:30:53,322 --> 00:30:56,505
- Yes, it is. 
 - Jenny! Jenny!

338
00:30:56,505 --> 00:30:59,265
Your boss is here to see you!

339
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,760
Boss!

340
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,760
Boss?

341
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,560
Hurry up.

342
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,520
I'm Maria.

343
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:19,360
I'm the local manager of the Central Region for Atlantic Life Insurance Company.

344
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,440
Hello.

345
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,940
Central Region?

346
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,840
Local manager?

347
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,580
Madam... Madam Maria.

348
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,540
Madam Maria, what brings you here?

349
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,880
- Have a seat. 
 - All right.

350
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,240
Here's the thing.

351
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,780
Our customer service department received a call from a client named Henry.

352
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:39,500
He said he wanted to buy insurance for himself and his siblings.

353
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,900
He specified you as his agent.

354
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,940
I couldn't get through to your phone.

355
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,160
After asking colleagues in Yan City,

356
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,300
I learned you were attending a wedding in your hometown.

357
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,500
I was afraid the client might go elsewhere if we kept him waiting,

358
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,420
so I came personally.

359
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:55,260
I've brought the client's documents and requirements

360
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,960
to help you tailor the insurance plans.

361
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,760
This... This is really appreciated.

362
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,380
Thank you so much for coming personally.

363
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,140
So heartwarming.

364
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,060
This is the power of our team.

365
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,780
Madam, please enjoy your tea.

366
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:11,600
I'll go check the client details inside.

367
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,000
Take your time.

368
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,200
Jenny.

369
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,660
Yes, Ma'am?

370
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:22,060
This village looks festive.

371
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,145
Preparing for a wedding?

372
00:32:24,145 --> 00:32:25,200
Yes.

373
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,600
I've never seen a wedding with so many flowers.

374
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,060
In the city, weddings are all handled

375
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,520
by wedding planning companies.

376
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,540
They end up looking the same.

377
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:35,300
Yours here in the mountains is better. It's unique.

378
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,380
Exactly.

379
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:39,320
We have lots of traditional rituals for weddings in the mountains.

380
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,940
Just the banquet alone lasts three days.

381
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:44,320
- Banquet? 
 - Yes.

382
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,740
Now that you mention it, I am a little hungry.

383
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:53,580
Then, stay for the feast, Ma'am.

384
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,620
- Would that be all right? 
 - Of course.

385
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:58,640
The more, the merrier. Just an extra seat.

386
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,600
I really shouldn't impose.

387
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,800
At least stay for a toast.

388
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,960
- Stay for a toast. 
 - Why are there four armchairs there?

389
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,540
The bride and groom were both orphans.

390
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,800
Those armchairs will stand in for their parents.

391
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,300
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

392
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,820
When will the newlyweds make their entrance?

393
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,900
Here. Soon the groom will receive the memorial tablet from here.

394
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,700
After that, he can fetch the bride.

395
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,300
- Memorial tablet? 
 - Yes.

396
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,480
It's our tradition.

397
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,040
There's an ancient memorial tablet kept by the eldest villager.

398
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:41,000
For every wedding, a boy under seven fetches it from the elder's place.

399
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,060
After that, he follows the gong bearer,

400
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,580
circling the village with the tablet.

401
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,180
Finally, it's presented to the groom.

402
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:48,840
The newlyweds must honor the tablet before bowing to heaven and earth.

403
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,460
   

404
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,240
I see.

405
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,840
Dear, quick.

406
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,405
Have you seen Qing Shan?

407
00:33:56,405 --> 00:33:57,920
Haven't seen him.

408
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,140
- Eat up. 
 - Jin Hua.

409
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,820
- Jin Hua, have you seen Qing Shan? 
 - No.

410
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:05,980
The memorial tablet's about to arrive, but Qing Shan's missing.

411
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,780
Come, help me look for him.

412
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,320
All right, sure. Madam, have a seat.

413
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,520
- Jin Hua, have you seen Qing Shan? 
 - No.

414
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,440
- Look for Qing Shan. 
 - Help me search for Qing Shan.

415
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,760
Go now. I'll check here.

416
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,000
Zhu's mom!

417
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,240
Stop drinking.

418
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,920
Help me find Qing Shan.

419
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,160
Hurry!

420
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,360
Move it.

421
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,540
Today's my wedding day.

422
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,640
We're cousins after all.

423
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:46,600
Even if you can't join the banquet, I'd like you to be there.

424
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,960
You are my cousin.

425
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,280
- Pudgy? 
 - In a couple of days,

426
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,680
I'll see if I can let you go.

427
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,220
But I can only guarantee your safety.

428
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,440
As for the others, there's nothing I can do to help.

429
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,740
- Qing Shan. 
 - Sister Jin Hua.

430
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:09,120
The tablet's ready. Where were you?

431
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,620
Just checking if everything's prepared.

432
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:13,240
- I'm coming now. 
 - Hurry up!

433
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:31,240
This rock is man-made.

434
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:55,300
Once we remove this one, the rest should be easier.

435
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,300
Mu Dai, come look.

436
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,160
These rocks are arranged in intentional layers.

437
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,600
The gaps between the upper rocks

438
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,140
align with the surfaces of the lower rocks.

439
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:08,980
So, if you thrust a knife into the gap, it will still hit rock below.

440
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:12,540
So someone purposely stacked them like this?

441
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:15,200
Then there might really be an exit below.

442
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:19,520
Mu Dai, I'm the one who found this exit.

443
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,420
You go climb over there.

444
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,880
No way.

445
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,580
Still think digging our way out is a joke?

446
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,780
Not anymore.

447
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:35,520
Then, you take over the digging. I'm tired.

448
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,240
Poor me. My boyfriend is making me dig through rocks.

449
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,640
My hands are going to break.

450
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,340
Fine, move aside.

451
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:46,520
Luo Ren, I really like you.

452
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,160
Is it good?

453
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,580
I'm full now. Now I'm full of energy.

454
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,880
Time to prove myself.

455
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,960
No rock lifting.

456
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,960
Take it easy. Your fingers haven't healed.

457
00:38:09,298 --> 00:38:10,938
Are you all right?

458
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,000
I'm fine.

459
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:25,080



460
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:33,300
