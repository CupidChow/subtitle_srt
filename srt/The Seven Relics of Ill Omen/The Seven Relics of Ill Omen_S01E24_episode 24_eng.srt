1
00:00:06,007 --> 00:00:09,447
   

2
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:40,020



3
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,790
   

4
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,000
   

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,015
   

6
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,460
Please, just let me go.

7
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,520
I'm begging you.

8
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,340
Please.

9
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,080
Wait, no.

10
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,180
The relic of ill omen isn't on her.

11
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,480
No, well... It was clearly...

12
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,320
When I fought her earlier, she was fast and strong.

13
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,540
 I had to give it my all just to land a hit. 

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,240
 But the moment Luo Ren joined me, we overpowered her instantly. 

15
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,380
 And that's when Qing Shan escaped. 

16
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:47,620
Do you mean she took advantage of the chaos to transfer the relic of ill omen

17
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,900
and deliberately let Qing Shan get away?

18
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,140
Very likely.

19
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,420
It's already been proven the relic of ill omen can be transferred this way.

20
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,080
What relic of ill omen?

21
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,060
I don't understand.

22
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,700
Are you after money?

23
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,120
I'm begging you.

24
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,560
Please, let me go.

25
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,620
I beg you.

26
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,820
Please.

27
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,160
I don't think she's faking it.

28
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,920
Back in Nantian, when the relic of ill omen left Xiang Si Lan's body,

29
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,860
she couldn't remember anything either.

30
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,060
Then, untie her.

31
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,025
Enough.

32
00:02:19,025 --> 00:02:20,725
Drop the act.

33
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,600
The relic of ill omen may have been transferred.

34
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,460
But if you knew nothing, you wouldn't have said,

35
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:38,080
"You won't get anything from me" after the relic of ill omen was transferred.

36
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,100
You were buying time for Qing Shan, weren't you?

37
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:47,820
Once he was safe, you started acting innocent and kind to muddle through.

38
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,940
That's right.

39
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,200
You won't get anything from me.

40
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,560
So what now?

41
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,080
Where are we supposed to find Qing Shan?

42
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,300
He should have run out of the village.

43
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,700
We're too far behind.

44
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,480
We probably can't catch up with him.

45
00:03:51,462 --> 00:03:53,082
We're here.

46
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,242
Where is he?

47
00:04:03,242 --> 00:04:05,723
He was supposed to wait for me here.

48
00:04:05,723 --> 00:04:08,763
Do you think Qing Shan took him?

49
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,180
Doesn't seem like it.

50
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,120
He removed the bandage himself.

51
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,240
No signs of a fight.

52
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,580
And a shovel is missing.

53
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,860
Why would he take that?

54
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,720
Hunting for food?

55
00:04:24,826 --> 00:04:27,840
- What's wrong? 
- Thirteen-Thousand just texted us.

56
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,300
 Are you guys still there? 

57
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,440
 I'll take on Qing Shan.  
  

58
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,770
   

59
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,340
Water can suppress the relic of ill omen.

60
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:19,420
♫  How much further until the end?  ♫

61
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:24,341
♫  I'll fight until I bend  ♫

62
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:28,980

64

♫  I don't care if the answer's in sight  ♫

65
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,320
Keep an eye on Ya Feng.

66
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,200
The rest of you, come with me.

67
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,600
♫  We'll stand side by side facing fate  ♫

68
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,732
♫  Through thorns, we charge to the rescue  ♫

69

♫  These unknown adventures and schemes  ♫

♫  It will ultimately be conquered in time  ♫

72
00:06:01,369 --> 00:06:02,940
Thirteen-Thousand!

♫  Through raging flames we'll fight  ♫

74
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,040
Thirteen-Thousand!

♫  Beyond the nightmares, we'll stand in the light  ♫

76
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,720
♫  What's there to fear?  ♫

77
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,220
Thirteen...

78
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,440
♫  What's left to fear?  ♫

79
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,320
Thirteen-Thousand!

80
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,960
He's here. Come and help!

81
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,920
♫  What's left to fear?  ♫

82
00:06:34,741 --> 00:06:36,581
Useless.

83
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,600
What did you say?

84
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,000
How dare you insult him?

85
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,180
Qing Shan was such a good kid.

86
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,280
Look what you've done to him.

87
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,740
Hong Sha, let's toss her down!

88
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,040
All right, enough.

89
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,020
That's enough.

90
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,600
Once I recover, we'll deal with her together.

91
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,760
- Stop moving, will you? 
 - Ouch.

92
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,220
The relic of ill omen has been removed. Come in.

93
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,100
What are you doing?

94
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,140
That's mine! My relic of ill omen!

95
00:07:03,972 --> 00:07:05,620
Mine!

96
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,060
Just you wait. Someone will deal with you.

97
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,600
You think this is over?

98
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,222
Dream on!

99
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,520
The cycle of seven sevens. The cycle of seven sevens.

100
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,920
The relic of ill omen will still be mine.

101
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,520
You'll be doomed!

102
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,000
Can someone shut her up?

103
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,780
What's this "cycle of seven sevens" she keeps ranting about?

104
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,005
No idea. She's been muttering it.

105
00:07:23,005 --> 00:07:23,960
This is strange.

106
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,080
Everyone else returns to normal after the relic of ill omen is removed.

107
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,400
Why is she even worse than before?

108
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,700
Forget about her for now. Have you seen the shadow of water?

109
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,520
Why hasn't it shown up yet?

110
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,100
What's wrong?

111
00:07:52,758 --> 00:07:55,538
Boss Lady Dai.

112
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,500
Mu Dai.

113
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:19,060
♫  The sky splits the dawn's horizon  ♫

114
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:23,400
♫  It's telling me the end  ♫

115
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,480
♫  (The end) Is about to gently appear  ♫

116
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:33,980
♫  Like a whisper in my mind, a fleeting touch across my face  ♫

117
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:40,520
♫  Yet I find myself in the dark  ♫

118
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,780
Are we in the shadow of water?

119
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,840
This one is way too sophisticated.

120
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,480
 Old Ke, dig in. 

121
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,460
- Did you see that? 
 - Yes.

122
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,005
A dog.

123
00:09:41,005 --> 00:09:43,065
But definitely not a good one.

124
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,780
Last time, we saw the girl getting married in the shadow of water in Nantian.

125
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,020
The dog stood by, looking longingly as the sedan chair carried her away.

126
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:53,200
This time, it's the scene of her raising the dog before the marriage.

127
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,740
The timeline is indeed reversed.

128
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,520
It seems this dog is very close to its owner.

129
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,540
But in those days, no one brings a dog along when getting married.

130
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,400
Did the dog track her down afterward?

131
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,400
Then came the house fire.

132
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,940
But the girl was so kind to the dog.

133
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,000
Instead of saving her, it just sat and watched.

134
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,380
I bet that dog was possessed by the relic of ill omen.

135
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,880
Perhaps the seven relics of ill omen

136
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,120
may form a complete story with seven shadows of water.

137
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,820
This seems to be an incident from over a hundred years ago.

138
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,180
What exactly is it trying to tell us?

139
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,880
We don't have the full picture yet.

140
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,780
Can't jump to conclusions without knowing the whole story.

141
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,820
Well?

142
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,380
Did she tell you what the "cycle of seven sevens" means?

143
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,180
No.

144
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:53,260
Ya Feng really is different from other hosts.

145
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,740
My gut tells me she knows a lot.

146
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,600
But she won't talk.

147
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,440
If only Dr. He was here.

148
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,680
Then, we could try hypnosis.

149
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,640
Maybe we could get some clues out of her.

150
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,480
Let me try.

151
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,140
You?

152
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,080
I've studied hypnosis.

153
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,360
I even got certified.

154
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,320
It's just that I'm not very skilled,

155
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,320
only a 50% success rate in practice.

156
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,180
I fail a lot.

157
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,120
Uncle Li asked me to hypnotize him for a portrait before,

158
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,060
and I thought it was too difficult.

159
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,820
But...

160
00:11:28,325 --> 00:11:30,260
Hypnosis might not work,

161
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,560
but getting clues out of her should be possible.

162
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,120
Forget it. Don't get your hopes up.

163
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,900
Of course, I'll get my hopes up.

164
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,600
You're the top hypnotist around this area.

165
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,820
Well then, I'll give it a shot.

166
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,060
The relic of ill omen has already been removed.

167
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,860
Should we let Ya Feng and Qing Shan go?

168
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,980
 Yes. 

169
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,140
 Keeping them locked up isn't right. 

170
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,500
 It's false imprisonment. 

171
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,140
Actually, they're victims.

172
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:24,240
Although Ya Feng talks tough, she's just a young girl.

173
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,960
 A good scare is enough. 

174
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,740
Are you sleepy?

175
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,780
Yes.

176
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,780
 But so many things have happened today. 

177
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,340
 I can't fall asleep. 

178
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:38,020
 Well, how about counting sheep? 

179
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:40,900
 I'll count the stairs instead. 

180
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:45,112
 One step, two steps, 

181
00:12:45,112 --> 00:12:49,394
 three steps, four steps, 

182
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:54,000
 five steps, six steps, 

183
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 seven steps... 

184
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,040
 You're here. 

185
00:13:23,863 --> 00:13:25,603
 Let's talk. 

186
00:13:28,502 --> 00:13:31,677
 How did the relic of ill omen come to you? 

187
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:33,377
No idea.

188
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,920
It just came.

189
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,645
I felt so good

190
00:13:40,645 --> 00:13:42,745
after it came to me,

191
00:13:44,193 --> 00:13:47,113
like I was brimming

192
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:49,772
with power.

193
00:13:49,772 --> 00:13:53,340
 Then, do you know why it chose you? 

194
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,020
Of course, I do.

195
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:02,880
It likes me because I'm wicked.

196
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,420
But he doesn't understand.

197
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:10,860
I'm more suitable for the relic than all the others.

198
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,340
 Who is he? 

199
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,380
 Your companion? 

200
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,960
Companion?

201
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,500
Do you mean Qing Shan?

202
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:23,660
If it weren't for that fool, I wouldn't have been caught.

203
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,760
 How did you know about the trapdoor? 

204
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,760
I just knew.

205
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,760
I've been here a long time ago.

206
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,340
It was them!

207
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:39,640
They brought officials and buried me alive!

208
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,046
Right in that pit.

209
00:14:44,046 --> 00:14:46,746
 What is the "cycle of seven sevens"? 

210
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,020
Don't let them hear it.

211
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:54,660
Nothing can trap us except the Imperishable Wood

212
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,780
and the Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle.

213
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,500
No matter what tricks they pull,

214
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,740
they can't avoid the cycle of seven sevens.

215
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,260
 Does "seven sevens" mean 49? 

216
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:09,120
Yes. 49 days.

217
00:15:10,254 --> 00:15:12,055
Those fools think

218
00:15:12,055 --> 00:15:14,820
they can take away my relic of ill omen with blood.

219
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,620
What use is blood?

220
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:20,340
It can trap us for 49 days at most.

221
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,540
That doesn't seem right.

222
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,680
 They trapped the first relic of ill omen a long time ago. 

223
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,040
 It's been way more than 49 days. 

224
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:30,620
That's because later they trapped the second and the third ones.

225
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:34,480
As long as a new relic of ill omen is trapped within 49 days,

226
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,140
the count resets.

227
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:41,144
So, it's useless.

228
00:15:41,144 --> 00:15:42,720
As long as they can't find a new one,

229
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,580
all their efforts will be in vain.

230
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:47,590
In the end, the relic of ill omen will still be mine.

231
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,580
Mine!

232
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,900
Everything will be ruined.

233
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,260
They'll all be finished!

234
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,420
What did you do to me?

235
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,740
You won't get anything from me!

236
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,220
You'll all be doomed!

237
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,595
I'll sue you.

238
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,260
Kidnapping, false imprisonment,

239
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,680
and even physical assault!

240
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,392
You peeled off a piece of skin from my back.

241
00:16:17,392 --> 00:16:19,692
Qing Shan is a victim, too!

242
00:16:22,667 --> 00:16:26,100
What did we even do wrong?

243
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,740
We're just a poor young couple.

244
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,140
You freaks.

245
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,040
Freaks!

246
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,620
This is a mess.

247
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,900
After all that, we're the freaks.

248
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,140
And they could easily sue us.

249
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,260
The bride and the groom vanished at the wedding.

250
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,300
The whole village can testify to that.

251
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,200
And they've got missing skin on their backs.

252
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,580
But if we want to sue them,

253
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,680
we don't even have evidence.

254
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,920
Let's release them tomorrow morning.

255
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,180
Keeping them any longer is false imprisonment.

256
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,880
At least, we've secured the relic of ill omen.

257
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,040
They can't cause trouble anymore.

258
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,520
Ya Feng!

259
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,320
Ya Feng!

260
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,420
Ya Feng, where are you going?

261
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:26,360
Let's talk when we get back to the village, alright?

262
00:17:29,037 --> 00:17:31,340
The village?

263
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:34,120
What do I have to do with your village?

264
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,980
We...

265
00:17:40,261 --> 00:17:42,020
We held the wedding banquet.

266
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,820
So what?

267
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,101
You good-for-nothing.

268
00:17:46,101 --> 00:17:49,960
If you hadn't messed up, I'd have succeeded by now!

269
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,920
And you think I'd marry you?

270
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,300
Keep dreaming!

271
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,780
Ya Feng.

272
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,560
Ya Feng.

273
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:03,140
I even betrayed my cousin for you.

274
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,660
I'm begging you, all right?

275
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,800
Come back with me.

276
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,760
Are you deaf?

277
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,920
Stop following me.

278
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,180
You won't go home, really?

279
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,880
I'll just pack things up and leave.

280
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,861
Haven't made anything of myself anyway.

281
00:19:04,861 --> 00:19:07,400
What's your standard for that?

282
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,060
You're my disciple, upright and decent.

283
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,380
That's making something of yourself.

284
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,620
You're right here, yet you're not seeing your parents.

285
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,000
That's shameful.

286
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,240
Got it?

287
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,360
Going back would only upset them.

288
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,480
Why bother?

289
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,841
Brother Cao, you should go back.

290
00:19:23,841 --> 00:19:27,641
Look, I don't even have a home to go back to.

291
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,700
Chubby, among the five of us,

292
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,100
you're the only one lucky enough to have parents waiting for you.

293
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,920
Go on. Chop chop.

294
00:19:56,482 --> 00:19:57,680
You haven't been home for so long.

295
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,100
Get something for them.

296
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,480
- I don't need it. 
 - Take it.

297
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,846
I...

298
00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:06,768
I...

299
00:20:06,768 --> 00:20:09,825
I don't need this much. You guys...

300
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,220
Buy your parents something nice.

301
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,660
Here is my share.

302
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,100
Mine.

303
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,280
It's a loan. You'll pay me back.

304
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,409
Now, how much am I in debt to you, a penny?

305
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,280
All right.

306
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,240
Well...

307
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,134
Deduct it from my shares of the hotpot restaurant.

308
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,538
Safe trip.

309
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,700
Deep down, Brother Cao has always missed home, hasn't he?

310
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:58,000
Let's take this chance to go check on the cave in the back of the mountain again.

311
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,925
I have a feeling it can tell us more.

312
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:07,440
I really don't understand kids these days.

313
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,220
Getting married on a whim and calling it off just as fast.

314
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:13,780
Whenever I ask him anything, he just clams up.

315
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:18,900
Qing Shan's stubbornness is just like Pudgy's.

316
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,640
I wonder where Pudgy is now.

317
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,440
Where?

318
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,060
Probably died out there.

319
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:33,220
He'd better stay out, or I'll beat him to death when I see him.

320
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,140
Mom.

321
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,960
Dad.

322
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,660
I... You...

323
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,860
You...

324
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,640
You've been gone for about eight years.

325
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,280
Where have you been?

326
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,880
I was working in big cities.

327
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,760
It was rough at first.

328
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,465
I thought I'd come back after I'd made something of myself.

329
00:22:11,465 --> 00:22:12,600
You silly boy.

330
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,680
What are you talking about?

331
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:20,880
Even if you end up as a beggar, to me,

332
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,040
you'd still be my son.

333
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,860
You know that?

334
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,080
Son.

335
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,820
Mom.

336
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,065
Son.

337
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,226
Get up.

338
00:22:40,226 --> 00:22:42,906
It's good that you're back.

339
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,480
Make some food for him.

340
00:23:17,626 --> 00:23:19,467
Son, get up.

341
00:23:19,467 --> 00:23:21,788
Your dad has forgiven you.

342
00:23:21,788 --> 00:23:23,709
Get up now.

343
00:23:23,709 --> 00:23:26,469
Get up. No more tears.

344
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,980
Your dad has forgiven you.

345
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,320
Come on, pull.

346
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,520
So, according to you two,

347
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,120
this one lying here is the Saturn Star Lord, the god of land?

348
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,060
Those possessed by the relic of ill omen often gain supernatural abilities.

349
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,320
Back in the old times, people were ignorant,

350
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:29,000
so they called him the Star Lord, followed him, and worshiped him.

351
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,760
So, these bodies with masks on must be his followers.

352
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,200
But who are these five kneeling ones?

353
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,760
The scripts here say that they are treacherous villains.

354
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,880
They were made to kneel for eternity.

355
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,440
When Ya Feng was hypnotized,

356
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:50,926
she said they brought officials to kill her in this cave.

357
00:24:50,926 --> 00:24:56,913
I'm guessing those five were the ones who caused the Star Lord's death.

358
00:25:00,281 --> 00:25:02,920
People who were against the relics of ill omen?

359
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,000
Five of them?

360
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,120
There are five of us, too.

361
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,900
And we're also against the relics of ill omen.

362
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:15,395
Just thinking about it gives me the creeps.

363
00:25:15,395 --> 00:25:16,496
Don't jinx it.

364
00:25:16,496 --> 00:25:17,701
What kind of nonsense is that?

365
00:25:17,701 --> 00:25:19,022
Have you lost your mind from the hit on your head?

366
00:25:19,022 --> 00:25:20,783
Yes, yes, I've lost my mind.

367
00:25:20,783 --> 00:25:22,463
I'm totally fried.

368
00:25:23,377 --> 00:25:25,338
This is a eulogy for the Star Lord.

369
00:25:25,338 --> 00:25:28,000
Signed by someone named Cao San Bao.

370
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,220
He should be the one who escaped from here.

371
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,520
He set up the trapdoor.

372
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,340
Perhaps, even the Cao Village exists because of him.

373
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,080
Yes, I remember now.

374
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,420
Cao Jin Hua told me the Cao Village used to make pottery for a living.

375
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:46,600
And their memorial tablet bears the ancient character for "Earth."

376
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,500
Earth?

377
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,760
Here, your favorite eggs.

378
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,960
You should have some too.

379
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,565
Okay. All these are your favorites.

380
00:26:05,565 --> 00:26:07,360
- Here you go. 
 - I've got enough.

381
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,320
Mom, I can do it myself.

382
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,920
I'll serve myself.

383
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,060
One more thing.

384
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:18,980
You should go and apologize to Jin Hua.

385
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,080
I ran into her dad yesterday.

386
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,360
He's still mad.

387
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,900
He said you held her back.

388
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,480
She's still single because of you.

389
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,860
Come on, eat.

390
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:39,640
Dig in.

391
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,660
Come on.

392
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:53,060
Jin Hua, my father gave me an earful.

393
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:56,900
And I do feel like I held you back on the marriage thing.

394
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,420
I sincerely apologize to you.

395
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,140
It's fine.

396
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:06,660
Honestly, I should thank you.

397
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:09,940
Back then, I left in a huff to find work.

398
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,720
Only then did I realize how big the world is,

399
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,620
and how many ways there are to live in.

400
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:19,100
Sure, my job's tiring and demanding, but it's fulfilling.

401
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,560
I wake up with hope every day.

402
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,880
Right.

403
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:28,720
As for the marriage thing, I feel great

404
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,240
living the days by myself.

405
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,820
I just want to focus on my work, so I can make money

406
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,460
and give myself and my family a better life.

407
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:42,000
I want to improve myself from the inside out.

408
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,620
You know what, several guys in Yan City hit on me,

409
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,840
but I turned them all down

410
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,060
because they don't even know who Monet is.

411
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:53,600
How's that going to work, right?

412
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:58,920
Yes. If they don't even know Motay, that's really...

413
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,743
Pudgy...

414
00:28:03,743 --> 00:28:08,603
I am quite worried about you.

415
00:28:10,332 --> 00:28:16,912
I think your work is too dangerous.

416
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,060
That's typical for a man, you know.

417
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:28,220
That's why I think you should get insurance.

418
00:28:28,978 --> 00:28:31,920
I... Uh... No, no.

419
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,480
Listen, the benefits are incredible.

420
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,880
- That's true. I get it. 
 - I bought insurance myself.

421
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,460
Actually... You've got it all wrong.

422
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:39,440
I'm in the catering business with those friends of mine.

423
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,700
It's very safe.

424
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,440
Perfectly safe.

425
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,940
Those friends of yours?

426
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,720
I saw them head up the mountain.

427
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,000
Head up the mountain?

428
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,520
Why didn't you go with them?

429
00:28:56,372 --> 00:29:00,160
We both left home in a huff.

430
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,020
Jin Hua is having a promising life.

431
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,640
She even lost weight.

432
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,340
While I'm on the way to becoming a loser,

433
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,905
and I just packed on the pounds.

434
00:29:08,905 --> 00:29:12,125
Luckily, I've found some true friends.

435
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:16,112
I'll just tease them a bit.

436
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,260
The Cao Village was built by Cao San Bao.

437
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,060
All the villagers share the surname Cao.

438
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,200
They even worship the Saturn Star Lord.

439
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:31,980
In this case, Chubby is a descendant of the Star Lord's followers?

440
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,760
The Star Lord was possessed by the relic of ill omen.

441
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,240
Well, is there something wrong with the village?

442
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,680
After centuries, the villagers have long forgotten this past

443
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,560
and just regard it as a tradition.

444
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:48,220
Oh, and don't tell Chubby about this.

445
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,780
My ancestors worshipped the Star Lord?

446
00:29:51,483 --> 00:29:53,923
I'm a descendant of villains?

447
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,460
Why do they keep it from me?

448
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,860
Who's there?

449
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,940
It's you.

450
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,040
We had a deal.

451
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,893
You should do as I say.

452
00:30:32,893 --> 00:30:37,250
 What do you mean I can handle them but can't kill them? 

453
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:39,688
 What if they try to kill me? 

454
00:30:39,688 --> 00:30:41,560
 Relax. 

455
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:45,740
 They only want the relic of ill omen, not your life. 

456
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:48,120
 Take away the relic of ill omen? 

457
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,120
 That is taking my life. 

458
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,200
 I think... 

459
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,859
 all the sacrifices now 

460
00:30:58,859 --> 00:31:02,499
 are worth it for the plan to succeed. 

461
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,200
But they almost died.

462
00:31:16,705 --> 00:31:19,386
You've gone too far.

463
00:31:19,386 --> 00:31:24,330
How can they play their parts when you push them to the corner?

464
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,160
Do you think I wanted this?

465
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,400
You didn't even tell me Yan Hong Sha was also coming.

466
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,960
There are five of them.

467
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,520
They're all ruthless.

468
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,800
I'm all alone and outnumbered.

469
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,240
And Qing Shan is useless!

470
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:47,360
Well now, things have gone your way.

471
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,540
I've lost everything.

472
00:31:51,401 --> 00:31:53,441
And you're blaming me?

473
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,840
No, no, I'm not.

474
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,660
Why would I?

475
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,760
All right. It's fine.

476
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,320
Nothing went too far off track, right?

477
00:32:11,902 --> 00:32:15,882
Think, if any deviation had happened,

478
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,040
would I have let you off?

479
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:48,240
I don't have the relic of ill omen.

480
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,140
But you still do.

481
00:32:51,957 --> 00:32:53,757
Give it to me!

482
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,780
Give it to me!

483
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:59,640
It prefers me.

484
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,300
It'll be happier with me.

485
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,840
Give it to me. Now!

486
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,840
Never.

487
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,580
Give it to me.

488
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,880
Give it to me!

489
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:26,220
So, you want to stay home longer, and you'll head back after dropping us in town?

490
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,910
My parents want me around a bit more.

491
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:31,780
Fair enough. Spend more time with them.

492
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:43,160
Brother Cao, aren't you going to relight the sparks with Cao Jin Hua this time?

493
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,480
Relight?

494
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,880
We never lit anything before.

495
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:50,420
Then, aren't you going to turn that little spark between you two into a roaring fire?

496
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,880
There's never been a spark.

497
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,580
Looks like I'm doomed to die alone.

498
00:34:55,580 --> 00:35:01,260
To prevent such a tragedy, I'm getting a pet.

499
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,634
What kind of pet?

500
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:05,520
I haven't decided yet.

501
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:11,360
Perhaps, fate will lead me to the right pet in the right place.

502
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,003
Fate, huh?

503
00:35:13,003 --> 00:35:16,840
All right. I'm cheesy, and you're the philosopher here.

504
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,440
Get in the car.

505
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,360
 I told them my decision to stay single for life. 

506
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,500
 And they don't care at all. 

507
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:37,360
 Obviously, they detest me because of where I come from. 

508
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,280
My phone's broken.

509
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,440
I'll get it repaired up ahead.

510
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,480
You guys can go for a stroll and grab some snacks to eat on the way.

511
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,840
Sure.

512
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,200
Fiery, let's go.

513
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,480
Get me something.

514
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,720
All right.

515
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,960
Chubby, you're on your own.

516
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,720
I'm going for a walk with Fiery.

517
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,040
Chubby, you're so lazy.

518
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,840
You heard me. Get out and move a little.

519
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,120
Let's go.

520
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,760
Fiery, what do you want to have?

521
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,400
My treat.

522
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,660
Let me see.

523
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:20,020
There's a nice bakery over there.

524
00:36:20,569 --> 00:36:22,197
A cake shop?

525
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,744
What do you want to have?

526
00:36:27,744 --> 00:36:29,644
I'll buy it for you.

527
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,000
Have you been waiting long?

528
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,700
No.

529
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,440
What are you looking at?

530
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,860
Chick...

531
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,600
are you as lonely

532
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,200
as I am?

533
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,620
I'm going to get my phone repaired.

534
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,960
I'll be right back. Wait for me.

535
00:37:46,549 --> 00:37:47,680
What a coincidence.

536
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,740
I was just about to call you.

537
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,000
What does "Seven-Star Stay Bright" mean?

538
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,200
What great crisis?

539
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,321
The relics of ill omen will grow?

540
00:37:58,321 --> 00:38:00,699
What does "grow" mean? How will they grow?

541
00:38:00,699 --> 00:38:02,000
I don't know either.

542
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,580
Yin Er Ma mentioned it last night.

543
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,100
I grilled him as soon as he woke up.

544
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:08,140
He swore to me that he'd only heard

545
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,760
that the "Seven-Star Stay Bright" and the relic of ill omen would grow.

546
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,520
But he didn't know how they'd grow or to what size.

547
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,280
   

548
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,960
We're just talking.

549
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,680
Relax.

550
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:27,400
Your account will be part of my next book.

551
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,560
I...

552
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,714
Will be...

553
00:38:31,714 --> 00:38:33,534
In a book?

554
00:38:34,169 --> 00:38:37,740
The Great Virtuous One came out of Xiagu Pass and passed by our village.

555
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:38,920
My ancestors were hospitable.

556
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,860
They treated him to alcohol, meat, and pancakes.

557
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:45,930
Pleased, he shared this tale.

558
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:47,500
Well...

559
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:51,482
Hospitality led to a miraculous encounter.

560
00:38:51,482 --> 00:38:55,106
Why do you visit the Stargazing Platform every day, rain or shine?

561
00:38:55,106 --> 00:38:56,620
Hobby.

562
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:59,074
Stargazing enthusiast?

563
00:38:59,074 --> 00:39:02,194
How many stars have you seen lit the most?

564
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,780
Six.

565
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,498
Well... When was that?

566
00:39:08,498 --> 00:39:10,979
A year and a half ago.

567
00:39:10,979 --> 00:39:14,940
But one day, I saw five.

568
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:20,436
Well, have you... Have you ever seen seven?

569
00:39:20,436 --> 00:39:21,917
That's impossible.

570
00:39:21,917 --> 00:39:23,720
No way, no way.

571
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,665
That would be disastrous.

572
00:39:25,665 --> 00:39:28,485
Why is that?

573
00:39:28,485 --> 00:39:30,390
They can grow.

574
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:32,330
Grow?

575
00:39:35,941 --> 00:39:37,602
Ponder it yourself.

576
00:39:37,602 --> 00:39:39,480
I'm really sleepy.

577
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,892
Wait...

578
00:39:40,892 --> 00:39:44,436
Last night's conversation got me thinking.

579
00:39:44,436 --> 00:39:48,280
If a relic of ill omen keeps growing,

580
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:51,540
 eventually, no human could contain them. 

581
00:39:51,540 --> 00:40:00,560



582
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,560
 'Palm Print' - An Qi
