[Episode 8]

5
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,740
Lady Dai, you're awake.

6
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,580
You screamed yourself hoarse.

7
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,580
You don't even know

8
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,180
how awful it sounded.

9
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,460
Come on, use my phone.

10
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,700
Just type if you need anything.

11
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,020
Where's my friend?

12
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,660
You mean the rich girl
all dressed in designer?

13
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:43,300
She...

14
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,420
What happened to her?

15
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,460
Her leg was injured,

16
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,780
swollen like a giant radish.

17
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,220
She's already been taken
to the hospital.

18
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,500
The doctors said

19
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:53,940
they might have to cut them off.

20
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,460
Nothing I could do for her.

21
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,100
So I stayed here with you.

22
00:01:59,260 --> 00:01:59,940
Let me tell you.

23
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,460
You looked like a potato

24
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,620
when they pulled you out.

25
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,420
I just kept dumping water on you.

26
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,300
Then left you under the sun

27
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,260
to kill germs.

28
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,100
Maybe even help you grow taller.

29
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,820
- Mu Dai.
- Washed it all off for you.

30
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,300
You're awake.

31
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:11,660
Luo Ren.

32
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,420
You okay?

33
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,700
Hongsha's leg got cut off?

34
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:17,980
What? Cut off?

35
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,260
No.

36
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,980
Her leg just got crushed.

37
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,140
She's already been taken
to the hospital.

38
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:26,940
Ow.

39
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,700
Ouch, that hurts.

40
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:28,540
My butt really hurts.

41
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,060
I saved you, remember?

42
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,620
What was in the swamp?

43
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,420
Let he tell you.

44
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,460
Listen, let me tell you.

45
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,260
That thing

46
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,660
is just like my butt,

47
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:42,900
having two parts.

48
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,860
And it snaps shut!

49
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,700
I touched its shell.

50
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,780
It felt like a clam.

51
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,660
But it's not exactly a clam.

52
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,540
Clams live in water.

53
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,980
They don't hang out in mud,

54
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,260
and they're never that huge.

55
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,860
Yeah, it was pretty weird.

56
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,340
That clam was unusual.

57
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,620
So how did you beat it?

58
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:05,900
All thanks to Thirteen-Thousand.

59
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,780
Speak of this,

60
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,140
you really owe my butt an apology.

61
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,420
It was an emergency.

62
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,660
Luo Ren even lost his dagger.

63
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,700
What else could I do?

64
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,940
I dove in like a dragon
plunging into the sea.

65
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,180
I started digging through the mud,

66
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,900
looking for that clam.

67
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,500
Sure enough, I found it!

68
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,900
I pulled a Tiger Claw!

69
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,540
Yanked its meat out and twisted!

70
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,660
It hurt, so the shell popped right open.

71
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,180
And I grabbed you with my left hand.

72
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,460
I want to go see Hongsha.

73
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,020
She told me what happened with you all.

74
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,620
When Thirteen-Thousand and I
first found this boat,

75
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,820
it was full of supplies.

76
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,140
At first, I didn't get

77
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,700
why someone would live here.

78
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,140
Hongsha said

79
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,780
her uncle was here to hunt treasure.

80
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,660
All is clear.

81
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,260
The big lake's dried up.

82
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,940
Now the only places
where pearls can grow

83
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,180
are the lake center
and the lake's deepest point.

84
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,980
Her uncle needs to test the water
every day,

85
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,420
so living here is the most convenient.

86
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,540
Did you find her uncle?

87
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:01,820
Not sure yet.

88
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,100
But when we passed through the village,

89
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,580
we did see someone.

90
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,100
Maybe

91
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,300
it was him.

92
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,900
That Hangshi...

93
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,700
We checked the ancestral hall,

94
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,220
but found nothing.

95
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,140
Still need to keep looking.

96
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,140
Eat this.

97
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,260
It's good for your throat.

98
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:42,980
Good for your throat.

99
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,340
What are you laughing at?

100
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:57,580
Oh.

101
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,460
This is a sailor's whistle,

102
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,260
and it's very loud and sharp.

103
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,780
Just blow it if you're ever in danger.

104
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,700
It's saved me a few times.

105
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,660
You're giving it to me?

106
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:34,820
I...

107
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,060
I just...

108
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,180
Go get some rest.

109
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,620
I'll get back to work.

110
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,740
Send out?

111
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,140
What?

112
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,140
Send the gear you bought

113
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,260
to Hepu?

114
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,540
What's going on?

115
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,260
Wait,

116
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,140
let me write this down.

117
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,420
Go on.

118
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,620
Slower.

119
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,660
Come again next time.

120
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,380
Sure.

121
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,380
Sure.

122
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:27,980
Express delivery. Got it.

123
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:28,820
Alright. Got it.

124
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,020
Dai's there too?

125
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,580
Didn't she go...

126
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,220
Didn't she go to Huacheng
for an interview?

127
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:40,860
Luo,

128
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,660
be straight with me.

129
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,740
Did you guys leave me out on purpose?

130
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,540
No, we ran into each other by chance.

131
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,340
By chance? Come on.

132
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,340
Three of you,

133
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,380
at Thirteen's home?

134
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,180
Who'd believe that?

135
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,220
Four people?

136
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:55,820
And another girl?

137
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,300
Luo,

138
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,100
you guys are bringing a newbie
instead of me now?

139
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,020
Enough.

140
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,060
Just remember to send that for me.

141
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,180
Oh,

142
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,820
tell Mr. Zhang that Mu Dai's okay.

143
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:05,660
Wait.

144
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,220
Gotta go.

145
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,580
That vision led us here.

146
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,380
What it wants us to look for?

147
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,860
Mu Dai and the others came too.

148
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,900
Was it really just a coincidence?

149
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:06,620
Mu Dai.

150
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,460
I was just thinking of you.

151
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,620
They said you lost your voice
screaming for help.

152
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,900
I gave you attitude the whole way,

153
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,260
and you didn't even hold a grudge.

154
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,060
How about this?

155
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,380
When I get back,

156
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,340
I'll have my grandpa pay you extra.

157
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:29,900
Okay.

158
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,420
Luo Ren rented you a wheelchair.

159
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,380
You'll be discharged soon.

160
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:41,980
Okay.

161
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,660
Oh, Mu Dai.

162
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,060
That Luo Ren.

163
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,620
Is he your boyfriend?

164
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:53,660
No.

165
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,620
That's great.

166
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,220
What a relief!

167
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,220
I think

168
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,220
I fell for him at first sight.

169
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,100
He's so handsome

170
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,340
and tall too.

171
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,300
And he saved me!

172
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,180
And he's so efficient.

173
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,100
Completely match

174
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,500
a novel's male lead I read as a kid.

175
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,700
After I saw him, my heart beat

176
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,060
fast.

177
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,220
Thump-thump.

178
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:20,980
Just racing like crazy.

179
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,900
What, you believed me?

180
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,580
Kidding! Just messing with you.

181
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,820
I acted pretty well, huh?

182
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,220
But after a quick chat with him,

183
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,260
I could tell

184
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:38,940
your relationship

185
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,340
is definitely more than ordinary.

186
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,340
And now it's like I got dumped
before the romance even started.

187
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,180
Still hurts though.

188
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,820
Do something to make me feel better.

189
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,180
How about I don't pay you extra?

190
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,380
Now I'm broke and heartbroken.

191
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:21,940
Chubby,

192
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,780
you can't let your guard down.

193
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,060
This is how people

194
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,860
slowly get sidelined.

195
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,260
They've already formed a little group,

196
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,540
and they're shutting you out.

197
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,700
They're off on a new adventure,

198
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:37,820
but you're not part of it.

199
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,260
You're stuck doing logistics.

200
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,860
You'll just take Mr. Zhang's place.

201
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,540
And don't forget,

202
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,820
there's a girl.

203
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,060
That newbie?

204
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:51,660
Yes.

205
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,260
I'm gonna be replaced by her.

206
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,220
My place in the team

207
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,780
will be gone for good.

208
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,900
Why?

209
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,420
I've seen the visions too.

210
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,540
Chase them now!

211
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,220
- It's not too late.
- It's not too late.

212
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,380
Or we could just play cards.

213
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:13,660
No.

214
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,740
The mountain will not come to Muhammad,

215
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:23,300
- then Muhammad must go to the mountain.
- then Muhammad must go to the mountain.

216
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,620
Hey,

217
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,900
you know what?

218
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:32,820
This boat

219
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,300
might be old,

220
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,660
but it looks cool.

221
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,140
Really feels like an adventure now.

222
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,460
Can you manage that?

223
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,300
Careful.

224
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:40,860
Wait.

225
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,460
Wait.

226
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,140
How are we eating here?

227
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,420
Hold on.

228
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,700
I wanna check over there.

229
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,780
Can you push me that way?

230
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:49,980
That way, in the back.

231
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,100
Lady Dai, she's...

232
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:51,700
Lift.

233
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,380
Lift.

234
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,660
That way.

235
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,980
So noisy.

236
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:07,900
It's locked.

237
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,860
Seriously, what is this?

238
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,540
I had a friend

239
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,460
send over some equipment.

240
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,220
Chubby express-shipped it over.

241
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,900
What types of equipment?

242
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,540
Drones and soil scanners.

243
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,140
This mudflat is huge
and full of hidden holes.

244
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,700
Better to scan it first.

245
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,740
Please tell me

246
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,780
it's not illegal equipment.

247
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,060
If it were illegal,

248
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,620
you think they'd let it get shipped?

249
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,260
Alright.

250
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:35,980
Mu Dai,

251
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,540
I'll go receive the equipment.

252
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,700
I'll go with you.

253
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,260
No need. You're working.

254
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,660
Hey, grandpa.

255
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,020
We just got to the boat.

256
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:04,860
We just arrived.

257
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,180
It's great here, really.

258
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,780
Super safe.

259
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,220
We've got everything,

260
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,380
food, drinks,

261
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,220
even instant noodles.

262
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,220
We're even cooking here.

263
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,100
I got news about uncle.

264
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:21,700
Really.

265
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,180
Mu Dai's friend saw someone
in the village.

266
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,140
Probably him.

267
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:26,900
He must be around.

268
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,060
We'll find him soon.

269
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,980
His stuff and equipment are all
on the boat.

270
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,380
It's just a matter of days now.

271
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,660
We'll definitely find him.

272
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,460
Don't worry.

273
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,700
I know.

274
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,780
Luo Ren is not right for you.

275
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,740
I'm saying this
because we've known each other so long.

276
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,820
Consider it a friendly warning.

277
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,380
Don't take it the wrong way.

278
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:50,980
Yes,

279
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,740
he's a good guy.

280
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,060
But the moment I saw him,

281
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:55,860
I just knew

282
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,700
his background must be complicated.

283
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,340
On the way to Wuzhu Village,

284
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,900
I heard him on a call.

285
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,100
How are things at Heisha now?

286
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,380
Still no word from Leopard.

287
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,820
What did you do before?

288
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,300
I mean, you've got great skills,

289
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,260
quick and efficient.

290
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,420
Worked overseas before,

291
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,300
earning my keep.

292
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,620
You know what place it is?

293
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,460
Always on the news.

294
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,020
Some war zone overseas.

295
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,620
What kind of people hang out there?

296
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,620
Just now,
he mentioned shipping equipment.

297
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,620
That equipment he's sending

298
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,260
doesn't seem like regular stuff.

299
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:38,820
Lady Dai,

300
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,820
don't mind me talking.

301
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,540
I'm just the bartender.

302
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,940
You're the future owner of our bar.

303
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,060
He's not one of us.

304
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,060
I can tell

305
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,700
he likes you.

306
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,540
But that's just because you're likable.

307
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,060
You know why

308
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,740
your relationship with him
can only stay at "like"?

309
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,300
And never go beyond?

310
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,860
I'll tell you.

311
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,220
It's because he knows it clearly.

312
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,860
You two don't match.

313
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,140
I...

314
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,380
I just...

315
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,260
Go get some rest.

316
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,700
I'll get back to work.

317
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,700
Nonsense.

318
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,980
What's your problem?

319
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,620
They're dating.

320
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,220
What's it got to do with you?

321
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,420
Who are you

322
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,500
to butt in like that?

323
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,980
Why can't I butt in?

324
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,420
Just because you've got some money,

325
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,220
you think you're so great?

326
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,220
When I get a wife someday,

327
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,540
she'll be richer than you.

328
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,380
You? Get a wife?

329
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,660
Look at the color of your shirt.

330
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,340
Green!

331
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,860
One more word, and I'm coming for you!

332
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,260
Careful.

333
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,220
I'll drag you.

334
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:57,940
I'll find another way up.

335
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,780
Unbelievable.

336
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,140
A cripple like you

337
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,140
dares to challenge me?

338
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,540
When the lion falls, the hyenas circle.

339
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:04,900
Just you wait.

340
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,180
I'll break your other leg too,

341
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:06,700
you hear me?

342
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,420
Ouch! Ow!

343
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,300
Ow! Lady Dai, save me!

344
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,820
- Save me.
- Alright, forget it.

345
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,260
You think you can take me like this?

346
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:16,700
I'll really give you...

347
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,380
What now?

348
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,820
Just wait,
it's only because I haven't eaten.

349
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,020
Let me finish my noodles first,

350
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,020
then we'll fight.

351
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,260
Thirteen-Thousand, right?

352
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,300
That's your name, yeah?

353
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,220
Yeah, why?

354
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,460
I swear I'll slice you in two
with one chop.

355
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,340
Bring it on!

356
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:29,980
With people like him,

357
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,100
you gotta watch your back.

358
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,180
I'm telling you.

359
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,380
Sowing discord with hidden motives.

360
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,420
A two-faced weasel.

361
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,060
Badmouthing people behind their backs.

362
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,580
What kind of man is that, huh?

363
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,500
If you ask me,

364
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,460
either he's into you,
or he's into Luo Ren.

365
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,140
Is that right?

366
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,460
You're the one who likes Luo Ren!

367
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,580
What did you say?

368
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,460
I do not like Luo Ren.

369
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,100
You!

370
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:46,660
Say that again!

371
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,300
You!

372
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,540
Oh no!

373
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,420
Who cooked the noodles?

374
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,460
Mu Dai.

375
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,260
I'm heading to the village
with Thirteen-Thousand.

376
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,700
You stay here with Hongsha.

377
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,380
Call us if anything comes up.

378
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:18,740
Mu Dai.

379
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,140
Is it done yet?

380
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:27,380
Yeah, here.

381
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,340
Hey,

382
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,260
are you still thinking about
what Thirteen-Thousand said?

383
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,940
I told you.

384
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,620
Don't take him seriously.

385
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,700
He did it on purpose.

386
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,940
I think he had a point.

387
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,780
I feel like Luo Ren's really nice to me.

388
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,540
More than just friends.

389
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,980
But sometimes he's distant.

390
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,380
Like

391
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,980
there's this invisible wall between us.

392
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,820
I can feel

393
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,060
he minds it

394
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,140
when things get too emotional
between us.

395
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,420
You get what I mean?

396
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,540
So what does he actually feel?

397
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:15,900
He keeps everyone guessing

398
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,060
like this.

399
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,340
Isn't he tired?

400
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,460
I'm tired.

401
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,100
No.

402
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:25,740
Mu Dai.

403
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,900
We've gotta be direct.

404
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,100
You have to ask him directly.

405
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,300
Ask him directly?

406
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:30,820
Yes.

407
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,020
I'm too shy. I can't.

408
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,260
No, I can't.

409
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,780
Oh, you absolutely can.

410
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:37,980
I...

411
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,300
Look, think of it this way.

412
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,980
Let me give you an example.

413
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:42,980
It's like

414
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,060
you've walked into a big, lush forest.

415
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:45,940
And by chance,

416
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,780
you spot Luo Ren, the little sapling.

417
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,340
You feel drawn to nurture it.

418
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,380
But you've gotta know what he wants.

419
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,940
If he's into it,

420
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,300
you nurture him,

421
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,460
and he grows into a towering tree.

422
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,900
If he's not,

423
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,980
no matter how much effort you put in,
it won't work.

424
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,220
He won't grow.

425
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,060
Besides,

426
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,020
what if you nurture him for ages,

427
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,940
only for him to lean
toward some other sapling?

428
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,060
Wouldn't that piss you off?

429
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,620
And

430
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,860
we've got the qualifications

431
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,420
and the looks.

432
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,660
Why worry if he's unwilling?

433
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,260
There's a whole forest out there

434
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,380
waiting for you.

435
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,260
Why get hung up on one tree?

436
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:20,940
Right?

437
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,860
If he's not into it, then let it go.

438
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,140
Just ask him straight out.

439
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,740
Better than sitting here
stewing over it.

440
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,860
Don't torment yourself!

441
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,740
You care a lot about this.

442
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,580
But what you're saying makes sense.

443
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,940
Fine.

444
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,380
I'll find a chance to ask him?

445
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,140
Make it soon.

446
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:45,980
Don't drag it out.

447
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,220
Luo Ren.

448
00:19:59,060 --> 00:19:59,980
Do you think that guy yesterday

449
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,100
was really Yan Jiuxiao?

450
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,780
Should we get a loudspeaker

451
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,980
and just call him out?

452
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,380
I've been thinking

453
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,380
the relic of ill omen
showed us that vision,

454
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,220
and we followed it

455
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,060
here.

456
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,660
So far,

457
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,900
that mysterious guy and the big clam
we ran into

458
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,140
are unusual.

459
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,340
Do you think they might be linked
to the relic of ill omen?

460
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,900
Hard to say.

461
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,500
Do you think

462
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,660
there could be another relic of ill omen
out there?

463
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,100
Luo Ren.

464
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,580
Chief's house.

465
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,060
Someone's living here.

466
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,780
Could Chief actually still be around?

467
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,940
When people drown around here

468
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,060
and we can't recover the body,

469
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,660
we use straw dolls as a substitute.

470
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,660
When my parents were buried,

471
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,900
there were straw dolls in the coffins.

472
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,020
Would you place them

473
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,420
at the dinner table?

474
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,780
That's not part of the custom.

475
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:10,100
These things don't look like
they belong to Chief.

476
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,460
They're Yan Jiuxiao's?

477
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,980
He moved in here?

478
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,980
Yan Jiuxiao's gone missing,

479
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,620
his daily stuff is on the pearl lugger,

480
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,740
and his personal belongings
are scattered here.

481
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,920
[Yan Jiuxiao. Incorrect Password]

482
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,180
Stop wasting your time.

483
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,260
If he set a password...

484
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,180
How do you know that?

485
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,740
Hongsha's been trying to find her uncle.

486
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,620
I've seen his personal info.

487
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,820
I tried his birthday

488
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,940
and the last six digits
of his phone number.

489
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:54,220
There should be synced photos
on here, too.

490
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,380
Found them.

491
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:14,740
See that?

492
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,860
Everyone in the field knows

493
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,580
where there are broken pearls,
there must be rare ones.

494
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,340
Today, I had a hunch

495
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,700
there's treasure here.

496
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,300
If this works out,

497
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:27,020
I'll never have to worry
about money again.

498
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,460
Worried about money?

499
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,940
I thought his family was loaded.

500
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:34,900
Yeah, I was curious about that too.

501
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,620
Look,

502
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,740
I've never seen a clam this big.

503
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,140
I've been squatting here
for like a week,

504
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,420
and this is the first time it's come up.

505
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:45,620
It's huge.

506
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,980
My guess is it rarely ever moves.

507
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,860
I've got the ropes ready.

508
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,860
I promise

509
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,020
there's definitely a pearl
in that thing.

510
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,180
It went back down?

511
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,660
I can't let it get away.

512
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:00,740
Did he fall?

513
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:02,860
He tripped.

514
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,660
I'm gonna kill you!

515
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,100
I'm done with this old man.

516
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,980
At first, he seemed totally normal.

517
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,300
But the second I said
I was going diving for the clam,

518
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,580
he suddenly lost it.

519
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,060
Stop right there!

520
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,820
Tell me that face is creepy or not?

521
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:20,980
Chief.

522
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,780
He's still in the village.

523
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,740
Anyway, I just hope

524
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,140
they bring my clothes back soon.

525
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,100
I haven't changed in days.

526
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,940
You can wear mine!

527
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:33,740
I'll go grab them for you.

528
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,380
Your pants are too long.

529
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,340
Once I put them on...

530
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:38,780
What is it?

531
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,260
Something's getting close to us.

532
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,340
What? Don't scare me.

533
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,620
The treasure bell.

534
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,340
It's my uncle.

535
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,940
Treasure bell?

536
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,900
Just like when you first met me,

537
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,660
I was wearing it then too.

538
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,860
Everyone in the Yan family has one.

539
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,980
It's really my uncle.

540
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:58,980
You're sure it's the treasure bell?

541
00:24:58,980 --> 00:24:59,500
Absolutely.

542
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,940
I know that sound well.

543
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:01,740
Uncle?

544
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,380
Un...

545
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,540
That's weird.

546
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,460
Why is your uncle just pacing around?

547
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,220
Why isn't he coming straight to us?

548
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,700
He stopped.

549
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,620
Mu Dai.

550
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,660
Who are you?

551
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:24,980
Is it the relic of ill omen again?

552
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:25,820
I don't know.

553
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,460
But he seemed a little crazy just now.

554
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,580
The relic of ill omen?

555
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,260
Let me go.

556
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,380
No relic of ill omen.

557
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,380
Let me go.

558
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:46,860
Bad people!

559
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,460
Bad people!

560
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,420
You're all bad people!

561
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,300
You all deserve to die!

562
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,980
You disturbed the God of Water.

563
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,460
Retribution.

564
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,100
There will be retribution.

565
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,340
There will be retribution.

566
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,140
Hey,

567
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,420
do you remember who I am?

568
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,020
Don't remember?

569
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,380
I'm Jiang Zhao.

570
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,220
From the Jiang family, Jiang Zhao?

571
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,180
Jiang Zhao.

572
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,180
You're Jiang Zhao?

573
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,900
Stop him! Put out the fire!

574
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,180
Hurry!

575
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,380
Keep basking in the moonlight?

576
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,220
It's on fire!

577
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,100
Put out the fire! Hurry!

578
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,060
Jiang Zhao, stop!

579
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,500
Hurry! Stop him!

580
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,820
What's this kid doing?

581
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,780
Hurry!

582
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,900
Stop! Put out the fire, quick!

583
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:02,580
Quick! Over here!

584
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,140
- This kid...
- Quick!

585
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,020
What's this kid doing?

586
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,740
Put out the fire!

587
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,060
Put out the fire!

588
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,060
Put out the fire!

589
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,060
Here!

590
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:18,780
Hurry!

591
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,260
You...

592
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,700
You little brat!

593
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,460
You little brat!

594
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:47,980
You set a fire!

595
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,780
A fire! Put it out!

596
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,100
Hurry, put it out!

597
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,220
Put out the fire!

598
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,580
Hurry, put out the fire!

599
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,740
Put out the fire! Now!

600
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,660
Tie him up.

601
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,220
I burned your clams. So what?

602
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,380
You murderer!

603
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,260
Thirteen-Thousand.

604
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,260
I burned your clams!

605
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,100
Wuzhu Village doesn't deserve
to find pearls!

606
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:05,860
Thirteen-Thousand.

607
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,620
Doesn't deserve!

608
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:07,740
That's right.

609
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,700
If you have any issues,

610
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:13,620
just treat me like this.

611
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,980
Why did you burn the clams?

612
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,980
It's retribution from the God of Water.

613
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:22,740
There are no more clams in our village.

614
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,900
Our village is ruined.

615
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,740
You ruined everything!

616
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,500
Why did you burn the clams?

617
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,060
The God of Water.

618
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,060
The God of Water was leaving.

619
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:44,740
I begged him.

620
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:47,380
I offered him gifts.

621
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:52,980
The God of Water.

622
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:53,740
Look at the video.

623
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,780
He said he'd negotiate.

624
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,940
Tell me that face is creepy or not?

625
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,460
I'll leave.

626
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,660
Turns out my uncle drove here.

627
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,100
But along the way,

628
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,340
we didn't see any cars.

629
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,220
Last time, I slipped

630
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,340
and scared off the old clam.

631
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,780
Once it dove back in,
it never came up again.

632
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,780
That's just how these things are.

633
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,260
They guard their home and don't move.

634
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,300
Let's dive in and clean them out.

635
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:20,940
Let's go.

636
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:23,900
Go.

637
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,820
This is the last video.

638
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,860
But it's from a few days ago.

639
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,820
There are two possibilities
why we didn't see the car.

640
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:39,980
The first one,

641
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,660
he'd already driven it away.

642
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,980
But all his personal stuff
is still here.

643
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,100
So, the second possibility is

644
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:50,940
the car is still
near the lake's deepest point.

645
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,500
You didn't see it

646
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:54,940
because that day,

647
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,180
you took a detour
to avoid the muddy area

648
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,740
and the lake's deepest point.

649
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,340
These things were probably
supposed to be in the car.

650
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,300
Could it be

651
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,700
that sir secretly took them out

652
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,220
while no one was around?

653
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,100
Then where did my uncle go?

654
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:10,820
Mu Dai,

655
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,860
do you remember the nightmare I had?

656
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,500
What if my uncle went into the water

657
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,460
and never came back up?

658
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,980
Let's not jump to conclusions.

659
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,060
Didn't your uncle call you

660
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,380
just a few days ago?

661
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,820
By the timeline,

662
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,740
he must have already gone
into the water by then.

663
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,220
Yes.

664
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,500
No.

665
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:28,980
But if he came back up,

666
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,340
why is his phone off now?

667
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,420
Don't overthink it.

668
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,660
We'll go check the lakeside tomorrow.

669
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,260
And what about him?

670
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,180
We can't keep him tied up forever.

671
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,420
Let's observe him overnight.

672
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,060
If nothing happens tomorrow,

673
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,180
we'll let him go.

674
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,100
Alright.

675
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,100
If Wuzhu Village

676
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,060
really lost all its pearls
because you burned the clams,

677
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:43,980
would you regret it?

678
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:47,700
That's what they deserve.

679
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,660
Why should I regret anything?

680
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,940
But only a few people were truly evil.

681
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,180
You took revenge

682
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,020
on the whole village.

683
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,140
Hit here!

684
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,180
Here, missed!

685
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,020
My turn!

686
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:16,900
Watch me.

687
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,060
Hey, let me have a turn!

688
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:18,660
See?

689
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,300
Jiang Zhao,

690
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:22,820
come have some yellow croaker.

691
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,260
Okay!

692
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:25,780
Wash your hands first.

693
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:27,900
How can you be like this?

694
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:29,700
Mrs. Jiang,

695
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,420
I made some yellow croaker for you.

696
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,580
Please try some!

697
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:33,860
Thank you so much!

698
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,540
Don't mind that kid.

699
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,420
I'll give him a good scolding later.

700
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,060
It's alright, kids are like that.

701
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,420
Thanks for all your help today!

702
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,460
Everyone, take a break.

703
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,180
Come on.

704
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:42,980
Take a break.

705
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:43,940
Mr. Jiang, take a break.

706
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:44,860
Everyone.

707
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,460
Take a break, have some water!

708
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,260
Come on.

709
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,300
Careful!

710
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,860
There's still yellow croaker to eat!

711
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,940
But only a few people were truly evil.

712
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,100
You took revenge

713
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:09,860
on the whole village.

714
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,860
I didn't want to.

715
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,300
I didn't want to.

716
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,180
What do these numbers mean?

717
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,660
They represent different areas
of the mudflats.

718
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:22,700
The higher the value,

719
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,540
the more solid the bedrock is.

720
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,180
This part is the lake center,

721
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,540
so it's all in red.

722
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,300
The surrounding area is a swamp,

723
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,980
with soft and wet soil,

724
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,180
so it's shown in orange-red.

725
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:33,860
Right.

726
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,860
Green areas mean
a Hummer can pass safely.

727
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,060
Blue to yellow,
those are more dangerous zones.

728
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,420
If it's orange-red,

729
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,660
even just a person's weight
could cause them to sink.

730
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,820
That's the spot where you and Hongsha
were in danger that day.

731
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,540
If my uncle was able to drive

732
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,420
that close to the lake's deepest point,

733
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,340
he must have been using a similar app.

734
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,420
If your uncle's car is still out there,

735
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,380
the best chance is in this green area.

736
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,660
I remember

737
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,460
this used to be a big lake.

738
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,540
When we were kids,

739
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,900
we used to fish and catch shrimp here
all the time.

740
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,900
Could it really be my fault?

741
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,180
Let's stop here.

742
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,060
Beyond this point is the danger zone.

743
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:25,460
Everyone out.

744
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,460
We'll split up and search.

745
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,300
Watch your step.

746
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,540
If you sense any danger,

747
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,380
take a prone position immediately.

748
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,100
Hongsha,

749
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,020
you stay here and keep watch.

750
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,220
If anything happens,

751
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,220
warn us right away.

752
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:46,740
Be careful.

753
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,460
Let's go.

754
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,700
Careful!
You're getting close to the orange zone!

755
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,100
Luo Ren.

756
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,180
Over here!

757
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,700
Could this be her uncle's car?

758
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:28,780
Luo Ren,

759
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:30,620
this car

760
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,420
didn't just sink in all at once, right?

761
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:32,940
Yeah.

762
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,380
It probably looked safe enough to park,

763
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,460
but the ground underneath was too soft.

764
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,900
Bit by bit, it sank in.

765
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,220
That's the scary thing about swamps.

766
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,340
Yeah, pretty scary.

767
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,140
There's even an old clam inside.

768
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,740
Don't worry so much.

769
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,140
Luo Ren just checked.

770
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,340
There's no one in the car.

771
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,540
Maybe your uncle

772
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,940
made it out on his own.

773
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,140
Come on, don't cry.

774
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,700
Try to think positive, okay?

775
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,180
Okay.

776
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,780
I see something over there.

777
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:06,820
Right there.

778
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:09,940
What is it?

779
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:10,900
Is it the old clam?

780
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:11,860
The old clam?

781
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,380
We're in the safe zone,

782
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,180
we should be fine, right?

783
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:15,780
I see it!

784
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,660
It's not coming toward us.

785
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,340
There's someone else out there?

786
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:20,420
Someone else?

787
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,500
Chubby.

788
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,020
Didn't want to include me, huh?

789
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:48,300
A little trick and here I am.

790
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:49,500
What?

791
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:52,260
Wasn't she supposed to be
at the interview with her senior?

792
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,460
How'd she end up in the swamp?

793
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,500
Exactly!

794
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:56,060
That's because she's always on the move,

795
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,500
and she lost her phone,

796
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,420
so she's out of touch.

797
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,980
Tried calling her,

798
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,700
but Luo Ren stopped me,

799
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,020
and said it wasn't a good time.

800
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,020
He's clearly hiding something.

801
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,860
If only someone could check for that.

802
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:07,420
Yes.

803
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,660
Quick, go now.

804
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,220
Hepu.

805
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,540
That's pretty far.

806
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,620
Speak of the devil!

807
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,660
Oh my poor helpless friends.

808
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,140
I'm coming!

809
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,180
Thirteen-Thousand, go faster!

810
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:49,100
Even my toenails are trying their best.

811
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,220
He got out of the car.

812
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,020
Chubby.

813
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,820
Watch your step!

814
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,340
Chubby, watch your step!

815
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:03,780
What's all the shouting?

816
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,740
Too excited!

817
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:06,900
Here!

818
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:16,780
Where's my car?

819
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,020
Chubby.

820
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:20,980
Can he hear me?

821
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,860
No way he can hear from this far.

822
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:24,820
Quick, use phone!

823
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:26,140
Call him?

824
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:26,700
Yeah.

825
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:27,820
Where's his number?

826
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,380
Look under "Cao" in contacts.

827
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,620
I think I came down from this side.

828
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,620
I can already see you guys!

829
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,260
What's up?

830
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:42,180
Hello? Cao.

831
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:43,180
I...

832
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,220
Cao, there's a clam under your feet.

833
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,700
A clam! You're standing on it!

834
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:49,780
What?

835
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:51,460
