00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:09,032
 

6
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,860
Stop crying! That's all you ever do!

7
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,860
Medicine and rope-jumping failed to rid me of you!

8
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,260
What are you crying about now?

9
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,900
You're driving me mad!

10
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,690
Mom.

11
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,140
Mom.

12
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,300
Mom, I'm hungry.

13
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,520
Are you a bottomless pit?

14
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,300
You just ate lunch!

15
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,180
But I'm still hungry.

16
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,420
Hungry, are you? Hungry, huh?

17
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,260
Look over there.

18
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,280
Stand over there.That'll cure your hunger.

19
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,340
Go now!

20
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,500
What a deadweight.

21
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,680
Tighten my pants.

22
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,100
Tighten my waist so I won't feel hungry.

23
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,180
Won't feel hungry.

24
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,500
But I'm still hungry.

25
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:42,479
 So you are Xiang Si Lan's daughter. 

26
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:45,440
 And your mom really finds you annoying. 

27
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,920
Get lost!

28
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,280
 My apologies. It's coming back to me now. 

29
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,540
 Luo Ren even paid good money to make Xiang Si Lan stop coming after you. 

30
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,780
 Pathetic. 

31
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,660
Shut your mouth!

32
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,940
 I'm showing concern for you. 

33
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,265
 You never wanted this life. 

34
00:03:05,265 --> 00:03:08,046
 Why won't you admit it? 

35
00:03:08,046 --> 00:03:12,609
 Just say the word, and I'll rewrite it for you. 

36
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,380
 Remember? 

37
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,080
 Your story can be rewritten as you wish. 

38
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,540
There's actually another little girl.

39
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,138
Would you like to see her?

40
00:03:30,138 --> 00:03:32,539
She's unwell. Resting now.

41
00:03:32,539 --> 00:03:35,080
It's okay. It depends on fate.

42
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,030
Maybe it's just not the right time yet.

43
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:42,498
Sweetheart, why are you out here?

44
00:03:42,498 --> 00:03:44,918
You're not even dressed properly.

45
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,740
 You really should learn from your younger self. 

46
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:01,560
 Opportunities have to be seized by yourself. 

47
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,440
Here's your chocolate, little bear.

48
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,620
Here's your chocolate.

49
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,660
If you won't eat it, I will.

50
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,240
Mu Dai.

51
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,540
Is it good?

52
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,220
Yes.

53
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,140
- We should go now.
- Where to?

54
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,340
I'm taking you to kindergarten.

55
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,620
- To kindergarten!
- Come on.

56
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,100
- Bye, little bear.
- Put on your backpack.

57
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:27,340
Mu Dai is the prettiest girl.

58
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,980
The prettiest!

59
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,160
Let's go.

60
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,560
Go.

61
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,440
What's wrong?

62
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:36,780
Don't eat too much candy.

63
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,885
You'll get cavities.

64
00:04:38,885 --> 00:04:44,320
 Look. One right choice can make life so beautiful. 

65
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,120
 You must seize the next opportunity. 

66
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,460
 Wen. 

67
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,265
Go to heck!

68
00:05:30,265 --> 00:05:33,825
Kill her! Kill her!

69
00:05:33,825 --> 00:05:36,220
 I know you often revisit this memory. 

70
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,195
 But no matter how much you dwell on it, 

71
00:05:38,195 --> 00:05:41,800
 you had already fallen back then. 

72
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,480
 It's all just imagination. 

73
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,300
 Now you see it clearly. 

74
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,040
 She was terrified. 

75
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,340
 She was so weak. 

76
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:58,280
 Yet she came back to save you. 

77
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,720
 If it weren't for you, she would still be alive. 

78
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,620
 Can you really bear to do nothing? 

79
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,820
 Won't you act? 

80
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,000
 She's dying. 

81
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,140
 If you don't do something now, she'll die. 

82
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,440
 She'll die. 

83
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,020
What is going on here?

84
00:06:31,298 --> 00:06:34,558
 That's more like it. 

85
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,300
 
 Let's go to the movies tomorrow night. 

86
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,960
 Meet me at our usual spot. 

87
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,720
 
 Sure. 

88
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,610
Mr. Zhang, you're busy?

89
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,100
Make a "Sunset Boulevard" cocktail.

90
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,620
The customer is waiting.

91
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,300
Get Thirteen-Thousand to do it.

92
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,420
Who's Thirteen-Thousand?

93
00:07:13,372 --> 00:07:16,313
Right. Who is Thirteen-Thousand?

94
00:07:16,313 --> 00:07:17,920
Whatever.

95
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,940
Madam Hong, are you going out?

96
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,360
Got some business in Wujiang.

97
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,640
Let me go instead.

98
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,400
Haven't you been feeling unwell?

99
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,980
Oh, you silly girl. You're not up to demanding tasks.

100
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,100
I can't trust you to go out alone.

101
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,800
You're underestimating me. I'm a disciple of Meihua Jiu Niang.

102
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,980
Who's Meihua Jiu Niang?

103
00:07:35,829 --> 00:07:37,509
Yeah.

104
00:07:38,654 --> 00:07:41,027
Who's Meihua Jiu Niang?

105
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:43,307
She is important.

106
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,480
It is really beautiful.

107
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,560
The scenery is so lovely.

108
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,340
Look over there.

109
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,320
- Let me take a photo of you.
- Sure.

110
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,945
You want to take a photo? I'll hold you.

111
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,040
I dare not look down.

112
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,880
Let's take a group photo.

113
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,540
Look.

114
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,740
There's someone important across the way.

115
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,600
Very important. Who was it again?

116
00:08:12,104 --> 00:08:14,045
Who was it?

117
00:08:14,045 --> 00:08:15,906
So pretty.

118
00:08:15,906 --> 00:08:17,566
Yeah.

119
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,820
Who was it?

120
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,440
This is where it all began.

121
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,760
Ren!

122
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,563
Save your breath.

123
00:09:02,563 --> 00:09:05,983
You won't meet them again.

124
00:09:05,983 --> 00:09:07,511
Who are you?

125
00:09:07,511 --> 00:09:09,472
I am you.

126
00:09:09,472 --> 00:09:10,793
Impossible.

127
00:09:10,793 --> 00:09:15,373
I take this cable car every day.

128
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,720
I've been waiting here for decades,

129
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:24,900
but I've never seen Chubby or Ren again.

130
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:30,760
They've chosen different lives.

131
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,460
Our paths no longer cross,

132
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,780
and we'll never meet again.

133
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,620
I don't believe it.

134
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,720
Why bother?

135
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:50,680
You have a happy life now.

136
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,080
Would you really give that up?

137
00:09:54,676 --> 00:09:57,963
They've already abandoned you.

138
00:09:57,963 --> 00:10:00,563
You should forget them too.

139
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,420
Lady Dai.

140
00:10:06,478 --> 00:10:07,620
Master.

141
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,365
Mu Dai.

142
00:10:10,022 --> 00:10:12,091
Kill all demonic blocks.

143
00:10:12,091 --> 00:10:13,991
Let's go take our chances.

144
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,960
I have to find them.

145
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,220
They're the most important people to me.

146
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,980
I can't forget them.

147
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,720
Willpower paves the way.

148
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,621
Ren, Hong Sha, Chubby, Thirteen-Thousand,

149
00:11:12,621 --> 00:11:15,021
I will find you all.

150
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,400
Luo Ren!

151
00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:40,397
Hong Sha!

152
00:11:40,397 --> 00:11:42,417
Thirteen-Thousand!

153
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,980
Chubby!

154
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,140
I didn't expect you to break free so soon.

155
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,000
But then again, it's not surprising.

156
00:12:03,729 --> 00:12:05,350
Among the five of you,

157
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,451
you weren't the one with the heaviest burdens.

158
00:12:07,451 --> 00:12:08,872
Where is this place?

159
00:12:08,872 --> 00:12:10,916
Familiar, isn't it?

160
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:13,141
Doesn't it resemble the Guansi Memorial Archway?

161
00:12:13,141 --> 00:12:15,389
I call it

162
00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:17,092
Guansi Mirage.

163
00:12:17,092 --> 00:12:22,952
Just like a mirage, it's an illusion, a fantasy.

164
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,260
If it weren't for the desires lurking in the hearts of you humans,

165
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:32,780
the illusion wouldn't exist.

166
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,245
The illusion is just the demon in your heart.

167
00:12:35,245 --> 00:12:37,166
Kill all demonic blocks.
I'll just go take my chances.

168
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,566
Just go take your chances?

169
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,500
Then how did Meihua Yi Zhao and the others die?

170
00:12:46,373 --> 00:12:48,453
They entered the illusion?

171
00:12:51,134 --> 00:12:53,414
My battle with Bo Yang Zi

172
00:12:54,402 --> 00:12:56,223
left me gravely weakened.

173
00:12:56,223 --> 00:12:59,039
For centuries,

174
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:02,964
I've failed to regain enough energy to restart the illusion.

175
00:13:02,964 --> 00:13:06,200
But 280 years ago, I thought I could manage.

176
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:10,120
As they were sealing the relics of ill omen,

177
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,240
I exerted all my power to pry it open.

178
00:13:13,946 --> 00:13:15,706
Yet,

179
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,300
I still failed.

180
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,214
The illusion developed flaws.

181
00:13:22,214 --> 00:13:23,415
Flaws?

182
00:13:23,415 --> 00:13:24,616
Yes.

183
00:13:24,616 --> 00:13:28,028
What you'd now call "bugs".

184
00:13:28,028 --> 00:13:32,960
Occasionally, they'd return to reality.

185
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,340
Return to reality?

186
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,820
Then why did they take their own lives?

187
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,826
They didn't want you
to extract the connectors, right?

188
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,947
We were wrong from the start.

189
00:13:47,947 --> 00:13:50,080
They weren't performing a death ritual.

190
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,660
The connectors exist within the mind,
tied to consciousness.

191
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,540
And consciousness is dependent on the body.

192
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:57,060
Destroy the body, and consciousness vanishes.

193
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,580
So does the connector.

194
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,151
I get it now.

195
00:14:01,151 --> 00:14:04,032
In your world, we exist as consciousness.

196
00:14:04,032 --> 00:14:06,693
Consciousness is built from choices.

197
00:14:06,693 --> 00:14:08,420
Once choices deviate,

198
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,640
the original self begins to dissolve.

199
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,380
The more it dissolves,

200
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,320
the easier it is to extract the connectors, right?

201
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,252
Rewrite the story?

202
00:14:16,252 --> 00:14:19,197
Your so-called ritual is just
to make us lose ourselves

203
00:14:19,197 --> 00:14:20,792
and dissolve in the illusion, isn't it?

204
00:14:20,792 --> 00:14:23,273
So what if it is?

205
00:14:23,273 --> 00:14:25,894
Life is but a dream.

206
00:14:25,894 --> 00:14:27,765
A dream.

207
00:14:27,765 --> 00:14:31,000
Just like the illusion.

208
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,940
I offered them the lives they desired.

209
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,500
They could have had anything,
yet they chose to die.

210
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,860
Lunatics, all of them!

211
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,300
They ruined everything...

212
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,380
For me.

213
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,422
That's because you don't understand.

214
00:14:47,422 --> 00:14:49,000
You don't know what it means to be human.

215
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,389
You seem wise.

216
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:56,070
But you won't be as lucky as Meihua Yi Zhao.

217
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,754
This illusion

218
00:14:58,754 --> 00:15:01,919
is flawless and impregnable.

219
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:03,720
But I managed to escape.

220
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,201
Yes, you did escape.

221
00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:08,362
But this is as far as you go.

222
00:15:08,362 --> 00:15:12,619
Time and space here are frozen.

223
00:15:12,619 --> 00:15:15,881
Your friends are already gone.

224
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:17,895
And you?

225
00:15:17,895 --> 00:15:21,847
You'll wander here forever,

226
00:15:21,847 --> 00:15:24,108
eternally alone.

227
00:15:24,108 --> 00:15:25,589
Why not go back?

228
00:15:25,589 --> 00:15:28,468
Return to your happy past.

229
00:15:28,468 --> 00:15:31,337
That passage is always open to you.

230
00:15:31,337 --> 00:15:33,618
My friends may be lost for now,

231
00:15:33,618 --> 00:15:35,659
but they won't stay that way forever.

232
00:15:35,659 --> 00:15:37,800
I'll drag them back if I have to.

233
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,820
Just you?

234
00:15:40,409 --> 00:15:42,700
Don't waste your effort.

235
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,380
You can't interfere with the fate of others.

236
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,177
Kill all demonic blocks.

237
00:15:48,177 --> 00:15:50,457
I don't fear taking my chances again!

238
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,240
I know you're close, but this is ridiculous.

239
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,300
Are you trying to merge into one?

240
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,020
Merge?

241
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,260
Seven-Star Unity?

242
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,980
Will you guys merge into one too?

243
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,680
Oh no, my gosh.

244
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,280
I'm a dead man today.

245
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,480
And there's no one to lend a hand!

246
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,440
Free Cao!

247
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,040
Aren't you a descendant of the phoenix?

248
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,600
Unleash your ultimate move!

249
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,940
Don't push me.

250
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,800
Don't push me! Don't!

251
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,360
This isn't an illusion for me.

252
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,620
The illusion is rejecting me.

253
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,720
Do you like it?

254
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,784
Yes.

255
00:17:27,784 --> 00:17:29,640
Luo Ren!

256
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,120
We won!

257
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,420
Yes!

258
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:37,220
- Cheers.
- Tasha, pour us a drink.

259
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,320
Who said you could order Tasha around?

260
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:46,160
I took down Leopard
and risked my life to save Tasha.

261
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,100
- Can't I ask her for a little help? 
 - Come on, Tasha.

262
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,300
- You're being so stingy. 
 - Have an arm-wrestling match with Yuris.

263
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,940
- Come on.
- Tasha.

264
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,200
Luo Ren!

265
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,860
Tasha.

266
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,340
- Tasha!
- Tasha!

267
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,916
- Tasha!
- Tasha!

268
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:05,891
- Tasha!
- Tasha!

269
00:18:05,891 --> 00:18:09,660
- Tasha!
- Tasha!

270
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,577
- Tasha!
- Tasha!

271
00:18:15,577 --> 00:18:20,118
- Tasha!
- Tasha!

272
00:18:20,118 --> 00:18:21,935
- Tasha!
- Tasha!

273
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:24,143
- Ren. 
 - Tasha!

274
00:18:24,143 --> 00:18:28,620
I don't think I've ever seen you this happy in all the time I've known you.

275
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:32,860
I know brotherhood is your heaviest burden.

276
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:35,760
But everything here isn't real.

277
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,820
Luo, I always feel like

278
00:18:48,446 --> 00:18:52,806
you should find Tasha a godmother.

279
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,480
Here we go again.

280
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,200
Ren.

281
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,760
What's wrong?

282
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,320
Nothing. I think I heard
someones call me Ren just now.

283
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,720
Are you insane?

284
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:14,945
Ren? Wasn't that
what your cousin Ping Ting called you?

285
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,200
I have no idea.

286
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,030
But it feels like someone else called me that too.

287
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,840
It doesn't matter.

288
00:19:25,367 --> 00:19:26,460
I understand now.

289
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,600
The illusion can be influenced.

290
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,720
The more he remembers reality,

291
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,360
the more unstable the illusion becomes.

292
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,260
And that's when I'll have a chance.

293
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,992
Dad, help me!

294
00:19:35,992 --> 00:19:37,340
Be gentle with her.

295
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,620
Don't hurt her.

296
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:43,420
Ren, do you remember Hong Sha, Chubby, and Thirteen-Thousand?

297
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,700
And Destiny Bar?

298
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,840
And... And Phoenix Pavilion.

299
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,240
Mu Dai.

300
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,020
Mu Dai?

301
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,560
Who's that?

302
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,360
Dad, help me!

303
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,160
Yuris,

304
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:13,620
though none of this is real,

305
00:21:15,881 --> 00:21:18,281
getting to see you all again...

306
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,440
It made me so happy.

307
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,000
We've been here all along.

308
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,800
I thought you'd never come back.

309
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:28,110
Master! Luo!

310
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,520
Don't leave me out. I'm joining you!

311
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,000
You...

312
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,040
Hey, you... I just saw Zhang Guang Hua.

313
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:43,160
He kept rambling about choices, rituals,
this and that.

314
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,680
Basically just sugarcoated lies.

315
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:48,180
He tried to tempt us with a little sweetness to make us lose ourselves.

316
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,320
But I held on.

317
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,560
Not sure how Hong Sha
and Thirteen-Thousand are doing.

318
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:55,960
You all carry too much
burden and too many regrets.

319
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,580
That makes you easy prey.

320
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,780
Not like me.

321
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,200
I'm easygoing and carefree.

322
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,980
Never faced real hardship.

323
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,120
Life's always been on easy mode for me.

324
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:08,080
I'm most worried about Thirteen-Thousand now.

325
00:23:08,973 --> 00:23:11,140
He probably has the heaviest burdens.

326
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,800
Hong Sha should be fine though.

327
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,480
Back in Cao Village,
she was the most level-headed.

328
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,400
No idea why she hasn't broken free yet.

329
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,400
Stop analyzing. Let's go find them.

330
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,840
Let's go.

331
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,680
 Zhao, you must have a lot of socializing to do
at the art exhibition. 

332
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,408
 Is it okay for you to keep chatting with us? 

333
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,909
Don't worry, Mom.

334
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,389
I am the star now.

335
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,240
 
 They'll wait for me. 

336
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,240
 Who'd have thought you from Wuzhu Village would become a famous artist? 

337
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,860
Oh, Chief just called, saying there's a huge pearl harvest this year.

338
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,520
He wants you to paint something

339
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,300
 to bring honor to our village. 

340
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,520
Sure, no problem.

341
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,960
Mr. Jiang, the press is here.

342
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,480
They're waiting for you.

343
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,260
 Alright. 

344
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,120
Let the boy go in now.

345
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,820
Don't want people
to say we're putting on airs.

346
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,120
That's right.

347
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,280
We'll hang up now.

348
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,660
Alright, Mom.

349
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,600
I'll call you again.

350
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,080
 Bye. 

351
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,838
- Mr. Jiang Zhao.
- Mr. Jiang Zhao.

352
00:24:16,838 --> 00:24:17,920
- Smile, please.
- Look this way.

353
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,120
We heard you have unpublished works.
When will we get to see them?

354
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,500
Mr. Jiang Zhao, we know you're currently single.

355
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,120
As the most eligible bachelor right now,

356
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,680
what do you look for in a partner?

357
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:29,240
Mr. Jiang Zhao, the theme
of the paintings is "Pearl". Why is that?

358
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,301
The inspiration comes from my hometown.

359
00:24:32,301 --> 00:24:33,539
- It's a small village.
- Thirteen-Thousand!

360
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:35,340
- It relies on pearl fishing.
- Thirteen-Thousand!

361
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:40,780
No matter where I am, it remains
my idyllic retreat and my guiding light.

362
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:44,040
Mr. Jiang Zhao, you mentioned
that you'd create works closer to life.

363
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,200
But we haven't seen any yet.

364
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,900
- When will we get to see them?
- Thirteen-Thousand.

365
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,340
Thirteen-Thousand!

366
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,900
It's me!

367
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,400
Mr. Jiang Zhao.

368
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,160
Right.

369
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,000
No idea.

370
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,720
- Mr. Jiang Zhao.
- Mr. Jiang Zhao.

371
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,780
- Please answer the question.
- Yes, please answer, Mr. Jiang Zhao.

372
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:04,000
- Over here.
- Over here.

373
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,080
Mr. Jiang Zhao.

374
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,480
- Mr. Jiang Zhao!
- Mr. Jiang Zhao!

375
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,740
Please answer our questions, Mr. Jiang.

376
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,420
- Mr. Jiang Zhao!
- Mr. Jiang Zhao.

377
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,540
Art knows no bounds.

378
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,380
Observe the world outwardly.

379
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,820
Listen to yourself inwardly.

380
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:25,780
Seriously? Flirting at a time like this?

381
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:28,380
Some habits never die.

382
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,920
Hong Sha!

383
00:25:31,094 --> 00:25:32,874
You're here.

384
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:36,859
What do we do? He's still trapped.

385
00:25:36,859 --> 00:25:38,820
Seems you have quite the artistic insight.

386
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:43,765
The highest level of understanding an artist is when you're looking at the painting,

387
00:25:43,765 --> 00:25:46,160
I'm looking at you.

388
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,840
Unbelievable!

389
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,000
- Your standards for a girlfriend must be strict.
- You're the last one left!

390
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,280
You hopeless idiot! Wake up.

391
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,880
- What I care about is the soul.
- Wake up!

392
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:58,060
Then would I be your type?

393
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,800
No!

394
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,280
Let go!

395
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,380
Well, that depends on...

396
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:12,340
- Turn your face away.
- What your soul looks like?

397
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,560
Thirteen-Thousand!

398
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,260
You hopeless idiot!

399
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,780
With all the dreams you could get lost in, you're indulging in this art nonsense?

400
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,080
You know how amazing my dream was?

401
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,400
And I still walked away.

402
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,340
What's so special about this dump
that you can't wake up?

403
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,040
Wake up!

404
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,920
Master, I can't wake him up. What now?

405
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,040
We need to come up with a solution.

406
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,420
Thirteen-Thousand!

407
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:09,660
 ♫ In the deepest night, longing takes shape ♫ 

408
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:16,400
 ♫ Warm memories slowly embrace you tight ♫ 

409
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:23,260
 ♫ The path of growth is inevitably lonely ♫ 

410
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:29,220
 ♫ But someone will shine on you like the stars ♫ 

411
00:27:30,288 --> 00:27:37,820
 ♫ Though fate may be muddy, through the storm ♫ 

412
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,300
Thirteen-Thousand.

413
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,600
Fiery?

414
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,920
What are you guys doing here?

415
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,340
What's going on?

416
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,240
Oh no. He's trying to take us all down with him!

417
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,665
Hold on tight! Don't get separated!

418
00:27:57,665 --> 00:27:59,466
Right. If we die, we die together!

419
00:27:59,466 --> 00:28:01,286
We won't be lonely!

420
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:37,680
I worry whether you stay still or move around.

421
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,480
When will this end?

422
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,320
Just lie still, alright?

423
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,280
Don't catch a cold.

424
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:52,400
Don't suffocate yourself.

425
00:29:14,674 --> 00:29:16,155
Free Cao.

426
00:29:16,155 --> 00:29:17,995
Free, come here.

427
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,960
You're my little heater.

428
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,080
Without you, I'd have frozen to death by now.

429
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,800
Thank you.

430
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:51,198
Free, did you ask
all your siblings from the mountains to come here?

431
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,020
Now we're all saved.

432
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:00,200
Otherwise, we'd be frozen to death.

433
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,141
Last night's snowstorm felt like the apocalypse.

434
00:30:03,141 --> 00:30:06,381
Yet it just stopped this morning.

435
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,880
Mr. Luo!

436
00:30:18,238 --> 00:30:20,310
Mr. Luo!

437
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,930
Mr...

438
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,980
Mr. Luo!

439
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,380
In all my years,

440
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:43,781
I've never seen the spectacle of pheasants saving people.

441
00:30:43,781 --> 00:30:46,601
It's the first time for me too.

442
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,620
Little heater, thank you.

443
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:58,340
If it weren't for you and your siblings
crowding our tent last night,

444
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:02,020
all six of us would've turned into icicles.

445
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,385
I used to love eating chicken.

446
00:31:04,385 --> 00:31:09,586
From now on, I'm quitting.

447
00:31:09,586 --> 00:31:11,266
I'll quit.

448
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,720

Comfy lying there, huh?

455
00:31:50,281 --> 00:31:51,420

You really know how to ruin the mood.

457

Be careful. Careful.

Watch it.

00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,276

Tell me what's on your mind.

498

 CHANNEL MANAGER
dimghro 

502
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:17,995
Yeah. Accusatory.

503
00:35:17,995 --> 00:35:19,580
You scared me.

504
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,140
But that doesn't make sense.

505
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,980
I haven't done anything to it lately.

506
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:26,342
I haven't eaten chicken either.

507
00:35:26,342 --> 00:35:28,560
Don't say such gloomy... Hey, he said it.

508
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:33,241
You must've promised it something but didn't keep your word.

509
00:35:33,241 --> 00:35:34,921
Promised?

510
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,420
The plaque! Free made a great contribution.

511
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,580
I promised it an honorary plaque.

512
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,665
So that's it.

513
00:35:42,665 --> 00:35:45,360
Free, good boy. Come on.

514
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,760
Let's go get that plaque.

515
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,280
We're getting you a plaque.

516
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,200
That's my chicken.

517
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,640
If anyone's getting it a plaque, it's me.

518
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,960
 

519
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,960
 

520
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,620
A great chicken, Thirteen-Thousand...

521
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:08,180
How did you punctuate that?

522
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:14,465
Cao Yan Hua's chicken.

523
00:36:14,465 --> 00:36:15,905
Mine.

524
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:23,721
Look at Free's scrawny little neck.

525
00:36:23,721 --> 00:36:26,740
It's bent under the weight of the plaques.

526
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,360
It's called muscle training.

527
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,400
That's cruel.

528
00:36:31,816 --> 00:36:34,580
 

529
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,480
Come on, Mr. Kun.

530
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,120
You give us something new,
but then you take back the old stuff?

531
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,960
You're way too stingy.

532
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,600
What do you know?

533
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,440
Don't break it.

534
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,700
Let me show you the difference between knockoffs and the real deal.

535
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:56,140
Now comes the moment everyone's been waiting for.

536
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,228
This is the... Exactly.

537
00:37:02,228 --> 00:37:03,840
Like I always said.

538
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:08,040
The torrential floods at Fengzi Ridge would wash the Feng-Huang-Luan Buckles downstream,

539
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,580
straight to collectors.

540
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:12,780
And sure enough, didn't it?

541
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:17,760
When I saw the real thing, I was over the moon.

542
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,200
I had them authenticated by experts.

543
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,180
Definitely meteoric iron.

544
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:24,380
And they're ancient.

545
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:29,260
It takes me back to my days
in Wujiang, living in constant fear.

546
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:32,020
Now I can say I am a world-saving hero.

547
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,780
No one asks where heroes come from.

548
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,640
You never know.

549
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,600
Wait a minute, Mr. Kun.

550
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,620
Aren't there only three Feng-Huang-Luan Buckles?

551
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,828
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

552
00:37:44,828 --> 00:37:45,880
But there are five of you.

553
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:49,120
You'd compete fiercely for these three.

554
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:52,071
So I had them reforged.

555
00:37:52,071 --> 00:37:53,680
Now that we have the Feng-Huang-Luan Buckles,

556
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,820
is there any news about the Imperishable Wood?

557
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:58,880
The Imperishable Wood is just wood.

558
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,800
Not a collector's item.

559
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,620
And it's hard to preserve.

560
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:07,000
Besides, you're sealing them with your bodies.

561
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,880
The Feng-Huang-Luan Buckles are enough.

562
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,400
That much meteoric iron, and you only made five bracelets?

563
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,260
And they're so thin?

564
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,960
Did you make six?

565
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,740
You doubt me?

566
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,440
- You doubt me...
- Hand it over!

567
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,340
You're morally corrupt.

568
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,800
- Stop running!
- You doubt me?

569
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,220
- Hand it over!
- You're underestimating me.

570
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,040
He doesn't want it? Is it mine now?

571
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:35,200
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

572
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:40,160
Cheers.

573
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,420
So heavy.

574
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:46,100
Let me throw out a question
to spark some discussion.

575
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,700
Today's crispy pork is exceptional.

576
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,920
Crunchy outside, tender inside.

577
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,960
Eat up, Mr. Kun.

578
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,612
Dig in, everyone. Have some.

579
00:38:52,612 --> 00:38:54,185
Alright, I will.

580
00:38:54,185 --> 00:38:55,240
Here, have some.

581
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,940
Here's my question.

582
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:02,240
Well, you see, your bodies contain connectors to the relics of ill omen.

583
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,600
Logically, you and the relics of ill omen should be mutually attracted.

584
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:09,295
But on the contrary, your blood can suppress them.

585
00:39:09,295 --> 00:39:11,640
Why is that? Have you ever wondered why?

586
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,940
- Nope.
- Which is why you need me.

587
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:18,340
All this time, I've been pondering this.

588
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:21,640
I believe our consciousness might very well belong

589
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:25,440
to a fourth dimension
beyond current human understanding.

590
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,640
In that space, as carbon-based beings,

591
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:32,520
we humans have already transformed
into energy entities.

592
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,940
Now, genes, as a substance
from a higher dimension,

593
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:37,560
undergo changes when they encounter us, humans.

594
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,840
- These changes are primarily manifested in...
- Look.

595
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,520
They can store information and can be inherited.

596
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,980
- I'm feeling so lost listening to this.
- Me too.

597
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:48,920
In this context, it's also called instinct.

598
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,800
Genius. That's spot on.

599
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,940
No one else could unravel such profound truths.

600
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,920
- Well...
- Yeah, brilliantly put.

601
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,640
The connector exists in the deepest part

602
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:03,260
of our consciousness.

603
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,600
The connector...

604
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,600
The relics of ill omen are inside you now.

605
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,420
Coupled with the Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle,
do you think this could become...?

606
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:11,340
We've settled this matter, right?

607
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,820
And now we've got the Feng-Huang-Luan Buckles.

608
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:17,740
Should we plan a team-building celebration?

609
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,140
That's a good idea.

610
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,500
So where do we start?

611
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,364
Let's go back to where we started.

612
00:40:22,364 --> 00:40:24,340
- How about Wujiang?
- Perfect.

613
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,420
I've never been to Wujiang.

614
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:27,320
- That's our base.
- Great chance to visit.

615
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,680
Say my name. I've got connections.

616
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,140
You've never been there. Great chance to visit.

617
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:33,560
If someone can cover for me
with Mr. Zhang, I'm in too.

618
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,680
Suppress them.

619
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,880
- You're not coming.
- I'll cover for you.

620
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,600
You can have my pay.

621
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,700
Where did you get the money?

622
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,520
Are you guys excluding me?

623
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,800
I'm in charge of the money.

624
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:46,320
In this vast world,
it's rare to find kindred spirits.

625
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,900
Mr. Kun.

626
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,300
Let's take a group photo.

627
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,040
The last group photo was creepy.

628
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,940
- This time, let's make it cheerful.
- Here we go.

629
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,940
- Move away.
- Hurry. Ten-second countdown.

630
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:56,580
I'm so popular.

631
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,100
- Put it on.
- You're holding her. Who do I hold?

632
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:01,120
Take it out.

633
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,294

 ♫ Following the traces left behind ♫ 

664
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,780
 ♫ If you were me ♫ 

665
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:54,740
 ♫ You'd understand every tear of mine ♫ 

666
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,200
 ♫ The reason they fall ♫ 

667
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,740
 ♫ If I were you ♫ 

668
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:05,680
 ♫ I'd feel each breath you take ♫ 

669
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,320
 ♫ Then we'd move forward ♫ 

670
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:12,600
 ♫ The sky splits the dawn's horizon ♫ 

671
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:16,916
 ♫ Telling me the end ♫ 

672
00:43:16,916 --> 00:43:21,180
 ♫ Is about to gently appear ♫ 

673
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:28,180
 ♫ Like a whisper in my mind ♫  ♫ A fleeting touch across my face ♫ 

674
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,600
 ♫ And I remain in darkness ♫ 

675
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:35,910
 ♫ The sky splits the dawn's horizon ♫ 

676

 ♫ Telling me the end ♫ 

677
