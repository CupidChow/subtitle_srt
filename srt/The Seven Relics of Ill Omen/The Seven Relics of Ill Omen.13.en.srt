00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,580
This way, please.

8
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,540
The murals here

9
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,780
feature vibrant colors and bold designs,

10
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:23,980
depicting

11
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,820
an ancient legend

12
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,780
of Lengquan Town.

13
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,300
It's said

14
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,140
that in primordial times,
demons descended

15
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,460
to plague mankind.

16
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,820
Once corrupted by these demons,

17
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,220
a person was doomed,

18
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,540
driven to madness,

19
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,540
spreading harm wherever they went.

20
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:45,900
Yet

21
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,580
righteousness has always
triumphed over evil.

22
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,580
Bo Yangzi, the Great Virtuous One,

23
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:55,540
enraged by these atrocities,

24
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,940
took up his scrolls

25
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,700
and waged war against the demons.

26
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,420
Sorry.

27
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,620
Ancient scrolls

28
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,860
were

29
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,500
made of wooden slips, right?

30
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,460
Yes, exactly.

31
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,100
Moved by Bo Yangzi's struggle,

32
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,860
the heavens intervened.

33
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,780
Amidst storm and thunder,

34
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,860
three divine birds,
Feng, Huang, and Luan,

35
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,940
descended to the human world.

36
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,620
They sacrificed themselves,

37
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,660
transforming into a clasp

38
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,820
that sealed the scrolls,

39
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:40,060
imprisoning the demons for eternity.

40
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,740
Sounds so convincing, huh.

41
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,420
- Well, it's mythology.
- Right?

42
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,140
Let's go.

43
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:45,620
Go.

44
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,420
Hey, don't go.

45
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,340
Guys,

46
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,580
come back.

47
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,780
Take a look at this.

48
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,260
Feng, Huang and Luan designs

49
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,420
are our original artistic creations.

50
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,100
They're recognized
as intangible cultural heritage...

51
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,500
Do they qualify?

52
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,660
Well, they're about to be.

53
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,260
Such a smooth talker.

54
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,380
Take one home.

55
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,380
These

56
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,980
ward off evil, bring peace,

57
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,620
and strengthen bonds
of love and friendship.

58
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,820
Perfect gifts for elders and children...

59
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,380
Are they free?

60
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,180
Scan to pay.

61
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,500
Scan and take the blessings home,
alright?

62
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,940
Never mind if it costs money.

63
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:23,860
Well...

64
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,340
Take one.

65
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,700
I'll take five.

66
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:36,180
That savage's been gone so long.

67
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,260
You actually want her to come back
and roast us?

68
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,180
Look,

69
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,220
vengeance has its proper target.

70
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,860
Yan's the one who pissed her off.

71
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,060
We've got nothing to do with it.

72
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,420
Besides, she's been nice to us.

73
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,660
She didn't harm us.

74
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,140
She even gave us food.

75
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,980
It's actually kind of

76
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,380
friendly.

77
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,820
Friendly?

78
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,060
Seriously?

79
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,460
If we fight, we're done for.

80
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,980
Our only options are endurance

81
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,220
and being friendly.

82
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:12,780
Thirteen,

83
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,700
I'm in awe.

84
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,580
You seriously considering
marrying into her tribe?

85
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,420
Don't jinx it.

86
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,740
If I go down, you're coming with me.

87
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,980
She's back.

88
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,140
Remember,

89
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,540
be friendly.

90
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:35,820
She's here.

91
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:36,980
She's back.

92
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,180
Why are you just standing there?

93
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,300
Show friendliness.

94
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,940
What are you doing?

95
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,260
Offering my sincerest friendliness.

96
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:46,940
You go.

97
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:47,420
You...

98
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,740
Well, Mrs. Thirteen.

99
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:44,740
Cao.

100
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,180
How's it going?

101
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:46,940
Don't stop.

102
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,420
It's working.

103
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,900
She seems into it.

104
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,500
Really?

105
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,620
She's actually
a young artistic female...

106
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,540
savage.

107
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:02,820
Look,

108
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,020
her leg's injured.

109
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,780
Probably Luo's doing.

110
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,700
Don't panic.

111
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,740
She's demanding the next chapter.

112
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:20,860
Serializing the story!

113
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,340
Yeah, yeah, got it.

114
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,860
You think I understand her?

115
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,540
Nope.

116
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,260
She probably means
Luo Ren and the others fled.

117
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,580
Thirteen,

118
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:27,660
wow,

119
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,740
you're a genius.

120
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,700
Extracting intel

121
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,700
without a shared language.

122
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,740
You two have common interests.

123
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,900
She's sharp.

124
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:39,820
You'd make a good match.

125
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,500
You marry her, then.

126
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,100
Who does this picture depict?

127
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,660
My master? Or Hongsha?

128
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,260
Is that Hongsha or Mu Dai

129
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,020
hanging there?

130
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,500
No, no.

131
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:44,660
No way.

132
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,420
Look closer. See there?

133
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,820
There's a well.

134
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,580
I think it must be

135
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,460
the woman Yan mentioned from back then.

136
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,180
Hongsha,

137
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,300
do you have any close relatives left?

138
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,340
I'm completely alone now.

139
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,020
I'll tell you a secret.

140
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,540
My mother abandoned me

141
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,380
when I was little.

142
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,580
I don't even know who my father was.

143
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,260
But look at me now,

144
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,700
I'm still living just fine.

145
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,340
You poor thing.

146
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,740
After we get back,

147
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,820
you could rent out the mansion.

148
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,620
And if you'd like,

149
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,660
you could come and live with us in Lixi.

150
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,780
It's lively with everyone together.

151
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,740
Really?

152
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,220
But we still haven't found
Thirteen-Thousand and Cao Yanhua.

153
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,140
Don't worry.

154
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,060
We will find them.

155
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,580
Once we're back,

156
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,260
we'll take care of Phoenix Pavilion.

157
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,500
We can't manage
without any one of us five.

158
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,420
Oh,

159
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,900
lend me your dagger for a bit.

160
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,300
I need to carve more throwing darts.

161
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,300
I forgot to tell you.

162
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:00,980
I used the dagger

163
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,300
against that woman today.

164
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,660
So I left it there.

165
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,820
But don't worry.

166
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,780
I'll get it back.

167
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,060
Believe me.

168
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,660
After all, it was a gift from you.

169
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,340
Cao,

170
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,140
I'm not trying to criticize.

171
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,980
But you wrote it so tiny.

172
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,580
How is anyone supposed to see that?

173
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,580
Well, it's still a glimmer of hope.

174
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,940
When I was a kid, I once found

175
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,580
a message in a bottle at the beach.

176
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,740
The sea's huge

177
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,700
while the bottle is tiny,

178
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,020
yet I still found it.

179
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,380
What did it say inside?

180
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,460
Whoever...

181
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,980
Whoever finds this is an idi...

182
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,020
Just some curse words.

183
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,700
Let's hope Luo Ren and the others
come to rescue us soon.

184
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,540
From what I've observed,

185
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,340
the savage and the woman
each have lairs.

186
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,500
Thirteen-Thousand and Cao Yanhua

187
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,860
are probably with the savage.

188
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,860
Our plan today is to head
into the underground cave,

189
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,060
subdue that woman,

190
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,260
and force the savage to bring
Thirteen-Thousand and Cao Yanhua to us.

191
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,820
That woman was spooked yesterday.

192
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,900
Could she have already fled

193
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,780
and not been in the cave?

194
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,020
I was the one
who fled in panic yesterday.

195
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,100
That woman wouldn't abandon her lair

196
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,020
over this.

197
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,420
We need strategies
and division of labor.

198
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,180
The wind's in our favor today.

199
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,300
Perfect for a fire attack.

200
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,300
Hongsha, you take point. Smoke her out.

201
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,060
If she sees only you,

202
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,100
she'll likely underestimate the threat

203
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,180
and come out to attack.

204
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,580
I'll stay hidden,
wait for her to come out,

205
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,180
then cut off her retreat with you.

206
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:00,780
Mu Dai, you're light on your feet.

207
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,820
Take the high ground as a backup.

208
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,100
What's going on?

209
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,540
Why is there smoke?

210
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,340
No one's here.

211
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:34,980
Luo Ren.

212
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,060
She doesn't seem to be here at all.

213
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,540
Or

214
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,380
she simply isn't afraid of smoke.

215
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,380
She's probably holed up deep inside.

216
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,540
Let's go in and check.

217
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,220
You two scout ahead in the cave.

218
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,260
I'll guard the entrance

219
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,900
in case the savage raids.

220
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,100
Mu Dai,

221
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,220
Mu Dai, if anything happens,

222
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,260
just blow the whistle.

223
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,660
Did you hear that?

224
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,060
What do we do? Signal Luo Ren?

225
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,700
No need to bother him over this.

226
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,180
Strike first.

227
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:20,740
I'll lead the attack.

228
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:21,700
You light the way.

229
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,980
She seems weakened by the smoke.

230
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:27,820
Now's our chance!

231
00:15:59,220 --> 00:15:59,940
Where's my dagger?

232
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,820
Right here. I got it back.

233
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,180
Here.

234
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,460
Yes.

235
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,020
Glad you found it.

236
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,020
What's this?

237
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,460
Seems the Sunny Doll we saw earlier

238
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,220
must've been made by her.

239
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,700
She was making figurines
of the savage and herself, right?

240
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,940
With such crude materials,
she still managed this.

241
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,820
Her needlework
must've been skilled once.

242
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,100
Cover your ears.

243
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,500
Is she calling the savage?

244
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:46,580
Yes.

245
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,820
It's their unique way of communicating.

246
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,860
She went that way.

247
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,340
You're right.

248
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,540
I get it now.

249
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,180
The villagers

250
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:13,020
organized hunters to rescue us.

251
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:13,940
They were just cooking over a fire.

252
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,580
But cooking fires don't produce
that much smoke.

253
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,700
- It's Luo Ren?
- It's Luo Ren?

254
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,180
Luo Ren's coming to rescue us!

255
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,580
No movement here yet.

256
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,660
Haven't spotted the savage.

257
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,140
I don't know what you're saying.

258
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,020
But you were once human.

259
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,620
You should understand me.

260
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,420
We've lost two friends in the mountains.

261
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,700
If the savage brings them back,

262
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,420
we'll let you go.

263
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,220
Should we light a fire

264
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,180
to signal back?

265
00:17:59,180 --> 00:17:59,780
Mark our position.

266
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,540
Let's go.

267
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,060
My mouth must be blessed.

268
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,700
What are you doing?

269
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,940
Thirteen, don't let go!

270
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,100
Cao!

271
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,700
- I won't let go!
- Release me!

272
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,500
Thirteen,

273
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,900
if anything happens to me,

274
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,140
you have to survive!

275
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:28,860
Cao.

276
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:35,900
Cao!

277
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,060
Cao!

278
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,060
Cao...

279
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,460
Cao,

280
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,500
Cao.

281
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,900
Help!

282
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,980
The savage fears fire.
Make it burn brighter.

283
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,580
It'll act as a barrier.

284
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,940
Help!

285
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,220
Chubby?

286
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,220
Help!

287
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,260
Help!

288
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,780
You two stay here. I'll check it out.

289
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,900
Hongsha, go assist them.

290
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,100
I'll take care of it here.

291
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,380
Got it.

292
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,460
Be careful.

293
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,180
Help!

294
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,100
Chubby, get down!

295
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:05,660
Luo.

296
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,020
Stop!

297
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:23,860
Such a high place.

298
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,100
No wonder I couldn't find you.

299
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,140
Only Mu Dai could reach that spot.

300
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:29,540
It's alright.

301
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,220
Mu Dai!

302
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,220
What happened to my master?

303
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,180
What happened?

304
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,180
- Master!
- Mu Da!

305
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:37,780
What happened?

306
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:39,660
Mu Dai.

307
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,340
Oh my!

308
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,060
Mu Dai!

309
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,460
Catch it with water now.

310
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:51,820
Mu Dai.

311
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,060
Mu Dai.

312
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,460
Mu Dai.

313
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,060
Hurry, scoop it up.

314
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:58,660
Luo Ren.

315
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:02,740
Here.

316
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,660
What happened to her?

317
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,660
I was about to ask you that.

318
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,380
What happened?

319
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,620
After you left, she attacked me.

320
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,660
And then...

321
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:27,900
It's fine.

322
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:28,980
Here.

323
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,420
Be careful.

324
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:37,820
Give it to me.

325
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:58,900
We guessed right.

326
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,700
The savage's amber

327
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,660
was split from that woman.

328
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,340
What did I miss?

329
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:05,900
I think

330
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,660
this relic of ill omen

331
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,580
was originally in the gem well.

332
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,220
Remember the visions you saw?

333
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,060
There were bones at the bottom.

334
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:15,980
Probably

335
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,380
the previous host
of the relic of ill omen.

336
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,660
When this woman

337
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,700
was hanging into a well
on the brink of death,

338
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,660
the relic of ill omen seems
to have chosen her as its new host,

339
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,380
healing her wounds

340
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,100
and letting her cling to life.

341
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:31,660
She's the...

342
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,340
During this process, the amber melted.

343
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,660
Then the amber, the relic of ill omen,
and some of her flesh

344
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,180
fused together.

345
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,620
She might not even have understood

346
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,660
what was happening.

347
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:46,820
To her, the amber

348
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,620
was a life-saving treasure.

349
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,100
So

350
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,020
she shared it with her child.

351
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,380
No wonder.

352
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,100
No wonder what?

353
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,540
The savage.

354
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,380
At first, she was terrifying.

355
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,980
But these days,

356
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,700
Thirteen-Thousand and I
have been with her

357
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,300
and found that she is not that bad.

358
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,820
She is quite friendly to us.

359
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,380
That's right then.

360
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,540
When she wore the amber,

361
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,020
the relic of ill omen influenced her.

362
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,420
Once it was removed,

363
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,740
she reverted to her true nature.

364
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,260
This time, the relic of ill omen

365
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,860
didn't fully control her.

366
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,500
It was more like

367
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,180
cooperation.

368
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,540
The relic of ill omen
sustained her life.

369
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,020
And she hanged victims

370
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:33,900
for its vengeance.

371
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,940
Anyway, this one
is back where it belongs.

372
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,100
Time is short.

373
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,140
Let's go find Thirteen-Thousand.

374
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,580
I almost forgot about him.

375
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:44,820
Shouldn't we

376
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,620
deal with this first?

377
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,180
I'm sorry.

378
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:16,900
Let's go, Mu Dai.

379
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:36,700
No.

380
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,780
I can't just sit here.

381
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,780
I have to do something.

382
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:10,580
Wait!

383
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,300
Where is he?

384
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,820
I said where is he?

385
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,100
You killed him?

386
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,700
I'll kill you.

387
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,220
No.

388
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,420
I can't act on rage alone.

389
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:44,980
In a straight fight,

390
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,860
I'd die.

391
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,220
Not worth it.

392
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,540
Where is it?

393
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,140
See that cave?

394
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,860
Thirteen-Thousand!

395
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,380
What if the savage's inside?

396
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:44,940
Exactly.

397
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,100
Luo Ren, give me the rope.

398
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,380
I'm going up.

399
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,060
Master, be careful.

400
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,340
You sure you can manage?

401
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,060
Don't worry.

402
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,540
I'll play it by ear.

403
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,100
That's awesome.

404
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,020
Empty.

405
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:15,700
Well?

406
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,500
It's small. I checked everywhere.

407
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:19,860
But there's blood.

408
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,100
Likely the savage's.

409
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,180
Here.

410
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:23,700
So you're saying

411
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,860
the savage moved Thirteen-Thousand?

412
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,340
Oh no.

413
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,620
This mountain's huge.

414
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,100
Finding him could take forever.

415
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:35,980
What?

416
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,180
505?

417
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,140
SOS.

418
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,460
This is one of the "hope stones"

419
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,300
I tossed down earlier.

420
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,860
Just a dumb attempt to stay optimistic.

421
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,620
Never thought it'd actually be found.

422
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:51,860
This proves

423
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,220
that when fate intervenes,

424
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,860
even finding a needle in a haystack
isn't impossible.

425
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,420
Let's go get Thirteen-Thousand.

426
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,380
We will find him.

427
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,460
We need to
head down the mountain tonight.

428
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,260
What're you saying?

429
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:03,740
Luo,

430
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,500
we can't just bail
after getting the relic of ill omen.

431
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,100
We agreed to stick together
through thick and thin.

432
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,500
I'm not abandoning Thirteen-Thousand.

433
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,860
But we're out of food and water.

434
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,100
The longer we push,
the weaker we'll get.

435
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,580
We'll resupply, and then come back.

436
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:18,460
Master,

437
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,620
you've known Thirteen-Thousand
for the longest time.

438
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:21,860
What do you say?

439
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,300
I also vote to leave first.

440
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,620
There might be more than one savage.

441
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,620
No way.

442
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,660
We were up there for days.

443
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,980
We only ever saw one.

444
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,340
How's that impossible?

445
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,780
Did you see the murals?

446
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,420
Yeah.

447
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,740
What about the ones on the ceiling?

448
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,260
Earlier, in that woman's cave,

449
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,580
I saw two dolls. One large, one small.

450
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:50,940
At first, I thought

451
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,620
they represented her and the savage.

452
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:53,780
You're saying

453
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,060
it's one woman and two children?

454
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:56,660
Yes.

455
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,220
If there's another savage,

456
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,660
why hasn't it shown itself?

457
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,340
The woman never appeared either.

458
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,700
Doesn't mean she wasn't real.

459
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,180
Chubby,

460
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,540
we agreed to stick together.

461
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,620
We'll resupply and return.

462
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:11,940
We're not leaving

463
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,380
without Thirteen-Thousand, alright?

464
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:23,500
Let's move.

465
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,060
Go.

466
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,300
That's the direction of the village.

467
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,020
Don't tell me she...

468
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,180
Careful.

469
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,100
Luo!

470
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:05,940
Zhama?

471
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:06,940
Finally found you all.

472
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:07,900
Anyone hurt?

473
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:08,940
What are you doing here?

474
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,420
Jiang Zhao sent me.

475
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,340
He said you got separated.

476
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,420
He worried you'd get lost
in the mountains.

477
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,620
Then I spotted this bag

478
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,700
and tracked you down.

479
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,780
Jiang...

480
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,300
You mean that big guy who came with us?

481
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,100
Yeah.

482
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:19,980
We saved him.

483
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,420
We killed the savage!

484
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,300
They found him.

485
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:25,260
Alright.

486
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,260
Let's head back to Jiang.

487
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,180
You guys are something else.

488
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:28,700
No injuries?

489
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,100
Let's go.

490
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,180
- Move.
- Be careful.

491
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,180
Luo,

492
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,420
I was really scared last night.

493
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,780
The savage came to the village.

494
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:36,740
Jiang escaped.

495
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,700
She tried dragging Jiang back.

496
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,340
This is the first time
I've encountered the savage.

497
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,660
That wretch even tried a sneak attack.

498
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,580
Good thing I'm quick.

499
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,340
I grabbed a gong

500
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,620
and banged the hell out of it.

501
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:44,540
Some villagers

502
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,460
backed me up.

503
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,380
We used to be hunters.

504
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,660
Dealt with wolves and bears.

505
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,180
A savage? Please.

506
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,380
Thirteen-Thousand!

507
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,300
Thirteen!

508
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,740
Hey, you're something else.

509
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,540
Look at you. Let me see.

510
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,900
You actually came back in one piece.

511
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:18,580
You're alive.

512
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:19,860
Our luck, huh...

513
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,220
You're alive!

514
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,380
Wait, what's going on?

515
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:24,620
Do you have a problem with me living?

516
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:25,700
What do you want?

517
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,700
Can't you be happy for me?

518
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,780
How did you escape?

519
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,380
- I tricked her.
- Zhama said

520
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,460
the savage chased you into the village.

521
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:35,940
Jiang Zhao was terrified.

522
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,700
He's been in a daze since it happened.

523
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,260
But I think he'll be fine.

524
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,340
Just needs time.

525
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,220
The search team
is at the village entrance!

526
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,500
Come quick!

527
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,620
They might've caught the savage.

528
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:48,460
I'll go check.

529
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:03,580
Thirteen-Thousand,

530
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,820
that cave was so high.

531
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,460
How did you even get down?

532
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,260
I...

533
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,460
I pretended to be dead to escape.

534
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,380
Never thought

535
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,980
she'd send me to the village.

536
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,620
Who's there?

537
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,900
Who's knocking this late?

538
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:28,620
Who's there?

539
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:29,740
Zhama.

540
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:31,380
Jiang?

541
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:32,900
You're back.

542
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,260
Where are Mu Dai and the others?

543
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,460
Maybe I seemed too nervous.

544
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,540
Zhama noticed something was off

545
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:45,780
and spotted the savage.

546
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,860
So when she smashed the window,

547
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,420
she was trying to get help for you?

548
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,940
She wouldn't have died if not for me.

549
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,220
Over there!

550
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,100
Catch her!

551
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,540
Catch the savage!

552
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,060
- Stop!
- Catch her! Hurry!

553
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,940
Go, everyone!

554
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,420
Go get her!

555
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:26,380
Don't...

556
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,940
- Get her!
- Check over there!

557
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:29,620
None.

558
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,060
Get her!

559
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:32,780
Stop right there!

560
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:35,500
Get her!

561
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,220
Catch her!

562
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,580
Nowhere to run now!

563
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,180
Get her!

564
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,140
Shoot her!

565
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,180
Listen to me...

566
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:46,780
No.

567
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,140
No, don't.

568
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,260
She saved me.

569
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,580
Please let her go!

570
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:51,980
No, please don't.

571
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,060
Move! Out of the way!

572
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:53,700
Move aside!

573
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,420
Out of the way!

574
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:54,980
Catch her!

575
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,380
Run! Run!

576
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:37,740
It's all my fault.

577
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:39,420
All my fault.

578
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,700
She wouldn't have died if not for me.

579
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,020
My fault.

580
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:54,460
She just fell off the cliff,

581
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:55,300
right?

582
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:56,740
Doesn't mean she's dead.

583
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:00,340
Right.

584
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:01,860
She climbed cliffs

585
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,820
even with a hurt leg.

586
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,700
She just fell off the cliff.

587
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,580
Maybe she caught hold of something
on the way down.

588
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,340
Don't worry too much.

589
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,260
Exactly.

590
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,340
In TV dramas,

591
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,780
people survive after falling off cliffs,

592
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,340
let alone a savage.

593
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,020
Thirteen-Thousand,

594
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:20,860
given her abilities,

595
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,620
her survival odds are way higher
than a normal person's.

596
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,140
How nice.

597
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:27,860
