1
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,840
   

2
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:25,000



3
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:03,390
   

4
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,020
   

5
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,880
   

6
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,040
Lady Boss Dai, you're awake.

7
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,580
You screamed yourself hoarse.

8
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:31,380
You don't even know how awful it sounded.

9
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,560
Come on, use my phone.

10
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,980
Just type if you need anything.

11
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,340
 Where's my friend? 

12
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,660
You mean the rich girl all dressed in designer clothes?

13
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,180
- She... 
 - What happened to her?

14
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,940
Her leg was injured, swollen like a giant radish.

15
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,660
She's already been taken to the hospital.

16
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:54,908
The doctors said they might have to cut them off.

17
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,660
Nothing I could do for her.

18
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,260
So, I stayed here with you.

19
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,860
Listen, you looked like a potato when they pulled you out.

20
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,140
I just kept dumping water on you.

21
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,260
Then left you under the sun to kill germs.

22
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,383
Maybe even help you grow taller.

23
00:02:09,383 --> 00:02:10,703
- Mu Dai. 
 - Washed it all off for you.

24
00:02:10,703 --> 00:02:11,700
- You're awake. 
 - Luo Ren.

25
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,700
You okay?

26
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,100
 Hong Sha's leg got cut off? 

27
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,080
What? Cut off?

28
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,500
No.

29
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,140
Her leg just got crushed.

30
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,965
She's already been taken to the hospital.

31
00:02:25,965 --> 00:02:27,980
Ouch, that hurts.

32
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,160
My butt really hurts. I saved you, remember?

33
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,220
What was in the swamp?

34
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,245
Let him tell you.

35
00:02:38,245 --> 00:02:39,540
Listen, let me tell you.

36
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:43,700
That thing is just like my butt, having two parts.

37
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,100
And it snaps shut!

38
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,700
I touched its shell.

39
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,940
It felt like a clam.

40
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,780
But it's not exactly a clam.

41
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,620
Clams live in water.

42
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,680
They don't hang out in mud, and they're never that huge.

43
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,240
Yes, it was pretty weird.

44
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,440
That clam was unusual.

45
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,940
 So, how did you beat it? 

46
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,800
All thanks to Thirteen-Thousand.

47
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,320
Speak of this, you really owe my butt an apology.

48
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,920
It was an emergency.

49
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,660
Luo Ren even lost his dagger.

50
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,700
What else could I do?

51
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,840
I dove in like a dragon plunging into the sea.

52
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,000
I started digging through the mud, looking for that clam.

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,580
Sure enough, I found it!

54
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,900
I pulled a Tiger Claw!

55
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,620
Yanked its meat out and twisted!

56
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,660
It hurt, so the shell popped right open.

57
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,280
And I grabbed you with my left hand.

58
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,820
 I want to go see Hong Sha. 

59
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,660
She told me what happened with you all.

60
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,820
When Thirteen-Thousand and I first found this boat, it was full of supplies.

61
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,900
At first, I didn't get why someone would live here.

62
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,780
Hong Sha said her uncle was here to hunt treasure.

63
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,760
All is clear.

64
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,620
The big lake's dried up.

65
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,940
Now, the only places where pearls can grow

66
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,460
are the lake center and the lake's deepest point.

67
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,980
Her uncle needs to test the water every day,

68
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,520
so living here is the most convenient.

69
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,060
 Did you find her second uncle? 

70
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,540
Not sure yet.

71
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:07,260
But when we passed through the village, we did see someone.

72
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,500
Maybe it was him.

73
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,712
That Hang Shi...

74
00:04:18,712 --> 00:04:21,740
We checked the ancestral hall but found nothing.

75
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,240
Still need to keep looking.

76
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,340
Eat this.

77
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,260
It's good for your throat.

78
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,480
Good for your throat.

79
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,640
What are you laughing at?

80
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:01,260
Oh. This is a sailor's whistle, and it's very loud and sharp.

81
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,780
Just blow it if you're ever in danger.

82
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,000
It's saved me a few times.

83
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,860
You're giving it to me?

84
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,260
I... I just...

85
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,920
Go get some rest. I'll get back to work.

86
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,240
Send out?

87
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,820
What?

88
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,620
Send the gear you bought to Hepu?

89
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,900
What's going on?

90
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:21,340
Wait, let me write this down.

91
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,780
Go on. Slower.

92
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,860
Come again next time.

93
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,380
Sure. Sure.

94
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,020
Express delivery, got it. All right.

95
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,640
Sister Dai's there too?

96
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,780
Didn't she go...

97
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,252
Didn't she go to Huacheng

98
00:06:37,252 --> 00:06:39,320
 for an interview? 

99
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,140
Brother Luo, be straight with me.

100
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,780
Did you guys leave me out on purpose?

101
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,700
No, we ran into each other by chance.

102
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,340
By chance? Come on.

103
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:53,340
Three of you, at Thirteen's home? Who'd believe that?

104
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,060
Four people?

105
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,580
And another girl?

106
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,364
Brother Luo, you guys are bringing a newbie instead of me now?

107
00:06:59,364 --> 00:07:00,440
Enough.

108
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,440
Just remember to send that for me.

109
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,000
Oh, tell Uncle Zhang that Mu Dai's okay.

110
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,320
- Wait. 
  - Bye. 

111
00:07:29,096 --> 00:07:31,155
 That vision led us here. 

112
00:07:31,155 --> 00:07:33,660
 What does it want us to look for? 

113
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,648
 Mu Dai and the others came too. 

114
00:07:35,648 --> 00:07:37,948
 Was it really just a coincidence? 

115
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,700
Mu Dai. I was just thinking of you.

116
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:12,920
They said you lost your voice screaming for help.

117
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,380
I gave you attitude the whole way, and you didn't even hold a grudge.

118
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,520
How about this?

119
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,640
When I get back, I'll have my grandpa pay you extra.

120
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,700
Okay.

121
00:08:38,965 --> 00:08:40,420
 Luo Ren rented you a wheelchair. 

122
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,980
 - You'll be discharged soon.  
 - Okay.

123
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,020
Oh, Mu Dai.

124
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,266
That Luo Ren.

125
00:08:49,266 --> 00:08:51,766
Is he your boyfriend?

126
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,660
No.

127
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,180
That's great.

128
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,280
What a relief!

129
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:04,660
I think I fell for him at first sight.

130
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:08,020
He's so handsome and tall too.

131
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,560
And he saved me!

132
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,940
And he's so efficient.

133
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,040
Completely match a novel's male lead I read as a kid.

134
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,380
After I saw him, my heart beat fast.

135
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,980
Thump-thump. Just racing like crazy.

136
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,800
What, you believed me?

137
00:09:27,499 --> 00:09:29,519
Kidding! Just messing with you.

138
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,820
I acted pretty well, huh?

139
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,680
But after a quick chat with him, I could tell

140
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,240
your relationship with him is definitely more than ordinary.

141
00:09:42,837 --> 00:09:46,357
And now it's like I got dumped before the romance even started.

142
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,080
Still hurts though.

143
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,820
Do something to make me feel better.

144
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,180
How about I don't pay you extra?

145
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,380
Now I'm broke and heartbroken.

146
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:25,360
Chubby, you can't let your guard down.

147
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,760
This is how people slowly get sidelined.

148
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,540
They've already formed a little group, and they're shutting you out.

149
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,920
They're off on a new adventure,

150
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,360
but you're not part of it.

151
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,260
You're stuck doing logistics.

152
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,760
You'll just take Uncle Zhang's place.

153
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,080
And don't forget, there's a girl.

154
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,060
That newbie?

155
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,360
Yes.

156
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,640
I'll be replaced by her.

157
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,880
My place in the team will be gone for good.

158
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,760
Why?

159
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,680
I've seen the visions too.

160
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,820
Chase them now!

161
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,380
- It's not too late. 
 - It's not too late.

162
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,380
Or we could just play cards.

163
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,560
No.

164
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,722
The mountain will not come to Muhammad.

165
00:11:18,722 --> 00:11:24,322
- Then Muhammad must go to the mountain. 
 - Then Muhammad must go to the mountain.

166
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,040
Hey, you know what?

167
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,660
This boat might be old, but it looks cool.

168
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,600
Really feels like an adventure now.

169
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,300
- Can you manage that? 
 - Careful.

170
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,780
Wait.

171
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,560
Wait. How are we eating here?

172
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,580
Hold on. I want to check over there.

173
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,320
Can you push me that way?

174
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,032
- That way, in the back. 
 - Boss Lady Dai, she's...

175
00:11:51,032 --> 00:11:52,460
Lift.

176
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,717
Lift.

177
00:11:54,717 --> 00:11:56,397
That way.

178
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,360
So noisy.

179
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,760
- It's locked. 
 - Seriously, what is this?

180
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,460
I had a friend send over some equipment.

181
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,980
Chubby express-shipped it over.

182
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,600
What types of equipment?

183
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,280
Drones and soil scanners.

184
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,040
This mudflat is huge and full of hidden holes.

185
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,740
Better to scan it first.

186
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,520
Please tell me it's not illegal equipment.

187
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,640
If it were illegal, you think they'd let it get shipped?

188
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,320
All right.

189
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,320
Mu Dai, I'll go receive the equipment.

190
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,560
I'll go with you.

191
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,160
No need. You're working.

192
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,800
Hey, Grandpa.

193
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,720
We just got to the boat.

194
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,360
We just arrived.

195
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,500
It's great here, really.

196
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,640
Super safe.

197
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:13,580
We've got everything, food, drinks, even instant noodles.

198
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:16,120
We're even cooking here.

199
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,100
I got news about uncle.

200
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,180
Really.

201
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,180
Mu Dai's friend saw someone in the village.

202
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,020
Probably him.

203
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,860
He must be around.

204
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,160
We'll find him soon.

205
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,720
His stuff and equipment are all on the boat.

206
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,480
It's just a matter of days now.

207
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,660
We'll definitely find him.

208
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,360
Don't worry.

209
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,500
I know.

210
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,780
Luo Ren is not right for you.

211
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,740
I'm saying this because we've known each other so long.

212
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,380
Consider it a friendly warning.

213
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:50,280
Don't take it the wrong way.

214
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,300
Yes, he's a good guy.

215
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,293
But the moment I saw him,

216
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:58,300
I just knew his background must be complicated.

217
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,775
On the way to Wuzhu Village, I heard him on a call.

218
00:14:05,775 --> 00:14:07,840
 How are things at Heisha now? 

219
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,280
 Still no word from Leopard. 

220
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,280
 What did you do before? 

221
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,160
 I mean, you've got great skills, quick and efficient. 

222
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,840
 Worked overseas before, earning my keep. 

223
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,520
You know what place it is?

224
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,460
Always on the news.

225
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,200
Some war zone overseas.

226
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,860
What kind of people hang out there?

227
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,320
Just now, he mentioned shipping equipment.

228
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,680
That equipment he's sending

229
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,260
doesn't seem like regular stuff.

230
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:41,760
Boss Lady Dai, don't mind me talking.

231
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,880
I'm just the bartender.

232
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,540
You're the future owner of our bar.

233
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,980
He's not one of us.

234
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:55,640
I can tell he likes you.

235
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,440
But that's just because you're likable.

236
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,520
You know why

237
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,720
your relationship with him can only stay at "like"?

238
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,640
And never go beyond?

239
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,480
I'll tell you.

240
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,320
It's because he knows it clearly.

241
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,660
You two don't match.

242
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,380
 I... I just... 

243
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,600
 Go get some rest. I'll get back to work. 

244
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,500
Nonsense.

245
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,300
What's your problem?

246
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,840
They're dating.

247
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,300
What's it got to do with you?

248
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,400
Who are you to butt in like that?

249
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,880
Why can't I butt in?

250
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,120
Just because you've got some money, you think you're so great?

251
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,840
When I get a wife someday, she'll be richer than you.

252
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,480
You? Get a wife?

253
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,200
Look at the color of your shirt.

254
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,460
Green!

255
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,260
One more word, and I'm coming for you!

256
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,440
Careful.

257
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,960
I'll drag you.

258
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,100
I'll find another way up. Unbelievable.

259
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,620
A cripple like you dares to challenge me?

260
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,200
When the lion falls, the hyenas circle.

261
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,360
Just you wait. I'll break your other leg too, you hear me?

262
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,980
Ouch! Ow!

263
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,400
Ow! Boss Lady Dai, save me!

264
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,540
- Save me. 
 - All right, forget it.

265
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,920
You think you can take me like this?

266
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,260
- I'll really give you... 
 - What now?

267
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,780
Just wait, it's only because I haven't eaten.

268
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,216
Let me finish my noodles first, then we'll fight.

269
00:16:22,216 --> 00:16:24,200
Thirteen-Thousand, right? That's your name, yes?

270
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,380
Yes, why?

271
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,360
I swear I'll slice you in two with one chop.

272
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,080
Bring it on!

273
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,400
With people like him, you have to watch your back.

274
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,360
I'm telling you. He's sowing discord with hidden motives.

275
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,640
A two-faced weasel.

276
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,360
Badmouthing people behind their backs.

277
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,760
What kind of man is that, huh?

278
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,360
If you ask me, either he's into you, or he's into Luo Ren.

279
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,460
- Is that right? 
 - You're the one who likes Luo Ren!

280
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,460
What did you say? I do not like Luo Ren.

281
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,560
- You! 
 - Say that again!

282
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,500
You!

283
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,740
Oh, no!

284
00:16:58,246 --> 00:17:00,435
Who cooked the noodles?

285
00:17:01,785 --> 00:17:04,440
 Mu Dai. I'm heading to the village with Thirteen-Thousand. 

286
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,940
 You stay here with Hong Sha. 

287
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,280
 Call us if anything comes up. 

288
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,740
Mu Dai.

289
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,300
Is it done yet?

290
00:17:26,749 --> 00:17:28,289
Yes, here.

291
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:36,200
Hey, are you still thinking about what Thirteen-Thousand said?

292
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,840
I told you.

293
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,200
Don't take him seriously.

294
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,600
He did it on purpose.

295
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,840
I think he had a point.

296
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,100
I feel like Luo Ren's really nice to me.

297
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,720
More than just friends.

298
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,320
But sometimes he's distant.

299
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,980
Like there's this invisible wall between us.

300
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:09,460
I can feel he minds it when things get too emotional between us.

301
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,920
You get what I mean?

302
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,540
So, what does he actually feel?

303
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:19,080
He keeps everyone guessing like this.

304
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,320
Isn't he tired?

305
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,260
I'm tired.

306
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,000
No.

307
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,600
Mu Dai.

308
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,960
We need to be direct.

309
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,200
You have to ask him directly.

310
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,200
Ask him directly?

311
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,620
Yes.

312
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,840
I'm too shy. I can't.

313
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,480
No, I can't.

314
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,440
Oh, you absolutely can.

315
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,120
I...

316
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,560
Look, think of it this way.

317
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,140
Let me give you an example.

318
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:45,080
It's like you've walked into a big, lush forest.

319
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,680
And by chance, you spot Luo Ren, the little sapling.

320
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,560
You feel drawn to nurture it.

321
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,500
But you need to know what he wants.

322
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:56,700
If he's into it, you nurture him, and he grows into a towering tree.

323
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,020
If he's not, no matter how much effort you put in, it won't work.

324
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,280
He won't grow.

325
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,080
Besides, what if you nurture him for ages,

326
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,180
only for him to lean toward some other sapling?

327
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,560
Wouldn't that piss you off?

328
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:13,320
And we've got the qualifications and the looks.

329
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,360
Why worry if he's unwilling?

330
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,380
There's a whole forest out there waiting for you.

331
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,260
Why get hung up on one tree?

332
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,940
Right?

333
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,840
If he's not into it, then let it go.

334
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,280
Just ask him straight out.

335
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,760
Better than sitting here stewing over it.

336
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,760
Don't torment yourself!

337
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,540
You care a lot about this.

338
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,800
But what you're saying makes sense.

339
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,740
Fine.

340
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,280
I'll find a chance to ask him?

341
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,880
Make it soon. Don't drag it out.

342
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,976
Luo Ren.

343
00:19:58,976 --> 00:20:01,620
Do you think that guy yesterday was really Yan Jiu Xiao?

344
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:05,280
Should we get a loudspeaker and just call him out?

345
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:12,780
I've been thinking the relic of ill omen showed us that vision,

346
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,780
and we followed it here.

347
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,880
So far,

348
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,700
that mysterious guy and the big clam we ran into are unusual.

349
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,940
Do you think they might be linked to the relic of ill omen?

350
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,680
Hard to say.

351
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,860
Do you think there could be another relic of ill omen out there?

352
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,100
Luo Ren.

353
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,780
Chief's house.

354
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,360
Someone's living here.

355
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,980
Could Chief actually still be around?

356
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,160
When people drown around here and we can't recover the body,

357
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,960
we use straw dolls as a substitute.

358
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:52,040
When my parents were buried, there were straw dolls in the coffins.

359
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:56,360
Would you place them at the dinner table?

360
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,880
That's not part of the custom.

361
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,360
These things don't look like they belong to Chief.

362
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,740
They're Yan Jiu Xiao's?

363
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,980
He moved in here?

364
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,280
Yan Jiu Xiao's gone missing,

365
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,260
his daily stuff is on the pearl lugger,

366
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:23,140
and his personal belongings are scattered here.

367
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:37,160
   

368
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,880
Stop wasting your time.

369
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,160
If he set a password...

370
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,680
How do you know that?

371
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,200
Hong Sha's been trying to find her uncle.

372
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,400
I've seen his personal info.

373
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,420
I tried his birthday and the last six digits of his phone number.

374
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:55,320
There should be synced photos on here, too.

375
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,480
Found them.

376
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,340
 See that? 

377
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,860
 Everyone in the field knows 

378
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,840
 where there are broken pearls, there must be rare ones. 

379
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:23,140
 Today, I had a hunch there's treasure here. 

380
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,540
 If this works out, 

381
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:28,220
 I'll never have to worry about money again. 

382
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,280
Worried about money?

383
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,920
I thought his family was loaded.

384
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,960
Yes, I was curious about that, too.

385
00:23:37,773 --> 00:23:41,620
 Look, I've never seen a clam this big. 

386
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,140
 I've been squatting here for like a week, 

387
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,020
 and this is the first time it's come up. 

388
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,380
- It's huge. 
  - My guess is it rarely ever moves. 

389
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,380
 I've got the ropes ready. 

390
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:54,120
 I promise there's definitely a pearl in that thing. 

391
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,641
 It went back down? 

392
00:23:56,641 --> 00:23:58,761
 I can't let it get away. 

393
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,860
Did he fall?

394
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,960
He tripped.

395
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,700
 I'm going to kill you! 

396
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,000
 I'm done with this old man. 

397
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,020
 At first, he seemed totally normal. 

398
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:14,340
 But the second I said I was going diving for the clam, he suddenly lost it. 

399
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,360
 Stop right there! 

400
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,060
 Tell me that face is creepy or not? 

401
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,980
Chief.

402
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,540
He's still in the village.

403
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:29,340
Anyway, I just hope they bring my clothes back soon.

404
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,040
I haven't changed in days.

405
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,920
You can wear mine! I'll go grab them for you.

406
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,380
Your pants are too long.

407
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,340
Once I put them on...

408
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,000
What is it?

409
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,540
Something's getting close to us.

410
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:44,540
What? Don't scare me.

411
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,360
The treasure bell.

412
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,900
It's my second uncle.

413
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,100
Treasure bell?

414
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,660
Just like when you first met me, I was wearing it then too.

415
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,860
Everyone in the Yan family has one.

416
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,980
It's really my uncle.

417
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,500
- You're sure it's the treasure bell? 
 - Absolutely.

418
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,000
I know that sound well.

419
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,680
- Second Uncle? 
 - That's weird.

420
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,500
Why is your uncle just pacing around?

421
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,420
Why isn't he coming straight to us?

422
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,900
He stopped.

423
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,620
Mu Dai.

424
00:26:09,993 --> 00:26:11,853
Who are you?

425
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,080
Is it the relic of ill omen again?

426
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,520
I don't know. But he seemed a little crazy just now.

427
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,340
The relic of ill omen?

428
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,360
Let me go.

429
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,360
No relic of ill omen.

430
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,580
Let me go.

431
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,700
Bad people! Bad people!

432
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,260
You're all bad people!

433
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,660
You all deserve to die!

434
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:56,640
You disturbed the God of Water.

435
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,120
Retribution. There will be retribution.

436
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,540
There will be retribution.

437
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:10,600
Hey, do you remember who I am?

438
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:15,320
Don't remember?

439
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,580
I'm Jiang Zhao.

440
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,320
From the Jiang family, Jiang Zhao?

441
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,080
Jiang Zhao.

442
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,280
You're Jiang Zhao?

443
00:27:47,015 --> 00:27:49,180
 - Stop him! Put out the fire!
- Hurry! 

444
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,380
 Keep basking in the moonlight? 

445
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,580
 It's on fire! 

446
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:55,500
 Put out the fire! Hurry! 

447
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,220
 Jiang Zhao, stop! 

448
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,500
 Hurry! Stop him! 

449
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,800
 - What's this kid doing? 
 - Hurry! 

450
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,878
 Stop! Put out the fire, quick! 

451
00:28:01,878 --> 00:28:02,900
 Quick! Over here! 

452
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,140
 - This kid... 
 - Quick! 

453
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,020
 What's this kid doing? 

454
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:12,800
 Put out the fire! Put out the fire! 

455
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,460
 Put out the fire! 

456
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,180
 Here! 

457
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,580
 Hurry! 

458
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,080
You... You little brat!

459
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,040
You little brat!

460
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,400
You set a fire!

461
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,040
A fire! Put it out!

462
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,440
Hurry, put it out!

463
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,580
Put out the fire! Hurry, put out the fire!

464
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,840
Put out the fire! Now!

465
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,980
Tie him up.

466
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,220
I burned your clams. So what?

467
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:01,700
You murderer!

468
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,260
- Thirteen- Thousand. 
 - I burned your clams!

469
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,100
Wuzhu Village doesn't deserve to find pearls!

470
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,040
- Thirteen- Thousand. 
 - Doesn't deserve!

471
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,260
That's right.

472
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:14,544
If you have any issues, just treat me like this.

473
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:18,120
Why did you burn the clams?

474
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,080
It's retribution from the God of Water.

475
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,040
There are no more clams in our village.

476
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,280
Our village is ruined.

477
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,740
You ruined everything!

478
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:36,300
Why did you burn the clams?

479
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,600
The God of Water.

480
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,100
The God of Water was leaving.

481
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:45,280
I begged him.

482
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,480
I offered him gifts.

483
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,100
- The God of Water. 
 - Look at the video.

484
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,700
 He said he'd negotiate. 

485
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,780
 Tell me that face is creepy or not? 

486
00:30:02,722 --> 00:30:03,740
 I'll leave. 

487
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:06,120
Turns out my uncle drove here.

488
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,340
But along the way, we didn't see any cars.

489
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,240
 Last time, I slipped and scared off the old clam. 

490
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,580
 Once it dove back in, it never came up again. 

491
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,680
 That's just how these things are. 

492
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,360
 They guard their home and don't move. 

493
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,000
 Let's dive in and clean them out. 

494
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,840
 Let's go. 

495
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,900
 Go. 

496
00:30:29,343 --> 00:30:31,280
This is the last video.

497
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,760
But it's from a few days ago.

498
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,280
There are two possibilities why we didn't see the car.

499
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:43,200
The first one, he'd already driven it away.

500
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,980
But all his personal stuff is still here.

501
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:49,100
So, the second possibility is

502
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,120
the car is still near the lake's deepest point.

503
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,840
You didn't see it because that day,

504
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,720
you took a detour to avoid the muddy area and the lake's deepest point.

505
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,340
These things were probably supposed to be in the car.

506
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:06,460
Could it be that elder secretly took them out while no one was around?

507
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:09,200
Then where did my uncle go?

508
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,960
Mu Dai, do you remember the nightmare I had?

509
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,700
What if my uncle went into the water and never came back up?

510
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,120
Let's not jump to conclusions.

511
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,200
Didn't your uncle call you just a few days ago?

512
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,520
By the timeline, he must have already gone into the water by then.

513
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,640
Yes.

514
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,980
No.

515
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:31,440
But if he came back up, why is his phone off now?

516
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,640
Don't overthink it.

517
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,660
We'll go check the lakeside tomorrow.

518
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,360
And what about him?

519
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,400
We can't keep him tied up forever.

520
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,640
Let's observe him overnight.

521
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,260
If nothing happens tomorrow, we'll let him go.

522
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,000
All right.

523
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,769
If Wuzhu Village really lost all its pearls because you burned the clams,

524
00:33:42,769 --> 00:33:44,809
would you regret it?

525
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,320
That's what they deserve.

526
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,460
Why should I regret anything?

527
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,200
But only a few people were truly evil.

528
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,820
You took revenge on the whole village.

529
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,135
 Hit here! 

530
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,180
 Here, missed! 

531
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,600
 - My turn! 
 - Watch me. 

532
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,960
 Hey, let me have a turn! 

533
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,660
 See? 

534
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:23,660
 Jiang Zhao, come have some yellow croaker. 

535
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,720
 Okay! 

536
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,900
 Wash your hands first. 

537
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,960
 How can you be like this? 

538
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,420
 Mrs. Jiang, I made some yellow croaker for you. 

539
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,700
 Please try some! 

540
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,600
 Thank you so much! 

541
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,620
 Don't mind that kid. I'll give him a good scolding later. 

542
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:39,100
 It's all right, kids are like that. 

543
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,320
 Thanks for all your help today! Everyone, take a break. 

544
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,995
 Come on. Take a break. 

545
00:34:42,995 --> 00:34:44,040
 Mr. Jiang, take a break. 

546
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,280
 Everyone, take a break, have some water! 

547
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,480
 Come on. Careful! 

548
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,760
 There's still yellow croaker to eat! 

549
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,240
 But only a few people were truly evil. 

550
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:10,860
 You took revenge on the whole village. 

551
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:51,874
I didn't want to.

552
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,240
I didn't want to.

553
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:20,135
What do these numbers mean?

554
00:36:20,135 --> 00:36:21,696
They represent different areas of the mudflats.

555
00:36:21,696 --> 00:36:25,640
The higher the value, the more solid the bedrock is.

556
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,620
This part is the lake center, so it's all in red.

557
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,100
The surrounding area is a swamp,

558
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,180
with soft and wet soil, so it's shown in orange-red.

559
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:35,660
Right. Green areas mean a Hummer can pass safely.

560
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,440
Blue to yellow, those are more dangerous zones.

561
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:42,840
If it's orange-red, even just a person's weight could cause them to sink.

562
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,820
That's the spot where you and Hong Sha were in danger that day.

563
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:49,520
 If my uncle were able to drive that close to the lake's deepest point, 

564
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,040
 he must have been using a similar app. 

565
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:55,020
 If your uncle's car is still out there, 

566
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:58,640
 the best chance is in this green area. 

567
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:03,620
I remember this used to be a big lake.

568
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:07,960
When we were kids, we used to fish and catch shrimp here all the time.

569
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,700
Could it really be my fault?

570
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,520
Let's stop here.

571
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,960
Beyond this point is the danger zone.

572
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,360
Everyone out.

573
00:37:35,633 --> 00:37:37,560
We'll split up and search. Watch your step.

574
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,298
If you sense any danger, take a prone position immediately.

575
00:37:40,298 --> 00:37:43,119
Hong Sha, you stay here and keep watch.

576
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:45,940
If anything happens, warn us right away.

577
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,720
Be careful.

578
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,260
Let's go.

579
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:38,700
Careful! You're getting close to the orange zone!

580
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,900
Luo Ren. Over here!

581
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,700
Could this be her uncle's car?

582
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:32,380
Luo Ren, this car didn't just sink in all at once, right?

583
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:35,470
Yes. It probably looked safe enough to park, but the ground underneath was too soft.

584
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:37,600
Bit by bit, it sank in.

585
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,180
That's the scary thing about swamps.

586
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,720
Yes, pretty scary.

587
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,280
There's even an old clam inside.

588
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,960
Don't worry so much.

589
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,220
Luo Ren just checked.

590
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,620
There's no one in the car.

591
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:52,940
Maybe your uncle made it out on his own.

592
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,440
Come on, don't cry.

593
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,380
Try to think positive, okay?

594
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,080
Okay.

595
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,960
I see something over there.

596
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,720
Right there.

597
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,860
- What is it? 
 - Is it the old clam?

598
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,480
The old clam?

599
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,780
We're in the safe zone, we should be fine, right?

600
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,440
I see it!

601
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,220
It's not coming toward us.

602
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,380
There's someone else out there?

603
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,320
Someone else?

604
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,300
Chubby.

605
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:46,080
Didn't want to include me, huh?

606
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,700
A little trick and here I am.

607
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,160
 What? 

608
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,260
 Wasn't she supposed to be at the interview with her senior? 

609
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,400
 How'd she end up in the swamp? 

610
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,840
 Exactly! That's because she's always on the move, 

611
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,260
 and she lost her phone, so she's out of touch. 

612
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:02,861
 Tried calling her, but Luo Ren stopped me, and said it wasn't a good time. 

613
00:41:02,861 --> 00:41:05,026
 He's clearly hiding something. 

614
00:41:05,026 --> 00:41:06,707
 If only someone could check for that. 

615
00:41:06,707 --> 00:41:09,220
 Yes. Quick, go now. 

616
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:12,600
 Hepu. That's pretty far. 

617
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,320
Speak of the devil!

618
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:26,560
Oh my poor, helpless friends.

619
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:33,180
I'm coming!

620
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,080
Thirteen-Thousand, go faster!

621
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,280
Even my toenails are trying their best.

622
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,020
He got out of the car.

623
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:58,400
Chubby. Watch your step!

624
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,760
Chubby, watch your step!

625
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,400
What's all the shouting?

626
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,000
Too excited!

627
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,900
Here!

628
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,580
Where's my car?

629
00:42:19,255 --> 00:42:20,980
- Chubby. 
 - Can he hear?

630
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,720
No way he can hear from this far.

631
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,274
Quick, use phone!

632
00:42:25,274 --> 00:42:26,500
- Call him? 
 - Yes.

633
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,760
Where's his number?

634
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,380
Look under "Cao" in contacts.

635
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:34,540
I think I came down from this side.

636
00:42:39,274 --> 00:42:41,160
I can already see you guys! What's up?

637
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,520
Hello? Brother Cao.

638
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:45,660
- I... 
 - Brother Cao, there's a clam under your feet.

639
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:48,819
A clam! You're standing on it!

640
00:42:48,819 --> 00:42:50,820
What?

641
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:52,560
No...

642
00:42:56,930 --> 00:43:06,460



643
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:10,540

00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:32,440
♫  It's telling me the end  ♫

662
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:36,810
♫  (The end) Is about to gently appear  ♫

663
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:43,780
♫  Like a whisper in my mind, a fleeting touch across my face  ♫

664
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:47,100
♫  Yet I find myself in the dark  ♫

665
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:51,410
♫  The sky splits the dawn's horizon  ♫

666
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:55,780
♫  It's telling me the end  ♫

667
00:44:55,780 --> 00:45:00,120
♫  (The end) Is about to gently appear  ♫

668
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:07,260
♫  Like a whisper in my mind, a fleeting touch across my face  ♫

669
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:12,980
♫  Yet I find myself in the dark  ♫

670
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:26,520
♫  The sky splits the dawn's horizon  ♫

671
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:30,840
♫  It's telling me the end  ♫

672
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:35,210
♫  (The end) Is about to gently appear  ♫

673
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:42,280
♫  Like a whisper in my mind, a fleeting touch across my face  ♫

674
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:47,070
♫  Yet I find myself in the dark  ♫
