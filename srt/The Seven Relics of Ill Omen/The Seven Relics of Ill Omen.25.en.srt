how's that on you?

110
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,540
When evaluating someone,

111
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,700
it matters what kind of person
they are at heart.

112
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,380
Since when did bloodline
become everything?

113
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,140
I mean, that sounds nice,

114
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,260
but if you guys really believed that,

115
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,940
why'd you keep it from me?

116
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,300
It's all Luo Ren's fault.

117
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,180
He worried you'd over-think it.

118
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,260
That's why he didn't tell you.

119
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,700

120
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,500

121
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,620
Yeah, why didn't you?

122
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,900
So what if his ancestors
followed some Star Lord?

123
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,820
You don't actually suspect him, do you?

124
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:44,740
No.

125
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,780
I just didn't want it to trouble him

126
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,740
and

127
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,420
mess with his head.

128
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,580
Turns out he was right.

129
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,820
I wasn't overthinking.

130
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,660
Really?

131
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,260
Luo Ren was overthinking.

132
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,700
He overthought that I would overthink.

133
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,380
So he kept it from me

134
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,020
and then I actually did overthink it.

135
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:07,980
That's pretty much how it went, right?

00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,020

137
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:12,780

138
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,660

at becoming a disciple?

Fate?

145
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,780
This was about eight years ago.

146
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,660
I had a friend, Wen.

147
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,140
She...

148
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,260
had an accident.

149
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,140
It hit me pretty hard.

150
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,340
Then Madam Hong

151
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,100
told me to go sit in a temple
and listen to the chants.

152
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,340
And while I was there,

153
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,260
I ran into the Master,
who was just visiting Lixi.

154
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:48,860
Holy Bodhisattva...

155
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,100
I dreamt of Wen again last night.

156
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,180
She didn't blame me at all.

157
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,580
But my heart still hurts so much.

158
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,940
If only I knew martial arts back then,

159
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,780
maybe I could've protected her.

160
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,380
Sorry.

161
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,020
Hey, young lady.

162
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,660
Just now, you said you wanted
to learn martial arts.

163
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:06,900
Why's that?

164
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,500
My best friend was killed
by some bad people.

165
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,500
If I'd known martial arts at the time,

166
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,100
I could've protected her.

167
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,020
And now?

168
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,740
Do you still want to learn?

169
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:24,660
Yes.

170
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,340
Back then, I just felt

171
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,460
Master was so warm and kind,

172
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,580
just like Madam Hong.

173
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,460
I felt so wronged deep down,

174
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,820
even though I didn't know why.

175
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,780
Then I just poured my heart out

176
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,860
to her, all of it.

177
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,300
And you became her disciple?

178
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,300
That's just...

179
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,460
You've got insane luck, you know that?

180
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,980
People say the ancestors
bless you with opportunities,

181
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,100
but look at you!

182
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,380
It wasn't just an opportunity.

183
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,900
It's like you were the chosen one!

184
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,300
She had been wanting
to take on a final disciple.

185
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,340
She saw me crying and begging

186
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,820
to learn martial arts.

187
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,060
And she just happened
to be ready to teach.

188
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,220
What a coincidence!

189
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,740
That's what we call fate.

190
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,020
Master, that means

191
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,220
you really were

192
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,700
the destined one.

193
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,100
I may not have it.

194
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,540
Of course, you had it!

195
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:20,900
Let me ask you this.

196
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,700
Did you ever want
to buy a pheasant before?

197
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,060
What would I want that for?

198
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,340
I just wanted to eat some chicken.

199
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,100
Then why did you want
to buy a pheasant today

200
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,340
and actually buy one?

201
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,500
Yeah.

202
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,460
I honestly didn't know.

203
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,020
Guess I was in that mood

204
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,940
at that place and that moment.

205
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,860
I looked into its eyes

206
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,180
and I knew I had to buy it.

207
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:42,820
That one.

208
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,740
This right here is fate.

209
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:46,900
You get what I mean?

210
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,100
I think I might have a little fate.

211
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:51,580
So...

212
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,620
What if my fate's kinda weak?

213
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,460
Like, I only have a bond
with this little creature,

214
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,380
and maybe not with a master.

215
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,900
No, you do have it with a master too!

216
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,140
If you don't,

217
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,540
would we be

218
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,500
on our way to see
my master right now?

219
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,580
You...

220
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,100
You have a way with words.

221
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,020
I got myself trapped before.

222
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,300
Impressive.

223
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,140
Really impressive.

224
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,140
You want it

225
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,500
to ride with us the whole way?

226
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,860
If you want it to fly alongside outside,

227
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,580
I don't mind if it can keep up.

228
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,340
Or just tie it to the roof?

229
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,380
Imagine how cool that'd look
at highway speed.

230
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,020
Super Chicken Car!

231
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,380
That's hilarious.

232
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,540
Maybe later we can find a place

233
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,380
and get it a cage.

234
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,780
Put it in the trunk, yeah?

235
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,580
No worries.

236
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,900
I kinda like holding it anyway.

237
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,820
Hey, Aoki.

238
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,820
I'm on the road now.

239
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,620
I'll meet you tomorrow night.

240
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,340
Plans changed. I'm in Lixi.

241
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,300
We need to move Pingting and Mr. Zheng
quickly.

242
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,020
Tell them

243
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:12,820
I'm one of them.

244
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,300
Why?

245
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,340
Leopard has crossed the border.

246
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,740
You okay, chick?

247
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,660
What's going on, Luo Ren?

248
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,220
You scared it right out of its nap!

249
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:36,940
Wait up for me, okay?

250
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,740
Is the intel solid?

251
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,220
She really crossed the border?

252
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:45,820
Absolutely.

253
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,100
She's got multiple passports

254
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,260
and used one of them.

255
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,060
I know you're out of town,

256
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,220
I'll take care of your family for you.

257
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:51,900
Don't worry about it.

258
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:53,900
Where is she now?

259
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,100
Can you track her down?

260
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,220
I'll try my best.

261
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,620
She just crossed the border.

262
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,540
She probably won't make any big moves.

263
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,100
But sooner or later,
she'll come for you.

264
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,460
After all,

265
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,220
you blinded one of her eyes.

266
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,100
Maybe it's better that way.

267
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,620
Save us the trouble
of searching all over for her.

268
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,900
I'll update you if I hear anything.

269
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,620
By the way.

270
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,700
Keep your little lamb in check.

271
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,140
What do you mean?

272
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,620
Find a way

273
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,260
to hide your girlfriend.

274
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,460
Don't give Leopard a chance

275
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,500
to use her against us.

276
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,780
Peanuts, sunflower seeds,

277
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,140
and fresh fruit!

278
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,660
Anyone want some?

279
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:43,860
Sorry for waking you.

280
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,340
Peanuts!

281
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:44,900
Hey!

282
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,500
Mu Dai, what's your next stop?

283
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,420
Next stop?

284
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,700
Nanping Mountain stop. Why?

285
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,860
Just get off there.

286
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,380
I'll come to pick you up.

287
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,300
I need to talk to you.

288
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,620
Tell Chubby to go ahead.

289
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,700
We'll meet up

290
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,780
at the last stop.

291
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,060
Hongsha and the others are back in Lixi.

292
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,340
No live poultry on the bus.

293
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,580
So we got a separate car for it.

294
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,180
Chubby's chicken

295
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,740
is costing a fortune.

296
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,860
You're coming back with me to Yun Ridge.

297
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,260
What about your business?

298
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,420
That

299
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:25,900
has been postponed.

300
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,620
Alright then.

301
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,980
Let's go see your master.

302
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,500
How do you like this outfit?

303
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,020
Nice outfit.

304
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,100
As for the person,

305
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,100
it's barely okay.

306
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,020
So, what is it you want to say?

307
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,940
Let me tell you something

308
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,060
about my past.

309
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:56,820
Back then

310
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,300
I had a falling out with my family.

311
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,140
I ran off abroad.

312
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,860
After bouncing around,
I ended up in Heisha.

313
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,820
You know Heisha.

314
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,420
It's pretty rough there.

315
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,100
If you can survive there,
you can stay here forever.

316
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:14,680
[Heisha]

317
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,940
Come on, you lazybones!

318
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:22,380
Move it!

319
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,620
At first,

320
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,100
I didn't know my way around.

321
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,180
I had to do tough manual labor
to get by.

322
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,420
The boss knew I had no connections.

323
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,020
He always shortchanged me

324
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,820
and gave me the hardest, dirtiest jobs.

325
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,060
The constant exhaustion
and poor nutrition

326
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,780
finally made me sick.

327
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,460
I was supposed to come home then.

328
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:44,940
But

329
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,460
I held it in.

330
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:49,660
I was scared my father
would just laugh at me.

331
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,060
Later, someone got me into fighting.

332
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,340
Fighting?

333
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,780
Like boxing matches?

334
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,100
Ever seen cockfighting?

335
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,740
People bet on the fights.

336
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,940
You fight in the ring
with your life on the line.

337
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,380
So, you took some serious beatings, huh?

338
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,220
I learned a lot of fighting moves,

339
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,540
but still got hit plenty.

340
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,300
The underground fights pay well.

341
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,580
So

342
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,300
even if I broke an arm or leg,

343
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,820
it was worth it.

344
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,020
But I always had my limits.

345
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,580
I never fought to kill.

346
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,380
What's "fighting to kill"?

347
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,780
It means

348
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,820
you have to kill someone in the ring

349
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,860
to end the match.

350
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,340
But this way

351
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,140
makes the stakes even higher.

352
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,940
The promoters make double the money.

353
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,700
Anyway,

354
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,340
I pissed off the promoters.

355
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,220
They drugged me

356
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,100
and bet on me to get killed.

357
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,140
I won!

358
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,060
That was pure luck.

359
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,460
That day

360
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:11,420
Aoki and Yuris came to the fight club
to recruit security staff.

361
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,060
Stand up! Stand up!

362
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,300
They're doing security work
for an international hotel,

363
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,060
protecting the guests,

364
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,460
and the hotel's property.

365
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:30,940
Aoki

366
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,860
invited me to join.

367
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,060
Sounds like a good deal.

368
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:37,740
Yeah.

369
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,820
In a place that dangerous,

370
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,700
having a steady job

371
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,580
feels pretty good.

372
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,700
So

373
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,380
I agreed to join.

374
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:48,860
Pretty soon,

375
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,980
I had a great group of teammates.

376
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,100
We'd often train and spar
at the jungle camp.

377
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,700
Even our downtime was pretty nice.

378
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,340
Eat more.

379
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,100
There's a long night ahead.

380
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,860
We'll reach Yun Ridge
by tomorrow afternoon.

381
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,740
Mister, buy this pretty lady a rose,
please?

382
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,020
She's so beautiful.

383
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,180
Five yuan a rose.

384
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,420
No thanks, really.

385
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,580
Come on, just one flower.

386
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,780
Only five yuan.

387
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,660
I bet this lady would love it.

388
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,260
Here's the money.

389
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,500
The flower...

390
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,060
No, thanks.

391
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,580
Don't you ask me

392
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,340
why I didn't buy a rose?

393
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,580
You'd tell me anyway.

394
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,220
After joining security,

395
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,740
we stayed at the base.

396
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,340
It facilitates daily training.

397
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,220
The closest bar to the jungle

398
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,300
is called Tipsy.

399
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,460
We often went there to grab a drink.

400
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,540
Luo, there are some pretty girls
over there.

401
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,820
Let's have a drink with them later.

402
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,660
Luo, Luo.

403
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:49,940
Luo!

404
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,540
There's a special beauty.

405
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,060
You're gonna like her.

406
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,220
She's your type.

407
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,140
Where?

408
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,100
Over there.

409
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,020
Where?

410
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:01,580
Right there.

411
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,580
What kind of pretty girl was it

412
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,340
that you "were gonna" like?

413
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,740
Someone's jealous.

414
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,140
Look at her, dressed so fancy.

415
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,820
She's way out of our league.

416
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,180
I think so too.

417
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,500
People like her

418
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:35,700
are off limits.

419
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,060
Yuris,

420
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,060
be careful not to risk your life.

421
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,420
It doesn't concern me.

422
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,260
I already got mine anyway.

423
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,220
You should give it a shot too.

424
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,500
Hurry up.

425
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,140
The fight's about to start.

426
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,260
Let's go, move!

427
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,100
Don't you get tired of always scowling?

428
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,780
Smile for once.

429
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,140
Hey there.

430
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,340
Hey.

431
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,580
Not gonna buy me a drink?

432
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,460
You don't seem like the type

433
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,100
who needs someone to buy your drinks.

434
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:54,740
I feel pretty good
about how I look today.

435
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,340
I even made a bet with my friends

436
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,940
that I'd get hit on a lot tonight.

437
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,420
But

438
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,940
no one even noticed me.

439
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,980
Guess the dancers are way more popular.

440
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,260
That's because
you're dressed too formally.

441
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:09,980
If...

442
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,140
Handsome boy!

443
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,340
Okay, give it to me.

444
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,740
If you dressed like her,

445
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,460
you'd get way more attention.

446
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:15,940
Thanks.

447
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,940
Can I borrow your clothes?

448
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,260
My clothes?

449
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,620
Yeah, I'll give you my jewelry.

450
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,900
No. I can't.

451
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,940
These are real diamonds.

452
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,100
No, I can't take it.

453
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,660
- No, no!
- Just take them.

454
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,100
Let me just borrow your clothes, okay?

455
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:34,660
Really?

456
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,420
Yeah.

457
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,860
Here, this is yours.

458
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,060
Come here.

459
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,060
Fine.

460
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,060
- Let's go.
- Okay.

461
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:41,820
Go.

462
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,340
Wait for me.

463
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,180
Hey man, how's it going?

464
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,340
Cheers!

465
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,020
Cheers!

466
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,140
Cheers!

467
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:05,700
Let's go.

468
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:18,940
Miss,

469
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,300
may I buy you a drink?

470
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,220
I only drink with him.

471
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,300
Is it okay now?

472
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,020
Do I look good?

473
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,460
I should be the one buying you a drink.

474
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,180
You can give me something else.

475
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,100
Drink up.

476
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,300
You don't mean to say

477
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,860
that you didn't give me roses

478
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:09,460
because you gave roses

479
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,020
to an unforgettable pretty girl before,
do you?

480
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,020
Do the roses come with a steel stamp?

481
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,580
Why could she accept them,

482
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:18,820
but I couldn't?

483
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,220
I'm not done yet.

484
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:21,940
That day,

485
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,500
everyone was drinking and having fun.

486
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,420
I wanted to help her
get her jewelry back.

487
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,380
Is Nina still inside?

488
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:32,980
I don't know.

489
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:47,780
She's dead?

490
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,220
Her name was Nina.

491
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,700
Her husband was an alcoholic.

492
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:55,900
She supported

493
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,780
the whole family all by herself.

494
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,620
She had a daughter.

495
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,460
She once asked me

496
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,020
how much it would cost
to get her daughter out of Heisha.

497
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,820
She wanted her daughter
to go somewhere safe.

498
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:10,700
To study.

499
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,660
To learn in a school.

500
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,340
She didn't want her daughter

501
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,580
stuck in a hopeless swamp like she was.

502
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,700
The one who killed her

503
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,580
was Leopard.

504
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:34,780
You thought Leopard was

505
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,380
just some innocent girl

506
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,340
who traded her own jewelry

507
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,940
for a plain dress, right?

508
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:45,900
She's the heiress
to Heisha's crime family.

509
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,500
Whatever she wants,

510
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,820
she just takes.

511
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,340
No need to trade.

512
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,540
In her eyes,

513
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,140
that was bold
for a mere nightclub dancer

514
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,700
to take her stuff.

515
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,100
I was the one who got Nina killed.

516
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,620
If I hadn't told Leopard

517
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,380
to change clothes,

518
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,980
Nina would still be alive.

519
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,180
Ren.

520
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:20,660
I'm fine.

521
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,420
I'm tired.

522
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,460
You should get some sleep first.

523
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,820
Leopard is the third-gen heir
to the family.

524
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,580
She's wildly ambitious.

525
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,780
She's hell-bent on ruling Heisha.

526
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,940
She tried to buy our hotel,
but we refused.

527
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,340
That pissed her off.

528
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,380
So, she sent thugs to attack us

529
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,100
and swore to wipe all of us off.

530
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,300
That woman is terrifying.

531
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,300
It was chaos that night.

532
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,740
We had no choice.

533
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,700
Get ready to retreat.

534
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,620
I don't even know what I was thinking.

535
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,260
But I couldn't help
but save Nina's daughter.

536
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:32,180
Maybe it's the fate
between the two of you.

537
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,500
I've never regretted saving her.

538
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,580
She's the sweetest little girl

539
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,580
in the world.

540
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,460
You know. She called me Daddy.

541
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,580
In that moment,

542
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,740
I felt like the world softened.

543
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,420
It was not safe for Tasha
to stay with us.

544
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,660
After we lost the hotel,

545
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,460
Leopard tried to force us
to work for her.

546
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,580
We said no.

547
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,940
And saying no to her is dangerous.

548
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,420
We sent Tasha to her uncle's,

549
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,420
thought she'd be safe there.

550
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,540
But that scoundrel

551
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,020
was blinded by greed.

552
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,700
He sold Tasha to Leopard.

553
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:21,940
What happened then?

554
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,420
Leopard called me

555
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,660
and said we humiliated her.

556
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,420
She set up a fight for me.

557
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,180
She bet on me to win.

558
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,100
If I helped her win money

559
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,620
and made her happy,

560
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,620
she'd give Tasha back.

561
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,260
Congrats.

562
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,140
I told you

563
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,860
I don't take threats.

564
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,100
I said he wouldn't play it straight

565
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,540
and would definitely make a move.

566
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,300
I won this game.

567
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,540
I was stupid.

568
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,300
Of course, someone like her has decoys.

569
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,940
She never bet on me to win.

570
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,060
Her real bet

571
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,420
was that I'd double-cross her.

572
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,780
So did you get away?

573
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,140
She let me go.

574
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,900
Told me to go home

575
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,300
and wait for her gift.

576
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,860
What gift?

577
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,300
Tasha's hair clip.

578
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,100
It was soaked in blood.

579
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:56,660
I'm sorry.

580
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,140
Luo...

581
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,060
This isn't just your fight.

582
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,820
And I'm dying to test her bite.

583
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:26,620
Luo Ren,

584
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,860
how could you not call me in on this?

585
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,020
Leopard's that cruel.

586
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,820
I've hated her guts for ages.

587
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,980
You think I can't hold my liquor?

588
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:54,900
Cheers!

614
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,020
It's rough…

615
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:29,740
Master.

616
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,980

and I still don't know

how great I've done.

620
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,700

621
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:42,940
Is that from Luo?

maybe I'd have joined in.

638

He said my chick won't shut up,

651
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,340
and he couldn't deal with it.

652
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,340

you name it that,

00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,980
won't it get some kind of trauma?

660
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,300
It's a chicken. What else is it for?

661
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,580
Naming it that

662
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,060
is just a way to remind it

663
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,540
