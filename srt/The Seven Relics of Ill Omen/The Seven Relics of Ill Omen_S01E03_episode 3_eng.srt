1
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,040
   

2
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:24,050



3
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,320
   

4
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,000
   

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
   

6
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:24,380
 Mu Dai. I'd say the portrait is quite accurate. 
   

7
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:27,230
 I'm selling the grocery store. 

8
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:30,400
 Once I get the money, I'll take the portrait to Xiaoshang River. 

9
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,710
 Worst case, I'll ask around. 

10
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,770
 No way this guy stays hidden. 

11
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,440
   

12
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,220
   

13
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,980
   

14
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,140
Nice location.

15
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,900
There are cameras everywhere and lots of people.

16
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,230
You really know how to protect yourself.

17
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,000
Relax. It's clean.

18
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,980
I don't take what I haven't earned.

19
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,810
I won't accept anything from you.

20
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:50,490
I didn't eat the strawberries. I threw them away.

21
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:54,560
Mu Dai, I actually have a good impression of you.

22
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,080
Do you know why?

23
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,840
Don't want to know.

24
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,360
You're skilled.

25
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,030
But you know when to hold back.

26
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,630
It makes dealing with you easy.

27
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,580
You almost killed me.

28
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,260
And you call me skilled?

29
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,360
Aren't you being sarcastic?

30
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:17,830
Seriously, I can tell you've got solid training in traditional martial arts.

31
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,090
If we were to fight seriously, I might not be your match.

32
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,590
And I can see that you're trained in combat.

33
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,120
So, what do you do?

34
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,160
Whatever. I'm not interested.

35
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,700
Are you here to talk about the Luoma Lake case?

36
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,800
Then I've got a condition.

37
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,020
Go on.

38
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:47,150
Only two types of people would keep tabs on this case.

39
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,980
Friends and family, and the murderer.

40
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:52,300
They bought information from Wan Feng Huo.

41
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,150
Auntie Hong and Li Tan are the friend and family type.

42
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,720
What about you?

43
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:05,320
You know Auntie Hong pretty well, and you're familiar with Li Tan, right?

44
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,800
Fine, we can talk.

45
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:12,540
But if you want us to share everything while you keep secrets, that's not fair.

46
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:18,340
I'm quite busy. So, talk or I'll walk.

47
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,250
These are your parents and sister?

48
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:45,810
The man's my uncle.

49
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,330
His name is Luo Wen Miao. He's a historian.

50
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,830
After my aunt passed away, he moved to Xiaoshang River

51
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:58,300
with his daughter Ping Ting to focus on regional history research.

52
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,500
About two years ago, he suddenly disappeared.

53
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,600
 Ping Ting filed a report. 

54
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,660
 And I came back to help look for him. 

55
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:11,810
 But not long after, he just came back on his own. 

56
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:15,810
 - Uncle.
- Dad, are you all right? 

57
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,540
 I'm fine. 

58
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,910
He told us he had been to Luoma Lake.

59
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:29,410
He often traveled for academic visits, so I didn't think much of it.

60
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:34,100
But that night, something strange happened.

61
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,560
 Uncle, why are you still up? 

62
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,370
 It's late. 

63
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,680
 Uncle? 

64
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:52,290
 Luo Ren, you have to stop me from killing. 

65
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:56,120
 Lock me up. 

66
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,290
What did he mean?

67
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,140
No idea.

68
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,430
I pressed him,

69
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:12,190
but he acted like he had never said it.

70
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:16,100
Like it was some sick joke.

71
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,980
Guess that moment stuck with me.

72
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,170
I stayed on guard after that.

73
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:24,850
 I started locking the gate at night. 

74
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:25,850
 Uncle, I'm coming in. 

75
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:29,240
 During the day when he went out, I tried to follow him. 

76
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,490
 Uncle. 

77
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,200
 What are you doing? 

78
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:21,130
 He seemed calm over the next few days, 

79
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:24,930
 so I let my guard down. 

80
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:28,170
 But then... 

81
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,140
 Brother Ren, wake up! 

82
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:41,080
 My dad... He's gone. 

83
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,950
You locked the gate, didn't you?

84
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,750
He climbed over the wall.

85
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,560
Can you believe it?

86
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,160
My uncle was in his fifties, not physically strong,

87
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,481
and couldn't even ride a bike.

88
00:07:56,481 --> 00:08:00,000
Yet he climbed over a four-meter wall.

89
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,520
 I thought that a gray-haired man would be easy to handle. 

90
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,520
 But I didn't expect him 

91
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:09,990
 to be incredibly strong. 

92
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,660
I chased after him right away and passed through an alley.

93
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,460
And there was a house on fire.

94
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:20,260
People were fighting inside.

95
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,120
You went in?

96
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,850
The scene inside was horrible.

97
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:30,320
Was Li Tan there too?

98
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:34,140
At first, I thought Li Tan was the murderer.

99
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:38,370
Because when I entered, I saw him choking my uncle.

100
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:42,220
You know how it is. One snapshot, and you jump to conclusions

101
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,740
even though it's not the truth.

102
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,330
I get it.

103
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:50,680
So, I knocked Li Tan out.

104
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,800
That's when my uncle ran.

105
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,378
I saw his eyes.

106
00:08:56,378 --> 00:09:00,560
That... Bloodlust.

107
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,080
I instantly realized I was wrong.

108
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,200
Turned out my uncle was the murderer.

109
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,440
When I chased after him, I saw his speed and strength.

110
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,600
That couldn't be my uncle.

111
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,950
But it was indeed him.

112
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,850
What happened next?

113
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:29,390
 Brother Ren, what's wrong with my dad? 

114
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:46,460
 Uncle. Did you kill someone? 

115
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:54,120
 I told you... Not to... 

116
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:58,010
 Let me out. 

117
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:13,440
 Ping Ting. Get the rope. 

118
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,890
 Now! 

119
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,340
 I tied up my uncle. Then I went to find Li Tan. 

120
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,630
 He was the only witness. 

121
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:27,750
 I had to find out what happened. 

122
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,770
 What just happened? 

123
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,285
 Who's the murderer? 

124
00:10:33,285 --> 00:10:35,185
 Got him. 

125
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,140
 Finally got him. 

126
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,750
 Finally. 

127
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,750
 What did you say? 

128
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:45,790
 Ya Qing, I finally got him. 

129
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,160
 Speak clearly! 

130
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,490
 The birthday present I gave you. 

131
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,700
 I needed to rush Li Tan to the hospital, 

132
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,575
so I locked my uncle in the study,

133
00:11:05,575 --> 00:11:10,120
and told Ping Ting to wait for me.

134
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,820
Li Tan has seriously misunderstood it.

135
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,192
I'll explain it to him when I get back.

136
00:11:14,192 --> 00:11:20,790
I thought the rope and the lock were enough,

137
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,080
and nothing would go wrong in the short term.

138
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,200
I rushed back as fast as I could.

139
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,720
But...

140
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:39,910
 My uncle was dead. 

141
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,120
 Ping Ting! 

142
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,010
 And Ping Ting lost her mind. 

143
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,690
I had no idea what happened.

144
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:48,690
Maybe she heard that I was going to call the police,

145
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,910
so she let my uncle out.

146
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:54,770
But the coroner ruled it a suicide.

147
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:57,290
Then why did Ping Ting go mad?

148
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:00,450
Even if she witnessed her father's suicide, would that drive her insane?

149
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:03,150
It wasn't until I met Cen Chun Jiao

150
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:06,270
 and learned about what happened to Liu Shu Hai 

151
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:12,700
I realized Ping Ting might've faced the same horror.

152
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,550
This is just eerie.

153
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:20,630
I began tracing back from this case, starting with Li Tan,

154
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,840
and learned about the Luoma Lake case.

155
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,620
But the culprit behind it wasn't my uncle.

156
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,170
He was studying abroad back then.

157
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:31,410
Later, I found out about Huo Zi Hong.

158
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:35,100
Then I pieced together all the clues I could find.

159
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:39,570
If this is some grand play, Huo Zi Hong is now

160
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,020
its central figure.

161
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,290
Mu Dai.

162
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,670
I need your help.

163
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:55,150
Well... Auntie Hong...

164
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,940
Auntie Hong can't be the murderer.

165
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,910
Maybe not.

166
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,630
But she knows who the murderer is.

167
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,960
What evidence do you have?

168
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,120
Remember she and I had a chat last night?

169
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,480
The first thing she asked was,

170
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,700
"Didn't he come with you?"

171
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,910
She meant my uncle.

172
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,320
But he was already dead.

173
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,690
How could a dead man come with me?

174
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:21,880
 Isn't he dead yet? 

175
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,630
 Alive and kicking. 

176
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:32,040
 Tough guy, isn't he? 

177
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,220
That’s when I realized we were talking past each other.

178
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,140
We were talking about the same case,

179
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:41,050
but not the same person.

180
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:43,450
She wasn't talking about my uncle,

181
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:46,260
but the real murderer.

182
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:50,550
Her tone made me think she had dealt with the murderer.

183
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:52,630
So, I tested her.

184
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:55,570
 You know who the culprit is in the Luoma Lake case. 

185
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:02,080
 And you're not the real Huo Zi Hong. 

186
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,720
And you saw how she reacted.

187
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,220
Remember something?

188
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,620
Zhang...

189
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,200
Zhang Guang Hua.

190
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,810
Who's that?

191
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:41,000
He's the second case Auntie Hong reported to Wan Feng Huo.

192
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,320
He's also from Luoma Lake.

193
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,910
And he used to live in the same building as Li Ya Qing.

194
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:52,260
Not long after the Luoma Lake case, he disappeared.

195
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:57,600
Later, his personal belongings were found on a riverbank in Datong.

196
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,670
Presumed dead.

197
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:03,330
- Datong. 
 - Datong?

198
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,670
This name sounds so familiar.

199
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,740
I think I've seen it somewhere before.

200
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,750
Liu Shu Hai's car went into the water there.

201
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,600
- Yes. 
 - It was in Datong.

202
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,030
Right.

203
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,880
 Where did Auntie Hong put Zhang Guang Hua's file? 

204
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,870
I don't know. I haven't seen Mu Dai all afternoon.

205
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:04,250
All right, keep looking.

206
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,320
Well, what are you up to now?

207
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,340
Auntie Hong, you're here.

208
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:21,100
I...

209
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,370
So much has happened recently.

210
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:27,980
Just praying for the bar's safety.

211
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:31,750
Auntie Hong, since you're here, you do it.

212
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,100
Done.

213
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,610
Any luck?

214
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,220
Couldn't find it.

215
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:13,050
No idea where she stashed Zhang Guang Hua's file.

216
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,150
Doesn't matter. Wan Feng Huo should have a copy.

217
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,210
So what's next?

218
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:23,000
I've grasped the basics of the three cases.

219
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,270
I need to find out the connections between them.

220
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:28,000
I can feel there's a hidden thread.

221
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,640
Wait... Three cases? Not two?

222
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,390
Right. You don't know about the Dalunte'er incident yet.

223
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,720
How about we go to my place,
you help me sort things out,

224
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,380
and I'll fill you in on more details?

225
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,170
To your place?

226
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:44,570
No, it's too late.

227
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,270
Fine.

228
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,680
See yourself out.

229
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,840
- We'll talk later. 
 - Sure.

230
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,270
Wait.

231
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:00,240
You live here?

232
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,780
Then I...

233
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,010
Come in.

234
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:16,030
This is your home?

235
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,460
It's a ready-to-move-in rental.

236
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,510
Come on.

237
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,580
Where to?

238
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,190
My room.

239
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,490
The files are in there.

240
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,420
Where are the files?

241
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,310
You can see the bar from here.

242
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,550
And my room.

243
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:23,310
No wonder I've been feeling that I'm being watched.

244
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:26,440
Watching implies ill intent.

245
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:31,780
What I'm doing is reconnaissance or observation.

246
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,430
Let's get to the files.

247
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:39,920
Liu Shu Hai mentioned two cases before he died.

248
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,310
One was the Luoma Lake case and for the other one,

249
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,330
Cen Chun Jiao didn't disclose it.

250
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,220
So, you bribed her for the information?

251
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:54,760
This one happened five years ago in Dalunte'er,

252
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,540
in a pastoral area, during winter.

253
00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:00,030
Same method. Kill first, then use fishing lines.

254
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,850
But no one knows about this case.

255
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,540
No one knows?

256
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:08,440
The victim was snowed in, and there were wolves around.

257
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:13,190
So, this incident was attributed to the natural disaster.

258
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,540
By the way, is there any pattern 
    

259
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:19,330
to these cases geographically? 
    

260
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,860
They are all far from each other.

261
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,570
No obvious connections.

262
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:27,720
What about the timeline?

263
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,510
Three years between the second 
    

264
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:36,120
But 17 years between the first and the second cases. 
    

265
00:20:37,741 --> 00:20:41,509
Then... What about the murderer in each case?

266
00:20:41,509 --> 00:20:43,190
I still don't believe

267
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:45,570
Liu Shu Hai committed the first case. 
    

268
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:49,570
First, the two cases are too far apart in time.

269
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:54,040
Second, when the case happened, Liu Shu Hai had just come of age.

270
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,890
How could he suddenly go to Luoma Lake

271
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:59,920
and kill Li Ya Qing and her family, who were complete strangers to him?

272
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,840
Right.

273
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:09,190
I was stuck

274
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:13,280
until you mentioned Zhang Guang Hua.

275
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,890
Funny, isn't it?

276
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:19,170
He's from Luoma Lake too. 
    

277
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:24,840
And furthermore, his belongings were found in Datong.

278
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:29,140
It was where Liu Shu Hai's car went into the water.

279
00:21:30,369 --> 00:21:33,400
Their paths crossed there.

280
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,620
   

281
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,020
Datong.

282
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:41,720
Liu Shu Hai and my uncle crossed paths, too.

283
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,930
Liu Shu Hai died in Jiquan.

284
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:50,340
Remember when I said I came back to look for my uncle?

285
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:55,430
I asked Ping Ting if he had acted strangely before he left home.

286
00:21:55,430 --> 00:22:01,030
She told me he had gone to Jiquan on a business trip

287
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:03,280
and came back very ill.

288
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,510
He hadn't been the same since.

289
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,552
 Five years ago... 

290
00:22:07,552 --> 00:22:10,513
 - I'm really sorry. I've got the wrong place. 
 -  My uncle bought the wrong ticket...  

291
00:22:10,513 --> 00:22:13,690
 - And ended up at Cen Chun Jiao's inn... 
 - All right. All right. 

292
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:16,040
 Okay, that's it. 

293
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:20,780
 Go upstairs, turn right, and keep walking straight. Room 202. 

294
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,720
Cen Chun Jiao said Liu Shu Hai stayed in Room 203.

295
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,950
What a coincidence.

296
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:26,120
Tell me about it.

297
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,780
 - Odd and even room numbers. 
 - Is... Is he dead? 

298
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:31,100
 My uncle was also there when Liu Shu Hai died. 

299
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,790
 - The manager has called the police. 
 - He called the police. 

300
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:38,230
Do you remember that when Liu Shu Hai died,

301
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:40,320
a piece of skin was missing from his back?

302
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:45,480
Cen Chun Jiao said the piece of skin was peculiarly neat.

303
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,390
The same went for my uncle.

304
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:54,230
Liu Shu Hai started acting strangely after he fell into the water in Datong.

305
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:56,890
And your uncle began to behave oddly after returning from Jiquan.

306
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:58,440
I think something's wrong.

307
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,670
It's like a killing relay.

308
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:07,200
One dies, the next takes the baton and commits another crime.

309
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,960
Then the next one, and the next.

310
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:14,430
Maybe someone is behind all of this, controlling everything

311
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:18,620
and taking the skin of the participants as a trophy.

312
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,430
Have you thought of anything?

313
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,680
Thought of what?

314
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,730
Is the relay race over?

315
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:26,620
What do you mean?

316
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:30,650
Liu Shu Hai died with my uncle nearby.

317
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,490
And he took the baton.

318
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:37,920
And when my uncle died, someone else was there.

319
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,640
Ping Ting?

320
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,740
Excuse me.

321
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,630
- Enjoy. 
 - Thanks.

322
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:25,040
Missy, you're back. Where did you go?

323
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,930
Got something done.

324
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:29,850
A big shot like you handles things yourself?

325
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:31,910
Wait. Think about Tang Monk.

326
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:35,410
He doesn't have to fight demons, beg for alms, or even carry luggage.

327
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:38,295
Because he has three loyal disciples. You don't need three.

328
00:24:38,295 --> 00:24:42,140
Having just one devoted disciple would save you a lot of trouble.

329
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,850
So, you want to be my disciple, huh?

330
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,870
Could I?

331
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,090
No way.

332
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,480
I have my master.

333
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,290
You need her approval to become my disciple.

334
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:01,820
Well, Missy, just introduce her to me, right?

335
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,410
I'll bring some pastries.

336
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:06,414
That would count as my sincerity.

337
00:25:06,414 --> 00:25:08,540
Fair point.

338
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:12,470
But my master despises thieves.

339
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,000
You know about my senior?

340
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,410
- Senior? 
 - He made a mistake once.

341
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:20,240
He stole something, I guess.

342
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,330
My master punished him severely for that.

343
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:25,140
He's still recovering.

344
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,440
His arms and legs are broken.

345
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,370
With your record?

346
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:30,810
Forget it.

347
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:32,870
Just do your job well.

348
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:40,460
That's hot-headed.

349
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:58,760
Brother Cao, smart men read the situation.

350
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,090
Martial arts are dying.

351
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:05,570
Even if you become an unrivaled master, one bullet from me, and you're dead.

352
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:08,960
Who trains just to fight?

353
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,605
Look at that piece of paper on the bed.

354
00:26:10,605 --> 00:26:12,892
Can you read? Step Four. 
    

355
00:26:12,892 --> 00:26:14,230
I will become a superstar! 
    

356
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:16,910
Superstar?

357
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,470
You tripped at step one.

358
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:19,730
With your record?

359
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:21,300
Even if you make it, you'll just be a disgraced celebrity.

360
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,200
You... Help me up.

361
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,930
Help me up.

362
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,030
What is this training?

363
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:38,370
Don't judge a man's dream.

364
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:40,660
Oh, you've got a dream?

365
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:44,070
Fine. I've got one too.

366
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:49,360
Ask me what it is.

367
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,072
My dream is for a gorgeous, kind,

368
00:26:58,072 --> 00:27:04,040
and wealthy women to come to me.

369
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,810
How did that saying go?

370
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:08,680
"Grant me a lifetime of comfort,"

371
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,760
"and spare me wandering."

372
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,570
So, living off women...

373
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:18,140
Hey, Brother Cao. Why does it sound so cheesy coming from you?

374
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,820
It's just a little bit about money.

375
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,510
That's why it's a dream.

376
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:26,930
Just dreaming and imagining.

377
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:31,750
Anyway, Brother Cao, you've got a roof and meals.

378
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,100
So, just make do.

379
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:37,570
Come on, Thirteen, why are you so bleak?

380
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:40,330
You're so young, but your spirit is already dead.

381
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:41,760
I can't be like you.

382
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,930
The bar is pretty quiet during the day.

383
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:48,570
I'll get a second job tomorrow. Even if it's doing manual labor.

384
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:51,060
There's no shame in earning my own keep.

385
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:54,960
I want Mu Dai to see me in a new light.

386
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:06,396
By the way, Bro, if one day step four ever comes true,

387
00:28:06,396 --> 00:28:08,576
don't rat me out, okay?

388
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:47,860
 Well, to find out the truth, 

389
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,450
 I still have to start with Auntie Hong. 

390
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,290
He's still awake.

391
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:31,760
 Maybe someone is behind all of this, controlling everything 

392
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,890
 and taking the skin of the participants as a trophy. 

393
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:40,780
 The skin collector must be the mastermind. 

394
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:44,430
 Could it be Zhang Guang Hua? 

395
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:46,440
 Putting Luo Wen Miao's incident aside, 

396
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,430
 when Liu Shu Hai died,   Cen Chun Jiao was in the hallway. 

397
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:52,680
 In such a short time, he managed to slip in, 

398
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:56,430
 cut the skin, and vanish without a trace. 

399
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:57,990
 So terrifying. 

400
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:00,800
 That's not human. 

401
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,000
- What's wrong now? 
 - Ugh, that Li Tan guy.

402
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,310
Infuriating.

403
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:25,620
Him? What did he do?

404
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:30,520
Well, Li Ya Qing was just his girlfriend.

405
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,090
He's wasted half of his life on her.

406
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:36,710
He lost his job and is running a grocery store.

407
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:39,580
Now he tells me he wants to sell the store

408
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,340
to raise money and keep looking for the murderer.

409
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,770
Isn't that insane?

410
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:53,710
He even swore at her grave he'd find out the truth.

411
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:55,060
Isn't that pathetic?

412
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,820
He is now the laughing stock.

413
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,470
- Everyone laughs at him. 
 - Mu Dai!

414
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:00,450
You're going too far.

415
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:02,960
What did I teach you?

416
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,100
Empathy. That is someone's misfortune.

417
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,940
How can you talk about him like that behind his back?

418
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,380
Sorry, Auntie Hong.

419
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,620
I shouldn't have said that.

420
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,610
But I've got a question.

421
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:18,440
Auntie Hong, do you remember Luo Ren?

422
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:21,580
His uncle died, and his cousin went mad.

423
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:24,480
He's a victim too.

424
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,340
You're saying Luo Ren is also a victim?

425
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:33,240
And that his uncle's killer is connected to the murderer from 20 years ago?

426
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,580
So, finding the murderer in the Luoma Lake case is extremely important.

427
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:39,710
Auntie Hong, I can tell you know something.

428
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:43,300
Can you please share whatever you can if it won't harm you?

429
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,190
Mu Dai! You're imagining things!

430
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,670
I really don't know anything.

431
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:50,540
If I did, why would I have sent Wan Feng Huo to investigate?

432
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,590
Drop it.

433
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,610
 Ping Ting's condition has worsened. 

434
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:23,630
 I can't wait any longer. 

435
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:40,380
Mu Dai, can you give me Li Tan's number?

436
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:05,560
   

437
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,130
Hello? I heard Li Tan's in Lixi?

438
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:19,990
I'm going to see him now.

439
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:22,810
 Why didn't you explain everything to him over the phone? 

440
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:24,190
Li Tan's impulsive.

441
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:26,860
It's better to discuss something this complex in person.

442
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:29,950
So, you know he's impulsive.

443
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:34,371
I'm afraid you two won't even get to talk before he kills you.

444
00:33:34,371 --> 00:33:36,430
I'm that weak?

445
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:40,360
 Just make sure to clear it up to avoid any misunderstandings. 

446
00:33:40,901 --> 00:33:43,240
If I hadn't promised Auntie Hong to accompany her to the temple,

447
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,860
I would go with you.

448
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:48,360
Relax. Just a chat.

449
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,220
Nothing will happen.

450
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:58,490
We'll talk later.

451
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:19,600
So ungrateful.

452
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,950
Doesn't even reply to messages.

453
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:23,850
Mu Dai.

454
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:26,730
Auntie Hong, you're finally done.

455
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:28,700
Sorry to keep you waiting.

456
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:32,800
   

457
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,942
-  Mu Dai. 
- Uncle Li.

458
00:34:33,942 --> 00:34:36,800
-  Mu Dai.  
 - Why are you sweating so much?

459
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,140
 I found the murderer. 

460
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:41,640
 The old one is dead. He got off easy. 

461
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,180
 But I got the young one. 

462
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:47,807
 I can... Die happily now. 

463
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:51,485
Luo Ren?

464
00:34:51,485 --> 00:34:52,990
No, Uncle Li.

465
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:55,790
You've got it wrong!

466
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:57,040
Do you know where they are?

467
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,220
Luo Ren's place.

468
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,440
Let's go.

469
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,980
Hurry.

470
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:10,660
Stay back!

471
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:14,350
Mu Dai. Get out.

472
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:15,859
Now!

473
00:35:15,859 --> 00:35:17,672
Uncle Li, Uncle Li, don't...

474
00:35:17,672 --> 00:35:18,930
This has nothing to do with Luo Ren.

475
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:20,830
Nothing to do with him?

476
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:23,260
I saw his uncle kill with my own eyes.

477
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,640
He's an accomplice!

478
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,210
And he even lied to me, saying his uncle was being controlled.

479
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:30,440
Nonsense! Do I look like a three-year-old?

480
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,690
I saw it!

481
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:33,740
- Uncle Li.
- No excuses!

482
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,260
Put the lighter down.

483
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,600
Murder is a crime!

484
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,330
Crime?

485
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,850
I've already put my life on the line!

486
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:43,910
It's been 22 years.

487
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:46,640
22 years!

488
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:51,120
I can finally give Ya Qing an answer.

489
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,440
- Uncle Li! 
 - Li Tan!

490
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,080
Li Tan! Li Tan!

491
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,520
It's... It's me.

492
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,200
Li Tan!

493
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,640
Ya Qing.

494
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:13,168
Ya Qing?

495
00:36:14,479 --> 00:36:16,469
Yes, it's me.

496
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,740
No.

497
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:27,220
You're not her.

498
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:30,940
You're her twin sister.

499
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,600
You're all liars!

500
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,260
No, I am Ya Qing.

501
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,540
I'm Li Ya Qing.

502
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,990
- I am! 
 - You're not.

503
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:38,980
- I am! 
 - You're not Li Ya Qing!

504
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,950
I am! I swear!

505
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:42,930
Don't you remember?

506
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:46,540
The first time we met was at a Sichuan restaurant near your workplace.

507
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,210
You ordered tomato and egg soup.

508
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:49,410
The egg was whole.

509
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:51,700
I said it shouldn't be like that. It should be scrambled.

510
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,830
But you said that was how Sichuan cuisine was.

511
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:58,110
Don't you remember? You also said you couldn't hold your liquor.

512
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,830
Remember?

513
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:05,130
I am really Li Ya Qing!

514
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,820
Ya Qing.

515
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,770
Li Tan.

516
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,910
I need to tell you something.

517
00:38:27,031 --> 00:38:29,680
Li Tan really went overboard.

518
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,161
We agreed to just go through the motions,

519
00:38:32,161 --> 00:38:34,421
but he used so much force.

520
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,560
So, it was all water?

521
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,560
Barely any gasoline.

522
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,990
Just enough for the smell.

523
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:46,140
Set the mood.

524
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:50,250
How could you team up to trick me?

525
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:52,770
Not cool.

526
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,950
Uncle Zheng sent it to me this morning.

527
00:39:05,041 --> 00:39:07,040
Sorry.

528
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,880
I couldn't wait any longer.

529
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,870
The song Ping Ting was singing is the one my uncle sang before he killed someone.

530
00:39:15,631 --> 00:39:17,560
I wanted to discuss it with you.

531
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,322
But Li Tan is impulsive,

532
00:39:20,322 --> 00:39:25,520
and we thought if we didn't tell you, your reactions would be genuine,

533
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,290
and the effect would be better.

534
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:30,220
It's urgent, so I had to do this.

535
00:39:33,188 --> 00:39:35,575
I haven't been able to sleep.

536
00:39:35,575 --> 00:39:39,330
So, I've been thinking about these cases.

537
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:41,850
Suddenly, an idea occurred to me.

538
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:42,990
Go on.

539
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:47,560
What if the mastermind is a supernatural force?

540
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,930
- Is that weird? 
 - Sorry.

541
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:54,370
After Liu Shu Hai fell into the water, he changed drastically because he was controlled.

542
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:58,050
Later, he died in the inn, and then your uncle was controlled.

543
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:04,330
You think she went mad because something took control of her?

544
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:05,870
Yes.

545
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:11,850
So, we need an exorcist now?

546
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:17,830
I'm just saying. Can't I even say it?

547
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,290
You'll drink my water now?

548
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:24,480
It's actually poisoned this time.

549
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:33,950
There's so much I should've told you sooner.

550
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:36,910
But I never had the chance.

551
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:39,640
Li Tan.

552
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:44,550
You know about me and Zhang Guang Hua.

553
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:48,300
My dad's been feeling ashamed, so...

554
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,140
I just want to say

555
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:57,380
I'm sorry.

556
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:00,490
It's my fault.

557
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:39,390
Uncle Li, how did the conversation...

558
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,410
Uncle Li?

559
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,460
What's wrong?

560
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:53,720
Uncle Li, where are you going?

561
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:03,100
Uncle Li.

562
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:06,200
What happened?

563
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,430
Auntie Hong?

564
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:20,050



565
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,800
 'Palm Print' - An Qi
