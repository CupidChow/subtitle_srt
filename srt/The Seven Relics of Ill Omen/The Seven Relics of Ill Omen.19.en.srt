00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,980
[Episode 19]

5
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,380
When I chased out of the rice fields

6
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,620
with Thirteen-Thousand and the others,

7
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,620
we found this house nearby.

8
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,260
This must be where she lives.

9
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,500
Luo Ren and the rest
are waiting outside.

10
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:32,460
They said

11
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,860
to call them anytime if we need backup.

12
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,140
What do you want?

13
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,580
What are you trying to do?

14
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,940
What do you want?

15
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,540
Alright, come in.

16
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,180
The relic of ill omen was just removed.

17
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,940
Without its support,

18
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,460
she's very weak right now.

19
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,660
She'll recover in a couple of days.

20
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,580
Do you remember having a daughter?

21
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,060
Then you abandoned her.

22
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,940
You left her at the orphanage gate.

23
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:39,780
Do you remember?

24
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,580
Remember?

25
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,740
You don't remember?

26
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,380
How could you forget something
so important?

27
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,060
Maybe it's better that you don't.

28
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,220
I came here to tell you

29
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,940
that she suffered terribly
in the orphanage.

30
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,260
She died of illness.

31
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,140
Quite pitiful.

32
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,100
Mu Dai.

33
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,940
Luo Ren said Xiang Silan
needs time to recover.

34
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,460
So we'll take turns

35
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,940
watching over her during this period

36
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,340
to avoid any complications.

37
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,780
How fortunate she is

38
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,060
to have people take shifts
to care for her.

39
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,540
What's your next move?

40
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,860
What do you mean?

41
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,180
Well,

42
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,060
how do you plan to handle things
with your mother?

43
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,060
Are you staying here to live with her,

44
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,580
or taking her back to Lixi?

45
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,860
I came to settle things with her.

46
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,300
But she's your mother.

47
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,100
So?

48
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,100
Does that make her my responsibility?

49
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,780
When she abandoned me,

50
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,340
why didn't she consider me hers?

51
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,020
Mu Dai, that's not what I meant.

52
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,540
Mu Dai.

53
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,460
Mu Dai.

54
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,980
Hongsha is worried.

55
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,380
She thinks she offended you.

56
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,540
When you

57
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,180
asked Xiang Silan

58
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,820
whether she had abandoned a daughter

59
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,420
if she had shown even a hint of regret,

60
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,620
would you have felt a bit better?

61
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,860
I never had any expectations of her.

62
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,140
I'm pathetic, right?

63
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,780
The person I was so desperate to find

64
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,380
never cared about me.

65
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,060
What was the point of finding her?

66
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,260
Mu Dai, don't jump to conclusions.

67
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,260
The relic of ill omen
has only just left her body.

68
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,220
Her memories might still be fragmented.

69
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,060
There's something I haven't told you.

70
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,340
After I arrived in Nantian,

71
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,500
Huo Zihong kept calling

72
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,220
to ask about you.

73
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,620
And Mr. Zhang too.

74
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,780
They've always cared deeply for you.

75
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:24,700
Mu Dai,

76
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,660
some people may not share your blood,

77
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,020
but for twenty years,

78
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,180
she has done everything to learn

79
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,020
how to care for you like a mother.

80
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,140
The love you lost matters.

81
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,180
But you can't keep dwelling on it.

82
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,540
You have to believe
the heavens love you.

83
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,020
The flowers they withhold,

84
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,940
they make up for with stars.

85
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,300
Mu Dai,

86
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,020
I know the lost relationship is a pity.

87
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,380
But you can't keep dwelling on it.

88
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,780
Some people may not share your blood,

89
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,340
but for twenty years,

90
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,220
she has done everything to learn
how to be a mother.

91
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:26,940
Hey, Hongsha.

92
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,420
Hello?

93
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,940
Hongsha, say something.

94
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:33,740
Madam Hong.

95
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,420
Oh, Mu Dai.

96
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:37,900
It's me.

97
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:38,940
Mu Dai,

98
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,300
where are you?

99
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,380
How have you been?

100
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,700
Are you alright?

101
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,180
Are you hurt?

102
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,380
Is that why you called?

103
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,860
Why did it take you so long
to reach out?

104
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,740
Say something, Mu Dai.

105
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:52,820
Hello?

106
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:53,980
Madam Hong,

107
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,020
are you alright?

108
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,700
I'm fine.

109
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,900
Don't worry about me.

110
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,020
I am

111
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,340
doing great. Everything's great.

112
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,340
The bar's business

113
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,020
is thriving.

114
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,380
I'm just worried about you.

115
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,900
How are you?

116
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,820
Are you staying healthy?

117
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,700
Does the food there suit you?

118
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,260
Do you have enough money?

119
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,820
If not, just tell me.

120
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,260
I'm doing well too.

121
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,300
Don't worry too much about me.

122
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,620
I'm really reassured you're well.

123
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:31,860
Alright.

124
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,180
Alright.

125
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,460
That girl

126
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,500
who questioned me last time

127
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,820
is not here today?

128
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,220
Is she your girlfriend?

129
00:09:59,140 --> 00:09:59,780
Yes.

130
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,380
Last time, she asked

131
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,780
if I had

132
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,420
abandoned my daughter at an orphanage.

133
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,420
She said

134
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,060
my daughter died long ago.

135
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,580
Actually,

136
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,580
she's my daughter,

137
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,700
right?

138
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,140
Yes.

139
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,380
It's her.

140
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,580
Let's talk about you first.

141
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,340
Do you know

142
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,500
what's been inside you all these years?

143
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,300
Of course, it's something good.

144
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,620
Something good?

145
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,540
It treated me well.

146
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,380
It helped me do things

147
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,340
I never could before.

148
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:57,940
Like spreading rumors?

149
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,820
Lying?

150
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,940
What do you mean, lying?

151
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,620
People love to spout nonsense.

152
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,860
Like,

153
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,300
"You spat in the soup pot."

154
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,580
"You dripped blood into the stew."

155
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,260
They all lied.

156
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,620
Why not blame them for the harm?

157
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,660
Yet, you're putting all the blame on it.

158
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,220
Let me ask you something else.

159
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,780
Did you target us

160
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,340
because the relic of ill omen
didn't work on us?

161
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,740
Not entirely.

162
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,460
A man told me to do it.

163
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,580
A man?

164
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,220
He was...

165
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,620
I remembered him just now.

166
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,020
He told me...

167
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,060
What did he say?

168
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,180
He said

169
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,820
this game

170
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,580
wasn't for me alone.

171
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,060
Others were waiting their turn.

172
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,700
[Luo Ren]
What?

173
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:15,980
A game?

174
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,740
And others?

175
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,300
Tell me in detail.

176
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,900
Don't take it seriously.

177
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,180
Xiang Silan might've made it up

178
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,380
to mess with us after we caught her.

179
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:30,820
No.

180
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,060
That night, she said,

181
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,540
"With him gone,

182
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,940
the game just got more interesting."

183
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,980
This is getting stranger.

184
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,100
Anyway,

185
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,180
we need to stay sharp.

186
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,660
One more thing.

187
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,020
Mu Dai,

188
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:49,980
Xiang Silan

189
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,380
knows you're her daughter now.

190
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,060
She wants to see you alone.

191
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,660
I heard

192
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,340
a wealthy woman adopted you.

193
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,660
A businesswoman.

194
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,580
Look

195
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,860
at how I live.

196
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,820
I'm frail now.

197
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:07,700
Don't know if I can have some comfort

198
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,740
in my final days?

199
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,140
You abandoned me,

200
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,180
and now you expect filial piety?

201
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,380
But think

202
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,340
about your boyfriend,

203
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,820
and your rich adoptive mother.

204
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,940
If I hadn't abandoned you,

205
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,620
you'd never have had such opportunities.

206
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,100
Then I thank you for your selflessness.

207
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,220
Abandoned children

208
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,740
owe their birth parents nothing.

209
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,900
You'll get not a cent from me.

210
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,740
You have to give me money.

211
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,060
Why?

212
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,380
Because you're not my real child.

213
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:07,940
What?

214
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,500
I might as well

215
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,180
tell you the truth.

216
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,260
Actually,

217
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,420
you were a child I found.

218
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,020
Remember that old bridge?

219
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,020
One night on my way home,

220
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,900
I heard a child crying beneath it.

221
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,060
I went down

222
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,940
and found you there.

223
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,700
Just a towel wrapped around you.

224
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,980
If I hadn't taken you in,

225
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,660
you'd have frozen to death
under that bridge.

226
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,940
Had you really been that kind?

227
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,500
I don't do charity.

228
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,740
A single woman struggles

229
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,820
to get by.

230
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,900
I figured a child might earn me

231
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,100
some sympathy.

232
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,020
You were small then.

233
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,380
Easy to feed

234
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,060
with scraps.

235
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,740
Really?

236
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,300
Then why abandon me when I grew older?

237
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,580
I could work and I was obedient.

238
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,420
Wouldn't I have been more useful to you?

239
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,780
Why throw me away?

240
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,140
Well,

241
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,300
you started eating more.

242
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,340
Like a bottomless pit.

243
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,940
Impossible to fill.

244
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,620
Anyway,

245
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,260
I took you in,

246
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,660
raised you,

247
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,020
then gave you

248
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,940
to a better family.

249
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,260
Isn't

250
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,660
some compensation

251
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,500
fair?

252
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:42,980
Sounds like

253
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,420
she does owe you.

254
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,660
Mu Dai, go wait in the car.

255
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,580
I'll handle this.

256
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:55,740
We have

257
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,500
unfinished business.

258
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,500
Take the money and stay out of her life.

259
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,460
Let's go.

260
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,340
We won't

261
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,260
need to return.

262
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,700
Didn't she want money?

263
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,220
It's settled.

264
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,460
You paid her?

265
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,300
Don't worry. It's resolved.

266
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,580
She's satisfied.

267
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,500
And I didn't lose out.

268
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,660
She told me

269
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,180
I'm not her real child.

270
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,780
She found me under a bridge.

271
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,300
How do you feel?

272
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,060
Very

273
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,380
disappointed?

274
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,340
Well,

275
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,020
does anything

276
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,420
ever shock you?

277
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,980
How does one "be shocked"?

278
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,100
Show me.

279
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,740
I can't.

280
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,300
Strangely,

281
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,860
hearing that

282
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,860
actually made me happy.

283
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,660
Like a weight lifted.

284
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:46,980
As it should.

285
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,900
You should save your love

286
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,980
for those who deserve it.

287
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:52,860
Right?

288
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:05,860
Here, take this back.

289
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,620
Zhama's mom gave it to you.

290
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,700
It carries her blessings.

291
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:13,940
Whether to keep it

292
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,700
is your choice.

00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,260
Ma Chao woke up.

305
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,060
He admitted
that he had pushed Zhang Tong.

306
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:21,660
Everything's okay now.

307
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,940
Luo Ren told me.

308
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,460
Thank you for caring so much.

309
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,380
Luo Ren?

310
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,060
You two made up?

311
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,140
Hard to say.

312
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,340
We'll see.

313
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,580
Take this.

Lixi?

317
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,700
Come visit when you're free. I'll leave.

318
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:42,780
Mu.

319
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:45,900
You seem

320
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,940
different from when you first arrived.

321
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,060
Really?

322
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,620
How?

323
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,980
Can't pinpoint it.

324
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,260
But

325
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,180
I like it either way.

326
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,420
Fiery, have you seen my charger?

327
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,380
No.

328
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,100
You should've kept track of your stuff.

329
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,340
Where's my hat?

330
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,700
Packed yet?

331
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,180
Almost.

332
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,580
Madam Hong's throwing Mu Dai
a welcome-back tomorrow, right?

333
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,580
So we...

334
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,180
Madam Hong's planning a surprise.

335
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,060
Don't spoil it.

336
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,220
There are regrets and pains,

337
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,500
yet love persists,

338
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,180
both received and given.

339
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,060
It's actually not bad.

340
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,420
Maybe,

341
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,300
you won't need me anymore.

342
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,100
Good.

343
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,740
I've long wanted to

344
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,580
distance myself from your friends.

345
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,260
The more time I spent with them,
the more I became you.

346
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,260
I stopped being myself.

347
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,140
Get out!

348
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,380
You wretch, get lost!

349
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,300
Get out!

350
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,340
Out!

351
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:55,540
Out!

352
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,700
How dare you hit back?

353
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,460
Hit back?

354
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,740
Keep going, huh.

355
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:32,860
Don't hit my mom!

356
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,580
If you hit back...

357
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,660
Stop hitting my mom!

358
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,140
What are you staring at?

359
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,580
Mom!

360
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,500
How dare you hit back?

361
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:47,100
Stop hitting my mom!

362
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,820
Honey, I love you.

363
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,820
Really.

364
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,180
Come here.

365
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:57,740
Come on.

366
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:58,940
Give me a kiss.

367
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:59,700
I won't!

368
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,900
I'll give you money.

369
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,820
- Let me go!
- We made up already.

370
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,940
Let go of me! I won't!

371
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,540
You ungrateful little brat!

372
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,100
Embarrassing me like this!

373
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,820
No, she's just a child.

374
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:12,820
I'll kiss you instead.

375
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,340
Alright?

376
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:14,820
Okay.

377
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:15,380
Alright.

378
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,700
After eating, come with me somewhere.

379
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,580
Where are we going?

380
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,140
Someplace

381
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,580
with no bad guys.

382
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,260
Okay.

383
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:18,420
You know what this money is for?

384

It's to ensure you

385

386

Thanks for the hard work.

391
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:50,540
- Got it.
- Alright.

392
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,740
- Master.
- Take a look at this.

393
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,740
Is Luo being overly paranoid?

394
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,420
He turned this into a secret chamber.

395
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,260
He has his reasons.

396
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,740
We should try to understand.

397
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,460

Right?

400
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,460
Upgrading security against thieves

401
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,540
makes sense.

402
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:14,780
Fair point.

403
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,900
I thought Mu Dai would come.

404
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,860
Didn't expect you two.

405
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,100
So you still believe

406
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,380
Bright Mudai and Dark Mudai
are the same person.

Hello.

427
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,220
Mr. Kun, where are you?

428
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,540
At Xiagu Pass.

429
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,820
This place I'm heading to is crucial.

I have a hunch

433
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,260
that it's a major clue.

434
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,900
My dear friends,

435
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,700
I must

436
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,860
share this exciting moment

437
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,180
with you.

438
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:53,580
By the way,

439
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,140
what you told me last time

440
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:00,580
sparked a bold new theory.

441
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,660
You mean the case of Xiang Silan?

442
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,220
Yes.

443
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,460
Look,

444
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,900
the fact that he could order Xiang Silan

445
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:08,980
proves

446
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:13,500
he and the relic of ill omen
are of the same kind.

447
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,140
This led me to a deeper realization.

448
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,740
Do you think

449
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:21,260
there's a hierarchy among
the relics of ill omen?

450
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,380
After consideration, I believe

451
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:26,980
he ranks higher.

452
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,460
And he's smart.

453
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,940
So it's very likely that he could
organize a rescue.

454
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,420
Do you understand what I'm...?

455
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:44,980
Truly spectacular.

456
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,140

Of course, he's wasted.

466
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,500

after returning from Huacheng?

00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,020
I never thought

574
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,660
you'd have such a story to tell.

575
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:36,820
Come on.

576
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,060
Spill it.

577
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:40,660
But first, let's be clear.

578
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,140
Don't involve anything like murder
or stuff like that.

579
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,140
Relax.

580
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,940
I'd never dare
to do something like that.

581
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:46,660
I ran from an arranged marriage.

582
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:48,660
Ran from an arranged marriage?

583
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,100
[Sealed Lips]

584
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:51,940
So

585
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,540
the girl betrothed to Chubby

586
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,980
was named Cao Jinhua.

587
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,940
For as long as he could remember,

588
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,500
she'd been taller

589
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,460
and stronger than he.

590
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:03,220
Every childhood scuffle

591
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,660
ended with him pinned,

592
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,700
howling.

593
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,860
Yet Cao's father

594
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:12,540
just adored her.

595
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:15,300
He thought she was a strong laborer.

596
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,460
He arranged the marriage at the moment
they reached marriageable age.

597
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:21,140
On a bleak, drizzly day,

598
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,860
Chubby climbed onto his roof

599
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,620
and summoned the village.

600
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,460
After a fit of wailing and howling,

601
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,740
everyone gathered around.

602
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:32,500
He told them that he intended
to unilaterally nullify the engagement,

603
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:35,080
in order to denounce
how arranged marriages

604
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,120
would ruin himself, others,

605
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:36,860
his family, and even the whole village.

606
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:37,540
Get down!

607
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,340
Everyone!

608
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:45,100
I've gathered you today

609
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,420
to make an announcement!

610
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:50,420
The engagement between Cao Jinhua and me

611
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,540
is off!

612
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:53,860
Get him down!

613
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,340
Arranged marriages

614
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:58,980
destroy family, village and society!

615
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,980
Mr. Cao, what's this about?

616
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:04,380
I reject feudal marital tyranny!

617
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,620
Easy there, buddy.

618
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,980
I'll get him down now.

619
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,180
Stop calling me that!

620
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,300
Calm down.

621
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,620
Pudgy!

622
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,500
Well done.

623
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:19,700
My disciple indeed.

624
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:22,180
After my earnest counsel,

625
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:24,340
Cao finally let go of his inner burdens

626
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,980
and decided to return home.

627
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,820
How will Mr. Cao react

628
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,700
to his portly prodigal son?

629
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,540
Will Cao rekindle things with Cao Jinhua

630
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,860
after all these years?

631
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:37,740
Tune in next time.

632
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,260
Mr. Ma visits
the Stargazing Platform every day.

633
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,580
Ask him if you need anything.

634
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:49,900
Mr. Yin.

635
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:57,860
Mr. Yin?

636
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,140
Mr. Yin?

637
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:12,940
Mr. Yin?

638
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,580
Mr. Yin!

639
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:27,780
Who are you looking for?

640
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,340
Mr. Yin,

641
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,420
allow me to introduce myself properly.

642
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,740
I'm Shen Mukun.

643
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,780
You can call me Mighty Kun.

644
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,220
Yin Village

645
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,860
is indispensable
for studying Xiagu Pass culture.

646
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:47,620
When the Great Virtuous One
went west beyond Yumen Pass...

647
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,540
Wait, why did I say Yumen Pass?

648
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,020
Bo Yangzi, the Great Virtuous One,

649
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,980
went west beyond Xiagu Pass
to live in seclusion.

650
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,140
He passed by Yin Village

651
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,100
and left behind a stone.

652
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,020
Have a seat.

653
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,580
Thank you.

654
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,300
Yes.

655
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,420
That stone

656
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,340
is the Stargazing Platform.

657
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,580
Ordinary people mistake it

658
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,940
for just a rock.

659
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,380
They don't grasp its mysteries.

660
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,820
Tragic, really.

661
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,180
So

662
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,260
you know its secrets.

663
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,740
A little about it.

664
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,300
Yin,

665
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,820
is the Stargazing Platform connected
to the relic of ill omen?

666
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:11,980
Thank you.

667
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,420
So, Mr. Shen,

668
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,580
you know
about the seven relics of ill omen.

669
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,420
There are seven?
