[Episode 32]

5
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,180
Stop crying!

6
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,220
That's all you ever do!

7
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,540
Medicine and rope-jumping
failed to rid me of you!

8
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,460
What are you crying about now?

9
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:39,900
You're driving me mad!

10
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:51,620
Mom.

11
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,140
Mom.

12
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,620
Mom, I'm hungry.

13
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,620
Are you a bottomless pit?

14
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,380
You just ate lunch!

15
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,100
But I'm still hungry.

16
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,020
Hungry, are you?

17
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,580
Hungry, huh?

18
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,420
Look over there.

19
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,180
Stand over there.
That'll cure your hunger.

20
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,140
Go now!

21
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,500
What a deadweight.

22
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,780
Tighten my pants.

23
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,020
Tighten my waist so I won't feel hungry.

24
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,180
Won't feel hungry.

25
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,500
But I'm still hungry.

26
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,340
So you are Xiang Silan's daughter.

27
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,900
And your mom really finds you annoying.

28
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,020
Get lost!

29
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,820
My apologies.

30
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,060
It's coming back to me now.

31
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,700
Luo Ren even paid good money
to make Xiang Silan

32
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,460
stop coming after you.

33
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,820
Pathetic.

34
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,700
Shut your mouth!

35
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,540
I'm showing concern for you.

36
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,820
You never wanted this life.

37
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,900
Why won't you admit it?

38
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,460
Just say the word,

39
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,620
and I'll rewrite it for you.

40
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,620
Remember?

41
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,220
Your story can be rewritten as you wish.

42
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,460
There's actually another little girl.

43
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,740
Would you like to see her?

44
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,260
She's unwell. Resting now.

45
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,460
Let's not.

46
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,020
It depends on fate.

47
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,820
Maybe it's just not the right time yet.

48
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:38,740
Sweetheart,

49
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,540
why are you out here?

50
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,860
You're not even dressed properly.

51
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,180
You really should learn
from your younger self.

52
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,900
Opportunities have to be
seized by yourself.

53
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,380
Here's your chocolate, little bear.

54
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,660
Here's your chocolate.

55
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,500
If you won't eat it, I will.

56
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,180
Mu Dai.

57
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,220
Is it good?

58
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,260
Yes.

59
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:14,980
We should go now.

60
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:15,900
Where to?

61
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,700
I'm taking you to kindergarten.

62
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,260
To kindergarten!

63
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:19,660
Come on.

64
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,180
Bye, little bear.

65
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,140
Put on your backpack.

66
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,420
Mu Dai

67
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,020
is the prettiest girl.

68
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,660
The prettiest!

69
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:29,620
Let's go.

70
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:30,700
Go.

71
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,580
What's wrong?

72
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,820
Don't eat too much candy.

73
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:37,900
You'll get cavities.

74
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,620
Look.

75
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,220
One right choice

76
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,580
can make life so beautiful.

77
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,820
You must seize

78
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,260
the next opportunity.

79
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,100
Wen.

80
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,380
Go to heck!

81
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,020
Kill her!

82
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:33,780
Kill her!

83
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,740
I know you often revisit this memory.

84
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,900
But no matter how much you dwell on it,

85
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,300
back then,

86
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,060
you had already fallen.

87
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,620
It's all just imagination.

88
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:47,140
Now you see it clearly.

89
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,340
She was terrified.

90
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,620
She was so weak.

91
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,980
Yet she came back

92
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,180
to save you.

93
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,100
If it weren't for you,

94
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,740
she would still be alive.

95
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,500
Can you really bear to do nothing?

96
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,580
Won't you act?

97
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,220
She's dying.

98
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,260
If you don't do something now,

99
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,900
she'll die.

100
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,380
She'll die.

101
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,980
What is going on here?

102
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,700
That's more like it.

103
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,900
[Shen Wen]
Let's go to the movies tomorrow night.

104
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,100
Meet me at our usual spot.

105
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,660
[Mu Dai]
Sure.

106
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,340
Mr. Zhang, you're busy?

107
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,140
Make a "Sunset Boulevard" cocktail.

108
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,020
The customer is waiting.

109
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,180
Get Thirteen-Thousand to do it.

110
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,460
Who's Thirteen-Thousand?

111
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,060
Right.

112
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,620
Who is Thirteen-Thousand?

113
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,100
Whatever.

114
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,900
Madam Hong, are you going out?

115
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,300
Got some business in Wujiang.

116
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,420
Let me go instead.

117
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,340
Haven't you been feeling unwell?

118
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,420
Oh, you silly girl.

119
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,940
You're not up to demanding tasks.

120
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,740
I can't trust you to go out alone.

121
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,140
You're underestimating me.

122
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,780
I'm a disciple of Meihua Jiuniang.

123
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,020
Who's Meihua Jiuniang?

124
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,580
Yeah.

125
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,820
Who's Meihua Jiuniang?

126
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,380
She is important.

127
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,420
It is really beautiful.

128
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,460
The scenery is so lovely.

129
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,340
Look over there.

130
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,020
Let me take a photo of you.

131
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:55,660
Sure.

132
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,060
You want to take a photo?

133
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,060
I'll hold you.

134
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,980
I dare not look down.

135
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,820
Let's take a group photo.

136
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,580
Look.

137
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,740
There's someone important
across the way.

138
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,540
Very important. Who was it again?

139
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,300
Who was it?

140
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,300
So pretty.

141
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,620
Yeah.

142
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,700
Who was it?

143
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,380
This is where it all began.

144
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,700
Ren!

145
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,620
Save your breath.

146
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,380
You won't meet them again.

147
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:06,900
Who are you?

148
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,860
I am you.

149
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,380
Impossible.

150
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,820
I take

151
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,380
this cable car every day.

152
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,900
I've been waiting here for decades,

153
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,380
but I've never seen

154
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,940
Chubby or Ren again.

155
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,860
They've chosen different lives.

156
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,500
Our paths no longer cross,

157
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,820
and we'll never meet again.

158
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,380
I don't believe it.

159
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,660
Why bother?

160
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,820
You have a happy life now.

161
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,220
Would you really give that up?

162
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,020
They've already abandoned you.

163
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,620
You should forget them too.

164
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,500
Lady Dai.

165
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,260
Master.

166
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,460
Mu Dai.

167
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,140
Kill all demonic blocks.

168
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,140
Let's go take our chances.

169
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,140
I have to find them.

170
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,820
They're the most important people to me.

171
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,140
I can't forget them.

172
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,780
Willpower paves the way.

173
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,500
Ren,

174
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,700
Hongsha, Chubby, Thirteen-Thousand,

175
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,140
I will find you all.

176
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,460
Luo Ren!

177
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,260
Hongsha!

178
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,420
Thirteen-Thousand!

179
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,020
Chubby!

180
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,180
I didn't expect you
to break free so soon.

181
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,140
But then again, it's not surprising.

182
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,740
Among the five of you,

183
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,420
you weren't the one
with the heaviest burdens.

184
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,340
Where is this place?

185
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,860
Familiar, isn't it?

186
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,380
Doesn't it resemble
the Guansi Memorial Archway?

187
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,300
I call it

188
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,740
Guansi Mirage.

189
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,900
Just like a mirage,

190
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,100
it's an illusion, a fantasy.

191
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,900
If it weren't for the desires

192
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,700
lurking in the hearts of you humans,

193
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,500
the illusion

194
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:31,780
wouldn't exist.

195
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,500
The illusion is just the demon
in your heart.

196
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,020
Kill all demonic blocks.
I'll just go take my chances.

197
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,700
Just go take your chances?

198
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,220
Then how did Meihua Yizhao

199
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,660
and the others die?

200
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,540
They entered the illusion?

201
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,740
My battle with Bo Yangzi

202
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,660
left me gravely weakened.

203
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,860
For centuries,

204
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,220
I've failed to regain enough energy

205
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,700
to restart the illusion.

206
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,300
But 280 years ago,

207
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,860
I thought I could manage.

208
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,780
As they were sealing
the relics of ill omen,

209
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,380
I exerted all my power to pry it open,

210
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:14,740
yet

211
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,220
still failed.

212
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,140
The illusion developed flaws.

213
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:22,980
Flaws?

214
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,180
Yes.

215
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,420
What you'd now call "bugs".

216
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,380
Occasionally,

217
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:32,060
they'd return to reality.

218
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,380
Return to reality?

219
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,860
Then why did they take their own lives?

220
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,620
They didn't want you
to extract the connectors, right?

221
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,220
We were wrong from the start.

222
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,140
They weren't performing a death ritual.

223
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,420
The connectors exist within the mind,

224
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,500
tied to consciousness.

225
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,580
And consciousness
is dependent on the body.

226
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,500
Destroy the body,

227
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,100
and consciousness vanishes.

228
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,620
So does the connector.

229
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,060
I get it now.

230
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,060
In your world,

231
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,500
we exist as consciousness.

232
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,940
Consciousness is built from choices.

233
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,260
Once choices deviate,

234
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,260
the original self begins to dissolve.

235
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,780
The more it dissolves,

236
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,380
the easier it is to extract
the connectors, right?

237
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,100
Rewrite the story?

238
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,340
Your so-called ritual

239
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,220
is just to make us lose ourselves

240
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,580
and dissolve in the illusion, isn't it?

241
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,900
So what if it is?

242
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,420
Life is but a dream.

243
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:26,660
A dream.

244
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,740
Just like the illusion.

245
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,020
I offered them the lives they desired.

246
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,220
They could have had anything,

247
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,300
yet they chose to die.

248
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,820
Lunatics, all of them!

249
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,460
They ruined everything

250
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,780
for me.

251
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,780
That's because you don't understand.

252
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,060
You don't know what it means
to be human.

253
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,300
You seem wise.

254
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,700
But you won't be

255
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,700
as lucky as Meihua Yizhao.

256
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,380
This illusion

257
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:01,220
is flawless and impregnable.

258
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,220
But I managed to escape.

259
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,980
Yes, you did escape.

260
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,780
But this is as far as you go.

261
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,700
Time and space here

262
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,420
are frozen.

263
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,420
Your friends are already gone.

264
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,020
And you?

265
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,620
You'll wander here forever,

266
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,420
eternally alone.

267
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,300
Why not go back?

268
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,580
Return to your happy past.

269
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,060
That passage is always open to you.

270
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,380
My friends may be lost for now,

271
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,220
but they won't stay that way forever.

272
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,540
I'll drag them back if I have to.

273
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,940
Just you?

274
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,700
Don't waste your effort.

275
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,980
You can't interfere
with the fate of others.

276
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,540
Kill all demonic blocks.

277
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,820
I fear not taking my chances again!

278
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,900
I know you're close,

279
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,260
but this is ridiculous.

280
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,700
Are you trying to merge into one?

281
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,460
Merge?

282
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,380
Seven-Star Unity?

283
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,100
Will you guys merge into one too?

284
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,700
Oh no, my gosh.

285
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,700
I'm a dead man today.

286
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,700
And there's no one to lend a hand!

287
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,220
Free Cao!

288
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,060
Aren't you a descendant of the phoenix?

289
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,820
Unleash your ultimate move!

290
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,740
Don't push me.

291
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,020
Don't push me! Don't!

292
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,380
This isn't an illusion for me.

293
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,740
The illusion is rejecting me.

294
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,380
Do you like it?

295
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,460
Yes.

296
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,580
Luo Ren!

297
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,500
We won!

298
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,740
Yes!

299
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,140
Cheers.

300
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:34,860
Tasha,

301
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,340
pour us a drink.

302
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,100
Who said you could order Tasha around?

303
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,900
I took down Leopard

304
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,220
and risked my life to save Tasha.

305
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,620
Can't I ask her for a little help?

306
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,100
Come on, Tasha.

307
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:49,740
You're being so stingy.

308
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,980
Have an arm-wrestling match with Yuris.

309
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,340
- Come on.
- Tasha.

310
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:53,620
Luo Ren!

311
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:54,980
Tasha.

312
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:59,020
- Tasha!
- Tasha!

313
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:09,580
- Tasha!
- Tasha!

314
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:22,100
- Tasha!
- Tasha!

315
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:22,900
Ren.

316
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,220
- Tasha!
- Tasha!

317
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,740
I don't think
I've ever seen you this happy

318
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,540
in all the time I've known you.

319
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,540
I know

320
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,220
brotherhood is your heaviest burden.

321
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,980
But everything here isn't real.

322
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:44,940
Luo,

323
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:46,940
I always feel like

324
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,260
you should find Tasha

325
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:51,980
a godmother.

326
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,700
Here we go again.

327
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,420
Ren.

328
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,540
What's wrong?

329
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:04,460
Nothing.

330
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,540
I think I heard

331
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,180
someones call me Ren just now.

332
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,340
Are you insane?

333
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,660
Ren?

334
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:13,660
Wasn't that
what your cousin Pingting called you?

335
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:15,820
I have no idea.

336
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,020
But it feels like

337
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,140
someone else called me that too.

338
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,060
It doesn't matter.

339
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,220
I understand now.

340
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,180
The illusion can be influenced.

341
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,580
The more he remembers reality,

342
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,980
the more unstable the illusion becomes.

343
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,660
And that's when I'll have a chance.

344
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,940
Dad, help me!

345
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,300
Be gentle with her.

346
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,500
Don't hurt her.

347
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,540
Ren,

348
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,340
do you remember Hongsha, Chubby,

349
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,300
and Thirteen-Thousand?

350
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,780
And Destiny Bar?

351
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:45,380
And...

352
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,020
And Phoenix Pavilion.

353
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,460
Mu Dai.

354
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,460
Mu Dai?

355
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:47,780
Who's that?

356
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,540
Dad, help me!

357
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,500
Yuris,

358
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,700
though none of this

359
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:12,980
is real,

360
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,340
getting to see you all again...

361
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,660
It made me so happy.

362
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,220
We've been here all along.

363
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,020
I thought you'd never come back.

364
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,300
Master! Luo!

365
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,380
Don't leave me out. I'm joining you!

366
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,220
You...

367
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,380
Hey, you...

368
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,700
I just saw Zhang Guanghua.

369
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,060
He kept rambling about choices,

370
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,780
rituals,

371
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,180
this and that.

372
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,700
Basically just sugarcoated lies.

373
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,500
He tried to tempt us
with a little sweetness

374
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,660
to make us lose ourselves.

375
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,340
But I held on.

376
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,420
Not sure how Hongsha
and Thirteen-Thousand are doing.

377
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:54,260
You all carry too much burden

378
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,980
and too many regrets.

379
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,420
That makes you easy prey.

380
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,620
Not like me.

381
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,900
I'm easygoing and carefree.

382
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,940
Never faced real hardship.

383
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,340
Life's always been on easy mode for me.

384
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:05,580
I'm most worried

385
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,300
about Thirteen-Thousand now.

386
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,260
He probably has the heaviest burdens.

387
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,180
Hongsha should be fine though.

388
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,020
Back in Cao Village,

389
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,900
she was the most level-headed.

390
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,340
No idea why she hasn't broken free yet.

391
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,420
Stop analyzing.

392
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,340
Let's just go find them.

393
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,060
Let's go.

394
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,340
Zhao,

395
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,460
you must have a lot of socializing
to do at the art exhibition.

396
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,580
Is it okay for you
to keep chatting with us?

397
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,540
Don't worry, Mom.

398
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,660
I am the star now.

399
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,980
[Jiang Zhao]
They'll wait for me.

400
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,380
Who'd have thought

401
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,060
you from Wuzhu Village

402
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,220
would become a famous artist?

403
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,100
Oh,

404
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,220
Chief just called,

405
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,980
saying there's
a huge pearl harvest this year.

406
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,020
He wants you to paint something

407
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,100
to bring honor to our village.

408
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,180
Sure, no problem.

409
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,220
Mr. Jiang,

410
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:52,980
the press is all here.

411
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,700
They're waiting for you.

412
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,140
Alright.

413
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,140
Let the boy go in now.

414
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,260
Don't want people
to say we're putting on airs.

415
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,700
That's right.

416
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,100
We'll hang up now.

417
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,140
Alright, Mom.

418
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:05,940
I'll call you again.

419
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,300
Bye.

420
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:17,100
-Mr. Jiang Zhao.
-Mr. Jiang Zhao.

421
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:17,940
- Smile, please.
- Look this way.

422
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,220
We heard you have unpublished works.

423
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,140
When will we get to see them?

424
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:20,940
Mr. Jiang Zhao,

425
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,620
we know you're currently single.

426
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,140
As the most eligible bachelor right now,

427
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,700
what do you look for in a partner?

428
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,620
Mr. Jiang Zhao,

429
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,420
the theme of the paintings is "Pearl".

430
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,100
Why is that?

431
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,580
The inspiration

432
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,220
comes from my hometown.

433
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,260
- It's a small village
- Thirteen-Thousand!

434
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,740
that relies on pearl fishing.

435
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,460
Thirteen-Thousand!

436
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,780
No matter where I am,

437
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,660
it remains my idyllic retreat

438
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:40,900
and my guiding light.

439
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,620
Mr. Jiang Zhao,

440
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,860
you mentioned that you'd create works

441
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,060
closer to life.

442
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,220
But we haven't seen any yet.

443
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:45,780
When will we get to see them?

444
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,620
Thirteen-Thousand.

445
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,020
Thirteen-Thousand!

446
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,020
It's me!

447
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,420
Mr. Jiang Zhao.

448
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,380
Right.

449
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,580
No idea.

450
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,740
-Mr. Jiang Zhao.
-Mr. Jiang Zhao.

451
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,580
Please answer the question.

452
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,900
Yes, please answer, Mr. Jiang Zhao.

453
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,620
- Over here.
- Over here.

454
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,100
Mr. Jiang Zhao.

455
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,500
-Mr. Jiang Zhao!
-Mr. Jiang Zhao!

456
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,700
Please answer our questions, Mr. Jiang.

457
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,540
-Mr. Jiang Zhao!
-Mr. Jiang Zhao.

458
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,540
Art knows no bounds.

459
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,860
Observe the world outwardly.

460
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,220
Listen

461
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:22,940
to yourself inwardly.

462
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:25,260
Seriously? Flirting at a time like this?

463
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,140
Some habits never die.

464
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,140
Hongsha!

465
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:31,940
You're here.

466
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,900
What do we do? He's still trapped.

467
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,860
Seems you have
quite the artistic insight.

468
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:41,100
The highest level
of understanding an artist

469
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,140
is when you're looking at the painting,

470
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:44,980
while I'm looking at you.

471
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,380
Unbelievable!

472
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,300
Your standards for a girlfriend

473
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,220
- must be strict.
- You're the last one left,

474
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,020
you hopeless idiot!

475
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:51,500
Wake up.

476
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,140
What I care about is the soul.

477
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:52,740
Wake up!

478
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,220
Then

479
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,180
would I be your type?

480
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:58,820
No!

481
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,500
Let go!

482
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,300
Well, that depends on what your soul

483
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,100
- Turn your face away.
- is like.

484
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,340
Thirteen-Thousand!

485
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,300
You hopeless idiot!

486
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,500
With all the dreams
you could get lost in,

487
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,700
you're indulging in this art nonsense?

488
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,100
You know how amazing my dream was?

489
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,420
And I still walked away.

490
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,100
What's so special about this dump

491
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,260
that you can't wake up?

492
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,060
Wake up!

493
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:27,700
Master,

494
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,940
I can't wake him up. What now?

495
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,260
We need to come up with a solution.

496
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,540

I worry whether you stay still

512
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,340
or move around.

513
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,660
When will this end?

514
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,500
Just lie still, alright?

515
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,460

Without you,

521
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,460
I'd have frozen to death by now.

522
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:32,980
Thank you.

523
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,020
Free,

524
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,260
did you call all your siblings

525
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,340
from the mountains here?

526
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,740
Now we're all saved.

527
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,820
Otherwise, we'd be frozen to death.

528
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:03,060
Last night's snowstorm
felt like the apocalypse.

529

537
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,780
It's the first time for me too.

00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,420
Let's go back to where we started.

758
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,420
How about Wujiang?

759
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,460
Perfect.

760
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,580
I've never been to Wujiang.

761
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,180
- That's our base.
- Great chance to visit.

762
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:28,740
Say my name. I've got connections.

763
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,300
You've never been there.
Great chance to visit.

764
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:33,060
If someone can cover for me
with Mr. Zhang,

765
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:33,700
I'm in too.

766
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:34,660
Suppress them.

767
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:35,380
You're not coming.

768
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:35,900
I'll cover for you.

769
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,100
You can have my pay.

770
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,580
Where did you get the money?

771
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:39,740
Are you guys excluding me?

772
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:41,740
I'm in charge of the money.

00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,940

775
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,460
Mr. Kun.

776
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,180
Let's take a group photo.

777
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,060
The last group photo was creepy.

778
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,300
This time, let's make it cheerful.

779
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:52,900
Here we go.

780
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,020
- Move away.
- Move away.

781
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,060
Hurry. Ten-second countdown.

782
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,740

00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,980
You're holding her. Who do I hold?

785
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,020
