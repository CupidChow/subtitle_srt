00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,360
   

4
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,100
   

5
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,080
   

6
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:49,360
 In ancient times, a meteorite from the sky brought a terrifying, mysterious power 

7
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,580
 that plagued mankind everywhere. 

8
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,920
 It's said that the Great Virtuous One, Bo Yang Zi came out from Xiagu Pass 

9
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,220
 and sealed it eventually, preventing it from doing evil again. 

10
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,500
 It is also said that the seal was only temporary  

11
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:08,500
 and it had been looking for an escape restlessly. 

12
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:17,140
 The story begins on a winter night at Luoma Lake 22 years ago. 

13
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,220
Are you blind?

14
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,980
Ya Qing, get me a pot of hot water.

15
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,920
Okay, coming.

16
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,320
   

17
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,260
   

18
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:21,740
   

19
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,020
Hello?

20
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,894
 Is this Ms. Huo Zi Hong? 

21
00:04:43,894 --> 00:04:45,360
Yes.

22
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,740
 There's news about the Luoma Lake case that you're investigating. 

23
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:32,500
   

24
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,860
- Quickly. 
 - Good thing that I took days off!

25
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,160
Shoot that side! Look!

26
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,760
- They fly too fast. 
 - Did you get the focus right?

27
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,760
- It's clear. 
 - Let me do it.

28
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,340
Auntie Hong. You finally called me.

29
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,200
Is there progress on that matter?

30
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,440
 It's just settled. 

31
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,740
 At 2:00 p.m. today. 

32
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,280
 Show the token when you arrive. Someone will lead you. 

33
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,740
The person's name is Wan Feng Huo.

34
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,760
He has been selling information for some decades.

35
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,500
 When you get there, don't talk too much. Just listen, all right? 

36
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,960
Don't worry, I know the rules better than you.

37
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,000
Right.

38
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,880
You are Mu Dai, who learned martial arts for eight years.

39
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,240
 Later, I'll send you the location. 

40
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,540
Be safe out there by yourself.

41
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,620
 Okay, Auntie Hong. 

42
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,120
Talk to you later.

43
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,380
Miss. Why are you holding my hand?

44
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,200
Let go.

45
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,680
I said let go.

46
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,320
You're holding my stuff.

47
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,780
I'm keeping it safe for you.

48
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,752
I'll put it back for you...

49
00:07:10,752 --> 00:07:12,700
Do it.

50
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,080
Let go of me.

51
00:07:19,276 --> 00:07:20,320
Wait.

52
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,260
You... You got the wrong direction.

53
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:26,980
You should be heading that way and going to the north bank.

54
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,540
- No... 
 - So, I have to go back?

55
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,910
Right...

56
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,780
Please let go of me.

57
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:40,400
You've got quite a grip.

58
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,120
I have to go back...

59
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,380
Come early next time.

60
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,880
Got it.

61
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,340
   

62
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,400
- Let's see a movie later. 
 - Okay.

63
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,980
- I just finished eating. Don't rush. 
 - 10 minutes to go.

64
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,280
Welcome.

65
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,740
It's tasty.

66
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,440
Our guest is here. This way, please.

67
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,380
 Electromagnetic energy is hitting a new high today. 

68
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,540
 Communications, electricity, and other related fields may be affected. 

69
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,940
How should I describe our industry?

70
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,160
I'll take this hairpin as an example.

71
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,540
There are two people.

72
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:39,640
One of them asks me for a phoenix hairpin made of old silver,

73
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:45,380
while the other one wants a phoenix hairpin with ruby eyes.

74
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,400
But I don't have any hairpins.

75
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,020
Until one day,

76
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,540
someone comes to me with this.

77
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,420
See? Now we have a buyer and a seller.

78
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,320
And everything falls into place, doesn't it?

79
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:03,160
As for me, I'm the one who sells information about this hairpin.

80
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,140
Just cut to the chase.

81
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,540
I came all the way here.

82
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,300
I don't have time for your tales.

83
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,160
Mr. Li, please be patient.

84
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,000
I've got tons of information this time.

85
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,300
You'll get more than your money's worth.

86
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,580
This must be worth it.

87
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,220
Mr. Ma.

88
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,540
Are you Ms. Huo?

89
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:32,000
She is my adoptive mother. My name is Mu Dai.

90
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,660
Miss Mu. I hope you don't mind.

91
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,200
Please sit down.

92
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,820
 Let me introduce you. 

93
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,100
 This is Mr. Li Tan. 

94
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,660
 This is Mr. Ma Tu Wen. 

95
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:49,880
I have a little rule here.

96
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,340
To protect the privacy of the informant,

97
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:56,780
no photography, video recording, or audio recording is permitted in this space.

98
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:00,520
Also, the signal in this room will be blocked later.

99
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,580
Your mobile phones will be kept well by us.

100
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,420
Brother, he'll take our phones and block the signal.

101
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,920
 Do as he says.  
    

102
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,880
Everybody. Now it's blocked.

103
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,160
 Enough talk. 

104
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,860
Let's get to the point.

105
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,220
Let me introduce her.

106
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:08,420
This is Cen Chu Jiao, the information provider this time.

107
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,260
 All of you have paid your deposits. 

108
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:14,740
 When she's done, you'll decide whether to pay the balance. 

109
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,260
You can question the veracity of her words.

110
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:22,860
If there's any doubt, we'll follow the old rules and vote.

111
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,240
The minority obeys the majority.

112
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,880
If more than half of you think the information is valuable and useful,

113
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,220
well, then you guys will pay.

114
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,860
So...

115
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,480
let's begin.

116
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:46,940
The murderer of these fishing-line murders was called Liu Shu Hai.

117
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,220
He died five years ago.

118
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,460
More than one murder?

119
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,620
Died five years ago?

120
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,820
Yes. Five years ago.

121
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,280
At that time,

122
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:03,140
I was a waitress in a hotel of the Xijiao Bus Terminal in Jiquan.

123
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:07,820
It was the kind of low-end little hotel where they rarely changed the covers,

124
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:11,780
and there were all kinds of guests from all walks of life.

125
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,400
 I was on the night shift that day. 

126
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,620
 Hello? 

127
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,840
 Is this the front desk? 

128
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,140
 I need a pot of hot water in 203. 

129
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,540
 Okay. 

130
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,430
   

131
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:22,280
 Mr. Liu. Mr. Liu. 

132
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:35,300
 I'll never forget what I saw when I got into the room. 

133
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:51,660
 Mr. Liu... The hot water is here. 

134
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,020
 I'll put it here for you. 

135
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,940
 Mr. Liu, let me help you. 

136
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,000
 Are you all right... 

137
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,540
 Are you okay? 

138
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,160
 Mr. Liu. 

139
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,240
 Mr. Liu? Mr. Liu? 

140
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,200
 Open the door! Someone! 

141
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,820
 On 20 January, Luoma Lake, 

142
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:06,800
 Room 501, 25 Shuguang Street, three people were killed. 

143
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,040
 Li Jian Li, male, 59 years old. 

144
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,440
 Yu Xiu Ying, female, 55 years old. 

145
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,600
 Li Ya Qing, female, 23 years old. 

146
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,320
 Help! 

147
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,960
Why did he speak in that way?

148
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,240
Who did he kill?

149
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,060
How did he kill them?

150
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,420
Why did he kill them?

151
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,500
And he spoke as if he were making a report.

152
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,600
It was particularly terrifying.

153
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,160
 How many cases did he tell? 

154
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,480
 Two. 

155
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,920
 Luoma Lake was the first case. 

156
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,540
And what about the second one?

157
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:47,340
Mister, there is a price for each case.

158
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:50,080
I-I'm sure you understand.

159
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,060
But he was a murderer.

160
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,620
And he used fishing lines.

161
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,760
And what happened next?

162
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,900
His body was there.

163
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,720
He indeed died.

164
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,300
But on his back,

165
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,110
someone cut off a large piece of skin.

166
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,000
 - Let's call the police. 
 - Wait... Wait. 

167
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,160
 - The manager has called the police. 
 - Has someone called the police? 

168
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,780
 This man is quite young. 

169
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,740
 He shed so much blood. 

170
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,560
His skin was cut off?

171
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,760
Someone came in after you ran out?

172
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,560
No one came in.

173
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,560
And that hallway was a dead end.

174
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,840
I was standing there and didn't see anyone coming in or out.

175
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,940
 So, why did you say the skin was cut off by someone? 

176
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,992
Because the edges of the wound were particularly smooth.

177
00:16:42,992 --> 00:16:45,500
It must have been done by hand with a sharp object.

178
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,620
Sharp object?

179
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,360
My gosh.

180
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,400
Lady, do you even believe the nonsense you said?

181
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,880
It would be convincing if you had just said that he died.

182
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,120
But the piece of skin...

183
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,480
Who would want that from a dead person?

184
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,980
But a piece of human skin was indeed cut off.

185
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,080
- You can just investigate whether it is true or not! 
 - You...

186
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,500
We called the police right away.

187
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,320
And every bystander in the corridor knew about it.

188
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,140
Wonderful.

189
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,420
You made up such a convincing story.

190
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:21,380
You must have made a great effort.

191
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:25,000
Mr. Wan. You should be honest in business.

192
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,380
It's no shame that you can't get true information.

193
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,920
But making up lies to cheat people out of money is disgraceful.

194
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,000
Wait, Mister. What do you mean?

195
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,780
I didn't make up nonsense. I was telling the truth.

196
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,200
I didn't say it was fake.

197
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,160
Maybe at the time, someone did die in the little hotel.

198
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,280
Maybe the dead man was skinned.

199
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,140
But he had nothing to do with the Luoma Lake case 22 years ago.

200
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:55,320
Liu Shu Hai was not the murderer of the Luoma Lake case!

201
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,040
Liu Shu Hai was a murderer!

202
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,960
- Liar. 
 - I... didn't lie.

203
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,240
Liar!

204
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,240
You don't have to buy my clues.

205
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,560
Mr. Wan.

206
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,460
My clues are true.

207
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,780
You don't have to buy them.

208
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:11,840
Mr. Wan. I spent money on finding out the murderer of the Luoma Lake case.

209
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,120
No matter how much weirder the other cases are, I'm not interested.

210
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,920
We are all buyers.

211
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,720
I want information.

212
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,580
I only want real information!

213
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:27,560
I won't give a penny for fake information.

214
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,560
What do you think?

215
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,940
Hello, Sir.

216
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,740
Hello.

217
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:42,480
 Brother Luo, what do you think of this? 

218
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,400
Just pay.

219
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,800
 Okay. 

220
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,160
That's the whole thing.

221
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,580
Among those who came, both myself and a guy surnamed Ma are agents.

222
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,140
That guy seems dumb.

223
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,640
I can't tell anything.

224
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,780
But there is one named Li Tan who insisted that the information was fake.

225
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,000
Auntie Hong. What do you think?

226
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,740
As far as I know, I also felt something was off about Cen Chu Jiao.

227
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,500
Is it fake?

228
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,640
So, I sat there for so long just to listen to her made-up story?

229
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,920
 But Auntie Hong, how do you know it's fake? 

230
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,020
Didn't I tell you?

231
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:21,320
Professor Li was my mentor.

232
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:25,380
I've always had his family's case on my mind,

233
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,940
not just through Wan Feng Huo.

234
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,700
 Then, should we pay or not? 

235
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,840
We'll pay.

236
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,000
Mr. Wan has been investigating for so many years.

237
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,360
We should at least pay for his hard work.

238
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,560
 All right. 

239
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,220
 Auntie Hong. You're so nice. 

240
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:46,560
Besides, I don't want him to know that I also entrusted someone else.

241
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,200
 That Mr. Li you just mentioned seems to know a lot about what happened back then. 

242
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,380
 Get in touch with him more and see what he knows. 

243
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:56,520
Okay. I see what you mean.

244
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,800
I'll hang up now, Aunite Hong.

245
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:06,000
 There are other fishing-line murders? 

246
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,280
 You devil. 

247
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,540
 Die! 

248
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,060
 He fell from such a height. 

249
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:24,161
 How could he have survived? 

250
00:20:24,161 --> 00:20:25,881
Mr. Li.

251
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,741
I'm sorry.

252
00:20:27,741 --> 00:20:31,161
Two to one.

253
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,160
Wan Feng Huo.

254
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:48,080
If your information was real, I could even give you my life.

255
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,500
You'll be guilty of taking my money.

256
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,720
It's not worth it.

257
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,000
Mr. Li, please stay.

258
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,400
I booked rooms in Bashu Mansion for all attendees today.

259
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,140
I'll distribute some documents later today.

260
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:08,160
Don't forget to pick it up...

261
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,160
Mr. Wan, then I'll leave too.

262
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,180
- I'll be back later. 
 - All right.

263
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,940
See you, Ms. Mu.

264
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,200
The light is flashing.

265
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,200
 What's going on? 

266
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,060
   

267
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,960
Brother Luo.

268
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,900
 Don't go back to the car. 

269
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,440
Why?

270
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,720
 Do as I say. 

271
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,020
 Go to your left-hand side. 

272
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,200
 Turn right and enter the mall. 

273
00:21:52,351 --> 00:21:54,980
Brother Luo, I'm at the mall now.

274
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,120
Where am I going?

275
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,340
 - Keep going down.  
 - Okay.

276
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,380
 You're being followed. 

277
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,180
I'm followed?

278
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,080
 Run now! 

279
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,680
Okay.

280
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,440
- Press it! 
 - Which floor?

281
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,040
The fifth.

282
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,800
Are you mad?

283
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,720
How's it going?

284
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,860
What took you so long?

285
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,700
 Mr. Wan, I know you have rules. 

286
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,320
 But the rules are set by people. 

287
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,240
 There's no need to get stuck in it. 

288
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,860
 I set the camera. 

289
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,540
 I won't use it again. 

290
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:29,560
 And I'm not interested in your business. 

291
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,120
 Please don't come to me in the future. 

292
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,520
I see.

293
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,740
I understand.

294
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,780
Mister, this bottle of wine is 200.

295
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,120
- Take it. 
 - Okay.

296
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,400
Ya Qing, don't worry.

297
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,540
They're all fooling you.

298
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,560
But I'll never fool you.

299
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,520
I will find them all.

300
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,320
I will.

301
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,820
Return my wallet!

302
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,860
Stop!

303
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,500
Come back!

304
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,380
Give me back my wallet!

305
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,400
What's going on, Brother Cao?

306
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,260
She's a thorny martial artist.

307
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,400
Seriously?

308
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,020
Stay sharp. Let's attack together.

309
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,960
Give me back the wallet.

310
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,300
It's been twice.

311
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,820
It's like we're chained together.

312
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:48,320
This matter today is none of your business.

313
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,580
But you are still meddling in it.

314
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,560
Do you know the rules?

315
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,520
Well, take this.

316
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,320
I'll leave it to you.

317
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,720
That's not cool at all.

318
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,980
Give me back my wallet!

319
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,700
Here it is.

320
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,720
Check if the money's missing.

321
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,160
Money isn't the issue.

322
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,501
It's this photo.

323
00:26:35,501 --> 00:26:37,060
Once it's lost, it's gone forever.

324
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,600
Miss, thank you.

325
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,703
Get up. Apologize.

326
00:26:43,703 --> 00:26:45,840
Forget it. They are gangs.

327
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,160
Don't mess with them. Save yourself the trouble.

328
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,400
Sir, you surely are experienced.

329
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,840
You should listen to him.

330
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,380
If my buddy brings back people, you won't get away with this.

331
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,920
Really?

332
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,180
Yes... Yes.

333
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,540
Look. What's going on?

334
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,740
What is he doing holding the pole?

335
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:15,340
Miss. It's all thanks to you today.

336
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:19,380
But as a girl, you'd better stay away from those ruffians and hooligans

337
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,040
to avoid suffering a loss.

338
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,060
I'm not afraid of them.

339
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:29,860
Uncle Li. I'd like to ask why you're investigating the Luoma Lake case.

340
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,860
What about you?

341
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:35,740
Judging from your age, you weren't born at the time of the crime.

342
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,980
Why are you investigating it?

343
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,660
Me?

344
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,357
I'm here for my adoptive mother.

345
00:27:40,357 --> 00:27:42,288
She was a student of Professor Li.

346
00:27:42,288 --> 00:27:45,800
Such a tragedy happened to her mentor's family, she can't let it go.

347
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,620
No wonder.

348
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,320
I did this for her.

349
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,480
Who is she?

350
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,460
Her name is Li Ya Qing.

351
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:15,120
 Why is she so similar to Auntie Hong? 

352
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,480
Her name is Li Ya Qing?

353
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,820
Is she Professor Li's daughter?

354
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:31,340
Weren't it for the case that day, we would have gotten engaged that year.

355
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,860
It's been more than 20 years.

356
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:40,560
Because of this case, I lost my job,

357
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:45,260
abandoned my future and investigated for half of my lifetime.

358
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:49,700
It's all because I can't get over it.

359
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:55,080
Uncle Li. Are you sure that friend of yours is really dead?

360
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,560
What do you mean by that?

361
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,760
I mean, have you figured this out?

362
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,780
What exactly are you trying to say?

363
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:06,100
I think...

364
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,700
What if...

365
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,560
What if you made a mistake?

366
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,000
Do you think I'm blind?

367
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,500
- No. 
 - Do you think I can't even recognize my lover?

368
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,440
I was even a cop back then.

369
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,480
How could I make such a mistake?

370
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:25,540
When the murder happened, I was the first to arrive at the scene.

371
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:28,100
Do you know what I saw?

372
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,680
 The scene was gruesome. 

373
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,740
 I still remember it vividly. 

374
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:44,220
In my mind, I can even piece together

375
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:48,560
how Ya Qing fell,

376
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:51,060
 got dragged, 

377
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,980
and then tangled in that cursed fishing line!

378
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,700
Uncle Li.

379
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,860
I am tired. Enjoy your drink.

380
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:24,480
By the way, since your adoptive mother was a student of Professor Li,

381
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,240
we are kind of connected.

382
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,920
Tell her not to believe Cen Chun Jiao's words.

383
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,800
Why?

384
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,820
Two years ago, the murderer committed another crime.

385
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:40,020
It was the fishing line again with the same cruelty.

386
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,500
I've seen the murderer.

387
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:45,220
It's a pity... I didn't see his face clearly.

388
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,480
So, Liu Shu Hai, who died five years ago,

389
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,760
can't be the murderer.

390
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,420
You're back.

391
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:04,740
Missy, look how obedient I am. I didn't even dare to move.

392
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,160
How many times is it?

393
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,000
Did I allow you to call me Missy?

394
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
You are so young and beautiful. It suits your young age quite well.

395
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,931
I can tell you are a habitual thief. I'll just call the police.

396
00:31:13,931 --> 00:31:15,960
Don't! Please.

397
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,560
How can I be a habitual thief?

398
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,680
Think about it. I only committed two cases.

399
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,260
And you got me each time.

400
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,520
Can I be a habitual thief, being so unskilled?

401
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,760
I'm the kid on the edge of the cliff.

402
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,280
I'll be saved if you pull me.

403
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,540
But if you push me, I'll fall.

404
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:34,440
My master said people choose their own ways in this world.

405
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,880
The same mistake can only be tolerated twice.

406
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,290
I'll give you another chance.

407
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,060
There's no next time.

408
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:43,120
You can rest assured. I won't dare, no matter what.

409
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,480
Thank you.

410
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,720
Look at yourself.

411
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,840
So? Following me for revenge?

412
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,640
No, I won't do that.

413
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,740
It's just I really admire you, seeing your skills.

414
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,900
I wonder if I have the pleasure of knowing you.

415
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,540
No.

416
00:32:14,068 --> 00:32:16,220
Missy. Missy.

417
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:19,080
I've loved martial arts since I was a kid.

418
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,080
This is my idol, Li Gang Long.

419
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,300
I've seen all of his films.

420
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,720
But in real life,

421
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,420
you are the first person I've ever seen who knows martial arts.

422
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:31,220
Well... And you've done it all to me, right?

423
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,320
We made an acquaintance through fighting.

424
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,680
I'm Cao Yan Hua.

425
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,920
Kong Cao Yan Hua, Jin Wei Tao Jiang. 
    

426
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,940
Is that where your name comes from?

427
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,420
Well, you even know how I got this name.

428
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,280
You are excellent both in literature and martial arts.

429
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,820
Sure, your martial arts skills are far beyond mine.

430
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:52,260
But I actually know some social tactics.

431
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:56,300
Maybe one day, you might find me helpful.

432
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,620
For example, now,

433
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:06,120
I can tell you which pervert has been staring at you from the cafe to here.

434
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,460
Follow me.

435
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:24,660
Pay attention. Be natural.

436
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:27,340
Look over my shoulder to the side.

437
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:32,460
At the fruit stand, the guy in a brown jacket.

438
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,280
It can't be wrong.

439
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,860
When I was tied up there just now,

440
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,040
there was a drone, buzzing and flying.

441
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,080
I thought it was shooting me, so I rushed to hide.

442
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,340
I didn't expect it to fly towards you.

443
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:54,600
It was obvious that he took a sneak peek first, and then tracked you.

444
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,620
Things could go terribly wrong.

445
00:33:57,955 --> 00:34:00,860
If you dare to scam me for your revenge...

446
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,700
Missy, that really hurts.

447
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,900
As Mr. Cao from Qianjinbei, even if I want revenge,

448
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,200
I won't use such a vulgar tactic.

449
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,440
Trust me. That brat is up to something.

450
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,300
The strawberries are fresh today.

451
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,540
Yes. They were just delivered.

452
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,780
Would you like a box of them?

453
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,260
Okay.

454
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,920
How will you pay?

455
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,300
All right.

456
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,800
See you.

457
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:53,380
Hey! Hey.

458
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,620
Why are you stalking me?

459
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,680
Me? I'm stalking you?

460
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:05,600
You may be mistaken. My friend is hospitalized here.

461
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,080
Since I'm here to visit him, I may need something as a courtesy.

462
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,720
So, I bought some fruit.

463
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,560
We are going the same way probably by chance.

464
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,100
Are we?

465
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,440
But Miss...

466
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,260
if you really want to get to know me, my name is Luo Ren.

467
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:33,220
Here is my number. You can call me at any time.

468
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:10,220
Wait... So, you just let him go?

469
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,540
   

470
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:26,440
It seems that Liu Shu Hai's life was quite interesting.

471
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,440
He had been an ordinary person before.

472
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,940
It says he was born in Anhe.

473
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,480
He had been a person of integrity.

474
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,160
Later, when he traveled to Datong, he had a traffic accident.

475
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,360
The car overturned and went into the river.

476
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,940
He had been in a coma for 48 hours before he was resuscitated.

477
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,960
It was a medical miracle.

478
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,760
After being discharged, he left home.

479
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,840
Half a year later, he died at the Jiquan Inn.

480
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:54,560
It seems not every cloud has a silver lining.

481
00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:01,380
It says Liu Shu Hai had never been to Luoma Lake.

482
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,420
His family did say so.

483
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:09,400
A piece of skin on his back went missing for real.

484
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,720
So, she didn't talk nonsense.

485
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,540
Such a waste of time.

486
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,100
Mr. Wan, I'll leave now.

487
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,960
Ms. Mu.

488
00:37:39,684 --> 00:37:43,560
This is another case Ms. Huo ordered here.

489
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,191
Please pass it to her.

490
00:37:46,191 --> 00:37:48,520
Zhang Guang Hua.

491
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,480
Who's that?

492
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,547
 Auntie Hong, have you seen these? 

493
00:37:54,547 --> 00:37:58,880
 Uncle Wan said these relics were found by villagers on the wild river beach in Datong. 

494
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,876
 There are frequent flash floods in that area. 

495
00:38:00,876 --> 00:38:04,880
 He probably didn't escape and had an accident. 

496
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:11,180
 By the way, Uncle Li said that two years ago, the murderer committed another crime. 

497
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,120
I see.

498
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:17,000
 Mu Dai. Please go to Li Tan again 

499
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,460
 and learn about the case from two years ago. 

500
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,000
Talk to you later.

501
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,640
 Okay. 

502
00:38:29,815 --> 00:38:32,690
 Did the heavens go blind 

503
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:35,790
 and let you escape death's grasp? 

504
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:43,446

00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:16,320
♫  The sky splits the dawn's horizon   ♫

508
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:20,680
♫  It's telling me the end  ♫

♫  Every hand has two sides  ♫

513
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:46,300
♫  One offers blessings  ♫

514
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:49,680
♫  One waits in silence  ♫

515
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,800
♫  There's no end to this game  ♫

516

♫  Following the traces left behind  ♫

517
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,800
♫  If you were me  ♫

518
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:11,330
♫  You'd understand every tear of mine  ♫

519
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,120
♫  (The reason they fall)  ♫

520
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,600
♫  If I were you  ♫

521
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:22,740
♫  I'd feel each breath you take  ♫

522
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,000
♫  Then we'd move forward  ♫
