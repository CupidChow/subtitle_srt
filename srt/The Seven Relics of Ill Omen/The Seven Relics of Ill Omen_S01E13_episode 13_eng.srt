1
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,140
   

2
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:24,040



3
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,340
   

4
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,000
   

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,525
   

6
00:01:09,525 --> 00:01:13,140
   

7
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,580
   

8
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,380
Come. This way, please.

9
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:22,680
The murals here feature vibrant colors and bold designs,

10
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:30,360
depicting an ancient legend of Lengquan Town.

11
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,076
 It's said that in primordial times, 

12
00:02:33,076 --> 00:02:36,460
 demons descended to plague mankind. 

13
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:40,520
 Once corrupted by these demons, a person was doomed, 

14
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:45,220
 driven to madness, spreading harm wherever they went. 

15
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,140
 Yet righteousness has always triumphed over evil. 

16
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,540
 Bo Yang Zi, the Great Virtuous One, 

17
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:58,180
 enraged by these atrocities, took up his scrolls 

18
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,700
 and waged war against the demons. 

19
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,580
Sorry.

20
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:08,920
Ancient scrolls were made of wooden slips, right?

21
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,360
Yes, exactly.

22
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,500
 Moved by Bo Yang Zi's struggle, the heavens intervened. 

23
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,180
 Amidst storm and thunder, 

24
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,240
 three divine birds, Feng, Huang, and Luan, 

25
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,750
 descended to the human world. 

26
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:33,920
 They sacrificed themselves, transforming into a clasp 

27
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,860
 that sealed the scrolls, 

28
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:41,360
 imprisoning the demons for eternity. 

29
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,920
Sounds so convincing, huh.

30
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,320
- Well, it's mythology. 
 - Right?

31
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,580
- Let's go. 
 - Go.

32
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,860
Hey, don't go.

33
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,700
Guys, come back.

34
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,480
Take a look at this.

35
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,620
Feng, Huang, and Luan designs are our original artistic creations.

36
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,340
They're recognized as intangible cultural heritage...

37
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,320
Do they qualify?

38
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,260
Well, they're about to be.

39
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,020
Such a smooth talker.

40
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,740
Take one home.

41
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,140
These ward off evil, bring peace,

42
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:12,260
and strengthen bonds of love and friendship.

43
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,480
- Perfect gifts for elders and children... 
 - Are they free?

44
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,480
Scan to pay.

45
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,760
Scan and take the blessings home, all right?

46
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,340
Never mind if it costs money.

47
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,660
Well...

48
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,440
Take one.

49
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,700
I'll take five.

50
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,180
That savage's been gone so long.

51
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,520
You actually want her to come back and roast us?

52
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,420
Look, vengeance has its proper target.

53
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,960
Old Yan's the one who pissed her off.

54
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,260
We've got nothing to do with it.

55
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,080
Besides, she's been nice to us.

56
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,600
She didn't harm us.

57
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,420
She even gave us food.

58
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,800
It's actually kind of friendly.

59
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,820
Friendly?

60
00:05:01,404 --> 00:05:05,280
- Seriously? 
 - If we fight, we're done for.

61
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:11,220
Our only options are endurance and being friendly.

62
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,240
Thirteen, I'm in awe.

63
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,720
You seriously considering marrying into her tribe?

64
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,860
Don't jinx it.

65
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,760
If I go down, you're coming with me.

66
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,280
She's back.

67
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,440
Remember, be friendly.

68
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,060
She's here. She's back.

69
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,280
Why are you just standing there? Show friendliness.

70
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,980
What are you doing?

71
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,420
Offering my sincerest friendliness.

72
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,220
- You go. 
 - You...

73
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,740
Well, Mrs. Thirteen.

74
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,340
Brogther Cao, how's it going?

75
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,440
Don't stop. It's working.

76
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,900
She seems into it.

77
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,060
Really?

78
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,520
She's actually a young artistic female...

79
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,540
savage.

80
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:05,240
Look, her leg's injured.

81
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,780
Probably Brother Luo's doing.

82
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,900
Don't panic.

83
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,160
She's demanding the next chapter.

84
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,860
Serializing the story!

85
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,340
Yes, yes, got it.

86
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,860
You think I understand her?

87
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,500
Nope.

88
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,260
She probably means Luo Ren and the others fled.

89
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,380
Brother Thirteen, wow,

90
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,080
you're a genius.

91
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,500
Extracting intel without a shared language.

92
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,840
You two have common interests.

93
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,680
She's sharp. You'd make a good match.

94
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,500
You marry her, then.

95
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,380
Who does this picture depict?

96
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,660
My master? Or Hong Sha?

97
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:41,480
Is that Hong Sha or Mu Dai hanging there?

98
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,060
No, no.

99
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,100
No way.

100
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,540
Look closer. See there?

101
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,300
There's a well.

102
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:58,400
I think it must be the woman Old Yan mentioned from back then.

103
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,180
Hong Sha, do you have any close relatives left?

104
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,340
I'm completely alone now.

105
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,920
I'll tell you a secret.

106
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,080
My mother abandoned me when I was little.

107
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,380
I don't even know who my father was.

108
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,400
But look at me now, I'm still living just fine.

109
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,320
You poor thing.

110
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:12,040
After we get back, you could rent out the mansion.

111
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,120
And if you'd like, you could come and live with us in Lixi.

112
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,980
It's lively with everyone together.

113
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,740
Really?

114
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,400
But we still haven't found Thirteen-Thousand and Cao Yan Hua.

115
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,680
Don't worry. We will find them.

116
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,520
Once we're back, we'll take care of Phoenix Pavilion.

117
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,300
We can't manage without any one of us five.

118
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,260
Oh... lend me your dagger for a bit.

119
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,200
I need to carve more throwing darts.

120
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,080
I forgot to tell you.

121
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:04,440
I used the dagger against that woman today.

122
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,560
So, I left it there.

123
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,200
But don't worry. I'll get it back.

124
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,960
Believe me.

125
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,660
After all, it was a gift from you.

126
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,660
Brother Cao, I'm not trying to criticize.

127
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,880
But you wrote it so tiny.

128
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,480
How is anyone supposed to see that?

129
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,480
Well, it's still a glimmer of hope.

130
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,640
When I was a kid, I once found a message in a bottle at the beach.

131
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:00,800
The sea's huge while the bottle is tiny, yet I still found it.

132
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,720
What did it say inside?

133
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,460
Whoever...

134
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,061
Whoever finds this is an idi...

135
00:13:07,061 --> 00:13:08,841
Just some curse words.

136
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,620
Let's hope Luo Ren and the others come to rescue us soon.

137
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,640
 From what I've observed, the savage and the woman each have lairs. 

138
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,840
 Thirteen-Thousand and Cao Yan Hua are probably with the savage. 

139
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,120
 Our plan today is to head into the underground cave, 

140
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,360
 subdue that woman, 

141
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,324
 and force the savage to bring Thirteen-Thousand and Cao Yan Hua to us. 

142
00:13:33,324 --> 00:13:34,840
 That woman was spooked yesterday. 

143
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,680
 Could she have already fled and not be in the cave? 

144
00:13:38,542 --> 00:13:40,200
 I was the one who fled in panic yesterday. 

145
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,920
 That woman wouldn't abandon her lair over this. 

146
00:13:44,689 --> 00:13:46,910
 We need strategies and division of labor. 

147
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,211
 The wind's in our favor today. 

148
00:13:48,211 --> 00:13:49,472
 Perfect for a fire attack. 

149
00:13:49,472 --> 00:13:51,753
 Hong Sha, you take point. Smoke her out. 

150
00:13:51,753 --> 00:13:53,240
 If she sees only you, 

151
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,681
 she'll likely underestimate the threat and come out to attack. 

152
00:13:55,681 --> 00:13:57,902
 I'll stay hidden, wait for her to come out, 

153
00:13:57,902 --> 00:13:59,703
 then cut off her retreat with you. 

154
00:13:59,703 --> 00:14:00,844
 Mu Dai, you're light on your feet. 

155
00:14:00,844 --> 00:14:02,564
 Take the high ground as a backup. 

156
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,000
What's going on?

157
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,440
Why is there smoke?

158
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,240
No one's here.

159
00:14:34,091 --> 00:14:35,731
Luo Ren.

160
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,660
She doesn't seem to be here at all.

161
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,860
Or she simply isn't afraid of smoke.

162
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,600
She's probably holed up deep inside.

163
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,640
Let's go in and check.

164
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,240
You two scout ahead in the cave.

165
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,360
I'll guard the entrance in case the savage raids.

166
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:06,100
Mu Dai, if anything happens, just blow the whistle.

167
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,560
Did you hear that?

168
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,200
What do we do? Signal Luo Ren?

169
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,201
No need to bother him over this.

170
00:15:18,201 --> 00:15:20,012
Strike first.

171
00:15:20,012 --> 00:15:22,513
I'll lead the attack. You light the way.

172
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,040
She seems weakened by the smoke.

173
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,720
Now's our chance!

174
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,840
Where's my dagger?

175
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,480
Right here. I got it back.

176
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,980
Here.

177
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:11,060
Yes. Glad you found it.

178
00:16:14,134 --> 00:16:15,894
What's this?

179
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,840
She must've made the Sunny Doll we saw earlier.

180
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,940
She was making figurines of the savage and herself, right?

181
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:30,040
With such crude materials, she still managed this.

182
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,720
Her needlework must've been skilled once.

183
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,000
Cover your ears.

184
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,940
Is she calling the savage?

185
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:49,820
Yes. It's their unique way of communicating.

186
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,520
She went that way.

187
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,600
You're right.

188
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,040
I get it now.

189
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,960
The villagers organized hunters to rescue us.

190
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,700
They were just cooking over a fire.

191
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,680
But cooking fires don't produce that much smoke.

192
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,861
- It's Luo Ren? 
 - It's Luo Ren?

193
00:17:19,861 --> 00:17:22,181
Luo Ren's coming to rescue us!

194
00:17:29,509 --> 00:17:31,493
No movement here yet.

195
00:17:31,493 --> 00:17:33,573
Haven't spotted the savage.

196
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,760
I don't know what you're saying.

197
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,293
But you were once human.

198
00:17:42,293 --> 00:17:44,433
You should understand me.

199
00:17:46,473 --> 00:17:48,914
We've lost two friends in the mountains.

200
00:17:48,914 --> 00:17:53,174
If the savage brings them back, we'll let you go.

201
00:17:55,969 --> 00:17:58,885
Should we light a fire to signal back?

202
00:17:58,885 --> 00:18:00,660
- Mark our position. 
 - Let's go.

203
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,060
My mouth must be blessed.

204
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,900
What are you doing?

205
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,320
Thirteen, don't let go!

206
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,852
- Brother Cao! 
 - I won't let go!

207
00:18:20,852 --> 00:18:22,560
Release me!

208
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,900
Thirteen, if anything happens to me,

209
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,040
you have to survive!

210
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,860
Brother Cao.

211
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,340
Brother Cao! Brother Cao!

212
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:40,260
Brother Cao...

213
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,500
Brother Cao.

214
00:18:51,143 --> 00:18:53,683
Help!

215
00:19:10,369 --> 00:19:12,230
The savage fears fire. Make it burn brighter.

216
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,335
It'll act as a barrier.

217
00:19:14,335 --> 00:19:16,336
Help!

218
00:19:16,336 --> 00:19:18,036
Chubby?

219
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,220
Help!

220
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,280
Help!

221
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,495
You two stay here. I'll check it out.

222
00:19:27,495 --> 00:19:29,020
Hong Sha, go assist them.

223
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,400
I'll take care of it here.

224
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,540
Got it.

225
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,300
Be careful.

226
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,960
Help!

227
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,100
Chubby, get down!

228
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,560
Brother Luo.

229
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,020
Stop!

230
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,522
Such a high place. No wonder I couldn't find you.

231
00:22:25,522 --> 00:22:28,182
Only Mu Dai could reach that spot.

232
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,540
It's all right.

233
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,200
Mu Dai!

234
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,282
- What happened to my master? 
 - What happened?

235
00:22:35,282 --> 00:22:36,807
- Master! 
 - Mu Da!

236
00:22:36,807 --> 00:22:39,218
What happened?

237
00:22:39,218 --> 00:22:40,359
- Mu Dai. 
 - Oh my!

238
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,859
Mu Dai!

239
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,460
Catch it with water now.

240
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,980
Mu Dai. Mu Dai.

241
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,853
- Mu Dai. 
 - Hurry, scoop it up.

242
00:22:57,853 --> 00:22:59,553
Luo Ren.

243
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,580
Here.

244
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,564
What happened to her?

245
00:23:08,564 --> 00:23:10,225
I was about to ask you that.

246
00:23:10,225 --> 00:23:12,305
What happened?

247
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,363
 After you left, she attacked me. 

248
00:23:17,363 --> 00:23:19,623
And then...

249
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,800
It's fine. Here.

250
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,360
Be careful.

251
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,560
Give it to me.

252
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,620
We guessed right.

253
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:03,040
The savage's amber was split from that woman.

254
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,107
What did I miss?

255
00:24:05,107 --> 00:24:10,685
I think this relic of ill omen was originally in the gem well.

256
00:24:10,685 --> 00:24:13,052
Remember the visions you saw?

257
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,180
There were bones at the bottom.

258
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:19,420
Probably the previous host of the relic of ill omen.

259
00:24:20,578 --> 00:24:23,940
When this woman was hanging in a well on the brink of death,

260
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,140
the relic of ill omen seems to have chosen her as its new host,

261
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:30,780
healing her wounds and letting her cling to life.

262
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,520
She's the...

263
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,820
During this process, the amber melted.

264
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:42,020
Then the amber, the relic of ill omen, and some of her flesh fused together.

265
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,760
She might not even have understood what was happening.

266
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,320
To her, the amber was a life-saving treasure.

267
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,140
So...

268
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,960
She shared it with her child.

269
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,045
No wonder.

270
00:24:57,045 --> 00:24:58,400
No wonder what?

271
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,180
The savage.

272
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,460
At first, she was terrifying.

273
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:05,940
But these days, Thirteen-Thousand and I have been with her,

274
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,240
and we found that she is not that bad.

275
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,080
She is quite friendly to us.

276
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,100
That's right then.

277
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:15,080
When she wore the amber, the relic of ill omen influenced her.

278
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,580
Once it was removed, she reverted to her true nature.

279
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,600
This time, the relic of ill omen didn't fully control her.

280
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,120
It was more like cooperation.

281
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,740
The relic of ill omen sustained her life.

282
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:34,940
And she hanged victims for her vengeance.

283
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:40,060
Anyway, this one is back where it belongs.

284
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,420
Time is short. Let's go find Thirteen-Thousand.

285
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,960
I almost forgot about him.

286
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,560
Shouldn't we deal with this first?

287
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,020
I'm sorry.

288
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,840
Let's go, Mu Dai.

289
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,540
No.

290
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,720
I can't just sit here.

291
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,620
I have to do something.

292
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,420
Wait!

293
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,636
Where is he?

294
00:27:14,636 --> 00:27:16,836
I said where is he?

295
00:27:40,426 --> 00:27:42,246
You killed him?

296
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,640
I'll kill you.

297
00:28:40,451 --> 00:28:44,000
 No. I can't act on rage alone. 

298
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,360
 In a straight fight, I'd die. 

299
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,060
 Not worth it. 

300
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,480
Where is it?

301
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,080
See that cave?

302
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,200
Thirteen-Thousand!

303
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,920
- What if the savage is inside? 
 - Exactly.

304
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,040
Luo Ren, give me the rope.

305
00:29:52,433 --> 00:29:53,994
I'm going up.

306
00:29:53,994 --> 00:29:55,680
Master, be careful.

307
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,220
You sure you can manage?

308
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:00,460
Don't worry. I'll play it by ear.

309
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,283
That's awesome.

310
00:31:14,283 --> 00:31:16,620
- Empty. 
 - Well?

311
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,820
It's small. I checked everywhere.

312
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:21,460
But there's blood. Likely the savage's.

313
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,760
Here.

314
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:27,293
So, you're saying the savage moved Thirteen-Thousand?

315
00:31:27,293 --> 00:31:29,575
Oh, no. This mountain's huge.

316
00:31:29,575 --> 00:31:32,095
Finding him could take forever.

317
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,720
What?

318
00:31:39,204 --> 00:31:41,045
505?

319
00:31:41,045 --> 00:31:43,657
SOS.

320
00:31:43,657 --> 00:31:46,340
This is one of the "hope stones" I tossed down earlier.

321
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,180
Just a dumb attempt to stay optimistic.

322
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,913
Never thought it'd actually be found.

323
00:31:50,913 --> 00:31:53,334
This proves that when fate intervenes,

324
00:31:53,334 --> 00:31:54,975
finding a needle in a haystack isn't impossible.

325
00:31:54,975 --> 00:31:57,212
Let's go get Thirteen-Thousand. We will find him.

326
00:31:57,212 --> 00:31:59,392
We need to head down the mountain tonight.

327
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,100
What're you saying?

328
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:05,680
Brother Luo, we can't just bail after getting the relic of ill omen.

329
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,130
We agreed to stick together through thick and thin.

330
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:09,180
I'm not abandoning Thirteen-Thousand.

331
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,800
But we're out of food and water.

332
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,175
The longer we push, the weaker we'll get.

333
00:32:13,175 --> 00:32:15,414
We'll resupply and then come back.

334
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:20,940
Master, you've known Thirteen-Thousand for the longest time.

335
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:24,040
- What do you say? 
 - I also vote to leave first.

336
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,370
There might be more than one savage.

337
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,760
No way.

338
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,860
We were up there for days. We only ever saw one.

339
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,600
How's that impossible?

340
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,340
- Did you see the murals? 
 - Yes.

341
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:39,680
What about the ones on the ceiling?

342
00:32:45,729 --> 00:32:47,280
Earlier, in that woman's cave,

343
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,800
 I saw two dolls. One large, one small. 

344
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,644
At first, I thought they represented her and the savage.

345
00:32:52,644 --> 00:32:56,940
- You're saying it's one woman and two children? 
 - Yes.

346
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:00,600
If there's another savage, why hasn't it shown itself?

347
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,280
The woman never appeared either.

348
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,640
Doesn't mean she wasn't real.

349
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:08,940
Chubby, we agreed to stick together.

350
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,903
We'll resupply and return.

351
00:33:10,903 --> 00:33:14,283
We're not leaving without Thirteen-Thousand, all right?

352
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,870
- Let's move. 
 - Go.

353
00:33:48,723 --> 00:33:50,965
 That's the direction of the village. 

354
00:33:50,965 --> 00:33:52,760
 Don't tell me she... 

355
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:46,182
Careful.

356
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,269
Brother Luo!

357
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:06,980
- Zha Ma? 
 - Finally found you all.

358
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,220
- Anyone hurt? 
 - What are you doing here?

359
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,220
Jiang Zhao sent me. He said you got separated.

360
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,460
He worried you'd get lost in the mountains.

361
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,540
Then I spotted this bag and tracked you down.

362
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:17,380
Jiang... You mean that big guy who came with us?

363
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,620
Yes.

364
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,001
We saved him.

365
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:22,341
We killed the savage!

366
00:35:23,365 --> 00:35:25,106
- They found him. 
 - All right.

367
00:35:25,106 --> 00:35:26,856
Let's head back to Jiang.

368
00:35:26,856 --> 00:35:28,060
You guys are something else.

369
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,321
- No injuries? 
 - Let's go.

370
00:35:29,321 --> 00:35:31,120
- Move. 
 - Be careful.

371
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:34,380
Brother Luo, I was really scared last night.

372
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,860
The savage came to the village.

373
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,640
Jiang escaped. She tried dragging Jiang back.

374
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,400
This is the first time I've encountered the savage.

375
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,600
That wretch even tried a sneak attack.

376
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,820
Good thing I'm quick. I grabbed a gong and banged the hell out of it.

377
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:46,460
Some villagers backed me up.

378
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:49,580
We used to be hunters. Dealt with wolves and bears.

379
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,920
A savage? Please.

380
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,204
Thirteen-Thousand!

381
00:36:07,204 --> 00:36:09,184
Thirteen!

382
00:36:10,114 --> 00:36:12,015
Hey, you're something else.

383
00:36:12,015 --> 00:36:14,290
Look at you. Let me see.

384
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:16,870
You actually came back in one piece.

385
00:36:17,706 --> 00:36:18,827
You're alive.

386
00:36:18,827 --> 00:36:20,092
Our luck, huh...

387
00:36:20,092 --> 00:36:22,189
You're alive!

388
00:36:22,189 --> 00:36:24,460
- Wait, what's going on? 
 - Do you have a problem with me living?

389
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:27,640
What do you want? Can't you be happy for me?

390
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,100
How did you escape?

391
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,025
- I tricked her. 
 - Zha Ma said...

392
00:36:32,025 --> 00:36:34,460
the savage chased you into the village.

393
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,080
Jiang Zhao was terrified.

394
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,040
He's been in a daze since it happened.

395
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,203
But I think he'll be fine. Just needs time.

396
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,320
The search team is at the village entrance!

397
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,340
Come quick!

398
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,676
They might've caught the savage.

399
00:36:47,676 --> 00:36:49,376
I'll go check.

400
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:05,940
Thirteen-Thousand, that cave was so high.

401
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,400
How did you even get down?

402
00:37:12,472 --> 00:37:14,469
I...

403
00:37:14,469 --> 00:37:17,269
I pretended to be dead to escape.

404
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:21,880
Never thought she'd send me to the village.

405
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,680
Who's there?

406
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:27,796
Who's knocking this late?

407
00:38:27,796 --> 00:38:28,990
Who's there?

408
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:30,680
Zha Ma.

409
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,001
Jiang?

410
00:38:32,001 --> 00:38:33,362
You're back.

411
00:38:33,362 --> 00:38:35,262
Where are Mu Dai and the others?

412
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:42,305
Maybe I seemed too nervous.

413
00:38:42,305 --> 00:38:46,768
Zha Ma noticed something was off and spotted the savage.

414
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:59,440
So, when she smashed the window, she was trying to get help for you?

415
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:11,817
She wouldn't have died if not for me.

416
00:39:16,448 --> 00:39:18,300
 Over there! Catch her! 

417
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,080
 Catch the savage! 

418
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,040
 - Stop! 
 - Catch her! Hurry! 

419
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,080
 Go, everyone! 

420
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,580
 Go get her! 

421
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,340
 Don't... 

422
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,520
 - Get her! 
 - Check over there! 

423
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,100
 - None. 
 - Get her! 

424
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,520
 Stop right there! 

425
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,940
 Get her! 

426
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,620
 Catch her! 

427
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,220
 Nowhere to run now! 

428
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,780
 - Get her! 
 - Shoot her! 

429
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:46,860
 Listen to me... No. 

430
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,120
 No, don't. 

431
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,400
 She saved me. 

432
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,920
 Please let her go! 

433
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,040
 - No, please don't. 
 - Move! Out of the way! 

434
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,400
 - Move aside! 
 - Out of the way! 

435
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,320
 - Catch her! 
 - Run! Run! 

436
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:40,460
It's all my fault. All my fault.

437
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:43,440
She wouldn't have died if not for me.

438
00:40:46,107 --> 00:40:47,827
My fault.

439
00:40:50,853 --> 00:40:55,674
She just fell off the cliff, right?

440
00:40:55,674 --> 00:40:57,594
Doesn't mean she's dead.

441
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,740
Right.

442
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:03,880
She climbed cliffs even with a hurt leg.

443
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,780
She just fell off the cliff.

444
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,780
Maybe she caught hold of something on the way down.

445
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,522
Don't worry too much.

446
00:41:09,522 --> 00:41:10,823
Exactly.

447
00:41:10,823 --> 00:41:15,004
In TV dramas, people survive after falling off cliffs,

448
00:41:15,004 --> 00:41:17,204
let alone a savage.

449
00:41:18,298 --> 00:41:20,879
Thirteen-Thousand, given her abilities,

450
00:41:20,879 --> 00:41:23,559
her survival odds are way higher than a normal person's.

451
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,620
How nice.

452
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:29,020
That's great.

453
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:44,060



454
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:55,500
