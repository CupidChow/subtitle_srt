00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,700
three people were killed.

192
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,860
Li Jianli,

193
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,860
male, 59 years old.

194
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,180
Yu Xiuying,

195
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,220
female, 55 years old.

196
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,580
Li Yaqing,

197
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,500
female, 23 years old.

198
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,500
Help!

199
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,380
Why did he speak in that way?

200
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,060
Who did he kill?

201
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,140
How did he kill them?

202
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,420
Why did he kill them?

203
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,820
And he spoke

204
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,140
as if he was making a report.

205
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,220
It was particularly terrifying.

206
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,940
How many cases did he tell?

207
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:33,980
Two.

208
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,020
Luoma Lake was the first case.

209
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,980
And what about the second one?

210
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,220
Mister,

211
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,540
there is a price for each case.

212
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,060
I'm sure you understand.

213
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,740
But he was a murderer.

214
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,420
And he used fishing lines.

215
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,180
And what happened next?

216
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,500
His body was there.

217
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,260
He indeed died.

218
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,060
But in his back,

219
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,300
a large piece of skin
was cut off by someone.

220
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,340
Let's call the police.

221
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:14,940
Wait...

222
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:15,500
Wait.

223
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,300
The manager has called the police.

224
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,260
Has someone called the police?

225
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,980
This man is quite young.

226
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,740
He shed so much blood.

227
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,500
His skin was cut off?

228
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,700
Someone came in after you ran out?

229
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,340
No one came in.

230
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,660
And that hallway was a dead end.

231
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,740
I was standing there

232
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,700
and didn't see anyone coming in or out.

233
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,100
So why did you say

234
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,940
the skin was cut off by someone?

235
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,940
Because the edges of the wound
were particularly smooth.

236
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,220
It must have been done by hand

237
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,500
with a sharp object.

238
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,620
Sharp object?

239
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,860
My gosh.

240
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,180
Girl.

241
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,700
Do you even believe the nonsense

242
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,500
you said?

243
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,980
It would be convincing

244
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,980
if you had just said that he died.

245
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,220
But the piece of skin...

246
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,580
Who would want that from a dead person?

247
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,980
But a piece of human skin
was indeed cut off.

248
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,140
You can just investigate

249
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,700
whether it is true or not!

250
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:05,300
You...

251
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,500
We called the police right away.

252
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,860
And every bystander in the corridor

253
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,220
knew about it.

254
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,140
Wonderful.

255
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,900
You made up such a convincing story.

256
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,260
You must have made a great effort.

257
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,100
Mr. Wan.

258
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,580
You should be honest in business.

259
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,820
It's no shame
that you can't get true information.

260
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,820
But it's such a disgrace

261
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,740
to make up nonsense to cheat money.

262
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:31,900
Wait, mister.

263
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,100
What do you mean?

264
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,180
I didn't make up nonsense.

265
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,660
I was telling the truth.

266
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,860
I didn't say it was fake.

267
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,460
Maybe at the time,

268
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,260
someone did die in the little hotel.

269
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:48,180
Maybe the dead man was skinned.

270
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,540
But he had nothing to do

271
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,180
with the Luoma Lake case 22 years ago.

272
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:54,900
Liu Shuhai was not the murderer
of the Luoma Lake case!

273
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,140
Liu Shuhai was a murderer!

274
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:57,900
Liar.

275
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,060
I...didn't lie.

276
00:17:59,060 --> 00:17:59,940
Liar!

277
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,780
You don't have to buy my clues.

278
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,660
Mr. Wan.

279
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,460
My clues are true.

280
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,780
You don't have to buy them.

281
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,500
Mr. Wan.

282
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,540
I spent money on finding out
the murderer of the Luoma Lake case.

283
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,740
No matter how much weirder
the other cases are,

284
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,180
I'm not interested.

285
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,900
We are all buyers.

286
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,180
I want information.

287
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,020
I only want real information!

288
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,900
I won't give a penny
for fake information.

289
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,660
What do you think?

290
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,340
Hello, sir.

291
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,940
Hello.

292
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,420
Luo, what do you think of this?

293
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,140
Just pay.

294
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,020
Okay.

295
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,740
That's the whole thing.

296
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,060
Among those who came,

297
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,220
both myself and a guy surnamed Ma
are agents.

298
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,140
That guy seems dumb.

299
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,100
I can't tell anything.

300
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,980
But there is one named Li Tan

301
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:59,260
who insisted
that the information was fake.

302
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:00,540
Madam Hong.

303
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:01,940
What do you think?

304
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,180
As far as I know,

305
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,940
I also think Cen Chunjiao

306
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,580
was not quite right.

307
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,500
Is it fake?

308
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,540
So I sat there for so long

309
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,980
just to listen to her made-up story?

310
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,660
But Madam Hong,

311
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,540
how do you know it's fake?

312
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,740
Didn't I tell you?

313
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,420
Professor Li was my mentor.

314
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,380
I've always had his family's case

315
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,180
on my mind,

316
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,940
not just through Wan Fenghuo.

317
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,580
Then shall we pay or not?

318
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,580
We'll pay.

319
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,100
Mr. Wan has been investigating
for so many years.

320
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,860
We should at least pay
for his hard work.

321
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,180
All right.

322
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,300
Madam Hong.

323
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,020
You're so nice.

324
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,140
Besides,

325
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,060
I don't want him to know

326
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,180
that I also entrusted someone else.

327
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,900
That Mr. Li you just mentioned

328
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,020
seems to know a lot
about what happened back then.

329
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,820
Get in touch with him more

330
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,380
and see what he knows.

331
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:53,980
OK.

332
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,500
I see what you mean.

333
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,900
I gotta go, Madam Hong.

334
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,300
There are other fishing-line murders?

335
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,420
You devil.

336
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,540
Die!

337
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,340
He fell from such a height.

338
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,820
How could he have survived?

339
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,020
Mr. Li.

340
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,420
Sorry.

341
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,300
Two to one.

342
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:42,740
Wan Fenghuo.

343
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,540
If your information was real,

344
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,220
I could even give you my life.

345
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,860
You'll be guilty of taking my money.

346
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,820
It's not worth it.

347
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,740
Mr. Li, please stay.

348
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,420
I booked rooms in Bashu Mansion

349
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,300
for all attendees today.

350
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,420
I'll distribute some documents
later today.

351
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,220
Don't forget to pick it up...

352
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:09,820
Mr. Wan.

353
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,860
Then I'll leave too.

354
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:11,980
I'll be back later.

355
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,700
Alright.

356
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,140
See you, Miss Mu.

357
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,100
The light is flashing.

358
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,100
What's going on?

359
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,660
[Laojiu Hotpot]

360
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,580
Luo.

361
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:43,900
Don't go back to the car.

362
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:45,660
Why?

363
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,500
Do as I say.

364
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,020
Go to your left-hand side.

365
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,300
Turn right and enter the mall.

366
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:52,940
Luo.

367
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,380
I'm at the mall now.

368
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,660
Where am I going?

369
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,340
Keep going down.

370
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,180
You're being followed.

371
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,700
I'm followed?

372
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:05,780
Run now!

373
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:07,780
Okay.

374
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,660
Press it!

375
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,460
Which floor?

376
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,140
The fifth.

377
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:39,900
Are you mad?

378
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,420
How's it going?

379
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,780
What took you so long?

380
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,340
Mr. Wan, I know you have rules.

381
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,060
But the rules are set by people.

382
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,500
There's no need to get stuck in it.

383
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,580
I set the camera.

384
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:25,900
I won't use it again.

385
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:29,100
And I'm not interested in your business.

386
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,220
Please don't come to me in the future.

387
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:34,620
I see.

388
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,940
I understand.

389
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,100
Mister.

390
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,780
This bottle of wine is 200.

391
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:10,740
Take it.

392
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,220
Okay.

393
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,380
Yaqing, don't worry.

394
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,820
They're all fooling you.

395
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,980
But I'll never fool you.

396
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,340
I will find them all.

397
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,420
I will.

398
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,820
Give me back my wallet!

399
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:01,860
Stop!

400
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:05,700
Come back!

401
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,380
Give me back my wallet!

402
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,340
What's going on, Cao?

403
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,220
She's a thorny martial artist.

404
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,020
Seriously?

405
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,020
Stay sharp. Let's attack together.

406
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,100
Give me back the wallet.

407
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,300
It's been twice.

408
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,020
It's like we're chained together.

409
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,180
This matter today

410
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,140
is none of your business.

411
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,580
But you are still meddling in it.

412
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,660
Do you know the rules?

413
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:02,700
Well,

414
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,300
take this.

415
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,940
I'll leave it to you.

416
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,820
That's not cool at all.

417
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,660
Give me back my wallet!

418
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:27,700
Here it is.

419
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,940
Check if the money's missing.

420
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:32,740
Money isn't the issue.

421
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,380
It's this photo.

422
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,540
Once it's lost, it's gone forever.

423
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:37,820
Miss.

424
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,820
Thank you.

425
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:41,980
Get up.

426
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,060
Apologize.

427
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:44,500
Forget it.

428
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,820
They are gangs.

429
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,860
Don't mess with them.

430
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,940
Save yourself the trouble.

431
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,100
Sir, you surely are experienced.

432
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,620
You should listen to him.

433
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,580
If my buddy brings back people,

434
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,900
you won't get away with this.

435
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,100
Really?

436
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:58,820
Yes...

437
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,020
Yes.

438
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:01,780
Look.

439
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:02,900
What's going on?

440
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,740
What is he doing holding the pole?

441
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,420
Miss.

442
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,420
It's all thanks to you today.

443
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,780
But as a girl,

444
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,980
you'd better stay away

445
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,420
from those ruffians and hooligans

446
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,580
to avoid suffering a loss.

447
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,060
I'm not afraid of them.

448
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:25,780
Mr. Li.

449
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,540
I'd like to ask

450
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,300
why you're investigating
the Luoma Lake case.

451
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:30,740
What about you?

452
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,980
Judging from your age,

453
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,220
you weren't born
at the time of the crime.

454
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:36,980
Why are you investigating it?

455
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:37,900
Me?

456
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,220
I'm here for my adoptive mother.

457
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,900
She was a student of Professor Li.

458
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,300
As such a tragedy happened
to her mentor's family,

459
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,380
she can't let it go.

460
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,820
No wonder.

461
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,100
I did this for her.

462
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,300
Who is she?

463
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,660
Her name is Li Yaqing.

464
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,220
Why is she so similar to Madam Hong?

465
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,580
Her name is Li Yaqing?

466
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,820
Is she Professor Li's daughter?

467
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,740
Weren't it for the case that day,

468
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,380
we would have gotten engaged that year.

469
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,300
It's been more than 20 years.

470
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,140
Because of this case,

471
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,580
I lost my job,

472
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,940
abandoned my future

473
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,460
and traced for half of my lifetime.

474
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,860
It's all because I can't get over it.

475
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,220
Mr. Li.

476
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,580
Are you sure that friend of yours
is really dead?

477
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,500
What do you mean by that?

478
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,860
I mean, have you figured this out?

479
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,220
What exactly are you trying to say?

480
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:04,980
I think

481
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:06,900
what if...

482
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,900
What if you made a mistake?

483
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,980
Do you think I'm blind?

484
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:13,540
No.

485
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,820
Do you think I can't even

486
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,620
recognize my lover?

487
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,100
I was even a cop back then.

488
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,980
How could I make such a mistake?

489
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,100
When the murder happened,

490
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,860
I was the first to arrive at the scene.

491
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,300
Do you know what I saw?

492
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,540
The scene was gruesome.

493
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,180
I still remember it vividly.

494
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,420
In my mind, I can even restore

495
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,340
how Yaqing fell,

496
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,260
got dragged

497
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,980
and then tangled
in that cursed fishing line!

498
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:05,900
Mr. Li.

499
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,620
I am tired.

500
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,540
Enjoy your drink.

501
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,500
By the way,

502
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,420
since your adoptive mother
was a student of Professor Li,

503
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,540
we are kind of connected.

504
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:26,980
Tell her

505
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,860
not to believe Cen Chunjiao's words.

506
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:30,900
Why?

507
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,180
Two years ago, the murderer
committed another crime.

508
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:37,900
It was the fishing line again

509
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,460
with the same cruelty.

510
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,340
I've met with the murderer.

511
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,340
It's a pity

512
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,620
I didn't see his face clearly.

513
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,260
So Liu Shuhai, who died five years ago,

514
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,860
can't be the murderer.

515
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,060
You're back.

516
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:01,860
Missy.

517
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,740
Look how obedient I am.

518
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,820
I didn't even dare to move.

519
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:06,820
How many times is it?

520
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,780
Did I allow you to call me Missy?

521
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,300
You are so young and beautiful.

522
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,700
It suits your young age quite well.

523
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,180
I can tell you are a habitual thief.

524
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:13,860
I'll just call the police.

525
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,820
Don't!

526
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,460
How can I be a habitual thief?

527
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,660
Think about it.

528
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,620
I only committed two cases.

529
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,260
And you got me each time.

530
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,100
Can I be a habitual thief
being so unskilled?

531
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,660
I'm the kid on the edge of the cliff.

532
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,180
I'll be saved if you pull me.

533
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,540
But if you push me, I'll fall.

534
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:32,860
My master said

535
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,540
people choose their own ways
in this world.

536
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,820
The same mistake
can only be tolerated twice.

537
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,460
I'll give you another chance.

538
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,060
There's no next time.

539
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:40,900
You can rest assured.

540
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,980
I won't dare no matter what.

541
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:43,820
Thank you.

542
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,820
Look at yourself.

543
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,580
So?

544
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,740
Following me for revenge?

545
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,100
No, I won't do that.

546
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,540
It's just I really admire you

547
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,740
seeing your skills.

548
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,580
I wonder if I have the pleasure
of knowing you.

549
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,540
No.

550
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:14,780
Missy.

551
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:15,780
Missy.

552
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,460
I've loved martial arts
since I was a kid.

553
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,780
This is my idol, Li Ganglong.

554
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,740
I've seen all of his films.

555
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,820
But in real life,

556
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,260
you are the first person
with martial arts

557
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,740
I've ever seen.

558
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,380
Well.

559
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,220
And you've done it all to me, right?

560
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,260
We made an acquaintance
through fighting.

561
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,460
I'm Cao Yanhua.

562
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,780
Kong Cao Yan Hua, Jin Wei Tao Jiang.
[*From Book of Family Names]

563
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:39,940
Is that where your name comes from?

564
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:42,420
Well,

565
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,420
you even know how I got this name.

566
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,060
You are excellent
both in literature and martial arts.

567
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,220
Sure,

568
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,820
your martial arts skills
are far beyond mine.

569
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:52,020
But I actually know some social tactics.

570
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,700
Maybe one day,

571
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,900
you might find me helpful.

572
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,540
For example, now,

573
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,900
I can tell you

574
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,580
which pervert has been staring at you

575
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,100
from the cafe to here.

576
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,460
Follow me.

577
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,300
Attention.

578
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:23,860
Be natural.

579
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,340
Look over my shoulder to the side.

580
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:29,820
At the fruit stand,

581
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,660
the guy in a brown jacket.

582
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,380
It can't be wrong.

583
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,860
When I was tied up there just now,

584
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,820
there was a drone, buzzing and flying.

585
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,100
I thought it was shooting me,

586
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:48,980
so I rushed to hide.

587
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,980
I didn't expect it to fly towards you.

588
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,300
It was obvious

589
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,460
that he took a sneak shoot first,
and then tracked you.

590
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,620
Things could go terribly wrong.

591
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,180
If you dare to scam me

592
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,460
for your revenge...

593
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,700
Missy, that really hurts.

594
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,900
As Mr. Cao from Qianjinbei,
even if I want revenge,

595
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,700
I won't use such a vulgar tactic.

596
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,100
Trust me.

597
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,340
That brat is up to something.

598
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,140
The strawberries are fresh today.

599
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,540
Yes. They are just delivered.

600
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,460
Would you like a box of them?

601
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:19,260
OK.

602
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,020
How will you pay?

603
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:41,980
Alright.

604
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,100
See you.

605
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,620
Why are you stalking me?

606
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,780
I'm stalking you?

607
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,100
You may be mistaken.

608
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,620
My friend is hospitalized here.

609
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,660
Since I'm here to visit him,

610
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,180
I may need something as a courtesy.

611
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,460
So I bought some fruit.

612
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,860
Probably by chance,

613
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:12,660
we are going the same way.

614
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,300
Are we?

615
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,220
But Miss,

616
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,100
if you really want to get to know me,

617
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,060
my name is Luo Ren.

618
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,220
Here is my number.

619
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,220
You can call me at any time.

620
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:07,740
Wait...

621
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,220
So you just let him go?

622
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,340
[Liu Shuhai]

623
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,420
It seems that Liu Shuhai's life
was quite interesting.

624
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:28,100
He had been an ordinary person before.

625
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:31,100
It says he was born in Anhe.

626
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,260
He had been a person of integrity.

627
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,020
Later, when he traveled to Datong,

628
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,220
he had a traffic accident.

629
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,860
The car overturned
and went into the river.

630
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,580
He had been in a coma for 48 hours
before he was resuscitated.

631
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,540
It was a medical miracle.

632
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,660
After being discharged, he left home.

633
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,940
Half a year later,
he died at the Jiquan Hotel.

634
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,420
It seems not every cloud

635
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,340
has a silver lining.

636
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,580
It says

637
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,700
Liu Shuhai

638
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,700
had never been to Luoma Lake.

639
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,780
His family did say so.

640
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,420
A piece of skin in his back
went missing for real.

641
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,780
So she didn't talk nonsense.

642
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,540
Such a waste of time.

643
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:32,740
Mr. Wan.

644
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:33,700
I'll leave now.

645
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:35,980
Miss Mu.

646
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,100
This is another case

647
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,940
Ms. Huo ordered here.

648
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,060
Please pass it to her.

649
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,780
Zhang Guanghua.

650
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,540
Who's that?

651
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,180
Madam Hong.

652
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,180
Have you seen these?

653
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,900
Mr. Wan said these relics

654
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,260
were found by villagers
on the wild river beach in Datong.

655
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,500
There are frequent flash floods
in that area.

656
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,620
He probably didn't escape it

657
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,980
and had an accident.

658
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,380
By the way,

659
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:10,340
Mr. Li said that two years ago,
the murderer committed another crime.

660
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,700
I see.

661
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:14,860
Mu Dai.

662
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,820
Please go to Li Tan again

663
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,780
and learn about the case
from two years ago.

664
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,420
See you.

665
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:21,740
Okay.

666
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,780
Did the heavens go blind

667
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,460
and let you escape death's grasp?
