[Episode 29]

5
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,780
Look at her.

6
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,420
She managed to hold on at first,

7
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:29,980
but not anymore.

8
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,540
She's developed a physiological aversion

9
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,300
to Luo Ren's voice and image.

10
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,820
Next, I'll keep showing her

11
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,020
edited composite footage

12
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,740
while reinforcing the perceived reality

13
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,660
with electric shocks
and other physical pain stimuli.

14
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,980
Could she be faking it?

15
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,300
All her vital signs are being monitored.

16
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,420
Body temperature, heart rate,
and blood pressure

17
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,620
are all included.

18
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:54,900
She can't fake it.

19
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,820
You're all here now.

20
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:09,780
Yes.

21
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,300
Could the Buckle be here?

22
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,180
Let's search for it.

23
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,500
My treasure.

24
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,060
The treasure of Plum Blossom Sect.

25
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,540
These are all antiquities.

26
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,300
Don't you...

27
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,380
Be more careful. You just spat on it?

28
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,820
Hey, don't damage anything.

29
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,220
Handle with care.

30
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,500
Be gentle with them.

31
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,860
Don't knock them over.

32
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,580
I'm not talking about you.

33
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,540
I mean, don't touch the things roughly.

34
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,700
Don't damage them.

35
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,660
Got it.

36
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,980
Be careful. Easy does it.

37
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,460
Gently now.

38
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,300
Gently.

39
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,420
Gently.

40
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,780
It says

41
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,140
the Great Virtuous One
subdued the relics of ill omen

42
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,380
at Fengzi Ridge.

43
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,740
So it was at Fengzi Ridge.

44
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,180
- Fengzi Ridge.
- Fengzi Ridge?

45
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,740
Then he hid them
beneath an ancient tree at Fengzi Ridge,

46
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,580
arranging disciples

47
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,060
for security

48
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,340
and astrological observations,

49
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,540
to prevent the relics of ill omen
from causing chaos again.

50
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,260
Quite a systematic arrangement.

51
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,700
After the battle
with the relics of ill omen,

52
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,820
five disciples

53
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,020
fell unconscious for days,

54
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,820
their lives in grave danger.

55
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,020
It seemed they might not survive.

56
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,420
Yet seven days later,
they were all fine.

57
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,180
They were supposed to be dead,

58
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,740
but recovered after seven days.

59
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,260
What does this mean?

60
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,540
Were they injured
during the subduing process?

61
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,020
No.

62
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,700
The Great Virtuous One stated here

63
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,580
they were unharmed.

64
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,900
It seems
even the Great Virtuous One himself

65
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,260
wasn't quite sure what happened.

66
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,300
Fengzi Ridge?

67
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,660
I think I've found the solution here.

68
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,180
Come take a look.

69
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,180
Look.

70
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,780
The Great Virtuous One
struck and dispersed it.

71
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,900
"Struck and dispersed it"

72
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,660
means to break it apart?

73
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:20,300
Alright.

74
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:24,180
Then, he pricked between its eyebrows
and anointed it with blood.

75
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,460
Hold wood to resist

76
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,220
and draw it into the wood.

77
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,780
So we just use

78
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,660
bloodstained Imperishable Wood
to prick between its eyebrows?

79
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,580
Is it really that simple?

80
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,620
I've got something here too.

81
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,780
From over 800 years ago.

82
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,260
I can't quite get it.

83
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,540
But it seems to say

84
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,780
submerge the Imperishable Wood

85
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,740
in the water
containing the relic of ill omen,

86
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,700
then drip blood.

87
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,740
It fears blood,

88
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,220
so it flees into the Imperishable Wood.

89
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,020
Well, that's how I understand it.

90
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,940
You're absolutely right.

91
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,780
That's exactly what it means.

92
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,940
Different methods, same principle.

93
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,860
If we consider the Imperishable Wood
as a vessel,

94
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,740
both methods involve trapping
the relic of ill omen inside

95
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,980
and then sealing it
with the Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle.

96
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,180
And there's this one.

97
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,700
It mentions something about "grow".

98
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,060
This was written by Meihua Yizhao
to Lin Feng'er.

99
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:09,660
Take a look.

100
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,040
Recently, the subjugation
of the relic of ill omen

101
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,820
has been unstable.

102
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,380
Every time it emerges, it grows,

103
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,980
expanding more than before.

104
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,300
But the relic of ill omen
we saw in the murals

105
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,460
was about the same size as it is now.

106
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,220
Every time it emerges, it grows,

107
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,380
expanding further.

108
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,740
The informant reported

109
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,300
that except for Aoki
staying behind at the bar,

110
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,900
the rest of them,
including Zheng Mingshan,

111
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,940
went to Youwu Town.

112
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,540
Luo Ren's team
entered the mountains yesterday,

113
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,500
but Zheng Mingshan didn't.

114
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,860
He stayed at the pass as a lookout.

115
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,220
So our people couldn't get in.

116
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,420
Even if we had entered,

117
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,540
our people couldn't have
kept up with them.

118
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,860
The mountain paths are hard to navigate.

119
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,020
But it's okay.

120
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,780
They'll come out eventually.

121
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,980
Keep watching.

122
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,800
Fengzi Ridge is
where the relics of ill omen

123
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,380
were last sealed.

124
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,860
It should also be the last location
where the Imperishable Wood

125
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,060
and the Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle
appeared.

126
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,300
Mingshan,

127
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,220
Mr. Shen wants to stay a few more days

128
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,140
to study the materials
in the memorial archway.

129
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,100
Please take extra care of him.

130
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,900
We're going to Fengzi Ridge.

131
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,580
We'll split up.

132
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,260
Fengzi Ridge is such a vast area.

133
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,580
Meihua Yizhao and others
went in and never returned.

134
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,220
They left no clues
about the hiding spot.

135
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,060
How are we supposed to find it?

136
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,140
It wouldn't help
even if they had left a clue.

137
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,420
Just think about it.

138
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,620
The relics of ill omen
have already been released.

139
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,300
That means the hiding spot
has already been disturbed.

140
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,860
Though we came to find
the Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle,

141
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,300
our real goal is to make Leopard believe

142
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,660
we've found it.

143
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,220
So,

144
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,540
we have to put on a show?

145
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,060
I see now.

146
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,460
Hey, guys!

147
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,780
Hey, wait a minute.

148
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,420
Guys!

149
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,020
You might want a guide.

150
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:06,740
A guide.

151
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:08,980
My surname is Ding.

152
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,660
You can call me Ding Laojiu.

153
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,180
I've been a guide here

154
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,260
for over thirty years.

155
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,020
Does this place even need a guide?

156
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,500
Miss,

157
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,220
you just don't know.

158
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,500
This destination offers

159
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,180
a wealth of unique experiences.

160
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,460
It's just not developed yet.

161
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,540
The county

162
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,420
has plans for it.

163
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,020
It's going to be launched soon.

164
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,540
People from the tourism administration

165
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,300
even consulted me specifically.

166
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,100
My family has lived here
for generations.

167
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,180
There's no legend or story

168
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,500
I'm not well-versed in.

169
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,180
Pick me, and you won't regret it.

170
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,460
Twenty per person.

171
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,700
I'll stick with you the whole way.

172
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:40,980
Not a bad deal, huh?

173
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,060
Let's go.

174
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,060
Okay.

175
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:45,940
Here, dear.

176
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:46,900
Water.

177
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,660
Got it.

178
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,620
Follow me.

179
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,020
Isn't he just causing trouble?

180
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,500
Says the one
who's always causing trouble.

181
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,220
One million?

182
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,140
Luo Ren is offering one million

183
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,820
for the Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle

184
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,060
through antique dealers in Xiagu Pass.

185
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,900
The news has already spread.

186
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,820
This is the design he released.

187
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,180
To prevent forgeries,

188
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,300
only the outer buckle's design
was provided.

189
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,540
The inner engraving remains unknown.

190
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,420
So is this the Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle,
the nightmare

191
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,460
of generations of Star Lords?

192
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,660
After leaving Youwu Mountain,

193
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,420
they went to a place

194
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,900
called Fengzi Ridge in Xiagu Pass.

195
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,340
We've learned

196
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,180
that decades ago, a torrential flood
broke out in that area,

197
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,820
and a large number of antiques
were unearthed.

198
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,780
Many antique dealers
have bought goods there.

199
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,500
[Design of the Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle]
Is this the Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle?

200
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,300
I don't know.

201
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,940
I've never seen it before.

202
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,100
You were also in Youwu Mountain.

203
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,580
Where did you go?

204
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,500
A cave.

205
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,300
I couldn't get in without the key.

206
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:01,500
Master told me to wait
for the messenger.

207
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,340
Tell our people
to keep a close eye on him!

208
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,020
Luo Ren is utterly deceitful.

209
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,140
Don't let him scheme behind our backs.

210
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,340
Grow.

211
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,780
I understand what "grow" means now.

212
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,820
I understand what "grow" means.

213
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,740
I understand what it means.

214
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,700
I understand what "grow" means now.

215
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,980
Hey, Radishie,

216
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,780
I finally figured out

217
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,620
what "grow" really means.

218
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,300
"Grow"

219
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,540
refers to expansion in scope?

220
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,020
There are three records

221
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,820
of subduing the relics of ill omen
in the Guansi Memorial Archway.

222
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,700
During Bo Yangzi's era,

223
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,340
over 800 years ago,
and in Meihua Yizhao's time.

224
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,260
The specific locations
discovered by Mighty Kun

225
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,820
form an ancient "seven" shape
when connected.

226
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,340
And the geographical scope they span
is getting larger.

227
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,140
So the Seven-Star Unity

228
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,980
always form a certain shape.

229
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,540
So the act of adjusting
their relative positions

230
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,980
to form a fixed shape

231
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,380
is called
"Seven-Star Return to Their Positions"?

232
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,140
I looked it up online.

233
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,380
Tiankui Seven-Star

234
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,900
is known abroad
as the Ilta Constellation.

235
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,140
Every 280 years,

236
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,420
we enter a phase

237
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,820
of close exposure to Ilta's radiation.

238
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,740
We're currently in the exposure cycle.

239
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,260
And approaching
peak radiation intensity.

240
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,500
Two hundred and eighty years?

241
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,380
The era of Meihua Yizhao

242
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,740
was roughly two to three centuries ago.

243
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,860
Maybe exactly 280 years.

244
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,780
So were they also
in the exposure cycle?

245
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,500
More than that.

246
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,180
All three conquests

247
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,620
occurred during exposure cycles.

248
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,300
Then what happens
under close-range radiation?

249
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,740
I guess the high-energy radiation

250
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,900
charges the relics of ill omen.

251
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,500
Are you saying the relics of ill omen
can receive energy from their home star?

252
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:41,940
It's highly possible.

253
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:46,020
Maybe that's what's called "grow".

254
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,580
It'll be terrifying
if they keep "growing".

255
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,180
Anyway,

256
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,780
finding the Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle
is of utmost importance.

257
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,460
It's the ultimate weapon
to end everything.

258
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,260
Take a look.

259
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,220
Antique pieces.

260
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,580
Sir,

261
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,180
where's the item we agreed upon?

262
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,660
I've never seen this before.

263
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,980
Don't leave yet.

264
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:41,660
Take another look.

265
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,620
This is premium quality.

266
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,860
Sir, please deliver it to Lixi.

267
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:17,940
Money isn't an issue.

268
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:22,860
Why is the door closed?

269
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,380
Got the Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle?

270
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,100
Congratulations.

271
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,100
See?

272
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,540
You can do it.

273
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,060
When you arrive,

274
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,340
I'll treat you to a proper meal.

275
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,220
Feed up this chicken.

276
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,620
I'm gonna give it as a gift
for a friend.

277
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,220
Okay?

278
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:49,820
Okay.

279
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,980
Mingshan has already arrived in Heisha.

280
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,260
Aoki is heading there today.

281
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,380
I need to leave now.

282
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,420
Drive my car back to Lixi.

283
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,540
Well, book flights for all three of us.

284
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:19,980
By loyalty,

285
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,220
since I've joined the sect,

286
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,940
I can't abandon my master in crisis.

287
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,380
By history,

288
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,500
Thirteen-Thousand has known Mu Dai
longer than you have.

289
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,180
Hongsha, say something he can't refute.

290
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,300
Mu Dai and I even shared the same bed.

291
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,420
That counts for something.

292
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,660
I definitely have to go.

293
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,580
But it's very dangerous in Heisha.

294
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,660
Can it be more dangerous

295
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,100
than being chased by the clam

296
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,260
or buried alive?

297
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,020
We'll make it quick.

298
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,780
Exactly. We know it's dangerous.

299
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:44,900
But for Mu Dai,

300
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:45,980
we have to go.

301
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:46,700
No.

302
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:50,740
The thing is

303
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,620
that entering Heisha requires
an international permit.

304
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,860
You won't obtain them in time.

305
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,500
This is complicated.

306
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,060
Wait...

307
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,020
Please stop!

308
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,860
I've told you everything!

309
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,620
Really.

310
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,540
Miss, he's confessed.

311
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,620
His grandfather did acquire

312
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,900
three Feng-Huang-Luan Buckles

313
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,420
near Fengzi Ridge over forty years ago.

314
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,500
Luo Ren got excited upon hearing this

315
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,220
and paid an extra 20,000.

316
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,140
He demanded the dealer

317
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,500
stage a fake falling-out
between them here.

318
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,380
Get to the point.

319
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,860
Where's the box?

320
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,860
Luo Ren never handled it directly.

321
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,460
He had the antique dealer
send it to Aoki in Lixi

322
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,540
under the guise
of a fresh produce delivery.

323
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,220
There's a note inside.

324
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,760
[Keep it safe.
Essential for killing Leopard]

325
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,180
This item is critical.

326
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,180
Ensure it arrives securely.

327
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,660
Understood. Please rest assured.

328
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,260
Miss,

329
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,020
Aoki has arrived in Heisha.

330
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,980
He's staying at a small hotel
on the outskirts,

331
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,980
carrying a large bag.

332
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,700
Nice.

333
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:36,940
Okay.

334
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,660
Good.

335
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,580
Kill him on the way

336
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,420
and

337
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,580
bring the item back.

338
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,620
Aoki just left the hotel.

339
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,140
He's about to get into a cab.

340
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,460
That was reckless driving!

341
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,460
What's going on?

342
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,860
Look, they're all armed.

343
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,780
I've watched enough documentaries
about this place.

344
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,100
It's chaotic here.

345
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,020
Stay sharp.

346
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,940
Get down!

347
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,700
It's just a balloon.

348
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,540
A balloon?

349
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:30,900
Get inside.

350
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,180
Let's go.

351
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,700
What are you all standing around for?

352
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,980
We've got this whole place to ourselves.

353
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,620
Food and drinks are ready.
Make it quick.

354
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,260
I've checked everything.

355
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,820
There are no recording devices.

356
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,340
You went this far?

357
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,300
Didn't I tell you to just put on a show?

358
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,700
Just a scratch.

359
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,740
If the show isn't convincing,

360
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,300
how will the audience believe it?

361
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,420
Have something to eat.

362
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,420
Did Leopard

363
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,700
get the item?

364
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,020
Fake.

365
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:42,900
Fake?

366
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,020
So this was a decoy?

367
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,140
Luo Ren keeps the real one on him?

368
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,620
He knows

369
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,140
if we intercept it before the deal,

370
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,620
he'll have no leverage.

371
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,980
Alright, you can go now.

372
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,900
Guys, come on.

373
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,580
Interesting.

374
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,140
Even with death looming,

375
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,780
he's still playing tricks.

376
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,500
It still doesn't feel quite right.

377
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,780
Forget it.

378
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,380
Injuries require recovery time.

379
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,300
Waste too much time,

380
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,460
and combat effectiveness plummets.

381
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,660
Don't you agree?

382
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,460
It wouldn't be any fun that way.

383
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:07,120
[Unknown]

384
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,420
Welcome to the Heisha Islands!

385
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,540
You're well-informed.

386
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,780
I just arrived

387
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,940
and already got your greeting.

388
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,100
I can't wait any longer.

389
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,580
Come alone at 3:30 AM.

390
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,500
See you then.

391
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,780
Leopard set a deal with me

392
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,540
at 10 AM sharp tomorrow.

393
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,580
Fine.

394
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:34,900
That settles it.

395
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,340
Just like when we used to fight as kids.

396
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,140
Eat up, drink up.

397
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,180
Build your strength.

398
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,580
A warrior's meal.

399
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,140
No need to hold back. Dig in.

400
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,140
Right. After we eat,
we'll take them down!

401
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,860
We'll just go all out against her.

402
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,660
Guys,

403
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,980
just thinking about tomorrow

404
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,020
gets me fired up!

405
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,580
Luo,

406
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:34,940
this liquor

407
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:37,740
is pretty strong.

408
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,220
I'm not that...

409
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,140
You're right.

410
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,500
A little liquor like this

411
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,260
couldn't possibly knock you out.

412
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,700
Food fuels the body.

413
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,900
An empty stomach won't get you far.

414
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,700
You've got to eat more
when you're injured.

415
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,220
Look how thin you've gotten.

416
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,940
You should cut back on these

417
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,180
high-potency neural stimulants.

418
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,700
They're bad for your health.

419
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,340
This is the last time.

420
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,700
Later,

421
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,620
we'll coordinate inside and outside.

422
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,220
I'll find a chance to create chaos,

423
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:01,100
and you take the opportunity
to rescue Mu Dai.

424
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,180
Don't worry about me.

425
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,300
You're an interesting one.

426
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,420
Drugged your mate

427
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,620
to team up with an outsider like me.

428
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,420
Do you really trust me?

429
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,140
You saw it.

430
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,940
He's ready to throw his life away.

431
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,380
I can't let him take that risk.

432
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,180
Besides,

433
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,180
you're not an outsider.

434
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:32,820
They're your junior

435
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,500
and master.

436
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,020
I can't cut you out of this.

437
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,420
Now that you're leaving,

438
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,260
what about them?

439
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,940
I've been through life and death
with them time and again.

440
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,300
They're all remarkable.

441
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,540
They are

442
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,460
heaven-sent friends.

443
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,300
But this time is different.

444
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,420
Leopard's a desperado.

445
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,580
And they've never even seen a gun.

446
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,100
You know that.

447
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:27,660
I'm leaving.

448
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:37,980
Who's there?

449
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:40,580
Everyone up. Now.

450
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,500
Get out.

451
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:43,900
What's wrong?

452
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,500
What happened?

453
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,820
Senior Master.

454
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,020
We've got a situation.

455
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,860
Speak your minds.

456
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,780
Minds?

457
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,900
Luo Ren has a deep-seated grudge
against Leopard.

458
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,260
But this involves my master,

459
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,380
my grandmaster,

460
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,820
and Free Cao.

461
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,460
His cutting me out makes no sense.

462
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:11,860
Mingshan,

463
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,180
we appreciate Luo Ren's intentions.

464
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,500
We also know it's dangerous.

465
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,220
But

466
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:21,100
we can't just sit here and wait for him.

467
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,740
Don't judge me,

468
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,540
but even if we just stand there

469
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,460
throwing

470
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:27,940
cheap shots,

471
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,740
we'd still help.

472
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,700
You two took all the good lines.

473
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,420
Let me just say one thing.

474
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,780
I may be scared,

475
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,500
but I didn't come all this way

476
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,220
just for a vacation.

477
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,380
Let's pack up

478
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:57,620
and head out.

479
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,340
Let's go.

480
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:25,660
Help him up.

481
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,300
Careful!

482
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,460
I've got him.

483
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,020
What now?

484
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,220
Should we take him with us?

485
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,220
Our sect believes

486
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,340
that every encounter, regardless of when

487
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:38,220
or where it takes place,
is a matter of fate.

488
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,540
Such a large dose
didn't even knock him out.

489
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,620
Let's take him with us.

490
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,340
Keep him safe.

491
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,260
Let's go.

492
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,580
Is he in a fit mental state for this?

493
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,580
Stay with us, Aoki.

494
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,180
Where's Mu Dai?

495
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,700
We've never really had

496
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,980
a proper showdown, have we?

497
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,620
Eager to fight me to the death?

498
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,180
But I can't imagine

499
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,580
how you'd manage that.

500
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,940
Your girlfriend's in my hands.

501
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,820
There are twenty armed guards here.

502
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,780
And you're all alone.

503
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:06,020
You know I have the relic of ill omen.

504
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,620
I'm looking forward to seeing
your performance tonight.

505
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,620
Where's Mu Dai?

506
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,020
Where's the item?

507
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,860
You'd better behave.

508
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:42,060
Or, I'll kill you and still get it.

509
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,140
The one Aoki has is fake.

510
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,500
This one you've got is also fake.

511
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,700
All your efforts
have been just a show for me.

512
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,220
You wanted me to think

513
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,900
you actually had leverage.

514
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:46,860
This is real.

515
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,580
Still being stubborn, huh.

516
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,380
What makes you think it's fake?

517
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:58,980
Have you ever seen the real one?

518
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:02,340
The Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle

519
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,060
has a strong suppressive effect
on the relic of ill omen.

520
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,580
If this were real,

521
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,700
I'd feel extremely uncomfortable

522
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,340
just standing near it.

523
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,140
I see.

524
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,900
This is real.

525
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,260
It's already working on you.

526
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,260
But it's a slow,

527
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,020
subtle process.

528
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,300
In less than a year,

529
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,180
it'll kill you.

530
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,660
How dare you trick me?

531
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,420
This is the real Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle.

532
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,580
I've brought it as you requested.

533
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,460
Now where's Mu Dai?

534
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,860
Killing them would be easy for me.

535
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,300
It's not difficult to kill you either.

536
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,540
Try me.

537
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,340
Take a look.

538
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,900
A little surprise to liven things up.

539
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,580
I'll give you a chance.

540
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,900
Our score needs to be settled.

541
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,860
Defeat me,

542
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,580
and no one here will stop you.

543
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,580
You'll live,

544
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,020
and I'll return your girl to you.

545
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,100
Bring it over.

546
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:28,980
Thirteen-Thousand,

547
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,580
stay with the car and Aoki.

548
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:33,340
Be ready to support us when we come out.

549
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,260
You're not going in.

550
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,700
Although this is the back door,

551
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,620
their people might
come in and out at any time.

552
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,300
So stay sharp.

553
00:33:59,100 --> 00:33:59,860
I'm leaving.

554
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,220
Kill him.

555
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,260
Leopard.

556
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:12,480
♪The sky splits the dawn's horizon♪

557
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:16,360
♪Telling me the end♪

Their main force is inside.

570
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:24,980
The door's locked.

571
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,380
It seems

572
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,260
the only way in
is through that vent up above.

573
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,420
I took a look.

574
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:34,740
It's pretty enclosed.

575
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,220
You two wait for me at the entrance.

576
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:38,860
Stay sharp.

577
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:40,900
Take this.

578
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,020
What are you staring at?

579
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,220
Your Qinggong must be better
than my master's, right?

580
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,180

Well?

595
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,460
From up here,
I can see the general layout.

596
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,820
Most of the force is concentrated
around the iron cages.

597
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:42,980
Can you pick locks?

598
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:43,660
Yes.

599
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,220
Your task now is to pick the locks.

600
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:46,740
Are you afraid of dying?

601
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,420
Yes.

602
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,620
I mean, no.

603
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:49,620
It's okay.

604
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,620
I've tied a rope up here.

605
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:52,900
Later,

606
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,220
you'll climb up the rope.

607
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,620
Swing in using the rope

608
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:56,540
and start shooting at them.

609
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:57,740
And your main job

610
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,140
is to draw their attention.

611
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,100
That way, Cao and I
will have a chance to storm in.

612
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,260
Hurry up.

613
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:10,540

614
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,340
