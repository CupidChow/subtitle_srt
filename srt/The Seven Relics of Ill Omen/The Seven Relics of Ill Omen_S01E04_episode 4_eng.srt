3
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,760
   

4
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,000
   

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,780
   

6
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,820
Come in.

7
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,220
Auntie Hong, what happened to Uncle Li?

8
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,320
You all know now.

9
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,700
I'm Li Ya Qing.

10
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:55,020
The victim was my twin sister, Huo Zi Hong.

11
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,180
She shouldn't have died. 
    

12
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,540
It should have been me.

13
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:04,920
The whole story began with Zhang Guang Hua.

14
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,220
Zhang Guang Hua?

15
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,060
I asked Wan Feng Huo about him.

16
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,140
There doesn't seem to be any connection between you.

17
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,880
I was pregnant with Zhang Guang Hua's child.

18
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,220
Back then, he was a married man.

19
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,640
Normally, such a scandal could not be uncovered.

20
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,020
In those days, in our small town,

21
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:42,520
Zhang Guang Hua was handsome, educated, and naturally romantic.

22
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,660
He was melancholic, lamenting his unhappy family.

23
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:50,380
He sweet-talked me, promising to get a divorce for me.

24
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,740
I actually believed him.

25
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,140
By the time I was pregnant, he had disappeared.

26
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,820
That's when I realized how foolish I had been.

27
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,020
 My parents were deeply disappointed in me. 

28
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:15,280
 Gossip runs rampant in small towns. 

29
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,540
 To avoid prying eyes, they took me elsewhere to have the child aborted. 

30
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,420
 Take it easy. 

31
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,460
 Are you still dizzy? 

32
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,900
 Have some water. I'll make you some noodles. 

33
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,140
 My father couldn't swallow the injustice. 

34
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:47,860
 He pulled strings and had Zhang Guang Hua transferred away. 

35
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,480
 Later, he introduced me to Li Tan. 

36
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,740
 But the atmosphere at home was never the same again. 

37
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,700
 Food is ready. 

38
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,660
 Go ahead. 

39
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,420
 Why aren't you eating? 

40
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,080
 Does it not taste good? 

41
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,340
 Dad, you should eat more greens. 

42
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,900
 I'm full. You two go ahead. 

43
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,540
 I have work to do. 

44
00:04:17,373 --> 00:04:18,698
 I was ashamed. 

45
00:04:18,698 --> 00:04:22,064
 - Never mind him. 
 - It was all my fault. 

46
00:04:22,064 --> 00:04:24,838
 - Then one day... 
 - Have some of the braised pork. 

47
00:04:24,838 --> 00:04:27,540
 I got a call. 

48
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,780
It was from Huo Zi Hong.

49
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:40,400
Auntie Hong, are you saying your abducted sister came back on her own?

50
00:04:41,474 --> 00:04:45,460
She was targeted and secretly taken away.

51
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,040
Later, the couple who took her had a car accident.

52
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,480
Before they died, they told her the truth.

53
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,300
So, she moved back to Luoma Lake and lived in Chenqian Alley.

54
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:02,460
She found my number in the phone book and called me.

55
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,500
 Oh, my goodness. We look exactly alike. 

56
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,980
 Let me see. 

57
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,380
 Just identical. 

58
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,620
 My gosh, exactly the same. 

59
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,720
 Perhaps it's true that blood is thicker than water. 

60
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,520
 Though it was our first meeting, 

61
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,180
 there was no distance between us. 

62
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:45,552
 We were as close as if we'd never been apart. 

63
00:05:45,552 --> 00:05:47,972
 - Zi Hong, come here. 
 - I realized then... 

64
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:50,400
 - Sit down. 
 - That this was a good thing. 

65
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,940
 A great joy. 

66
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:56,260
 - So delicious. 
 - It would lift the gloom at home. 

67
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,100
 - Here. 
 - I wanted to pick the perfect day 

68
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,100
 to introduce her properly and give my parents a surprise. 

69
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,060
So silly.

70
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:08,060
Then came the day...

71
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,200
of our birthday.

72
00:06:15,702 --> 00:06:18,080
 - Zi Hong. 
 - Ya Qing. 

73
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,078
 You look beautiful. 

74
00:06:20,078 --> 00:06:21,120
 Come in. 

75
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,340
 I'm still a bit nervous. 

76
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,360
 It's all right. Come in. 

77
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,797
 Is that Li Tan? 

78
00:06:25,797 --> 00:06:27,260
 No. 

79
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,640
 Just the cake I ordered. 

80
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,220
 Come in. 

81
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,120
 Just relax. Make yourself at home. 

82
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,740
 Take off your coat. 

83
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,300
 Just do everything like normal. Don't be afraid. 

84
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,000
 I'll hide in the closet. 

85
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,420
 Here. 

86
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,320
 Will this work? 

87
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,540
 It's fine. 

88
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,220
 Remember, you are now Li Ya Qing. 

89
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,600
 I'm Huo Zi Hong. Just do whatever you need to do. 

90
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,020
 Hurry up. 

91
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,180
 Go on. 

92
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:28,060
 Ya Qing, bring me some hot water. 

93
00:07:32,092 --> 00:07:33,532
 In a minute. 

94
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,740
 What are you standing there for? 

95
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,860
 Give me the water. 

96
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,540
 Silly girl. 

97
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,060
 Is... Is everything okay? 

98
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,580
 Mom? 

99
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,020
 Mom! 

100
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,720
 What's wrong? 

101
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,780
 What are you doing? 

102
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,460
 You... 

103
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,540
 Dad! 

104
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,760
 No. 

105
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,940
 No, don't. 

106
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,360
 Stay back! 

107
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,860
 No! Please, no! 

108
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,100
 No, no! 

109
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,280
 Don't... Don't come any closer! 

110
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,900
 My mind went completely blank. 

111
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,340
 I kept telling myself not to go out. 

112
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,980
 If I did, it'd all be over. 

113
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,960
Then...

114
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:58,940
everything faded, and I passed out.

115
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,000
What happened next?

116
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,120
Was the person...

117
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,100
really using fishing line?

118
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,920
 When I woke up, I vaguely heard him going out. 

119
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,280
 After I crawled out of the closet... 

120
00:10:17,297 --> 00:10:19,077
Auntie Hong.

121
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,660
I saw the bodies of my parents and my sister.

122
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,380
Auntie Hong.

123
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,560
They were hung in the middle of the room with fishing line.

124
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,800
 Mom! 

125
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:15,340
 I completely lost my mind. 

126
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:20,640
 I grabbed a knife from the floor and ran out. 

127
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,020
 How ironic. 

128
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,520
 The man I loved with all my heart and who was always on my mind 

129
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:11,260
 could kill me and my family so brutally. 

130
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,000
I kept asking why.

131
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,740
Why would he do this to me?

132
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,420
Did you call the police?

133
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,060
No.

134
00:12:28,811 --> 00:12:33,931
I was numb at first.

135
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,980
I wasn't thinking about anything.

136
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,860
But then...

137
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:47,005
I felt a fire burning within me.

138
00:12:47,005 --> 00:12:50,080
I wanted to kill him myself.

139
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,100
I wanted to kill this beast.

140
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,920
Kill him most cruelly.

141
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,160
I wanted to make him suffer exactly as he had made us suffer!

142
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,800
Auntie Hong.

143
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,300
 He didn't go home that night. 

144
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,020
 He went to the long-distance bus station. 

145
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,860
 I followed him. 

146
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,280
 Bought the same ticket. 

147
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,840
 Boarded the same bus. 

148
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,360
 Hatred can transform a person in an instant. 

149
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,980
 I was able to disguise myself so calmly 

150
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:36,560
 and follow him without being noticed. 

151
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,920
 After two days and nights and multiple transfers, 

152
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,100
 we finally arrived in Datong. 

153
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,320
   

154
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,240
 After what he'd done, 

155
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,020
 that beast could still eat calmly. 

156
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,480
 What are you doing? 

157
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,740
 Pay the bill. 

158
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,300
 Why are you running? Are you in a hurry to kick the bucket? 

159
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,020
 The flood discharge starts in three minutes. 

160
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:51,160
 Residents downstream of the floodgates must evacuate now. 

161
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,280
 The flood discharge starts in three minutes. 

162
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,380
 Residents downstream of the floodgates must evacuate now. 

163
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,100
 Ya... Ya Qing? 

164
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,820
 How could it be you? 

165
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,140
 How could it be me? 

166
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,020
 What do you think? 

167
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,100
 I... 

168
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,640
 What did I ever do to make you want to kill me? 

169
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,180
 And even my family! 

170
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,920
 Why did you kill them? 

171
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,320
 Why? 

172
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,400
 I didn't want to kill you! I swear I didn't! 

173
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,822
 I don't know why! 

174
00:16:13,822 --> 00:16:16,020
 Why did you do this to me? 

175
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:19,100
 Answer me! 

176
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,620
 You devil! 

177
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,920
 Go to hell! 

178
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,260
 Of course, I was no match for Zhang Guang Hua. 

179
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,180
 I was losing strength. 

180
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,380
 But maybe my family was protecting me. 

181
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:09,700
 I managed to climb up along the guardrail. 

182
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:14,876
I sat there all night, thinking.

183
00:19:16,365 --> 00:19:18,365
I didn't kill anyone.

184
00:19:19,065 --> 00:19:24,685
But Zhang Guang Hua's death was indirectly caused by me.

185
00:19:24,685 --> 00:19:29,444
And if I went back, I'd have to explain everything to the police.

186
00:19:29,444 --> 00:19:33,860
Then our affair would've been exposed.

187
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:38,920
In those days, in that small town, gossip could ruin lives.

188
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:43,520
Even my dead parents would be dragged through the mud.

189
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,838
At dawn, watching the sunrise,

190
00:19:47,838 --> 00:19:53,975
I suddenly felt heaven had given me a second chance.

191
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:58,979
So, you decided to impersonate Huo Zi Hong?

192
00:19:58,979 --> 00:20:01,260
The murderer was dead.

193
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,680
My family was avenged.

194
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,220
Li Ya Qing's old life...

195
00:20:07,504 --> 00:20:09,520
was over.

196
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:15,100
It was best to start fresh with a new name.

197
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,760
You already knew Zhang Guang Hua's fate,

198
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,240
yet you still asked Wan Feng Huo about him?

199
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,960
I need to see him, alive or dead.

200
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,780
I couldn't rest easy without confirmation.

201
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:28,360
Then what about Uncle Li?

202
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,720
Didn't you think about him?

203
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,000
No.

204
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,060
Not at all.

205
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:37,920
I only dated Li Tan to make my father happy.

206
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,780
So, you never loved him?

207
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,540
It was all an act?

208
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,760
Is that what you told him?

209
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,060
He looked devastated earlier.

210
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,700
He left without a word.

211
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,440
Auntie Hong, don't you think this is cruel?

212
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,920
He'll see his entire life's devotion as a joke.

213
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,721
At least you could tell him a white lie.

214
00:21:00,721 --> 00:21:04,620
It's exactly because he wasted half his life

215
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:09,820
that I don't want him to keep wasting it on someone like me.

216
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,788
That's enough.

217
00:21:17,788 --> 00:21:21,686
I've told you everything I need to.

218
00:21:21,686 --> 00:21:23,566
I'm tired.

219
00:21:24,673 --> 00:21:26,893
You should go now.

220
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,760
You don't need to feel sorry for Li Tan.

221
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,200
Love can't be faked.

222
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,260
He will eventually discover the truth.

223
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,540
He deserves to know.

224
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,300
Things seem to be clearer, but also confusing.

225
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,480
It doesn't seem to help Ping Ting much.

226
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,240
What are you going to do next?

227
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,620
Investigating may lead nowhere.

228
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:31,300
And even if it does, it might not be satisfying.

229
00:22:32,824 --> 00:22:34,880
I'll take it step by step.

230
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,773
I think...

231
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:39,073
I should return to Xiaoshang River.

232
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,480
That's wise.

233
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,880
It's more reassuring for you to be by Ping Ting's side.

234
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,960
It's good to meet you.

235
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,640
See you next time.

236
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,200
 Mu Dai. 

237
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,720
 After revealing the secret I've kept for years, 

238
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,540
 I felt a sense of relief. 

239
00:24:00,151 --> 00:24:04,380
 But when I think about how my cowardice and avoidance 

240
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,200
 brought misfortune to so many, 

241
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,760
 even causing some to waste half their lives, 

242
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:13,180
 I feel ashamed of this relief. 

243
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:22,540
 I've decided to return to Luoma Lake and finish what I didn't complete. 

244
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,079
 Don't worry about me. 

245
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:26,419
 I'll take care of myself. 

246
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:34,821
 It's time I faced my past, present, and future with courage. 

247
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:14,420
   

248
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,180
Ping Ting.

249
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,300
Ping Ting!

250
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:59,546
   

251
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:06,400
 Auntie Hong won't let me go see her, and Luo Ren hasn't replied. 

252
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,280
Why hasn't he replied to my messages?

253
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,420
Let's share what we know.

254
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,120
 Hello? 

255
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,420
Hello, Luo Ren.

256
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,400
 Sorry. 

257
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,640
 I've been busy with Ping Ting's matters since returning. 

258
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,260
 Didn't check my phone much. 

259
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,460
It's okay.

260
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,320
How is Ping Ting?

261
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,320
Not good.

262
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:44,180
Last night, she almost broke the guardrail trying to escape.

263
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,220
She's that strong?

264
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,540
Just like my uncle back then.

265
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:50,620
 Physical abilities far exceed normal limits. 

266
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,400
Thankfully, she's fine during the day.

267
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,840
But at night, she acts strangely.

268
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,400
The nurse just gave her a sedative.

269
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,720
She should be okay now.

270
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,320
The guardrail has been reinforced.

271
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,770
Won't constant sedation take a toll on her body?

272
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:07,410
Yes.

273
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,841
It's not a long-term solution.

274
00:27:09,841 --> 00:27:14,927
But right now, staying by her side is all I can do.

275
00:27:14,927 --> 00:27:18,827
Then... What do we do?

276
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:32,460
 Physical changes. 

277
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,440
 Becoming a different person. 

278
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,180
 It does seem like being possessed. 

279
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,560
   

280
00:27:51,991 --> 00:27:53,073
Hello?

281
00:27:53,073 --> 00:27:54,374
Hello, Uncle Wan?

282
00:27:54,374 --> 00:27:56,160
Do you remember me? It's Mu Dai.

283
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,700
Of course, I do.

284
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,460
Miss Mu.

285
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,580
Ground rules first.

286
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:05,080
You pay upfront for information here.

287
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,600
No, Uncle Wan.

288
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,932
Clients come first these days, right?

289
00:28:09,932 --> 00:28:11,920
 Auntie Hong is your loyal client, isn't she? 

290
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,440
And I'm your potential client, right?

291
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,751
I could even bring you more clients, right?

292
00:28:15,751 --> 00:28:17,560
So, for a valuable client like me,

293
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,500
shouldn't you have a little chat with me and offer some free service

294
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,559
to keep me interested?

295
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,240
 You're right. 

296
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,901
 That makes a lot of sense. 

297
00:28:26,901 --> 00:28:28,672
 All right. 

298
00:28:28,672 --> 00:28:31,060
So, what would you like to discuss?

299
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:34,720
 Well, you handled the Luoma Lake case. 

300
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,480
 And you know it's full of doubts and weird aspects. 

301
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,100
Well, you've got connections.

302
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,480
Do you know any reliable experts,

303
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,600
 like someone who studies supernatural phenomena? 

304
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:53,040
 I figure it's best to consult experts, right? 

305
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,640
Uncle Wan, are you still there?

306
00:29:00,425 --> 00:29:03,740
   

307
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,540
Kun Talk?

308
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:09,101
 His name is Shen Mu Kun. 

309
00:29:09,101 --> 00:29:11,662
 An expert in supernatural phenomena. 

310
00:29:11,662 --> 00:29:14,623
 Also deeply interested in ancient mysticism and aliens. 

311
00:29:14,623 --> 00:29:16,440
 He's known in the field as Master Kun. 

312
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:21,241
 He's a walking encyclopedia and has read countless ancient texts. 

313
00:29:21,241 --> 00:29:23,210
 A true polymath. 

314
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:26,870
 You can consult him about this. 

315
00:29:42,338 --> 00:29:43,816
Hello?

316
00:29:43,816 --> 00:29:46,120
Hello, Mr. Mighty.

317
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,620
Uncle Kun, hi.

318
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,001
I'm a friend of Wan Feng Huo.

319
00:29:49,001 --> 00:29:51,092
My name is Mu Dai.

320
00:29:51,092 --> 00:29:52,760
Old Wan's referral?

321
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,640
 He mentioned you. 

322
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,656
 Honestly, that guy... 

323
00:29:56,656 --> 00:29:59,500
 I've been busy writing a book lately. 

324
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,620
But since you're his friend,

325
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,140
I'll give you five minutes. Go ahead.

326
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,240
All right, okay.

327
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,860
Here's the thing.

328
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:09,380
In your research, have you ever encountered cases

329
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,720
 where a person is controlled by some force, 

330
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,020
 leading them to do bad things against their will? 

331
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,960
 And this force can leave the body and harm others? 

332
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,860
Your description is rather vague.

333
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,205
 Maybe I'm not phrasing it well. 

334
00:30:23,205 --> 00:30:25,360
 Listen, if you want answers, 

335
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,880
 you need to provide the five specifics. 

336
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,740
 Who, what, when, where, and what makes it unusual. 

337
00:30:33,004 --> 00:30:35,284
Here's what happened.

338
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:43,840
Did you just say human skin?

339
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,260
 Yes. Each victim was missing a piece of skin. 

340
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,380
 Quite rectangular. 

341
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,785
Rectangular?

342
00:30:49,785 --> 00:30:52,086
How precise? Any measurements?

343
00:30:52,086 --> 00:30:53,567
Yes, let me check.

344
00:30:53,567 --> 00:30:55,967
   

345
00:30:55,967 --> 00:30:59,020
23.5 centimeters long and five centimeters wide.

346
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,680
That's not very rectangular.

347
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,280
That's the size of a long strip.

348
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:08,640
This size is very special and highly indicative.

349
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,920
Very special?

350
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,380
From your reaction,

351
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:15,240
I can tell that you don't read books or learn history, do you?

352
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,100
 Ancient bamboo slips had a standardized size. 

353
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,780
About one chi in length.

354
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:23,500
Converted to modern units, that's about 23.5 centimeters.

355
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,160
 23.5 multiplied by 5. 

356
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,200
 That was the common size for all wooden slips. 

357
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,280
You just said...

358
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:35,300
This force can twist the human heart

359
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:38,480
and make them do bad things against their will?

360
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,060
Yes.

361
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,633
Twisting the human heart.

362
00:31:42,633 --> 00:31:45,014
Making them do bad things against their will.

363
00:31:45,014 --> 00:31:47,649
23.5 multiplied by 5.

364
00:31:47,649 --> 00:31:49,889
I've heard...

365
00:31:49,889 --> 00:31:51,660
This story.

366
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,460
I... I even took notes on it.

367
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,680
Yes, but my mind just went blank for a second.

368
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:59,100
I... I need to check my notes.

369
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,400
 Give me a moment. 

370
00:32:31,281 --> 00:32:32,881
Pocketty.

371
00:32:33,508 --> 00:32:34,660
My name is Mu Dai.

372
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,801
I know. That's why I'm calling you that.

373
00:32:37,801 --> 00:32:42,061
 If he gives you a nickname while talking, 

374
00:32:42,061 --> 00:32:46,581
 it means he considers you a friend. 

375
00:32:46,581 --> 00:32:47,980
 Listen up. 

376
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,972
 Born of wood, 

377
00:32:49,972 --> 00:32:51,980
parasitizes in the human body,

378
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:56,669
twists the heart, and lures its host into evil.

379
00:32:56,669 --> 00:33:00,673
Thus, it is called a relic of ill omen.

380
00:33:00,673 --> 00:33:02,873
Relic of ill omen?

381
00:33:16,198 --> 00:33:18,158
 Let us... 

382
00:33:19,749 --> 00:33:22,209
 Begin. 

383
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:33,040
You're saying that Master Kun heard about this thing?

384
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,640
He found records in his notes from over a decade ago.

385
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,280
The shape matches.

386
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,445
The description fits, too.

387
00:33:39,445 --> 00:33:44,625
Where and from whom did he hear about this thing?

388
00:33:44,625 --> 00:33:47,013
 - It seems it was from...  
 - Ren!

389
00:33:47,013 --> 00:33:49,033
Ping Ting's in trouble!

390
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,240
It was fine. Why did the lamp just fall?

391
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,680
Ping Ting!

392
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,960
Get the first aid kit!

393
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,860
Ren! Hurry!

394
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,620
Ping Ting.

395
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:23,660
Hey, Ren.

396
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,560
Ren, be gentle.

397
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,460
Be gentle.

398
00:34:52,945 --> 00:34:55,785
What just happened?

399
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,507
Nothing. Ping Ting just had a fall.

400
00:35:01,507 --> 00:35:04,520
 - Uncle Zheng got scared.  
 - New Boss Lady, what are you...

401
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,920
What are you doing?

402
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,706
Why do you sound so far away?

403
00:35:10,706 --> 00:35:12,886
Then I'll move closer.

404
00:35:14,142 --> 00:35:15,741
   

405
00:35:15,741 --> 00:35:17,140
You sure you're okay?

406
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,360
I'm fine.

407
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:23,000
By the way, what else did Master Kun mention?

408
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,200
 Nothing else for now. 

409
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,526
 He heard about it over ten years ago during his travels up north. 

410
00:35:27,526 --> 00:35:31,020
It's a kind of folk tale.

411
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,885
 The records are limited. 

412
00:35:32,885 --> 00:35:34,800
What are you waiting for? You're bleeding out.

413
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,100
 This isn't how you treat a wound. 

414
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,945
Uncle Zheng, please get me some water.

415
00:35:37,945 --> 00:35:39,166
All right, sure.

416
00:35:39,166 --> 00:35:42,436
But that cut is so deep. What if it gets infected?

417
00:35:42,436 --> 00:35:45,297
You're injured? Is it serious?

418
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,161
Nothing. Just a scratch.

419
00:35:48,161 --> 00:35:49,780
I got careless.

420
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,220
What happened?

421
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:55,640
Ping Ting's condition has worsened.

422
00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:01,059
 She's started attacking people, and she doesn't just do it randomly. 

423
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:02,792
She actually...

424
00:36:03,776 --> 00:36:05,504
uses strategies.

425
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:07,280
Strategies?

426
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,401
Yes.

427
00:36:08,401 --> 00:36:10,080
 She first sabotaged the lamp, 

428
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,085
 then pretended to be hit by it. 

429
00:36:13,085 --> 00:36:15,050
 Thankfully, I got there in time. 

430
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:17,431
What's your plan now?

431
00:36:17,431 --> 00:36:19,596
I just gave her a sedative.

432
00:36:19,596 --> 00:36:21,700
Then I dismissed the caregiver.

433
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:26,185
With Ping Ting like this, I don't dare let anyone near her.

434
00:36:26,185 --> 00:36:28,278
Do you need help?

435
00:36:28,983 --> 00:36:31,303
It's fine. But with her like this,

436
00:36:32,094 --> 00:36:33,655
there's no one I can turn to.

437
00:36:33,655 --> 00:36:35,095
Me.

438
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,740
You?

439
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,920
Forget it.

440
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,640
Ping Ting is dangerous now.

441
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:46,240
Luo Ren, are you doubting me or my skills?

442
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,600
 Uncle Zheng is getting old, you're injured, 

443
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,020
and Ping Ting is unstable.

444
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,840
You need someone who can restrain her, watch over her,

445
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,360
and help with personal care.

446
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,760
Who else fits better than me?

447
00:36:59,185 --> 00:37:01,358
That's not appropriate.

448
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:02,539
And you're in Lixi.

449
00:37:02,539 --> 00:37:03,740
It's too much trouble.

450
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,661
I'm not offering to help for free.

451
00:37:05,661 --> 00:37:07,401
I have conditions.

452
00:37:08,281 --> 00:37:09,830
What conditions?

453
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:11,531
You know I'm in Lixi.

454
00:37:11,531 --> 00:37:14,351
You're covering my round-trip flight tickets, right?

455
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,821
No problem.

456
00:37:16,821 --> 00:37:18,821
And room and board?

457
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,680
Sure.

458
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,160
Mu Dai.

459
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,400
Thank you.

460
00:37:41,878 --> 00:37:43,239
Come on, we're friends.

461
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:45,299
It's a matter of urgency.

462
00:37:45,299 --> 00:37:47,316
Don't be so formal.

463
00:37:47,316 --> 00:37:49,996
Well, see you later.

464
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,720
I brought a suitcase.

465
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,560
- Let me get that. 
 - Thank you.

466
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,840
- Luo Ren. 
 - Sorry, I couldn't pick you up.

467
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,880
You had to take a cab.

468
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,900
It's fine. You're injured.

469
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,700
It's nothing.

470
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,960
Serves you right.

471
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,200
This morning, when changing the dressing,

472
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,920
the wound was still bleeding like crazy.

473
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,260
You always play the tough guy.

474
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:42,240
Old folks exaggerate.

475
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,300
Let's go.

476
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,500
Ping Ting.

477
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,700
Mu Dai. This iron gate is new.

478
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,360
Here's the switch.

479
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,640
Usually, meals are passed through this opening.

480
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,180
All utensils are made of paper.

481
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,600
Let me.

482
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,660
Ping Ting?

483
00:39:29,257 --> 00:39:31,217
What's going on?

484
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,520
Hasn't she showered in days?

485
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,680
Time to get to work.

486
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,220
Ping Ting?

487
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,680
Here.

488
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,020
Ping Ting, this is Mu Dai.

489
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,780
She's here to help you.

490
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,620
Be good, will you?

491
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,620
Let's go.

492
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,820
Come on.

493
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:17,000
Fun, isn't it?

494
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:24,480
♫  Give me wings to pierce the universe  ♫

495
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,420
Is the water too cold?

496
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:35,320
♫  In these ordinary moments  ♫

497
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,640
Ping Ting, turn around a bit more.

498
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,512
Let me rinse you off.

499
00:40:40,512 --> 00:40:41,643
Ping Ting?

500
00:40:41,643 --> 00:40:43,900
♫  I'll fly to forbidden snowy mountain peaks  ♫

501
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,500
Ping Ting?

502
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,387
Ping Ting?

503
00:40:47,387 --> 00:40:51,129

 'Palm Print' - An Qi 

506
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,890
♫  The sky splits the dawn's horizon  ♫

507
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:15,240
♫  It's telling me the end  ♫

508
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:19,680
♫  (The end) Is about to gently appear  ♫

509
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:26,020
♫  Like a whisper in my mind, a fleeting touch across my face  ♫

510
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,400
♫  Yet I find myself in the dark  ♫

511
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:38,020
♫  Every hand has two sides  ♫

512
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:40,860
♫  One offers blessings  ♫

513
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:44,340
♫  One waits in silence  ♫

514
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:49,360
♫  There's no end to this game  ♫

515
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:55,740
♫  Following the traces left behind  ♫

516
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:58,460
♫  If you were me  ♫

517
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:05,560
♫  You'd understand every tear of mine  ♫

518
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,780
♫  (The reason they fall)  ♫

519
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:10,190
♫  If I were you  ♫

520
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:17,000
♫  I'd feel each breath you take  ♫

521
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,860
♫  Then we'd move forward  ♫

522
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:24,100
♫  The sky splits the dawn's horizon  ♫

523
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:28,520
♫  It's telling me the end  ♫
