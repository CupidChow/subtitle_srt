00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:06,100
   

5
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,180
   

6
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,460
All rubbernecks!

7
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,820
They just love it, huh.

8
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,680
Some even came from out of town just for this.

9
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,980
Heartless.

10
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:20,340
Chubby, it's natural for villagers to be afraid when a savage enters their village.

11
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,160
Were they supposed to invite her in?

12
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,100
And it's natural for them to rubberneck.

13
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,100
When you first arrived and heard a savage had been killed,

14
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,160
you might've done that too.

15
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,960
They're not heartless.

16
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,780
They...

17
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,020
They just don't understand savages.

18
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,340
To them, she was just a terrifying beast.

19
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,440
She wasn't a beast.

20
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,180
Master, you're right.

21
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,260
I have no right to judge those villagers.

22
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:56,840
When we first encountered her, we thought she was a monster, too.

23
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,460
Well?

24
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:01,040
I spoke to the village head.

25
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,620
Hong Sha has to stay for a few days.

26
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,380
Her grandpa's situation is complicated.

27
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,220
She may need to assist with the investigation.

28
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,232
But we have to get the relic of ill omen back to Lixi now.

29
00:02:08,232 --> 00:02:09,440
No more delays.

30
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,624
We'll split up.

31
00:02:10,624 --> 00:02:12,660
One group takes the relic of ill omen to Lixi.

32
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,800
- Then, I'll stay. 
 - I'll stay.

33
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,460
She saved my life.

34
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,820
Walking away now would make me no better than a beast.

35
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:24,020
Besides, Hong Sha has to stay here.

36
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,600
I might as well keep her company.

37
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,360
I...

38
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:41,500
Zha Ma, if there's any news about savages, contact me anytime.

39
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,700
Oh...

40
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,780
this is from my mom.

41
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:57,280
She asked me to tell you something.

42
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,220
She noticed you the moment you entered the village.

43
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:07,020
She could see you carry deep sorrow and burdens.

44
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,580
But she hopes you won't let them crush you.

45
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,100
Just keep moving forward.

46
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,780
The road ahead will get brighter.

47
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:21,133
She also said if you ever meet someone you like, never let her go.

48
00:03:21,133 --> 00:03:22,940
People drift apart too easily.

49
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:27,560
Once they're gone, you might never find them again.

50
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,395
Give it to me.

51
00:03:32,395 --> 00:03:33,880
- Help me out. 
 - Hand me that.

52
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,540
Let's go.

53
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,500
Don't pick unripe fruit anymore.

54
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,240
Choose ones like this.

55
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,200
Red. And sweet.

56
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:14,655
♫  In the deepest night, longing takes shape  ♫

57
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:21,495
♫  With warm memories, I slowly hold you close  ♫

58
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:28,355
♫  The path of growth is inevitably lonely  ♫

59
00:04:28,355 --> 00:04:34,115
♫  But someone will light your way like the stars  ♫

60
00:04:35,235 --> 00:04:42,095
♫  Perhaps fate is too muddy, through the storm  ♫

61
00:04:42,095 --> 00:04:48,955
♫  Stubbornness and courage keep you strong  ♫

62
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:55,695
♫  In the gaps of time within memories  ♫

63
00:04:55,695 --> 00:05:01,255
♫  There will be light, gently warming you  ♫

64
00:05:01,255 --> 00:05:05,360
♫  The long road of life is scarred and cruel  ♫

65
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,180
That savage was a good person.

66
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,080
Not a beast.

67
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,120
So, when she's there, kind souls will keep her company.

68
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:22,720
♫  Companionship and care are like gentle beams of light  ♫

69
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,360
♫  Embark on the journey, healing all loneliness  ♫

70
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,180
♫  Waiting together for the sunrise  ♫

71
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,760
Missing your grandpa?

72
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,340
It's okay.

73
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,520
Of course, you can miss him.

74
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:58,240
 No matter what, your grandpa loved you. 

75
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,900
 Cry if you need to. 

76
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,700
♫  Perhaps fate is too muddy, through the storm  ♫

77
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,380
 It'll make you feel better. 

78
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:11,120
♫  Stubbornness and courage keep you strong  ♫

79
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:18,000
♫  In the gaps of time within memories  ♫

80
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,660
♫  There will be light, gently warming you  ♫

81
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:30,430
♫  The long road of life is scarred and cruel  ♫

82
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:37,260
♫  But some will heal your pain  ♫

83
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,180
All right then.

84
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,740
We'll talk later, Uncle Kun.

85
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,540
What did Uncle Kun say?

86
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:50,340
He was worried when he couldn't reach us these past few days.

87
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,480
And he made a major breakthrough on his trip.

88
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,080
He'll share in the group chat later and discuss it with us.

89
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,580
He also wants to review what we told him.

90
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:03,260
Oh, and he brought us gifts.

91
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,740
Gifts?

92
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,100
- What kind of gifts? 
 - He didn't say.

93
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:11,840
But coming from him, it's bound to be extraordinary.

94
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,340
Extraordinary.

95
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,120
Let's hope so.

96
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,020
By the way, both Thirteen-Thousand and I wanted to stay with Hong Sha.

97
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,780
Why did you give me that look?

98
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,760
He's better suited to stay.

99
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,980
Why? Hong Sha and I are like sisters.

100
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,060
Wouldn't it be better if I stayed?

101
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,940
The broken understand the broken.

102
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,840
They'll have more to talk about.

103
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,160
- And that might help them heal. 
 - Fine.

104
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,380
Hit.

105
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,500
Hit... Hit him.

106
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,020
What are you mumbling about?

107
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,820
Is this yours?

108
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,220
Can I open it?

109
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,140
I have one just like it.

110
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,380
It's from Zha Ma's mom, right?

111
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:07,640
Do you know what it's for?

112
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,260
 For enhancing romantic luck. It's very effective. 

113
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,520
 If you ever meet someone you like, 

114
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,380
wear it on your wrist.

115
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,520
 Let's take a break up ahead. 

116
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:38,450
   

117
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,940
Mu Dai.

118
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:57,540
Remember that question you asked me in Wuzhu Village?

119
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,360
I've asked you a lot of questions.

120
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,611
I...

121
00:09:00,611 --> 00:09:02,820
 All right. Ask me now. 

122
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,760
 Do you like me? 

123
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,580
I haven't...

124
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,100
answered you.

125
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,360
Is it too late...

126
00:09:25,867 --> 00:09:27,907
to answer now?

127
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:38,982
You once said the best time for two people to be together

128
00:09:38,982 --> 00:09:43,222
is when they like each other.

129
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,740
Mu Dai...

130
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,620
I like you.

131
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,520
But I don't know

132
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,860
how you feel now.

133
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,120
What if I've already moved on?

134
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,720
What would you do?

135
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,500
Then, I'll pursue you.

136
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:28,732
With everything I've got.

137
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,940
Is it too late?

138
00:10:43,521 --> 00:10:45,581
Zha Ma's mom is never wrong, is she?

139
00:10:53,242 --> 00:10:55,950
I don't want us to go our separate ways.

140
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,990
I don't want to see you holding someone else's hand.

141
00:10:59,086 --> 00:11:02,330
She said my future would be brighter.

142
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:06,350
But without you in it,

143
00:11:07,532 --> 00:11:09,372
nothing could ever be bright enough.

144
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,160
It's fine, I...

00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:23,960
♫  I'l take your hand till the world ends  ♫

166
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,285
That's so sweet.

167
00:13:26,285 --> 00:13:28,919
As the unwritten rule goes,

168
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:33,820
teammates always end up pairing off by the end.

169
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,440
Master and him... might work things out.

170
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:43,700
♫  I just want to slowly, slowly hold you tight  ♫

171
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:49,800
♫  Through all the time we've spent together  ♫

172
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,460
♫  And countless memories  ♫

173
00:13:54,460 --> 00:14:01,120
♫  I just want to slowly, slowly hold you tight  ♫

174
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,640
So annoying.

175
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,760
Who are you trying to scare?

176
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,560
Got a problem with that?

177
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,232
 Chubby, you... 

178
00:14:38,232 --> 00:14:40,525
 Move aside. I can't see clearly now. 

179
00:14:40,525 --> 00:14:42,220
I almost forgot about you.

180
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,200
Here.

181
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,520
Have a proper look.

182
00:14:49,398 --> 00:14:52,600
This relic of ill omen is unusual.

183
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,840
Could it be because...

184
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,480
Our theory might be correct.

185
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,120
There's another savage.

186
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,240
And another amber.

187
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,300
This relic of ill omen isn't complete.

188
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,135
You're right.

189
00:15:08,135 --> 00:15:10,555
Its reactions are so abnormal.

190
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,760
It hasn't shown us the shadow of water.

191
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,300
So, there is remaining part of the relic of ill omen hidden in Yueliang Mountain?

192
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,542
But it's fine.

193
00:15:21,542 --> 00:15:23,440
We have most of it here.

194
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,880
The remaining traces probably can't cause much harm.

195
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,820
I've told Zha Ma to contact me immediately

196
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,860
if anything happens.

197
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:34,080
We can't let the remnants hurt anyone else.

198
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:39,840
What do you all think about my trip to Lengquan?

199
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,980
It was really valuable.

200
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,720
Bo Yang Zi, the bamboo slips, Feng, Huang, and Luan.

201
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,320
They all share striking parallels with our experiences.

202
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,140
Let me be blunt.

203
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,240
Whether it's water or blood,

204
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,000
 they can only temporarily restrain the relics of ill omen. 

205
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:04,840
 Only by finding those legendary items 

206
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,920
 can we seal them away forever. 

207
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,120
But where are we supposed to find them?

208
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,100
And how many relics of ill omen are there in total?

209
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,920
If there are only three, then we're pretty much done.

210
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,960
What's his problem?

211
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,197
He must be stumped.

212
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:30,397
 Luo Ren! 

213
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,720
In a minute.

214
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,520
Chubby, I'm paying you to work.

215
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,660
But look at you.

216
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,880
Luo Ren!

217
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,540
Work for a few days and then disappeared for over a week.

218
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,840
- What were you thinking? 
 - Renting the space, renovations.

219
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,400
- They all fell on me. 
 - Got it.

220
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,000
- I'm sorry. 
 - Oh, just shut up.

221
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,120
I'll be more responsible, all right?

222
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,320
- Look at you. 
 - Look at that attitude.

223
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,115
He... He said he still has important matters to handle.

224
00:16:55,115 --> 00:16:56,122
Nonsense.

225
00:16:56,122 --> 00:16:58,240
- I've been so busy these past few days. 
 - Stop bullshitting.

226
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,020
I haven't even had time to take care of Ping Ting.

227
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,080
Thanks to Miss Lian.

228
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,712
Otherwise, this whole thing would've...

229
00:17:03,712 --> 00:17:05,540
Miss Lian?

230
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:10,180
The owner of Lianyan Boutique right across from Phoenix Pavilion.

231
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,800
When she heard we were renovating, she was really enthusiastic.

232
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,400
She gave a lot of great suggestions.

233
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,520
Wait, how do you know her?

234
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,172
I just told you.

235
00:17:18,172 --> 00:17:19,660
We're neighbors.

236
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:23,180
A neighbor cares more than you.

237
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:27,293
Stop contacting her from now on.

238
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,515
Why?

239
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,280
Well, Hong Sha, I need to head back.

240
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,300
Now that I've gotten you here, my job's done.

241
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:47,880
Chubby just told me Uncle Zhang is waiting to skin me alive when I return.

242
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,040
I really have to go.

243
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,480
You can handle the rest on your own, right?

244
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,088
Do...

245
00:18:03,088 --> 00:18:06,328
Do you actually know what needs to be done?

246
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,320
What else is there?

247
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:19,760
First, you'll need a proper portrait of your grandpa, right?

248
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:29,540
And, for the funeral arrangements, you'll need to prepare everything.

249
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,520
Elegiac couplets, wreaths, mourning dress, crapes.

250
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,240
And the burial plot.

251
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,580
And the cemetery.

252
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,480
You'll have to make calls to find a geomantically...

253
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,960
Wait, hold on.

254
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,760
Start from the beginning.

255
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,232
- First, the portrait, then... 
 - I'll handle it.

256
00:18:48,232 --> 00:18:49,720
Let me.

257
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,760
Good thing I'm here.

258
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,040
Boss Lday Dai tried to fight me over staying.

259
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,400
What use would she have been?

260
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,480
Thirteen-Thousand...

261
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:16,420
how do you know all this so well?

262
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,760
Me?

263
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,340
Of course I know.

264
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,941
I've been on my own since I was a teenager.

265
00:19:20,941 --> 00:19:23,980
Back then, to scrape by, I did everything,

266
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:27,440
like, playing the filial mourner, professional wailing.

267
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,560
Old Yan!

268
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,260
Old Yan!

269
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,640
Old Yan!

270
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,560
Who are you people?

271
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,280
- You guys... 
 - Finally, someone's here.

272
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,920
Where's your grandfather?

273
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,200
Inside.

274
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,160
- Old Yan! 
 - Wait.

275
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,720
Old Yan!

276
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,040
Old Yan, come out!

277
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,480
You can talk to me instead.

278
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,140
Where's your grandfather?

279
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,660
Dead? Are you all messing with me?

280
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,600
I kept extending the deadline, and now you pull this "playing dead" stunt on me?

281
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,700
Pretending to be dead, huh?

282
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,380
Think that gets you out of paying?

283
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,720
Get your grandfather out here!

284
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,380
What do you mean "pretending"?

285
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,540
I have his death certificate.

286
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,460
Want to see it? I'll show you.

287
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,000
Still acting?

288
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,100
I'll break your arm right now.

289
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,980
Not bad moves, eh? She taught me.

290
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,320
You know how the Yan family fights. You guys don't stand a chance.

291
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,940
You won't even afford the medical bills.

292
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,480
Debts should be repaid.

293
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,640
That's only fair.

294
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,300
But claims need proof.

295
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,380
Where's the IOU?

296
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,500
The IOU? Give it to me.

297
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,320
Man, is this IOU even legit?

298
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,460
Even debt collection has to follow basic rules.

299
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,040
Deadbeats lecturing me about rules?

300
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,380
Read it clearly!

301
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:09,860
How much did my uncle owe you?

302
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,820
Missy, listen up.

303
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:16,560
Even with this house as collateral, you still owe me 1.2 million!

304
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,000
I've got not just this IOU, but recordings from every visit.

305
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,860
Your grandfather promised me he'd repay this!

306
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,900
What now? The Yan family's word means nothing?

307
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,720
Hey, no need for insults. Calm down.

308
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,460
- I'll pay it. 
 - Calm...

309
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,648
I'll repay you.

310
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:41,100
But listen up. The Yan family always keeps its word!

311
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,820
If I say I'll repay, I will.

312
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,852
But I don't have the money right now.

313
00:21:44,852 --> 00:21:47,900
What I do have are two working hands to earn it.

314
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,480
It might take time, but you'll get every last cent.

315
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,060
Understood?

316
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,700
No money now? Then how do you plan to repay?

317
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,080
And "take time"?

318
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,160
What trick are you pulling on me?

319
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,140
If you don't accept this...

320
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,820
Then, just kill me.

321
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:18,140
You heard her, man. She's not afraid to die.

322
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,080
Let me suggest something.

323
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,980
Call the police.

324
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:26,980
Let the judge decide whether a niece should pay her uncle's debts.

325
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,720
What do you think?

326
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:35,080
A young girl willing to repay millions in debt.

327
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,140
That's more than fair.

328
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,560
Fine.

329
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,660
But every last cent better be paid!

330
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,160
Let's go.

331
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,440
Well, Hong Sha...

332
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,700
are you sure you'll be all right?

333
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,820
I'll manage.

334
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,000
Are you sure?

335
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,320
It's just... You wrote me that checklist.

336
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,920
I'll follow it step by step.

337
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,920
I know I'm the last of the Yan family now.

338
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,760
That's exactly why I have to live well.

339
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,880
Having nothing left doesn't matter.

340
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,660
I can start from scratch. Begin anew.

341
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:10,960
I'll work hard and earn my way back

342
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,000
to being rich again.

343
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:22,160
Okay, since you've said that, I can leave reassured.

344
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,100
But let me correct one thing.

345
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:28,720
Well, it's not like that you have nothing.

346
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:34,620
Head south from here. There's a place called Destiny Bar.

347
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,340
Your friends are there.

348
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:40,505
As long as they've got something, you'll get your share.

349
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,200
I'm leaving now.

350
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,960
Here.

351
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:45,000
Hey, make way.

352
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,580
- All right, put it here. 
 - I told you to take Ping Ting out for a walk.

353
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,960
- Why are you here? 
 - Today's the plumbing and electrical work.

354
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,420
I don't trust it without supervision.

355
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,640
Look, we're short on pipes.

356
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,060
Don't worry, Miss Lian is taking care of Ping Ting.

357
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,280
Why her again?

358
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,600
And who's this?

359
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,200
Oh, Miss Lian.

360
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,840
Nothing. We were just discussing the plumbing.

361
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,760
Miss Lian, you know him.

362
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:08,440
Uncle Zheng mentioned you've been a great help with the renovations lately. Thank you.

363
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,520
We're neighbors. No need for formalities.

364
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,820
By the way, Uncle Zheng,

365
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,440
my friend just got new wallpaper stock for the private rooms.

366
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,680
We can go check the samples tomorrow.

367
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,400
Good, good.

368
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,960
Miss Lian, could we speak privately?

369
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,280
Go ahead.

370
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,280
Ping Ting, don't stay here.

371
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,460
It's too messy.

372
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,960
Come over here.

373
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,220
Ping Ting, come here.

374
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:52,380
What now? Dragging me in here for secret talks.

375
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:55,280
Let me be blunt, Miss Lian.

376
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,700
What's your intention?

377
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,600
Intention?

378
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,080
I don't understand.

379
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,280
Taking care of Ping Ting, advising on renovations,

380
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,780
and even going to check out the samples.

381
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,820
What?

382
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,320
Don't you have your business to run?

383
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:12,060
Don't you think you're being overly enthusiastic?

384
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:18,620
I can't help it. I've been helpful all my life.

385
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,420
Well? Is it against the law?

386
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,780
Something wrong with that?

387
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:24,080
Do I deserve to be dragged in here for questioning like this?

388
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:28,200
- Uncle Zheng. 
 - Mu Dai.

389
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,440
Where's Luo Ren?

390
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,320
Inside.

391
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,520
I'll leave if there's nothing else.

392
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,040
I'm meeting Uncle Zheng tomorrow to check samples anyway.

393
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,920
Ping Ting.

394
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,600
Uncle Zheng said you were up to no good in here.

395
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,340
Me?

396
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:59,780
He said you dragged some pretty girl in and wouldn't let anyone else enter.

397
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,540
What were you trying to do?

398
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:04,600
Out with it. Where's that pretty girl?

399
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,280
Right here.

400
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,200
Uncle Zheng also said you got upset about Lian Shu

401
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,880
helping pick wallpapers.

402
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,360
How did she offend you?

403
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,100
Why the hostility?

404
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,360
I can't quite explain.

405
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:24,740
She gives me this uneasy feeling.

406
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:28,280
And the way she's always hovering around Ping Ting and Uncle Zheng.

407
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,720
I feel a bit unsettled about it.

408
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,720
Then, I'll handle the wallpaper samples tomorrow.

409
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,180
As one of the shareholders of Phoenix Pavilion,

410
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,600
I should do my part.

411
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,380
I'll ask her to hand over all the work to me later.

412
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,800
That way, we won't have to trouble her further.

413
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,340
What do you think?

414
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,640
Ping Ting.

415
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:05,680
♫  Give me wings to pierce the universe  ♫

416
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,140
Do you have anything to eat?

417
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,300
Uncle Zheng.

418
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,080
Mu Dai, you're here.

419
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,400
Sit here to eat. Sit here, Ping Ting.

420
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,340
♫  In these ordinary moments  ♫

421
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,140
Use the plate.

422
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:21,020
Thank you, Uncle Zheng.

423
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,220
In a minute.

424
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:28,280
♫  Fly over any plain I wish to go  ♫

425
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:31,960
Miss Lian, here. Please come in.

426
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,560
This is Miss Lian.

427
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,840
And this is Mu Dai.

428
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,080
Nice to meet you, Miss Lian.

429
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,640
Luo Ren told me how much you've helped recently.

430
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,660
Thank you.

431
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,780
You're welcome.

432
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:44,380
Mu Dai is one of the shareholders of Phoenix Pavilion.

433
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:47,585
She'll go with you today to get familiar with things.

434
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:50,900
From now on, she'll handle these matters.

435
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,560
We've troubled you long enough.

436
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,080
I'm really sorry about that.

437
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,240
Don't mention it, Uncle Zheng.

438
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,660
Let's go then, the car's outside.

439
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,320
All right. Uncle Zheng, I'll be leaving then.

440
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,120
- Go ahead. 
 - We're leaving, Uncle Zheng.

441
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,680
Miss.

442
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,560
Upstairs.

443
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,660
I'm not going upstairs.

444
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:13,180
I'm going out. Bye.

445
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,520
Come on, sit and eat.

446
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,145
Here you go.

447
00:30:24,145 --> 00:30:26,760
This piece is entirely handcrafted.

448
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:32,320
The carving details are exceptionally fine.

449
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,320
Over here we have marble designs.

450
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:39,120
Each stone has been processed by skilled artisans.

451
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,620
The durability and attention to detail in every small piece are remarkable.

452
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:47,980
Now, these six pieces use imported German materials.

453
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:51,120
The engraving work is impeccable.

454
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,320
And over here, we have ceramic colored stones.

455
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,940
The color procurement for these...

456
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,320
Ping Ting, what are you looking at?

457
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,880
Miss.

458
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,200
Upstairs.

459
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,600
That's downstairs, Ping Ting.

460
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,600
You can't tell up from down.

461
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,040
But since when am I a girl?

462
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,940
Well, just skip breakfast.

463
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,340
It's practically noon.

464
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:32,080
You might as well sleep straight through till evening.

465
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,820
   

466
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,800
Smells amazing.

467
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,860
I'm getting hungry.

468
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,100
I'm starving too.

469
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,740
Why don't you check out this shop?

470
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,200
And I'll order some takeout.

471
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,940
All right. But I can't handle spice.

472
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,620
Mild then. Thank you.

473
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,120
All right.

474
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:23,150
   

475
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,140
Hello, Sir,

476
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:35,900
I just placed that order.

477
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,520
Make it extra spicy, please.

478
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,340
Also, I ordered a soda.

479
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:41,760
Don't forget that.

480
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,500
Thank you.

481
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,824
Not a savage?

482
00:32:48,824 --> 00:32:50,952
 That expert mentioned that 

483
00:32:50,952 --> 00:32:55,120
it belongs to the order Primates, genus Simia.

484
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,480
Then, he rambled on about a bunch of other stuff.

485
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,100
I didn't understand any of it.

486
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,320
True.

487
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,940
The "savage" label is just folkloric.

488
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,140
The scientific community never endorsed it.

489
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,500
By the way, Luo, there's one more thing.

490
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:13,120
Do you remember that vanished village on Yueliang Mountain?

491
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,320
 Some elders recently brought up that old story. 

492
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,120
 They said that 20 years ago, 

493
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,960
 when that village wasn't abandoned yet, 

494
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,520
 a woman went into the mountains to gather herbs 

495
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,960
 and was assaulted by a savage. 

496
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,520
 Then her husband led village hunters from our village 

497
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:29,680
 into the mountains to corner it, and in the end, they killed it. 

498
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,000
But later, people noticed the woman kept returning to the mountains.

499
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,360
And she stayed with a little savage.

500
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,240
Gradually, rumors started spreading.

501
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:41,200
Many people claimed that the little savage was her child with that savage.

502
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,940
 Impossible. As Simians, savages can't have children with humans. 

503
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,820
 Yueliang Village was already slated for relocation then. 

504
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:51,360
Her husband told her to just leave and forget about that beast.

505
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,460
Yet she abandoned her husband and daughter, never to return.

506
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,760
The authenticity of this story needs verification.

507
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,720
Also, have you ever considered that the woman

508
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,420
might not have come back because something happened to her?

509
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,820
 I'll make more inquiries. 

510
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,520
Abandoned her husband and daughter.

511
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,700
She had a daughter?

512
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,080
We guessed wrong.

513
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,580
The other wasn't a savage.

514
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,880
It was her daughter.

515
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,485
The relic of ill omen is incomplete.

516
00:34:28,485 --> 00:34:32,170
She gave the amber to her daughter.

517
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,130
This world is vast.

518
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,120
Where could it be?

519
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:44,280
Miss, upstairs. Miss, upstairs.

520
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,000
Ping Ting, are you talking about Mu Dai?

521
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,660
She's not here. She can't go upstairs.

522
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:56,160
No idea why, but she's been saying that all day.

523
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,620
Not Mu Dai.

524
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:09,380
Ping Ting, are you saying a girl did go upstairs?

525
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,360
Which girl?

526
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,560
 Then where is this Sunny Doll from? 

527
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,180
 I don't remember exactly. 

528
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,400
 Some rainy place. 

529
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,540
Lian Shu?

530
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,740
 I'll leave if there's nothing else. 

531
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:00,560
 I'm meeting Uncle Zheng tomorrow to check samples anyway. 

532
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,240
 Then, I'll handle the wallpaper samples tomorrow. 

533
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,760
 As one of the shareholders of Phoenix Pavilion, 

534
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,020
 I should do my part. 

535
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,400
Wow, who are you?

536
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,000
You look familiar.

537
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I think you might be a former employee here. 
    

538
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,280
No, Uncle Zhang, please don't say that.

539
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,360
I swear I won't do it again.

540
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,840
Never again.

541
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:54,012
Uncle Zhang, I think his apology sounds sincere.

542
00:36:54,012 --> 00:36:55,300
Right.

543
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:59,240
Besides, the temps we've been interviewing lately are slow.

544
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,440
They're all clumsy.

545
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,700
He's worth three of them.

546
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,920
I'm sharp.

547
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,740
Listen, this better not happen again.

548
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,880
It won't happen again.

549
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,980
Come on in and get to work.

550
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,220
Thirteen-Thousand, Chubby, get in the car!

551
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,920
Sorry for the trouble.

552
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,460
Love you, Uncle Zhang.

553
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:23,400
You... What kind of nonsense is that?

554
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,480
So, you're saying Lian Shu is that woman's daughter,

555
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,520
and she's kidnapped Boss Lady Dai?

556
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:32,080
Wait, was the amber on that woman, the one my master pried off?

557
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,240
Lian Shu kidnapped her?

558
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,480
Is this revenge?

559
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,920
Any leads?

560
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,860
They said they drove off in a white car.

561
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,280
They left for an hour or two.

562
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,060
That's impossible to track.

563
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:48,240
- Should we call the police? 
 - The police?

564
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,800
The sales guy said they were laughing and chatting,

565
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,280
and got into the car with some barbecue.

566
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,980
What evidence do we have? How do we prove it was a kidnapping?

567
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,560
Then, we do it the hard way.

568
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,660
Check every security camera along the route.

569
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,200
Let's go.

570
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,020
Here.

571
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:13,000
Right here.

572
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,840
- Hurry. 
 - Thanks.

573
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,280
What do you want?

574
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,900
What are you doing?

575
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,140
I don't know what I'm doing.

576
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:58,020
I just thought you'd look good

577
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,720
hanging there.

578
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,040
How did I offend you?

579
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,080
You didn't offend me.

580
00:40:20,681 --> 00:40:22,480
You offended it.

581
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,560
 Thin. 

582
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,600
 Flaky. 

583
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,680
 With jagged fractures. 

584
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,080
 She might not even have understood what was happening. 

585
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,700
 To her, the amber was a life-saving treasure. 

586
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,940
 So, she shared it with her child. 

587
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:38,280
Is your hometown Yueliang Mountain?

588
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,800
You have a sister who's a savage, right?

589
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:46,080
That filthy little beast.

590
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,420
My sister?

591
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,740
She was never worthy.

592
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,420
But your mom cared for her.

593
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,880
My mom was insane.

594
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,280
She kept running into the mountains to raise a savage's child.

595
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,140
The whole village insulted her.

596
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,280
They said she'd bred with a savage.

597
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,860
But she didn't care.

598
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,640
But what about me?

599
00:41:09,587 --> 00:41:11,387
My dad?

600
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,920
Our dignity?

601
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,340
But your mom must have had her reasons for taking care of her.

602
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:19,440
Reasons?

603
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:27,540
She once went into the mountains to gather herbs and didn't return for days.

604
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,940
My dad grew worried and sent men to search for her.

605
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:33,660
They found her disheveled, with some savage.

606
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:36,980
Anyone could tell what happened.

607
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:39,660
My dad killed that beast.

608
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:45,580
To spare my mom's dignity, he begged the others to keep it quiet.

609
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,420
But what did she do?

610
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,100
She claimed that she'd been in danger in the mountains,

611
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,800
and the savage had saved her.

612
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,240
That my dad had killed her savior in a misunderstanding.

613
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,180
That she was guilty.

614
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,340
How ridiculous.

615
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:59,760
As if anyone would believe that.

616
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,960
Why wouldn't you believe your mom?

617
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,300
What if she was telling the truth?

618
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,660
Because she made it up!

619
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,200
She knew she'd been defiled and was too ashamed,

620
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,380
so she spun that ridiculous story about gratitude.

621
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:13,720
Would someone abandon her own child just to repay a debt of gratitude?

622
00:42:15,061 --> 00:42:17,961
I was her daughter.

623
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:26,660
 Mom, this amber is so pretty. 

624
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:31,000
 - Doesn't its color look like honey? 
 - Yes. 

625
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,620
 Sweet as honey, a charm for good fortune and health. 

626
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:36,540
 When you're older, I'll give it to you. 

627
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,700
 - Okay. 
 - Good girl. 

628
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:43,480
 She abandoned me for that monster. 

629
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,700
Have you considered that maybe your mother was killed

630
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:51,140
and can never come back?

631
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:55,320
Can never come back?

632
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,040
But she did come back.

633
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,740
 Mom! 

634
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,400
 She left the amber for that little beast 

635
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,200
but gave me this hideous thing instead.

636
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:36,192
Yet sometimes it feels sentient.

637
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:41,460
It understands me, comforts me.

638
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,620
But talking to you is a waste of time.

639
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:53,040
You might as well die now.

00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:39,020
♫  The sky splits the dawn's horizon  ♫

659
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:43,140
♫  It's telling me the end  ♫

660
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:47,510
♫  (The end) Is about to gently appear  ♫

661
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:54,380
♫  Like a whisper in my mind, a fleeting touch across my face  ♫

662
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:58,000
♫  Yet I find myself in the dark  ♫

663
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,210
♫  The sky splits the dawn's horizon  ♫

664
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:06,480
♫  It's telling me the end  ♫

665
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,920
♫  (The end) Is about to gently appear  ♫

666
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:17,860
♫  Like a whisper in my mind, a fleeting touch across my face  ♫

667
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:23,680
 ♫ And I remain in darkness ♫ 

668
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:37,220
♫  The sky splits the dawn's horizon  ♫

669
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:41,540
♫  It's telling me the end  ♫

670
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:46,010
♫  (The end) Is about to gently appear  ♫

671
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:52,980
♫  Like a whisper in my mind, a fleeting touch across my face  ♫

672
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:57,970
♫  Yet I find myself in the dark  ♫
