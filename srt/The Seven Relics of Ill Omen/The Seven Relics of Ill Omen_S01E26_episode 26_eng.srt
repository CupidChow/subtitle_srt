1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,940
 

2
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:50,040



3
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,020
 

4
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:09,020
 

5
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,840
Handsome.

6
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,780
You look handsome.

7
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,500
Yin, turn around.

8
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,500
Turn around. That's right.

9
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,420
This is the famous stargazer, Mr. Yin.

10
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:24,000
How about you give an introduction?

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,200
This is the Stargazing Platform.

12
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,560
It's a huge stone.

13
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,340
According to Kun, it's... Stone from the...

14
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,608
Stone from the sky.

15
00:01:34,608 --> 00:01:36,180
It's scarce.

16
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,240
Something like a meteorite.

17
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,360
And this is the Magic Hole.

18
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,400
Inside the hole, the stars are reflected.

19
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,780
Let's take a look.

20
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,900
Yin, smile.

21
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,440
Don't be so serious.

22
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,040
Six stars.

23
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,520
Ming Shan.

24
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,800
Hi, Ming Shan.

25
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,580
There you are, Dai.

26
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,100
How is Master?

27
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,640
She took her medicine and fell asleep.

28
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,760
Don't worry. She's all right.

29
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,040
I told her you would arrive.

30
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,880
She said she wouldn't wait.

31
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,420
She's the master, after all.

32
00:02:33,138 --> 00:02:35,720
Don't worry. Tomorrow morning,
you'll serve her tea.

33
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,320
Okay.

34
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,880
Ming Shan, you have a new look, huh?

35
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,280
I don't.

36
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,160
I haven't washed my hair.

37
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,000
So I used a hood. Or Master would keep nagging.

38
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,240
How have you been?

39
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,940
Who is this?

40
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,840
My... My disciple.

41
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,700
Actually, we met before.

42
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,120
You may not remember me.

43
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,440
I'm Cao, Cao Yan Hua.

44
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,520
You're my senior master.

45
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,200
I'll learn from you then.

46
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,380
You aren't experienced yet.

47
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,340
How could you have a disciple so early?

48
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,080
There's a procedure for disciples.

49
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,060
You get famous, set up a sect,
and then take disciples.

50
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,620
Why are you doing this backward?

51
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,800
You took a disciple quite early.

52
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,300
And who is this?

53
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,040
My...

54
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,080
My boyfriend.

55
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,140
Have martial arts, huh?

56
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,320
He's good.

57
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,420
Master, let's not stand here.

58
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,840
Shall we get in?

59
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,720
You can't get in just as you wish.

60
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,940
It depends on what you can do.

61
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,480
Come on.

62
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,960
Right here,

63
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,640
kick over the bowl

64
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,960
and you'll get in.

65
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,840
Well...

66
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,460
Is it appropriate?

67
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,180
You haven't eaten a lot.

68
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,220
The food will be wasted.

69
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,840
- Does it count?
- What do you think?

70
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,740
Sorry.

71
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,720
What else can you do?

72
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,780
Bring it on.

73
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,760
Do the best you can.

74
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,340
I will, then.

75
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,540
You're here, Grandmaster.

76
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,160
The bowl isn't flipped.

77
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,520
You lost.

78
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,380
What a waste of your muscle.

79
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,360
Next one.

80
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,320
Hey, it's my first time here.

81
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,640
How could I kick over your bowl?

82
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,560
Enjoy the food.

83
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,960
You're polite and you behave.

84
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,000
Come in with me.

85
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,920
What?

86
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,020
Are you kidding me?

87
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,320
It's not about martial arts but manners, huh?

88
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,320
This is unfair.

89
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,280
Tonight, you two will live here.

90
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,980
Get the quilts yourselves.

91
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,520
In the wardrobe, I think.

92
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,200
If you can't find any, just make do with it.

93
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,880
Dai will live in the backyard just like before.

94
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,140
Ming Shan, only one bed?

95
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,360
Another one is in the inner room.

96
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,480
Let's go.

97
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,020
Quilt delivery?

98
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,740
A girl really cares for her boyfriend.

99
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,240
Glad I have some wine.

100
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,305
Yuris!

101
00:07:35,305 --> 00:07:36,546
What's wrong?

102
00:07:36,546 --> 00:07:38,586
What happened, Ren?

103
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,400
I dreamed of Yuris.

104
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,720
Leopard is here.

105
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,340
She'll take revenge.

106
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,240
Are you scared?

107
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,960
Leopard.

108
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,100
I lost to her twice.

109
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,500
She took away those I cared most for.

110
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,720
I watched her kill them and couldn't do anything.

111
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,880
Back then, I was so powerless.

112
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,900
I'm getting scared even before I see her.

113
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,580
She's the demon in my mind.

114
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,440
There was a demon in my mind too.

115
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,080
That's a mental barrier.

116
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,060
Just break it down.

117
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,100
Master once said something.

118
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,620
I'm saying it now.

119
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,060
We can break down anything.

120
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,020
Let's just do it.

121
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,800
I'll do it with you.

122
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,740
 

123
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:32,920
 

124
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:26,240
Master, here's your tea.

125
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,360
Master, have some tea.

126
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,560
Get up.

127
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,920
Kneeling will tire you out.

128
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,180
I'm nervous.

129
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,460
So am I.

130
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:01,220
Master, did you miss me?

131
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,460
If you missed me, so would I.

132
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:07,620
If you didn't,
I had no time to think of you either.

133
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:16,400
I heard you came back with your disciple.

134
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,500
Which one?

135
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,120
Greetings, Grandmaster.

136
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,480
Don't do this.

137
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,000
This isn't my rule.

138
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,960
He is Cao Yan Hua.

139
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,760
He's my disciple now.

140
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,860
But if you don't like him, Master, forget it.

141
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,020
Hey, don't.

142
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,460
What's good about him?

143
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,800
Oh, him.

144
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,460
He's honest and cute.

145
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,760
He learns from his mistakes.

146
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:55,240
He's sympathetic and quite proactive.

147
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:05,040
In your life, have you ever hurt people?

148
00:12:09,973 --> 00:12:12,333
Be honest.

149
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,760
In Wujiang,

150
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,125
I stole things.

151
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,892
I can't lie about this.

152
00:12:21,892 --> 00:12:24,520
I know you hate that most.

153
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,900
Senior Master stole things,
and you broke his legs.

154
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,620
Right? Don't be embarrassed.

155
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,960
We deserve this.

156
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,600
It's for our own good.

157
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,600
Only in this way can we stop.

158
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,080
I stopped.

159
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:40,520
I believe one day, I can rise again just like him.

160
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,320
You know that, huh?

161
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,900
How about you call the Railway Ministry?

162
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,800
I caught two thieves on the train here

163
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,140
and saved people from losing things.

164
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,340
Times have changed.

165
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,740
Martial arts are fading.

166
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,500
Why do you want to learn?

167
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,680
To be a star.

168
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,420
To earn...

169
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,100
Earn...

170
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:13,520
When I get famous,
I can better promote martial arts.

171
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,880
When I have money,
I'll share it with people in need.

172
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,560
I've had this dream since childhood.

173
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,960
But later, I went the wrong way.

174
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,920
Luckily, I met my master.

175
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,100
I guess this is what people call "fate".

176
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,460
Something like that.

177
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:33,540
It's like she's my heaven-sent savior.

178
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,080
Come over.

179
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,320
Mu Dai, it's your fault.

180
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,400
You didn't teach him a lot.

181
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,760
He can't even do basic moves.

182
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,600
Master, I've been too busy to teach him.

183
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,120
That's not an excuse.

184
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,120
Why aren't you too busy to eat or sleep?

185
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,040
A master must be responsible.

186
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,920
Among all relationships, mentorship ranks fifth.

187
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,180
He calls you Master, and that's not for fun.

188
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:27,660
Grandmaster, Master taught me something.

189
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,960
I was just too lazy to practice.

190
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,220
I've been busy too.

191
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,600
I run a restaurant.

192
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,340
I'm also busy.

193
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,180
He's a good disciple.

194
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,680
He defends you.

195
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,460
Get up.

196
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,860
And who is this?

197
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,134
Hi. I'm Luo Ren.

198
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:04,794
He's my... boyfriend.

199
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,080
What's good about him?

200
00:15:09,013 --> 00:15:11,046
He...

201
00:15:11,046 --> 00:15:13,692
Nothing special.

202
00:15:13,692 --> 00:15:16,320
I just... I just like him.

203
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,180
In this case, I won't bother.

204
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,860
Master, don't embarrass him.

205
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,800
Tell me.

206
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,500
What's good about Mu Dai?

207
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:51,620
I think everything is good about her.

208
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,240
Go over there.

209
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,800
Stand beside him and I'll see.

210
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,220
You look perfect together.

211
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,640
That wasn't easy, huh?

212
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,720
You're a lucky dog.

213
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,180
She asked me so much but approved of you quickly.

214
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,220
Do you really think she approved of me?

215
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,900
She didn't?

216
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:13,360
Ming Shan told me you'd bring back a boyfriend.

217
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,160
I didn't believe it at first.

218
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,500
It's been eight years.

219
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,120
You've grown up.

220
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:35,320
Master, stay alive and well.

221
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,860
I'll take care of you for many years.

222
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,360
People get sick and die.

223
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,120
That's unavoidable.

224
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,480
Don't be sad.

225
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,360
Everyone is an island on the sea.

226
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,920
Islands appear and sink.

227
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,720
You just appeared later than me,

228
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,800
and I will sink before you.

229
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,840
Master,

230
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,480
do you not like Luo Ren?

231
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:17,860
If I don't, will you break up?

232
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,840
He may be a good guy.

233
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:27,200
I know you brought him here for my approval.

234
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:32,620
But sadly, I have no time to know him or like him.

235
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,100
Instead of Luo Ren, I would rather rely on you.

236
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,420
Rely on me?

237
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,780
About what?

238
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,920
In the past, when a girl got married,

239
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,660
her mother gave her a lot of advice.

240
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,720
But I'm too old.

241
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,600
I won't make it to your wedding.

242
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,080
You've brought him here.

243
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,360
That's good.

244
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,520
There's something I can tell you now.

245
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,460
I don't know about Luo Ren.

246
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,860
I don't really like him either.

247
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:14,880
Ming Shan and I think his background

248
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,800
may be much more complicated.

249
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:29,840
In the future, you may marry
Luo Ren or someone else.

250
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,580
But however good that guy is, do not rely on him.

251
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:36,680
Whatever the circumstances, be yourself.

252
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:41,840
You're Mu Dai before you're my disciple or some guy's wife.

253
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,720
Only when you're confident enough will you attract others.

254
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,040
If you like him, stay with him.

255
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,398
If one day, you think you have the wrong husband,

256
00:19:55,398 --> 00:19:58,798
then leave him and get a better one.

257
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,021
An old saying goes,
"A bad marriage ruins any life."

258
00:20:02,021 --> 00:20:04,102
That's nonsense.

259
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:06,503
In this case, you can just break up.

260
00:20:06,503 --> 00:20:10,503
Follow your heart
and you won't be scared of anything.

261
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,680
If he bullies you, give him a good lesson.

262
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,920
If you can't beat him, ask Ming Shan and your disciple for help.

263
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:18,520
If you can't beat him, ask Ming Shan and your disciple for help.

264
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,380
I'm tired

265
00:20:29,967 --> 00:20:32,327
after this long speech.

266
00:20:32,926 --> 00:20:37,000
After dinner, come to my room.

267
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,740
I'll talk to you about the inheritance.

268
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,960
Hey, Aoki.

269
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,100
Everything's ready.

270
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,481
As you requested,
I settled Mr. Zheng and Ping Ting

271
00:20:58,481 --> 00:21:01,089
in a secret place nearby.

272
00:21:01,089 --> 00:21:04,098
I'm guarding the bar and protecting your friends.

273
00:21:04,098 --> 00:21:05,758
Thanks.

274
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,960
Any news on Leopard?

275
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,120
 No. 

276
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,200
 But an informer told me Leopard's minions 

277
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,740
 came to our country over a year ago. 

278
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,560
Over a year ago?

279
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,620
Weird, isn't it?

280
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,040
They didn't give you trouble.

281
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,640
They went to a place

282
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,740
named Xiacheng Town and stayed for months.

283
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,614
Xiacheng Town?

284
00:21:28,614 --> 00:21:30,135
Why did they go there?

285
00:21:30,135 --> 00:21:31,916
 I'm not sure. 

286
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,865
 That's a small town. 

287
00:21:33,865 --> 00:21:37,280
 The biggest news was a murder. 

288
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,760
 But they didn't do that. 

289
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,480
 The murderer ran away. 

290
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,240
What else do you know?

291
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,860
And...

292
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,120
- Mr. Zhang.
- How dare you?

293
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,300
You got into the room!

294
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:50,040
Very well. I'll show you who's in charge.

295
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,480
And what kind of friends do you have?

296
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,864
Friends?

297
00:21:53,864 --> 00:21:55,865
They stay around a pheasant.

298
00:21:55,865 --> 00:21:57,846
I'll stew it sooner or later.

299
00:21:57,846 --> 00:21:59,625
Mr. Zhang, it's just a pheasant.

300
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,380
Don't be angry with its noises.

301
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,760
It was crowing all night.

302
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,729
Without a punishment, it won't stop.

303
00:22:04,729 --> 00:22:06,349
Stop right there!

304
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,512
- You know what this is?
- Yes.

305
00:22:08,512 --> 00:22:09,720
This is a knife.

306
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,120
The pheasant has a thin neck.

307
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,860
When I cut it, it will die immediately.

308
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,440
- Yes, yes.
- Understand?

309
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,063
- Yes, yes.
- Then make it nod.

310
00:22:17,063 --> 00:22:18,880
Make it nod.

311
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,720
- It understands now.
- It really does.

312
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,300
No more crowing tonight.

313
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,500
Or I'll just kill it.

314
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,680
I mean what I say.

315
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,240
Don't worry. It won't crow anymore.

316
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,640
If it crows again, you can just kill me.

317
00:22:32,689 --> 00:22:34,449
I crowed.

318
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,080
Bad pheasant.

319
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:46,300
It was almost killed.

320
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,960
Yin.

321
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:08,640
Does this look like Tiankui Seven-Star?

322
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,512
When it grows, it'll be like...

323
00:23:10,512 --> 00:23:11,760
Will it grow like this?

324
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,000
Or like this?

325
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,800
No idea.

326
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,760
I see that now.

327
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,840
You're not good at lying.

328
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:29,300
Your ancestors didn't only treat the Great Virtuous One for dinner.

329
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:33,000
And you don't watch the stars
just for a hobby thing.

330
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,900
Who told you?

331
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,760
What I've told you is true.

332
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:44,760
From a scientific perspective, when you were talking, you avoided eye contact.

333
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,920
Your voice trailed off and sounded uncertain.

334
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,360
And your head tossed all the time.

335
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,200
So, you must have lied!

336
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,480
Fine.

337
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,600
You're smart.

338
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,920
You know everything, okay?

339
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,440
Come on, Yin.

340
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,120
Hey, brother. We're good buddies.

341
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,540
Now, you and I even share a bed.

342
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:08,680
Tell me about it. Where are the relics of ill omen from?

343
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,040
The imperishable wood and Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle. Where on earth are they?

344
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,740
I don't know.

345
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,680
Six stars are lit now!

346
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,860
What about the seventh?

347
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,200
What will happen?

348
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,880
What can we do?

349
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,300
You...

350
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,520
Kun.

351
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,240
I can't tell you.

352
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,440
Don't push me.

353
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:47,640
You know everything but you don't tell me.

354
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:53,360
Yin, you broke my heart!

355
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,628
That is to say, he does know a lot.

356
00:25:07,628 --> 00:25:09,800
 Yin Er Ma is an honest guy. 

357
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,530
 He... He won't confess, anyway. 

358
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:15,995
I believe he has a reason.

359
00:25:15,995 --> 00:25:17,733
What do we do then?

360
00:25:17,733 --> 00:25:19,120
I'll just keep asking him.

361
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,420
As the old saying goes, perseverance will prevail.

362
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,981
I'll keep asking him.

363
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:27,756
Eventually, I'll get some information.

364
00:25:27,756 --> 00:25:29,469
 Is the map ready? 

365
00:25:29,469 --> 00:25:31,189
Wait a minute.

366
00:25:33,181 --> 00:25:35,841
Okay. Go ahead.

367
00:25:35,841 --> 00:25:41,381
These days, when I was studying the map, something occurred to me.

368
00:25:41,381 --> 00:25:43,581
You map out

369
00:25:43,581 --> 00:25:46,901
 the location of Xiaoshang River, 

370
00:25:47,741 --> 00:25:51,501
 Wuzhu Village, Yueliang Mountain, Nantian, 

371
00:25:51,501 --> 00:25:53,721
 and Cao Village. 

372
00:25:53,721 --> 00:25:54,981
Done.

373
00:25:54,981 --> 00:25:56,921
 What can you see? 

374
00:25:58,334 --> 00:25:59,441
Five dots.

375
00:25:59,441 --> 00:26:02,681
 Get a picture of Tiankui Seven-Star
and compare them. 

376
00:26:02,681 --> 00:26:05,401
What is it with Tiankui Seven-Star?

377
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,880
Tiankui...

378
00:26:10,891 --> 00:26:12,671
Wait a minute.

379
00:26:22,101 --> 00:26:23,772
 
The shape...

380
00:26:23,772 --> 00:26:25,041
 Indeed. 

381
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:29,441
 The positions of the stars look like the locations 

382
00:26:29,441 --> 00:26:33,901
where we found
the relics of ill omen in real life.

383
00:26:33,901 --> 00:26:36,601
The same, actually.

384
00:26:36,601 --> 00:26:41,721
So, based on Tiankui Seven-Star, we may figure out

385
00:26:41,721 --> 00:26:43,761
the location of the last two relics of ill omen.

386
00:26:43,761 --> 00:26:45,701
 Check the map again. 

387
00:26:45,701 --> 00:26:47,301
 Find Jiang Province. 

388
00:26:47,301 --> 00:26:48,541
 Southeast. 

389
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:50,541
 Highlight it. 

390
00:26:51,661 --> 00:26:53,781
On this scale,

391
00:26:53,781 --> 00:26:57,641
the sixth star is there.

392
00:26:57,641 --> 00:27:00,581
 Over a year ago, it was lit. 

393
00:27:00,581 --> 00:27:02,781
 Suddenly, it went dark. 

394
00:27:02,781 --> 00:27:04,421
 The other day, it was lit again. 

395
00:27:04,421 --> 00:27:06,321
 Really weird. 

396
00:27:06,321 --> 00:27:10,441
The seventh star... Figure it out the same way.

397
00:27:10,441 --> 00:27:13,001
You need no more instruction, huh?

398
00:27:17,701 --> 00:27:20,501
 Leopard's minions came to our country
over a year ago. 

399
00:27:20,501 --> 00:27:22,341
They went to a place

400
00:27:22,341 --> 00:27:24,701
 
named Xiacheng Town.

401
00:27:24,701 --> 00:27:26,581
Xiacheng Town?

402
00:27:26,581 --> 00:27:29,381
What's special about it?

403
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:31,301
Aoki just called me.

404
00:27:31,301 --> 00:27:34,261
He said one of Leopard's minions went there a year and a half ago

405
00:27:34,261 --> 00:27:35,881
and stayed for a long time.

406
00:27:35,881 --> 00:27:38,701
A year and a half ago, six stars were lit.

407
00:27:38,701 --> 00:27:40,061
Suddenly, one went dark.

408
00:27:40,061 --> 00:27:43,941
When I took revenge on Leopard,
she was badly shot.

409
00:27:43,941 --> 00:27:45,761
And she lost one of her eyes.

410
00:27:45,761 --> 00:27:48,121
We believed she was dead.

411
00:27:48,684 --> 00:27:50,141
But now, she's in our country.

412
00:27:50,141 --> 00:27:55,201
And as soon as she arrived,
the sixth star appeared.

413
00:27:55,901 --> 00:28:00,721
That is to say, the sixth relic of ill omen was taken to Heisha over a year ago.

414
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:03,201
Now, Leopard has brought it back.

415
00:28:10,741 --> 00:28:13,181
Beautiful fog, indeed.

416
00:28:13,181 --> 00:28:17,181
My sect is in such a wonderful place.

417
00:28:17,181 --> 00:28:18,961
The fog...

418
00:28:19,621 --> 00:28:22,501
It feels like it's hiding something.

419
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:27,800
Luo, sometimes, you're just too pessimistic.

420
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,361
Look at me. I used to be nothing.

421
00:28:30,361 --> 00:28:32,021
But things would work out.

422
00:28:32,021 --> 00:28:34,621
My master took me in.

423
00:28:34,621 --> 00:28:38,541
Then I worried if I would be accepted in my sect.

424
00:28:38,541 --> 00:28:44,021
Then smoothly, I passed all the tests.

425
00:28:44,021 --> 00:28:48,501
Oh, I'll make the bed for my master.

426
00:28:48,501 --> 00:28:49,701
Make the bed?

427
00:28:49,701 --> 00:28:51,621
Senior Master asked me to.

428
00:28:51,621 --> 00:28:53,541
Disciples used to make the bed.

429
00:28:53,541 --> 00:28:56,721
Well, we don't need to care for such unnecessary formalities.

430
00:28:56,721 --> 00:28:58,632
But I still think...

431
00:28:58,632 --> 00:29:02,941
Um... I should make the bed all night.

432
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:04,501
Think about it.

433
00:29:04,501 --> 00:29:05,961
I'm quite shy.

434
00:29:05,961 --> 00:29:10,400
When I get into my master's bedroom, I'll be quite nervous.

435
00:29:11,721 --> 00:29:15,521
Can it be another test?

436
00:29:21,201 --> 00:29:23,081
Make the bed?

437
00:29:25,761 --> 00:29:27,821
All night?

438
00:29:31,821 --> 00:29:34,601
Come, Mu Dai, my disciple.

439
00:29:39,821 --> 00:29:43,181
Actually, I've been wondering

440
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,381
if I should leave this duty to you.

441
00:29:45,381 --> 00:29:50,461
After all, it's selfish of me to make you keep an unrelated secret.

442
00:29:50,461 --> 00:29:55,661
But I promised my master
that I would pass it down.

443
00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:58,981
Now, I'm dying.

444
00:29:58,981 --> 00:30:00,258
So, I have to count on you.

445
00:30:00,258 --> 00:30:01,559
Master.

446
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:03,041
Master, don't say that.

447
00:30:03,041 --> 00:30:04,941
You taught me how to fight and live.

448
00:30:04,941 --> 00:30:07,261
I'll do anything for you.

449
00:30:07,261 --> 00:30:11,661
Please don't say you're selfish or you have to count on me.

450
00:30:11,661 --> 00:30:14,521
I don't deserve that.

451
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:17,841
Actually, a small sect
doesn't have too much heritage.

452
00:30:17,841 --> 00:30:20,581
But anyway, even if there's only one member,

453
00:30:20,581 --> 00:30:25,241
we should follow our rules
and take responsibility.

454
00:30:25,241 --> 00:30:28,701
From now on, you have to be cautious.

455
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:33,521
You must keep this secret
even from the closest people.

456
00:30:33,521 --> 00:30:39,061
Even if life is hopeless, you'll have to live on for this duty.

457
00:30:39,061 --> 00:30:40,365
Can you do this?

458
00:30:40,365 --> 00:30:41,905
Yes.

459
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:48,141
We're the Plum Blossom Sect.

460
00:30:48,141 --> 00:30:51,741
The founder was Meihua Yi Zhao.

461
00:30:51,741 --> 00:30:53,921
Meihua Yi Zhao?

462
00:30:56,501 --> 00:30:59,001
You're Meihua Jiu Niang.

463
00:30:59,821 --> 00:31:04,461
Master, are we supposed
to be named after our sect?

464
00:31:04,461 --> 00:31:07,841
Should I be Meihua Shi Mu?

465
00:31:08,621 --> 00:31:12,254
If you want that, I won't interfere.

466
00:31:12,254 --> 00:31:13,935
Back to business.

467
00:31:13,935 --> 00:31:17,456
Later, our founder abandoned this name

468
00:31:17,456 --> 00:31:21,217
and renamed our sect Guansi Memorial Archway.

469
00:31:21,217 --> 00:31:23,178
Guansi Memorial Archway?

470
00:31:23,178 --> 00:31:24,939
What a weird name.

471
00:31:24,939 --> 00:31:27,799
Open the secret compartment in my bed.

472
00:31:37,461 --> 00:31:39,441
Open it and see.

473
00:31:52,861 --> 00:31:54,521
Bat?

474
00:31:55,361 --> 00:31:56,861
Look carefully.

475
00:31:56,861 --> 00:32:00,021
What is on this bat?

476
00:32:03,261 --> 00:32:04,621
A wooden kite.

477
00:32:04,621 --> 00:32:05,667
Yes.

478
00:32:05,667 --> 00:32:09,308
Have you heard of the grandmaster of carpenters?

479
00:32:09,308 --> 00:32:12,301
There are many legends about him.

480
00:32:12,301 --> 00:32:16,161
Even Bo Yang Zi, the Great Virtuous One, was his good friend.

481
00:32:16,161 --> 00:32:20,301
He was really ingenious,
and once made a wooden kite

482
00:32:20,301 --> 00:32:24,461
that flew three days and nights without landing.

483
00:32:24,461 --> 00:32:26,741
There's a wooden kite on this bat.

484
00:32:26,741 --> 00:32:27,923
Is it...?

485
00:32:27,923 --> 00:32:29,064
Yes.

486
00:32:29,064 --> 00:32:31,781
It's the logo of him.

487
00:32:31,781 --> 00:32:35,901
In today's words, it's his signature.

488
00:32:35,901 --> 00:32:38,127
So, it's an antique.

489
00:32:38,127 --> 00:32:39,888
Can it really...?

490
00:32:39,888 --> 00:32:41,129
Fly up to the sky?

491
00:32:41,129 --> 00:32:42,501
Yes.

492
00:32:42,501 --> 00:32:46,201
Don't underestimate the wisdom of the ancients.

493
00:32:47,221 --> 00:32:51,201
This is the Silver-Eyed Bat.

494
00:32:51,201 --> 00:32:54,621
It's also half a map and half a key.

495
00:32:54,621 --> 00:32:57,701
Someone else keeps the other halves.

496
00:32:57,701 --> 00:32:59,121
Only when they become one can we open the gate of Guansi Memorial Archway.

497
00:32:59,121 --> 00:33:02,461
can we open the gate
of Guansi Memorial Archway.

498
00:33:02,461 --> 00:33:05,658
According to my master,
a wild goose will fly south.

499
00:33:05,658 --> 00:33:07,858
One day, a message will come

500
00:33:07,858 --> 00:33:11,419
with the other half of the map
and key from the north.

501
00:33:11,419 --> 00:33:15,461
By then, the Silver-Eyed Bat will take me

502
00:33:15,461 --> 00:33:18,621
to see the real Guansi Memorial Archway.

503
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:22,915
Mu Dai, the messenger hasn't come in my lifetime.

504
00:33:22,915 --> 00:33:26,576
In your lifetime, you may not see him either.

505
00:33:26,576 --> 00:33:28,477
But I beg you.

506
00:33:28,477 --> 00:33:33,158
Guard this house and wait for the message from the north.

507
00:33:35,541 --> 00:33:37,621
Mu Dai.

508
00:33:41,941 --> 00:33:45,461
Take the food on the table and go with me.

509
00:33:45,461 --> 00:33:47,721
Are we going far?

510
00:34:09,461 --> 00:34:11,301
Mu Dai.

511
00:34:12,058 --> 00:34:14,858
Lift the left wing three times

512
00:34:15,981 --> 00:34:18,981
and press the right one four times.

513
00:34:45,781 --> 00:34:50,203
Master, now I understand
why you call it a living map.

514
00:34:50,203 --> 00:34:52,661
This is unbelievable.

515
00:34:52,661 --> 00:34:58,746
When I walked along this way with my master, I said the same thing.

516
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:04,101
This mountain behind Youwu Town is foggy all year round.

517
00:35:04,101 --> 00:35:05,863
The magnetic field is weird.

518
00:35:05,863 --> 00:35:10,121
Phones and drones won't work in here at night.

519
00:35:10,121 --> 00:35:13,821
Even in daylight, they can't work very well.

520
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:20,561
Maybe this is why the Silver-Eyed Bat was made.

521
00:35:21,309 --> 00:35:23,661
It won't fail.

522
00:35:23,661 --> 00:35:26,681
It only follows the fixed path.

523
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,880
Master,

524
00:35:33,541 --> 00:35:35,281
are you tired?

525
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:37,799
The distance is nothing.

526
00:35:37,799 --> 00:35:39,945
I'm full of energy.

527
00:35:39,945 --> 00:35:42,405
I can even fight now.

528
00:35:44,781 --> 00:35:47,541
No one has challenged me in 30 years.

529
00:35:47,541 --> 00:35:49,546
Boring, indeed.

530
00:35:49,546 --> 00:35:55,691
A martial artist can't have a cool fight
before dying.

531
00:35:55,691 --> 00:35:58,261
What a shame!

532
00:35:58,261 --> 00:36:00,461
How about I tell Ming Shan and Luo Ren to come?

533
00:36:00,461 --> 00:36:02,601
We can fight you.

534
00:36:04,775 --> 00:36:06,216
Not interested.

535
00:36:06,216 --> 00:36:08,636
You guys are no match for me.

536
00:36:10,415 --> 00:36:12,301
Master.

537
00:36:12,301 --> 00:36:14,461
Ssomeone's here.

538
00:36:15,454 --> 00:36:17,021
I know.

539
00:36:17,021 --> 00:36:18,541
You go alone now.

540
00:36:18,541 --> 00:36:20,261
The Silver-Eyed Bat never waits.

541
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,712
But Master...

542
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:23,241
Go.

543
00:36:39,341 --> 00:36:41,021
Did you make the bed?

544
00:36:41,021 --> 00:36:42,357
Yes.

545
00:36:42,357 --> 00:36:45,238
It looks perfect without even a ruffle.

546
00:36:45,238 --> 00:36:47,178
You're hardworking, Chubby.

547
00:36:51,461 --> 00:36:54,230
I'm hardworking?

548
00:36:54,734 --> 00:36:56,954
Then you're romantic, Luo Ren.

549
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,721
What?

550
00:37:00,721 --> 00:37:04,461
If my master ends up with you,
she'll be really happy.

551
00:37:04,461 --> 00:37:07,286
What were you thinking?
Why did you put it on her pillow?

552
00:37:07,286 --> 00:37:09,051
Pillow?

553
00:37:09,051 --> 00:37:11,966
- What's on it?
- Come on.

554
00:37:11,966 --> 00:37:13,476
Nothing.

555
00:37:13,476 --> 00:37:15,021
You didn't put it. I did, okay?

556
00:37:15,021 --> 00:37:16,621
I put it there.

557
00:37:34,301 --> 00:37:36,301
What is on Mu Dai's pillow?

558
00:37:36,301 --> 00:37:38,253
Didn't you put a flower there?

559
00:37:38,253 --> 00:37:39,855
What flower?

560
00:37:39,855 --> 00:37:41,555
A rose.

561
00:37:45,314 --> 00:37:47,034
You didn't put that?

562
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,470
Senior Master?

563
00:37:57,501 --> 00:37:59,281
What's going on here?

564
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,520
Didn't you put it here?

565
00:38:08,834 --> 00:38:10,580
Why are you going in there?

566
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,661
You should have knocked.

567
00:38:21,941 --> 00:38:23,861
I think it's all right.

568
00:38:23,861 --> 00:38:25,541
They haven't seen each other for a long time.

569
00:38:25,541 --> 00:38:27,561
So, he gave her a rose.

570
00:38:33,721 --> 00:38:36,641
What are you doing in my master's room?

571
00:38:36,641 --> 00:38:38,761
Do you know where Mu Dai has gone?

572
00:38:39,641 --> 00:38:42,021
Do I have to tell you?

573
00:38:42,021 --> 00:38:44,666
She's safe with Master.

574
00:38:44,666 --> 00:38:48,733
And my master doesn't want strangers
to break into her room.

575
00:38:48,733 --> 00:38:50,313
Go out!

576
00:38:51,351 --> 00:38:54,012
Ming Shan, I have an enemy.

577
00:38:54,012 --> 00:38:55,313
She's trying to take revenge.

578
00:38:55,313 --> 00:38:57,274
This rose is her mark.

579
00:38:57,274 --> 00:39:00,394
It was found on Mu Dai's pillow.

580
00:39:01,621 --> 00:39:04,461
Luo Ren, who do you think you are?

581
00:39:05,181 --> 00:39:08,222
What makes you think you can break in here?

582
00:39:08,222 --> 00:39:09,802
Out!

583
00:39:10,901 --> 00:39:14,220
Ming Shan, Mu Dai and her master aren't here.

584
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,602
Something must be wrong.

585
00:39:15,602 --> 00:39:16,978
What could be wrong?

586
00:39:16,978 --> 00:39:18,940
Nothing would be wrong. Master is there.

587
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:22,181
You have no idea. My enemy is fierce.

588
00:39:22,181 --> 00:39:23,501
Where's the back of the mountain?

589
00:39:23,501 --> 00:39:25,321
Tell me.

590
00:39:26,661 --> 00:39:30,741
Tonight, Master will give authority to Dai.

591
00:39:30,741 --> 00:39:33,721
It can't be done in front of strangers.

592
00:39:33,721 --> 00:39:36,621
So, you just wait here.

593
00:39:36,621 --> 00:39:38,461
And look. It's dark out there.

594
00:39:38,461 --> 00:39:39,781
It's foggy too.

595
00:39:39,781 --> 00:39:41,061
The mountain roads are tough.

596
00:39:41,061 --> 00:39:43,981
With this little equipment, you can't go too far.

597
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:45,981
Just stay here.

598
00:39:45,981 --> 00:39:47,341
Fine.

599
00:39:47,341 --> 00:39:48,821
I'll go myself.

600
00:39:48,821 --> 00:39:50,321
You...

601
00:39:53,061 --> 00:39:54,401
Let him go.

602
00:39:54,401 --> 00:39:56,361
I'll try to persuade him.

603
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,460
How conceited.

604
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,800
You'll return within half an hour.

605
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,616
Luo.

606
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:17,661
Hey, Luo. Listen to me.

607
00:40:17,661 --> 00:40:19,661
You have to trust Senior Master.

608
00:40:19,661 --> 00:40:21,694
It's late and foggy out there.

609
00:40:21,694 --> 00:40:23,856
A stranger like you will get lost.

610
00:40:23,856 --> 00:40:26,161
And you can see
my grandmaster isn't an ordinary lady.

611
00:40:26,161 --> 00:40:27,426
Have confidence in her.

612
00:40:27,426 --> 00:40:28,767
Leopard isn't ordinary either.

613
00:40:28,767 --> 00:40:31,227
She may have a relic of ill omen.

614
00:40:34,415 --> 00:40:36,315
The relic of ill omen?

615
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:12,730



616
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:17,780
