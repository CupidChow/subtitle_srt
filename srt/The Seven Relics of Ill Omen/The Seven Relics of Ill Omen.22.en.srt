5
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,940
Chubby.

6
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,060
Chubby?

7
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,100
Chubby!

8
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,850
Help! Someone help me!

9
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,130
No, Qingshan, put the knife down.

10
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,170
- Stay back.
- Drop the knife!

11
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,290
Just leave
if you can't find your friends.

12
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,940
Why insist on throwing your life away?

13
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,780
But

14
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,850
my friends are here.

15
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:17,930
How can I just leave?

16
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,340
It wouldn't be right

17
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,460
if I left, right?

18
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,930
Alright then.

19
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,170
Is it too late

20
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,170
for me to leave now?

21
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,460
Where is he?

22
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,020
Over there.

23
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,050
Where's Mu Dai?

24
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,730
They're all dead.

25
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,340
What?

26
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:04,700
Say that again.

27
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,050
Where's Mu Dai?

28
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,580
I'll say it again.

29
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,290
They're all dead.

30
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,660
One was crushed into a pulp with rocks,

31
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,100
and the other was buried alive.

32
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,460
Yafeng.

33
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,220
Luo Ren.

34
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,780
Relax your body and don't move.

35
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,300
Or the dagger won't hold much longer.

36
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,620
Mu Dai, climb up.

37
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,300
Mu Dai, there's rope in my bag.

38
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,380
Take it out and tie it around my waist.

39
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,580
You go down first.

40
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,460
Why do you think

41
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,460
Yafeng took a liking to Qingshan?

42
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,060
She always said
she wanted to marry someone rich.

43
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,900
Who knows?

44
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,020
Maybe she got tired of playing around

45
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,540
and wanted to settle down
with a decent man.

46
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,140
You know what? I heard

47
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,500
Yafeng came on to Qingshan.

48
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,860
Really?

49
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,260
What does she see in him?

50
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,500
Did Qingshan
cast some kind of spell on her?

51
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,060
Does it hurt?

52
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,900
If it does, look away.

53
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,220
What's wrong?

54
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,020
Will my fingers break?

55
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,340
No.

56
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,460
There.

57
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,900
You always come prepared
with all the right gear.

58
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,060
Old habit.

59
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,460
Better safe than sorry.

60
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,340
This new bandaging feels much better.

61
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,740
Looks like they're
wearing little hats now.

62
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,460
Ouch.

63
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,020
They really saved us this time.

64
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,380
When we get back,

65
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,140
I'm going to pamper them
with hand cream every day.

66
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,700
And maybe even get a nice manicure.

67
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:34,940
Mu Dai,

68
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,100
thank you for saving me earlier.

69
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,500
If it weren't for you,

70
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,220
I might have fallen to my death.

71
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,580
See?

72
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,500
I can save you too, right?

73
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,260
I can protect you as well, can't I?

74
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,900
Don't mention it.

75
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:56,780
Ren,

76
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,700
I just hope nothing ever happens to you.

77
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,580
How did you fall down here?

78
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:10,700
Me?

79
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,300
I heard someone screaming for help.

80
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,740
Then I was lured here.

81
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,060
I saw Chubby tied up,

82
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,420
with something in his mouth.

83
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,620
That's when I knew someone
was in the cave.

84
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,540
I tried to hit him with a rock.

85
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,260
He was hiding behind that rock.

86
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,220
The moment I took aim,

87
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,820
the ground gave way beneath me.

88
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,980
Same old trick.

89
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:32,540
So this whole thing
was staged by Qingshan.

90
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,060
Yafeng is his accomplice.

91
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,220
Yafeng?

92
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,220
Earlier, Qingshan dragged Yafeng
in at knifepoint.

93
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,740
I saved Yafeng.

94
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,300
And guess what?

95
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,980
She's the one who pushed me down.

96
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,060
Then

97
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,580
could they...?

98
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,060
Chubby is still up there.

99
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,980
Why would Qingshan

100
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,300
go this far to hurt us?

101
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,140
We've never done anything to him.

102
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,860
And Chubby is his cousin.

103
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,100
What do you think?

104
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,740
The relic of ill omen.

105
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,700
I tested Yafeng with blood.

106
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,060
She didn't react.

107
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,060
Qingshan probably didn't use the power
of the relic of ill omen

108
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,420
to control her mind.

109
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:12,740
Maybe

110
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,020
just simple brainwashing.

111
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,460
What about Chubby?

112
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,980
Do you think they'll hurt him?

113
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,220
Don't worry.

114
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,780
Right now, he's probably
the safest one.

115
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,900
The pitfall trap he set for us

116
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,340
was meant to kill.

117
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,620
But with him,

118
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,540
so far, it's just restraints.

119
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,460
Maybe he's sparing him

120
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,300
out of family ties.

121
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:38,940
But right now,

122
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,260
I'm most worried
about Thirteen-Thousand.

123
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,940
What if he...?

124
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,140
I was just saying.

125
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,180
I just feel like we're trapped here

126
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,140
with no way out,

127
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,180
and no way to save him.

128
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,180
What if we never get out?

129
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,180
Don't lose hope.

130
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,260
Think about it.

131
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,460
Even stuck in this hopeless place,

132
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,540
you're still fighting to survive.

133
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,580
I believe

134
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,060
they're doing the same.

135
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:10,620
Don't forget,

136
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,020
we still have Hongsha.

137
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,100
Thank you.

138
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,060
Thank you.

139
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:19,860
Excuse me,

140
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,500
how much farther is it

141
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,220
to Cao Village?

142
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,140
Cao Village?

143
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,780
It rained heavily last night.

144
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,940
The road collapsed.

145
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,420
Just go straight along this path.

146
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,860
It should take about two hours.

147
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,980
- Two hours?
- Two hours?

148
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:36,500
Yeah.

149
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,500
That's way too far.

150
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,460
Shouldn't have come.

151
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,260
Right?

152
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,180
Sir,

153
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,620
Where's the collapsed road
you just talked about?

154
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,260
I'd like to ask

155
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,380
if I can climb over the mountain
to get into the village?

156
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,100
Climb over the mountain?

157
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:01,740
Yes.

158
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,540
Young lady, you've got some nerve.

159
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,260
That's so dangerous.

160
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,860
It rained heavily last night.

161
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,580
There could be falling rocks everywhere.

162
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,820
Better stick to the main road.

163
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,540
It's safer.

164
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,860
Would I get lost
taking the mountain path?

165
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,740
Not really.

166
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,180
Height gives you perspective.

167
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,260
If you lose your way,

168
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,100
just climb to the highest point.

169
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,620
You'll spot Cao Village for sure.

170
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,340
Got it, thanks.

171
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:27,820
Be careful.

172
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,980
Someone was buried by the mudslide.

173
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,940
Thirteen-Thousand?

174
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,780
Thirteen-Thousand.

175
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:51,980
Thirteen-Thousand!

176
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,540
Thirteen-Thousand!

177
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,700
Thirteen-Thousand.

178
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:13,860
Thirteen-Thousand!

179
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,500
Thirteen-Thousand.

180
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,740
Oh my gosh.

181
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,380
You're awake.

182
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,820
Are you alright?

183
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,580
How are you feeling?

184
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,980
Just survived a brush with death,

185
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,820
only to wake up to this horror scene.

186
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,100
Almost scared me to death again.

187
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,220
Got any water?

188
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,500
Yeah.

189
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,780
Easy, easy.

190
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:16,740
What are you doing here?

191
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,500
Luo Ren called,
saying you'd all lost contact.

192
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,140
He entered the village yesterday.

193
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,580
Now I can't reach him either.

194
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,140
I hadn't even arrived yet.

195
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:24,940
I'd just entered the village

196
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,300
and met you halfway.

197
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,620
Right.

198
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,660
Qingshan...

199
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,340
Something's wrong with Qingshan.

200
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,180
The relic of ill omen

201
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,020
might be inside him.

202
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,340
Dai?

203
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,340
Dai?

204
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,540
Look at you,
completely useless in a fight.

205
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,180
The relic of ill omen
might be inside him.

206
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,460
I couldn't go head-to-head with him.

207
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,020
I had to rely on brains instead.

208
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,020
What brilliant strategy did you use?

209
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:28,980
I...

210
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,860
Such as cutting his power base,

211
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,860
substituting crucial parts,

212
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,660
and making a secret move.

213
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,420
I...

214
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,060
Ah, forget it.

215
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,180
I played dead.

216
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,300
I tried climbing out later,

217
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,020
but I was too weak

218
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,900
and got buried again.

219
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,060
So, when you woke up
and found yourself in Luo Ren's car,

220
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,540
were you overjoyed?

221
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,300
Thirteen-Thousand.

222
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,060
Hang in there.

223
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,900
Please don't die.

224
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,500
Thirteen-Thousand!

225
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,700
Thirteen-Thousand!

226
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,340
Not really.

227
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,580
What do you mean, "not really"?

228
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,860
Who in their right mind

229
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,820
would be overjoyed to see themselves

230
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,300
in such a creepy look after waking up?

231
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,660
I even thought I'd gone to heaven

232
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,980
and been mummified.

233
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,660
And Fiery, no offense,

234
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,100
but your bandaging skills...

235
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,780
Dockworkers packing cargo

236
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,140
do a neater job than this.

237
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,060
Don't hit me. Don't.

238
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,180
Everything hurts. Spare me.

239
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:33,780
See?

240
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,100
If I don't teach you a lesson,

241
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,700
the heavens will.

242
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,340
Yeah, I'm sloppy.
You're the meticulous one.

243
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,580
The most meticulous.

244
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:42,940
Then unwrap it

245
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:43,860
and do it yourself.

246
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,580
You're amazing at this. The best.

247
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,620
I love your bandaging style.

248
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,180
Thinking back now,

249
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,780
the day Dai lost contact with Luo Ren

250
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,980
was probably when she
got into trouble too.

251
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,740
So what do we do now?

252
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,060
Call the police?

253
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,100
With what evidence?

254
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,980
Everyone in Cao Village
will side with Qingshan.

255
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,260
Who'd believe the two of us?

256
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,500
Our top priority

257
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,140
is finding Luo Ren.

258
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,700
Are you sure the relic of ill omen
is inside Qingshan?

259
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,180
Not a hundred percent,

260
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,140
but he's definitely up to no good.

261
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,260
And doesn't this feel different

262
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,540
from before?

263
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,860
Like we've been set up.

264
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,300
First, Chubby

265
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,380
was lured back
to Cao Village by a letter,

266
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,380
then went missing.

267
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,340
Then Dai and I came looking for him.

268
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,580
All we did was buy some insurance.

269
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,620
We didn't piss anyone off,

270
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,140
yet someone's trying to kill us.

271
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,580
Now Dai's missing too.

272
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,180
Then Luo Ren went into the village
to look for us.

273
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,300
He also went missing.

274
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:45,980
Lucky for you.

275
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,700
You didn't just go straight
into Cao Village.

276
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:48,940
Or you'd have been fooled

277
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,740
by Qingshan's harmless face

278
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,300
and ended up just like the others,

279
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,140
missing.

280
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:07,940
I'm setting an alarm.

281
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,460
Is that necessary?

282
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,140
Dark, confined spaces

283
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,340
can cloud your judgment

284
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,020
and push you toward emotional collapse.

285
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,820
That's why keeping a routine matters.

286
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,820
I've already checked all the spots

287
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,660
you just looked for.

288
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,860
The only way out is up there.

289
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,420
Really?

290
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,300
I'm starving.

291
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,860
Tighten your belt
will make you feel less hungry.

292
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:37,980
Try this.

293
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,380
Sure.

294
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,980
It's really much comfier
than lying on the ground.

295
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,060
But aren't the mesh holes a bit too big?

296
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,500
What if I fall through?

297
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,820
Did I say

298
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,860
this was for you?

299
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,180
It's not for me?

300
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,340
Then where do I sleep?

301
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:04,780
Here.

302
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,780
We'll sleep together?

303
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,100
Madam Hong always taught me

304
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,420
that girls shouldn't stay out overnight,

305
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,620
let alone sleep next to boys.

306
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,500
Suit yourself.

307
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,260
But

308
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,140
desperate times

309
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,540
call for flexible rules.

310
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,100
Do you like xiaolongbao?

311
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,060
The ones with shrimp filling.

312
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,980
With a touch of crab roe.

313
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,500
Juicy filling wrapped in thin skin.

314
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,980
Slurp up the soup through a straw.

315
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:54,700
Delicious.

316
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,900
I want to have roast duck.

317
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,380
Crispy skin and tender meat.

318
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,380
Stop.

319
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,380
Now you're making me hungry.

320
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,020
Just sleep.

321
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,620
Maybe there'll be food

322
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,300
tomorrow.

323
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,980
You're treating me like a kid.

324
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,020
My poor stomach.

325
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,780

00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,300
You snored and drooled

when you were sleeping last night.

354
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:53,780
What?

355
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:55,860
That's nonsense.

356
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,580
Really.

357
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,540
Never mind. I'll stop teasing you.

358
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,420
Get up and stretch a bit.

359
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,220

00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,460

361
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,660
Where's the food?

362
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:13,780
Close your eyes.

363
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,660
Don't peek.

364
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,060
Open your mouth.

365
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:37,820
Chocolate?

366
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,780
A little snack won't fill you up.

367
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:40,900
But it's better than nothing.

368
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,180
Then why didn't you
bring it out last night?

369
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,060
I was starving back then.

370
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,940
We don't know
how long we'll be trapped here.

371
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,380
Of course we need to ration.

372
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,460
Fine.

373
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:52,780
Did you eat any?

374
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,020
I did.

375
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,700
Did you sleep well last night?

376
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,420
Not bad.

377
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,620

beats sleeping in water.

00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:02,780
In water?

379
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,740
It rained the night before last.

380
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,180
I woke up

381
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,380
in the middle of the night

382
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,060
only to find myself lying in a puddle.

383
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,140
Luckily, the water receded
after the rain stopped.

384
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,540
Did the water recede quickly?

385
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,380
The water here came from seepage.

386
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,300
This place is all soil.

387
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:40,020
And there probably aren't
many rocks underneath.

388
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,100
That's why the water
could seep through so fast.

389
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,540
This cave goes deep.

390
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,180
Judging by the mountain's height,

391
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,300
it should be close to the surface.

392
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,300
If it's all soil below,

393
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,300
that means

394
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,500
we can dig.

395
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,340
Dig what?

396
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:58,980
A path.

397
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,140
A tunnel?

398
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,460
How many years would that take?

399
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,540
Are we really going to dig?

400
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:08,940
Yes.

401
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:32,620
Hello.

402
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,540
Hi.

403
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,620
Hello.

404
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,380
And you are...?

405
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,980
Is this Jenny Cao's place?

406
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,260
You mean Jinhua?

407
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,100
Yes.

408
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:53,980
Yes, it is.

409
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,740
Jenny! Jenny!

410
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,380
Your boss is here to see you!

411
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:00,820
Boss!

412
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:07,700
Boss?

413
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:08,620
Hurry up.

414
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,260
I'm Maria.

415
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,420
I'm the local manager
of the Central Region

416
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:19,180
for Atlantic Life Insurance Company.

417
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,220
Hello.

418
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,940
Central Region?

419
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,180
Local manager?

420
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,620
Ma...

421
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,540
Madam Maria.

422
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,380
Madam Maria, what brings you here?

423
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,580
Have a seat.

424
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:31,820
Alright.

425
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,020
Here's the thing.

426
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,340
Our customer service department

427
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,940
received a call
from a client named Henry.

428
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:39,420
He said he wanted to buy insurance
for himself and his siblings.

429
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,380
He specified you as his agent.

430
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,860
I couldn't get through to your phone.

431
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,580
After asking colleagues
in Yan City, I learned

432
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,020
you were attending a wedding
in your hometown.

433
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,660
I was afraid the client might
go elsewhere if we kept him waiting,

434
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,300
so I came personally.

435
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:55,060
I've brought the client's documents
and requirements

436
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,660
to help you tailor the insurance plans.

437
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:58,620
This...

438
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,820
This is really appreciated.

439
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,980
Thank you so much for coming personally.

440
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,740
So heartwarming.

441
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,220
This is the power of our team.

442
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,940
Madam, please enjoy your tea.

443
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,380
I'll go check the client details inside.

444
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,260
Take your time.

445
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,460
Jenny.

446
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,460
Yes, ma'am?

447
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,940
This village looks festive.

448
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,620
Preparing for a wedding?

449
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,140
Yes.

450
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,660
I've never seen a wedding
with so many flowers.

451
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,220
In the city, weddings are all handled

452
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,780
by wedding planning companies.

453
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,060
They end up looking the same.

454
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,980
Yours here in the mountains is better.

455
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,460
It's unique.

456
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,260
Exactly.

457
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,780
We have lots of traditional rituals

458
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,300
for weddings in the mountains.

459
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,100
Just the banquet alone lasts three days.

460
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:42,940
Banquet?

461
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:43,580
Yes.

462
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,020
Now that you mention it,

463
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,100
I am a little hungry.

464
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,980
Then

465
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,940
stay for the feast, ma'am.

466
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,500
Would that be alright?

467
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,500
Of course.

468
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,700
The more, the merrier.
Just an extra seat.

469
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,020
I really shouldn't impose.

470
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,140
At least stay for a toast.

471
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:18,700
Stay for a toast.

472
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,540
Why are there four armchairs there?

473
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,700
The bride and groom were both orphans.

474
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,660
Those armchairs

475
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,860
will stand in for their parents.

476
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,180
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

477
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,820
When will the newlyweds
make their entrance?

478
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:28,620
Right from here.

479
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,980
Soon the groom will receive
the memorial tablet from here.

480
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,660
After that, he can fetch the bride.

481
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,500
Memorial tablet?

482
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,140
Yes.

483
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,540
It's our tradition.

484
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,380
There's an ancient memorial tablet

485
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,100
kept by the eldest villager.

486
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,100
For every wedding,

487
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,860
a boy under seven

488
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,100
fetches it from the elder's place.

489
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,060
After that,

490
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,220
he follows the gong bearer,

491
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,740
circling the village with the tablet.

492
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,340
Finally, it's presented to the groom.

493
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,700
The newlyweds must honor the tablet

494
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,740
before bowing to heaven and earth.

495
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,540
[Resting Hut]

496
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,220
I see.

497
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,140
Dear,

498
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:53,900
quick.

499
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,540
Have you seen Qingshan?

500
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,220
Haven't seen him.

501
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:58,740
Eat up.

502
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:59,460
Jinhua.

503
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:00,820
Jinhua.

504
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,340
Have you seen Qingshan?

505
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:02,980
No.

506
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,140
The memorial tablet's about to arrive,

507
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,460
but Qingshan's missing.

508
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,940
Come help me look for him.

509
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:08,540
Alright, sure.

510
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,380
Madam, have a seat.

511
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,220
I need to find someone.

512
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,540
Come here!

513
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,140
Look for Qingshan.

514
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:13,500
Help me search for Qingshan.

515
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,020
Go now.

516
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:14,820
I'll check here.

517
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,060
Zhu's mom!

518
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,300
Stop drinking.

519
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,860
Help me find Qingshan.

520
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:19,780
Hurry!

521
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,620
Move it.

522
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,660
Today's my wedding day.

523
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,180
We're cousins after all.

524
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,580
Even if you can't join the banquet,

525
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,860
I'd like you to be there.

526
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,020
You are my cousin.

527
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,340
- Pudgy?
- In a couple of days,

528
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,940
I'll see if I can let you go.

529
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,980
But I can only guarantee your safety.

530
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,700
As for the others, there's nothing
I can do to help.

531
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,540
Qingshan.

532
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:06,660
Jinhua.

533
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,460
The tablet's ready. Where were you?

534
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,780
Just checking if everything's prepared.

535
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,420
I'm coming now.

536
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,500
Hurry up!

537
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,500
This rock is man-made.

538
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,580
Once we remove this one,

539
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,460
the rest should be easier.

540
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,460
Mu Dai, come look.

541
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,860
These rocks are arranged
in intentional layers.

542
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,660
The gaps between the upper rocks

543
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,940
align with the surfaces
of the lower rocks.

544
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,380
So if you thrust a knife into the gap,

545
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,500
it will still hit rock below.

546
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:11,420
So someone purposely
stacked them like this?

547
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,460
Then there might really be
an exit below.

548
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:17,300
Mu Dai,

549
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,340
I'm the one who found this exit.

550
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,300
You

551
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,580
go climb over there.

552
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,140
No way.

553
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,420
Still think digging our way out
is a joke?

554
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,540
Not anymore.

555
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,580
Then you take over the digging.

556
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:35,580
I'm tired.

557
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,980
Poor me.

558
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,300
My boyfriend is making me
dig through rocks.

559
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,540
My hands are going to break.

560
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,180
Fine, move aside.

561
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,180
Ren,

562
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:45,780
I really like you.

563
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:36,420
Is it good?

564
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,420
I'm full now.

565
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,740
Now I'm full of energy.

566
