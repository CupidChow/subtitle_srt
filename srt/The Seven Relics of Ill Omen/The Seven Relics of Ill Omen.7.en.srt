[Episode 7]

5
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,340
That place

6
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,780
is in Wuzhu Village,

7
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,220
Hepu, Gui Region.

8
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,260
It's my hometown.

9
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,820
For generations,
villagers have fished for pearls.

10
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,420
They dive for clams and get pearls.

11
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,420
In our ancestral hall
is the God of Water.

12
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,900
On its roof ridge, there are
animals of Immortals Leading the Way.

13
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,700
Actually, in Xiaoshang River,

14
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,380
when I painted for the first time,

15
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,420
I saw the vision
from the shadow of water.

16
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,340
But before I finished it,

17
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,060
I didn't know what it really was.

18
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,180
I was too shocked

19
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,420
to tell anyone about it.

20
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,180
And I didn't know

21
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,940
you guys would see the same vision

22
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,700
one after another.

23
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,100
The shadow of water is one thing

24
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,660
while the vision is another.

25
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,140
How can you be sure

26
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,940
the exact thing in your village

27
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,700
is what we are after?

28
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,500
Because I smashed the last animal.

29
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,740
It was my hands that took it away.

30
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:02,940
Why didn't you tell us?

31
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,660
Because I hate that place!

32
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,180
Wuzhu Village.

33
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,220
Glad we have an address now.

34
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,340
I'll check the map.

35
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:17,980
It's a small village.

36
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,940
You can't find it on the map.

37
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,860
I can take you there.

38
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,380
But there is a condition.

39
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,340
Tell me.

40
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,740
Keep me safe.

41
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,260
Deal.

43
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,900
The cool bartender isn't here.

44
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,500
He isn't here.

45
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,060
I'll serve you.

46
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:32,780
Sorry about that.

47
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,380
Fine, then.

48
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,860
Oh, poor me.

49
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,580
Luo took away Thirteen-Thousand.

50
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,820
The workload isn't a problem.

51
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,500
I just feel way too lonely.

52
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,820
I'm a party person, after all.

53
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,380
Luckily, Master is here with me.

54
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,860
Or how could I live?

55
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,380
I even feel life is meaningless.

56
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,300
Life is actually meaningless.

57
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,820
What would you like, sir?

58
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,060
I've got this.

59
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,460
You can sit for a while.

60
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,460
But this is an area for paid food.

61
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:08,940
You can use this.

62
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:09,940
Is Mu Dai here?

63
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,380
You know her?

64
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,140
Tell her her senior is here.

65
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:16,780
Who?

66
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:18,140
You...

67
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,820
You... look fine.

68
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,460
My master punished him

69
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,020
severely for that.

70
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,980
He's still recovering.

71
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:26,980
His arms and legs are broken.

72
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,180
Your limbs have recovered?

73
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,980
You look intact.

74
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,340
What did she tell you?

75
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,500
No, no.

76
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,660
Nothing. I just...

77
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,500
Senior.

78
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,100
You're an able body.

79
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,340
Oh, gosh.

80
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,340
When did you come?

81
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,580
Get in there.

82
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,540
You have a new hairstyle.

83
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,700
I hate washing my hair.

84
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,020
Didn't you ask me

85
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,300
to get you a job?

86
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:52,780
You got one?

87
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,500
Yes.

88
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,740
Go with me for an interview.

89
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:55,260
Come on.

90
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,100

00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,220
Huacheng.

92
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,380
Huacheng?

93
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,900
I need to get packed.

94
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,140
No need.

95
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,380
It's just 30 kilometers away.
You'll be back soon.

96
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,420
- You're right.
- Let's go.

97
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,860

I'm leaving with my senior.

99

What's your name?

100
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:11,940
Cao.

101
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,020
Cao.

102
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,740
Thanks for taking care of Mu Dai.

103
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,140
Life is meaningful in some ways.

104
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,460
Yes, whatever you say.

105
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,020
Go get my purse.

106
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,540
Hurry. The train is leaving.

107
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,340
Be right there.

108
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,340
Hurry.

109
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:26,740
Bye-bye.

110
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,740
I want to talk to him.

111
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,740
Such a medical miracle!

[The Yan Family, Huacheng]

00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,780
Fancy house, indeed.

114
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,420
A fancy house doesn't mean anything.

115
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,940
All are made of clay bricks.

116
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,260
Senior.

117
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,260
Can I really be a bodyguard?

118
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,580
Of course. You're my junior.

119
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,620
You can do anything.

120
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,260
Then...

121
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,380
What should I do in the interview?

122
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,540
Nothing.

123
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,260
Just be yourself.

124
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,780
Don't put on an act.

125
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,700
They'll test you.

126
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,020
You'll test them, too.

127
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,700
If you feel upset, leave immediately.

128
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,660
Don't hesitate.

129
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,140
And remember.

130
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,580
In your life,

131
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,620
you must respect yourself.

132
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,100
It makes sense.

133
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,100
There you go.

134
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,260
Yan, here we are.

00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:21,700
Here, Dai.

137
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,380
Remember.

138
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,100
Don't put on an act.

139
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,620
Hello, sir.

140
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,620

141
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,420
See the stone table in front of you?

142

Yes.

143
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,580
There are words on it.

144
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,180

Well done!

Dai,

149
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,460
I've told you many times

150
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,500
to be gentle.

151
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,860
What if you choke her?

152
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,540
Hello.

153
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,340
Nice to meet you.

154
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,500
Someone recommended your clan.

155
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,020
Hongsha has never

156
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,860
traveled alone.

157
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,420
I want a female bodyguard

158
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,620
to travel with her.

159
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,940
Four or five days at most.

160
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,380
This trip is all-inclusive.

161
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,980
The pay is twenty thousand.

162
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,620
It's the deposit.

163
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,020
Ten thousand.

164
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,060
Senior.

165
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,860
Quite a lot of money.

166
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,740
If necessary, I'll give you more.

167
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,940
Where are we going then?

168
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,420
What will we do?

169
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:11,660
Hongsha.

170
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,300
Tell her about it.

171
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,180
We're treasure hunters.

172
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,020
Have you heard of it?

173
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,620
Treasures

174
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,860
refer to gems.

175
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,660
They're priceless.

176
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,140
Can we get them, then?

177
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,780
Be patient, okay?

178
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,820
Equipment is needed for the gems

179
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,940
in the mine.

180
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,820
We don't do

181
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,420
such hard jobs.

182
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,060
Do you remember the remark on the table?

183
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,180
What is it?

184
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,060
"Soil can't obscure them."

185
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,860

187
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,620
We only hunt

188
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,620
this kind of gems.

189
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,780
Why do you think you can

190
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,020
get this kind of gem?

191
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,460
People would get them first.

192
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,660
Such an ignorant amateur.

193
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,180
Do you think gems will shine

194
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,020
where they are?

195
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,620
They're either encased in stone

196
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,820
or wrapped in earth.

197
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,860
They're invisible to ordinary guys.

198
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,420
Special eyes are needed

199
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,380
to detect their spreading light.

200
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,420
Got it?

201
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,380
We don't dig from the earth.

202
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,380
We only dive in water or wells.

203
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,180
In water, we get pears and jade.

204
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,300
In wells, we get gems.

205
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:38,860
According to ancient books,

206
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,780
"If there are gems in a well,

207
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,300
the air will look crystal."

208
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,180
- "Pearls are in the deep... "
- Hongsha.

209
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,180
This is too elusive to be understood.

210
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,700
Let me tell you.

211
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,980
Treasure hunters like us

212
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,820
need the eye training.

213
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:05,980
We locate the treasures with our eyes.

214
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,820
But it exhausts our eyes terribly.

215
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,700
So, we end up half-blind

216
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,460
for the rest of our lives.

217
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,220
I have a son.

218
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,060
He's Hongsha's uncle.

219
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,140
Instead of using this skill,

220
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,620
he uses his own way.

221
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,540
Some days ago, he went to Gui Region.

222
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,940
For some treasures.

223
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,620
The other day, when I called him,

224
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,700
I couldn't get through.

225
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,140
I could get through,

226
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,260
but he didn't answer.

227
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,020
I located him.

228
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,900
He was in that region.

229
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,220
I'm really worried.

230
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,900
But I have trouble moving around.

231
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:51,100
So, I want you to take Hongsha there.

232
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:52,940
Gui Region?

233
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,740
Around the Plateau Lake?

234
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,780
Can you tell me the exact location?

235
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,220
Wuzhu Village,

236
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:01,780
Hepu.

237
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,740
What a coincidence.

238
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,740
The tunnel is closed.

239
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,500
Go another way.

240
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,300
[Destination: Wuzhu Village]

241
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,700
The tunnel is closed.

242
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,580
Go another way.

243
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:19,540
Thirteen-Thousand,

244
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,780
the tunnel isn't available.

245
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:23,980
In such remote areas,

246
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,700
the navigation often goes wrong.

247
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,100
Trust me.

248
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,340
Go through the tunnel

249
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,220
and Wuzhu Village
is just a few miles away.

250
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,420
I remember the route clearly.

251
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,100
The navigation is accurate.

252
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,180
That's impossible.

253
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,500
Drive through the tunnel
and we'll arrive.

254
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,300
It'll take a whole day
if we go another way.

255
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,660
I don't know why the tunnel is closed.

256
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,380
My luggage.

257
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,100
I'm your bodyguard,

258
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,460
not your personal assistant.

259
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,140
Oh.

260
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,100
When we're in Hepu,

261
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,540
what vehicle will we take?

262
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,340
Where will we live after our mission?

263
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,380
Have you arranged it?

264
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,340
Have you got a plan?

265
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,220
Your grandpa said

266
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,860
this trip would be all-inclusive.

267
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,780
So, arrange everything.

268
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,700
I invited you over.

269
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,220
There was a dance. Lively, indeed.

270
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:07,980
It tastes great.

271
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:08,940
Look at this.

272
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:09,540
Madam.

273
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,980
Have you heard
of a Wuzhu Village nearby?

274
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,260
Yes.

275
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,060
You're going there?

276
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,300
Before, you could go
through the old tunnel.

277
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,980
But it's closed now.

278
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,740
You'll have to take a detour.

279
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,140
You can go by train.

280
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,780
It's available there.

281
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,700
Do you know

282
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,740
why the tunnel is closed?

283
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,380
Because no one is there.

284
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,300
The village is empty.

285
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,540
Empty?

286
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,860
I've heard people in this village

287
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,180
do pearl hunting.

288
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,420
For generations.

289
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,900
How come it is empty?

290
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,700
It's true.

291
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,820
No pearls are available.

292
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,020
So, people moved away.

293
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,660
No pearls?

294
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,020
But I heard there were
many clams in the lake.

295
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,380
There should have been pearls.

296
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,460
Dude,

297
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,980
you have no idea.

298
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,260
On one Mid-Autumn night,

299
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,340
Clams Basking in the Moon
actually happened.

300
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,020
Clams were everywhere on the shore.

301
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,460
But a naughty boy

302
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,700
burned them with gasoline.

303
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,180
What a terrible kid.

304
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,340
So wicked.

305
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,340
That's right.

306
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,460
I've heard,

307
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,820
since then,

308
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,420
no pearls have been found here.

309
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,980
According to the locals,

310
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,140
they offended the God of Water
and had their comeuppance.

311
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,460
Well, I think

312
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,140
everything has a soul.

313
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,780
When the clams were burned,

314
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,180
they would hate this place.

315
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,660
So, they'd never come again.

316
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,220
Right?

317
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:27,820
Maybe.

318
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,860
Why are you going there?

319
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,260
Nothing's left there.

320
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,460
I've also heard

321
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,660
that village is haunted now.

322
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,260
Really?

323
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,620
You don't know?

324
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,340
Hey, stop.

325
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,020
Sounds creepy.

326
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,780
- Let's drink.
- Ok.

327
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:40,620

- No.
- Join us.

330

Why can't I get through to him?

350
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,540
Your uncle was missing.

351
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,580
But he called you just now.
Isn't it great?

352
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,860
Maybe his phone is dead.

353
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,180
He'll call you after charging it.

354
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,260
Come on, he answered.

355
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,660
He just didn't say anything.

356
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,740
Is he in trouble?

357
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,380
Maybe he couldn't say anything
because of the low battery.

358
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,660
My dream was horrible.

359
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,540
It felt so real.

dreams aren't real.

00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,140
Go back to sleep.

Don't worry. I've arranged everything.

So, this is your fancy cart?

380

That's right. Fancy cart.

00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,660
We're about to go.

385
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,860
I've got this for this.

386
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,280
[No pearls. Only spiders.]

387
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:51,860
How did this happen?

388
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,020
My home is still here.

389
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,420
This is...

390
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:14,900
your home?

391
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,220
Aren't we supposed
to have a final division?

392
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,620
Why do you have to guard the lake?

393
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,940
Our village head is foresighted.

394
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,620
He fears neighboring thieves.

395
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,060
If they steal,

396
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,580
we'll get fewer pearls.

397
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,420
Each family will get a smaller share.

398
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,580
For Jiang Zhao's school life,

399
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,340
we'll afford fewer erasers

400
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,780
or pencils.

401
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,620
Am I right?

402
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:08,820
I should go.

403
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,060
Be very careful.

404
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,820
I'm wearing my talisman.

405
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,420
Don't worry.

406
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,020
We're here alone.

407
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,580
If something is on your mind

408
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,100
and bothers you,

409
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,060
you can talk to me.

410
00:21:59,220 --> 00:21:59,900
You know.

411
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:04,220
Villagers here live off pearls.

412
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,140
Waters with clams
are just like farmlands.

413
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,140
They aren't all fertile.

414
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,060
Some have more clams
while some have fewer.

415
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,300
Everybody wants the best part.

416
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,420
Stop fighting.

417
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,260
In the division of water,

418
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,540
we fought with the neighboring village.

419
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,700
At first, they agreed to wait

420
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,660
for the authorities' solution.

421
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,500
Stop it!

422
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,940
But guys from the neighboring village

423
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,300
sneaked in to steal clams.

424
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,380
Things were out of control.

425
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,380
This is our territory!

426
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,740
Go back to your own village.

427
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,420
Go away.

428
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,900
Get out of here.

429
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,500
Get away!

430
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:40,940
Leave.

431
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,620
Send them away.

432
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,060
Throw them off.

433
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,580
My father...

434
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,060
fell into the water and died

435
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,420
during this fight.

436
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,500
But a pearl fisher

437
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,820
should be a good swimmer.

438
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:03,900
That's right.

439
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:05,940
Who knows?

440
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,420
Maybe

441
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:13,100
he fell and cramped up.

442
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,660
Accidents happen.

443
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,420
Right?

444
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,060
We didn't even find his body.

445
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,620
After he died,

446
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,740
my mother became delirious.

447
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,900
She couldn't distinguish
between illusion and reality.

448
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:39,620
Mom,

449
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,460
where are you going?

450
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,620
To see your father.

451
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:42,620
Mom,

452
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,740
it's blowing really hard. Don't go.

453
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:45,580
Mom!

454
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,420
Did you hear?

455
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,620
He's yelling for help.

456
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,180
He's hunting pearls.

457
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,140
He can't pull so many pearls.

458
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,540
I need to go now.

459
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,900
Mom, you can't go.

460
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:58,780
It's blowing hard.

461
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,980
Mom! Mom!

462
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,020
Get out of my way!

463
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:04,820
Mom!

464
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:16,820
Mom!

465
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,060
Mom!

466
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,340
Mom!

467
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,980
Don't go!

468
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,540
Come back!

469
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,580
You can't go!

470
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,540
- Let me go!
- No!

471
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,420
You can't go.

472
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,380
Don't be silly.

473
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,180
You'll get killed.

474
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,020
You can't go.

475
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,220
Chief,

476
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,940
please save my mother.

477
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,420
Such strong waves.

478
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,020
How can I save her?

479
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,340
Nobody can get down to save her!

480
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,540
Or they will just die!

481
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,580
You're a madwoman.

482
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,100
Mom!

483
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:52,740
She's insane!

484
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,580
Let me go!

485
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,020
Let me go!

486
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:07,980
Mom!

487
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,620
That night,

488
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,540
it blew strongly on the water.

489
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,100
Nobody saved her.

490
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,620
The next morning,

491
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,860
she couldn't be seen.

492
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,740
Do you think I was really unlucky?

493
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,180
I thought so, anyway.

494
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,140
During that time,

495
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,020
I often sneaked into the ancestral hall.

496
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,220
I asked the God of Water

497
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,860
what I had done wrong

498
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,620
or what my family had done wrong.

499
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,060
I asked how we offended him.

500
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,620
But he didn't reply.

501
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,340
Close the door.

502
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,220
I got you guys here

503
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,940
to talk about Jiang Zhao.

504
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,700
He's a poor kid.

505
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,380
He needs a lot of money

506
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,820
for his school and marriage.

507
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,500
Why don't we

508
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:33,020
split the cost evenly?

509
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,300
Okay. Whatever you say.

510
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,460
That's fine with me.

511
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,740
Jiang Liu,

512
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,980
say something.

513
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:46,940
Chief,

514
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:48,540
this is unfair.

515
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,380
You didn't save his father.

516
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,260
Why do I have to pay?

517
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,020
Nonsense.

518
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,540
I didn't kill him.

519
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,740
I didn't push him into the water.

520
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,260
You were just beside him.

521
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,020
Why didn't you save him?

522
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,140
It was too chaotic.

523
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,900
We might not manage to save him.

524
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,660
Anyway,

525
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,500
his death isn't in vain.

526
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:11,140
At least, we own the lake now.

527
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,660
Yeah.

528
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,500
We lost a man and they were guilty.

529
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,420
They were too ashamed to come.

530
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,180
The authorities pitied us too.

531
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,980
Then, this lake was given to us.

532
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:22,780
So,

533
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,580
Jiang Zhao's father is our hero.

534
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:29,180
We should take care of Jiang Zhao

535
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,420
and bring him up.

536
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:34,340
Don't be stingy on such small expenses.

537
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,260
Fine, then.

538
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,660
- Clams are basking in the moon.
- Clams are basking in the moon.

539
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:39,940
- Clams.
- In the moon.

540
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:40,900
It's really happening.

541
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,220
Let's take a look.

542
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,620
Let's go.

543
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,420
- Clams.
- Move.

544
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,260
Be quick, Chief.

545
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,900
I'll screw this.

546
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,500
Then,

547
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,300
what is Clams Basking in the Moon?

548
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:27,900
Clams Basking in the Moon?

549
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,500
That's just

550
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,100
a ridiculous legend here.

551
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,340
During the Mid-Autumn Festival,

552
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:39,060
if the clams come onto the shore,
open their shells,

553
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,340
and bask in the moon,

554
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,860
there will be a great harvest of pearls

555
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,180
for the next year.

556
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,940
Enough moonshine

557
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,660
can make the pearls bigger and rounder.

558
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,100
But did they deserve the pearls?

559
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,220
They watched my father die heartlessly.

560
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,540
Do you think they deserved that?

561
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,700
A great harvest?

562
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:06,700
Then what happened?

563
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,140
What happened?

564
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,420
I took some diesel there

565
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,940
and burned the clams.

566
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,780
I climbed onto the roof
and smashed Hangshi.

567
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,820
Then, I ran away.

568
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,740
After that, I never

569
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,220
told anyone about this.

570
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,060
Am I to blame?

571
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,180
Thirteen-Thousand,

572
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,180
what's gone

573
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,780
is gone.

574
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,340
What matters

575
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,900
is to live a good life now.

576
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,300
Yes.

577
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,460
You're right.

578
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,100
We're here to save Pingting.

579
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,300
Tell me. Where are we going now?

580
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,300
The ancestral hall.

581
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,420
The corner of its roof
appeared in the vision.

582
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,180
We'll find a clue there.

583
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,220
Here we are.

584
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,580
Someone cleans this hall regularly.

585
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,260
Or it couldn't be so clean.

586
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,260
Yeah. I noticed that too.

587
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,820
[Comeuppance for disturbance]
Does someone come back

588
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:42,860
to clean this hall?

589
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,660
Hey.

590
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,340
Do you guys here

591
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,100
believe in this?

592
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,100
No.

593
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,420
People here honor

594
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:58,980
the God of Water.

595
00:30:58,980 --> 00:30:59,780
But we don't

596
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,540
believe in the comeuppance thing.

597
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:29,980
Here we are.

598
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,820
This is it?

599
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,820
My cart can't

600
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,900
get through that path.

601
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,340
Ladies, you'll have to

602
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,620
walk from here.

603
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,780
Keep walking in this direction.

604
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:57,060
Wuzhu Village is on the opposite hill.

605
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,660
Climb up and you'll see
an old ancestral hall.

606
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:00,540
That's it.

607
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,380
Will we go along the way?

608
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,100
You can't go straight there.

609
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:05,700
See?

610
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,900
You must take the outer path.

611
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,260
In the middle is a swamp.

612
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,580
You'll get stuck.

613
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,740
Call me if you need a ride
when you're back.

614
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,460
Why are you going that way?

615
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,940
Isn't that the center of the lake?

616
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,700
There's a swamp.

617
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:32,820
We'll get stuck.

618
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,700
Where are you going?

619
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,220
Let's just go straight.

620
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,260
Don't take a detour.

621
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,180
Isn't it exhausting?

622
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,500
According to my analysis,

623
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,580
this terrain

624
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,100
is like a divided soft-boiled egg.

625
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,620
In the middle is the lake.

626
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,340
Around the lake
is the inaccessible swamp.

627
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,580
But as it goes out, it gets more solid.

628
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,460
Horses and cars can ride on it.

629
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,460
Between two points,
the straight line is the shortest.

630
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,420
We should walk near the center
as far as we can.

631
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,940
It saves time and energy.

632
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,140
The lake bottom.

633
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,140
Thirteen-Thousand.

634
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,740
What's that noise?

635
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,460
Don't need to see it.

636
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,420
It's the pearl lugger.

637
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,500
According to our custom,

638
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:04,220
a shell wind bell is tied to the pole

639
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,380
to get good luck

640
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,100
for clams and pearls.

641
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,340
Let's take a look.

642
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:16,100
Are you sure we'll walk there?

643
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,220
What a terrible route you've chosen.

644
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:38,900
Look.

645
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,220
So what?

646
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,700
A bodyguard can't even endure this?

647
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:43,860
See for yourself.

648
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,260
Aren't we getting closer?

649
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,060
Look.

650
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,260
Come on.

651
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,140
I'm talking to you.

652
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,140
Be polite, okay?

653
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,060
Do you feel

654
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,660
there's something underground?

655
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,340
No.

656
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,300
Don't be so suspicious.

657
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:06,860
Thirteen-Thousand.

658
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,700
The food was recently produced.

659
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,100
Is it the guy

660
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,580
we saw just now?

661
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,220
This is where he lives for now.

662
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,940
But why does he live on a boat

663
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:36,540
instead of living in the village?

664
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,380
Hey, Mu Dai.

665
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,260
What's up?

666
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:50,580
Hey, Luo Ren.

667
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,020
Are you in Wuzhu Village?

668
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:53,980
Yes. What's wrong?

669
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,260
Luo Ren, I'm also here.

670
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,340
You're also here?

671
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,380
Mu Dai.

672
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:01,780
I'm sinking.

673
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,420
Mu Dai. Mu Dai!

674
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:11,780
Mu Dai.

675
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:13,540
What's wrong?

676
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:13,980
Hello?

677
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:16,460
Mu Dai,

678
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,300
I'm stuck.

679
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,220
Mu Dai, I'm stuck!

680
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,620
Mu Dai, help me!

681
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:24,500
Help me!

682
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:25,660
Hello?

683
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,820
Something's in the lake bottom.

684
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:27,700
Come and help us.

685
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:29,500
- Hello?
- What's wrong?

686
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:31,940
Lake bottom.

687
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:34,580
Mu Dai, help me!

688
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:35,740
Mu Dai!

689
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:37,420
Mu Dai!

690
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,300
Mu Dai, help me!

691
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:41,940
Mu Dai!

692
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:43,340
