That clam's completely mutated.

41
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,180
So aggressive.

42
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,260
With those tentacles.

43
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,060
And its shell's all jagged now.

44
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,620
That was sinister.

45
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,620
Seems this clam

00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,780
- is no ordinary thing.
- It hurts?

47
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,460
Thought you were immune to pain.

48
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,740
Analyze this.

49
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,340
Could the relic of ill omen
be inside that clam?

50
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,220
From your description,

51
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,460
it has undergone
significant physiological changes.

52
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,860
Similar to how humans transform

by the relic of ill omen.

54

High probability

55
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,180
the relic of ill omen
is within that clam.

56
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,300
Investigate further.

57
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,500
Understood.

58
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,020
I'll handle something now.

59
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,380
Done.

61
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,900
have you noticed something?

62
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:57,900
What?

63
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,140
When I'm sitting,

64
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,100
I'm about as tall as you standing.

65
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,860
Master, Luo.

66
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,060
Why are you dressed like that?

67
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,260
My clothes have been washed.

68
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,860
I had to wrap myself in this blanket,

69
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,300
and Thirteen-Thousand
keeps yanking it off.

70
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,100
So annoying.

71
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,420
What's wrong?

72
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:21,740
I'm hungry.

73
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,860
Lucky this is solid ground.

74
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,740
That clam can't get here.

75
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:28,420
Right.

76
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,060
Are these ready?

77
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:30,740
Yeah.

78
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:31,580
Cao,

79
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,100
all you ever think about is food.

80
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,180
Look at you, coiled up like a razor clam

81
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,060
and still drooling for a meal.

82
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:35,780
Obviously!

83
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,220
That clam's been tormenting me all day.

84
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,580
I'm eating its neighbors to vent.

85
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,300
Good?

86
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,300
So good.

87
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:42,940
Try some.

88
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,260
- Luo Ren...
- Why's there shell?

89
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:44,860
Extra calcium.

90
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,740
Both of you, knock it off.

91
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,220
Luo Ren,

92
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,620
you really think the relic of ill omen

93
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,620
- is inside that cla...
- By the way,

94
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,300
what is the relic of ill omen?

95
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,940
That's too deep a question.

96
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,300
Answer mine first.

97
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:58,940
Master,

98
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,780
what have you been through these days?

99
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,500
How about this?

100
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,020
You explain

101
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,580
what we've been dealing with.

102
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,660
And you explain
what the relic of ill omen is.

103
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,620
You two,

104
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,540
take your skewers

105
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,620
and catch up over there.

106
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:11,620
Got it.

107
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,100
Wait.

108
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,100
Enough for you both?

109
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:15,580
Plenty.

110
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,420
Freak.

111
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,380
So what's your plan?

112
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,860
You're not thinking
of taking that clam down, are you?

113
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:31,940
Luo Ren,

114
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,260
that's a clam,

115
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,380
not Pingting!

116
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,900
We could die.

117
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,260
Just so we're clear.

118
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,260
I'm not getting involved in this.

119
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,540
I need to get back to the bar anyway.

120
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,820
I haven't figured it out yet.

121
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,500
Safety first, no matter what.

122
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,100
Tomorrow,

123
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,220
let's go check out those waters again.

124
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,100
We might find Hongsha's uncle.

125
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:57,740
Or...

126
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,460
Be careful.

127
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,860
That guy's back.

128
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,020
Thirteen-Thousand, Thirteen-Thousand...

129
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:08,620
Let him go.

130
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,020
But after what happened yesterday...

131
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,100
He'll manage.

132
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,140
Fine.

133
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,020
Here. Your shrimp.

134
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,340
Gosh, it's burnt to a crisp.

135
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,940
Can we even eat it?

136
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,380
Thank you.

137
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,100
Delicious.

138
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,420
You're pretty skilled.

139
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:41,980
This counts as skilled?

140
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,540
It's a pity you haven't tried

141
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,300
my barbecue in Heisha.

142
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,620
Better?

143
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,460
You know

144
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,580
how we grilled seafood back then?

145
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,620
We invented our own method,

146
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,020
Heisha stone-grilling.

147
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,620
Those seafood

148
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,180
were grilled on a large rock.

149
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,060
My colleagues and I

150
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,300
would sing and drink.

151
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:03,980
Those times

152
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,420
were really carefree.

153
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,260
Your colleagues?

154
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,100
I had two good friends.

155
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,100
One was Yuris.

156
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,820
He always enjoyed singing
those cheesy love songs.

157
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,260
Then there was

158
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,860
- Qingmu.
- Yuris, we can't hear you!

159
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,780
Louder!

160
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,220
Back home, he had a fiancée.

161
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,900
Every night, he'd face the sea,

162
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,620
thinking about her.

163
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,300
That scene

164
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,740
is actually pretty sweet.

165
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,980
Where are they now?

166
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,420
Still in touch?

167
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,540
We haven't been in much contact

168
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,860
after returning home.

169
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:04,620
Mu Dai,

170
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,220
we're heading
to the Eye of the Lake tomorrow.

171
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,460
Are you nervous?

172
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:09,620
Yes.

173
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,740
Even with the gear and the car,

174
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,460
just thinking about that clam

175
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,260
makes my blood run cold.

176
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,700
Let's play a game

177
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,020
to take your mind off it.

178
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,180
Rules are simple.

179
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,060
Heads or tails.

180
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,900
Heads, you ask me a question.

181
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,020
Tails, I ask you one.

182
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,580
One question each.

183
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,260
Okay?

184
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,460
If he's not into it, then let it go.

185
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,140
Just ask him straight out.

186
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,260
Better than sitting here
stewing over it.

187
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,260
Don't torment yourself!

188
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,460
Here we go.

189
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,460
You're cheating.

190
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,260
Alright. Ask me.

191
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,340
Do you like me?

192
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,460
Mu Dai,

193
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,100
we...

194
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,060
Alright, I see.

195
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:19,860
Let's keep going.

196
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:29,940
Mu Dai,

197
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:36,940
if,

198
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,860
I mean, if

199
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,100
the guy you like

200
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,620
is in a huge,

201
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,140
huge mess,

202
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,900
would you still like him?

203
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,140
What are you trying to say?

204
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,140
I'm in a lot of trouble.

205
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,180
Life-threatening trouble.

206
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,740
So you mean

207
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,580
to avoid these troubles,

208
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,580
I should stay away from you?

209
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,860
Or I should keep my distance
from you for now

210
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:25,860
and just wait

211
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,740
until you've sorted out

212
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,300
all these life-threatening

213
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,700
before we can be together?

214
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,380
You're dreaming.

215
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,060
I've never been in love before.

216
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,660
But I know

217
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,020
the best time for two people
to be together

218
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,060
is when they

219
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,500
like each other.

220
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,340
All those excuses

221
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,100
like "Wait till I'm rich"

222
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,300
or "Wait till I've sorted out this"

223
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,820
just fade away as time goes by.

224
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,140
I won't wait.

225
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,500
If two people don't seize
each other's hands

226
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,980
when they meet,

227
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,780
they might just go their separate ways

228
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,140
and hold someone else's hand.

229
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,900
I'll only wait for the kind...

230
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:11,700
The kind

231
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,100
where we've already developed
deep feelings for each other

232
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,580
and are willing to wait.

233
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,460
But we're

234
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,980
not there yet.

235
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,300
Mu Dai...

236
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,140
Enough.

237
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,100
I'm bringing Hongsha some food.

238
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,940
Just consider that my question

239
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,700
was never asked.

240
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,820
We're still good friends.

241
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:02,940
Don't move!

242
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,140
You'd dive for clams now?

243
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,620
The God of Water will punish you!

244
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,380
Are you crazy?

245
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,780
But how can a crazy person
grow vegetables?

246
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,580
Or are you just crazy now and then?

247
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,660
Come here.

248
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,540
Look at this.

249
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,140
Here.

250
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,740
See clearly now.

251
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,700
They're all there.

252
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,380
So many

253
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,700
fighting over territory,

254
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,860
brawling.

255
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,500
Open your eyes

256
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,620
and take a good look!

257
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:50,860
Come on.

258
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,540
There.

259
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,100
There's a man over there.

260
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,220
See him?

261
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,820
That's Jiang Zhao's father.

262
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,660
Help... Help...

263
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,940
He's drowning.

264
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,780
He's watching you
and waiting for you to save him.

265
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,380
He's waiting for you to save him.

266
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,060
But you didn't. What held you back?

267
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,580
No conscience left?

268
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,900
Do you think I don't know?

269
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,580
Over a decade!

270
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,940
Heaven judges me.

271
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:30,340
My own conscience condemns me!

272
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:35,060
I know I failed your father.

273
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,900
Mr. Jiang,

274
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,540
I'm sorry.

275
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,500
This is all my fault.

276
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,060
This is my retribution.

277
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:57,260
It has nothing to do with Jiang Zhao.

278
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,300
It's all my retribution!

279
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,380
Back then,

280
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,380
my hesitation cost you your life.

281
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,900
I've lost my conscience

282
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,660
and made the God of Water mad.

283
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,420
Even our ancestors turned their backs.

284
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,860
Now we

285
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:23,500
can't harvest a single clam.

286
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,700
This is my reckoning!

287
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,380
Can't sleep either?

288
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,900
One minute I'm thinking about my uncle,

289
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,540
the next, that relic of ill omen
pops into my mind.

290
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,340
I asked him.

291
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,580
Asked what?

292
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,260
I was being straightforward.

293
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,020
And?

294
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,540
And

295
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,420
I've got a whole bunch of options again.

296
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,380
He's blind.

297
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,940
He should get his eyes checked.

298
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,420
Infuriating.

299
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,260
Whatever.

300
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,420
I've got connections.

301
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,820
I know every type out there.

302
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,020
Give me your criteria.

303
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:35,940
I'll arrange introductions.

304
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:36,820
Let's piss him off.

305
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,660
Then find me someone hotter.

306
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,940
No problem.

307
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,540
And

308
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,740
tougher too.

309
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,740
Line up eight or ten

310
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,740
meeting that standard
for me to choose from.

311
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,260
Oh my, eight or ten?

312
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,980
You can handle that many?

313
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,020
Absolutely.

314
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:53,700
Fine.

315
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,300
Then I'll start looking.

316
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:55,940
Eight to ten.

317
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,740
You said it.

318
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,260
That's very kind of you.

319
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,420
Tell me about it.

320
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,460
This isn't coming out of my pay, is it?

321
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,500
Now there's an idea.

322
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,500
For safety,

323
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,220
we'll use the water scope to remotely

324
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,740
to check the underwater situation

325
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,300
and see if we can find any clues.

326
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:40,740
Mu Dai,

327
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,460
my uncle will be okay, right?

328
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,860
No news is good news.

329
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,060
Why are there no fish?

330
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,340
This feels like dead water.

331
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,620
When I was a kid,

332
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,220
this lake had tons of fish and shrimp.

333
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,500
Even with the lake shrinking,
this isn't normal.

334
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,300
Luo Ren,

335
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,380
pan the detector horizontally

336
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,860
and see if there are any fish nearby.

337
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,060
Could the clam

338
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,060
have disrupted the ecosystem?

339
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,500
I bet it's also the reason

340
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,620
for the pearl disappearance
in Wuzhu Village.

341
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,300
Indeed.

342
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,100
Such a huge clam.

343
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,380
Even people avoid it like the plague.

344
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,420
Let alone the fish and shrimp.

345
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,820
So the pearl disappearance
has nothing to do with retribution.

346
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,740
It's simply due to
an ecological disaster.

347
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:32,860
Oh my god!

348
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:33,580
Are you okay?

349
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,500
I'm fine.

350
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:36,860
Just algae.

351
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,780
Scared me to death.

352
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,060
Are those bones?

353
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,660
Doesn't look human bones.

354
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,020
I'll have the detector
move underwater to take photos

355
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,020
and then stitch them together.

356
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,380
Oh my god,

357
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,460
the underwater scene is really eerie.

358
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:09,740
What,

359
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,940
does your village run a slaughterhouse?

360
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,900
We used to make sacrificial offerings

361
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,180
to the God of Water.

362
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,580
During festivals, three kinds of
sacrificial animals would be offered.

363
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,060
On grand occasions, whole pigs
and sheep would be sacrificed.

364
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,340
And there are concave areas
in this slope.

365
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,860
Water currents likely

366
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,220
accumulated
sacrificial animal bones here,

367
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,860
forming a large area of bones.

368
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,020
What a waste.

369
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,580
Luo Ren.

370
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,780

382
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,500
He seemed tangled in waterweeds.

383
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,620
I doubt it was that simple.

384
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,020
We've all gotten entangled
when swimming.

385
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,060
You could tear free with some effort.

386
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,100
Unless the clam

387
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,300
dragged him down.

388
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:25,860
Anyway,

389
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,740
let's get your uncle out of the water.

390
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,580
Perimeter is clear.

391
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,220
Can the manipulator handle it?

392
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,780
A maximum weight of 120 kilograms.

393
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:56,660
It should be fine.

394
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,820
Careful! The clam!

395
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:09,980
Thirteen-Thousand,

396
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:10,980
protect the detector!

397
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:11,500
Got it.

398
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,060
The clam is watching from below.

399
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,180
It's going to be difficult.

400
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,100
Luo Ren,

401
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,140
did you set up the video playback?

402
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,140
Everything's preserved till signal loss.

403
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,020
Don't worry.

404
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,980
I've got the amulet.

405
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,060
It's my father.

406
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,260
Mr. Jiang,

407
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,660
did you receive my offerings?

408
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,140
At this point,

409
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,100
retrieving the body means
dealing with that clam.

410
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,980
But confronting it is dangerous.

411
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:05,660
You don't have to join.

412
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,500
Count me in.

413
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,100
I'm definitely in.

414
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,780
You all know

415
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,460
I came

416
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,660
for Pingting.

417
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,700
Turning back now
means leaving empty-handed.

418
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,780
I'm seeing this through.

419
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:25,780
Though it's dangerous,

420
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,340
as the old saying goes,

421
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:28,940
desperation breeds miracles.

422
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,580
Maybe pushing forward

423
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,620
will bring new insights
and a turning point.

424
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,700
I asked Thirteen-Thousand.

425
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,500
His father's remains are down there.

426
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,020
His mother's might be too.

427
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,620
He's coming with us.

428
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,380
Then so am I.

429
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,180
That clam took my life savings

430
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,500
and nearly my life.

431
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,300
I would've died without you.

432
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,060
Besides,

433
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,180
I have to help

434
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,140
Thirteen-Thousand.

435
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,500

this is my employer and bestie,

Let's do this.

♪Hands are joined

451
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,740
Since we're doing this,

452
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,340
we need a plan.

453
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,860
Try to lure the clam
from the Eye of the Lake to the surface.

454
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,260
Once it's out,

455
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,500
I'll fire the capture net.

456
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:47,820
The moment it's in the net,

457
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,900
I'll hook it to the winch.

458
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,460
Reverse!

459
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,940
That clam is too strong.

460
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,300
So we need to
activate the winch immediately.

461
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,740
At the same time,
Thirteen-Thousand drives the car.

462
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,980
We'll use multiple approaches at once

463
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,740
to firmly hold onto the clam.

464
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,260
As long as the car moves fast enough,

465
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,300
it won't have time to react.

466
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,820
Then we'll just tow it all the way
to the shore.

467
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,300
After it's dragged out,

468
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,900
the next step is to extract the flesh.

469
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,700
The relic of ill omen
likely nests within.

470
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,260
Remove the relic of ill omen,

471
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,100
the clam will calm down.

472
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,540
That's our plan.

473
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,220
Wait,

474
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,820
how do we

475
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,420
bait it out?

476
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,660
I'll do it.

477
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,980
I'll make noise from the boat
to draw it up.

478
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,500
I'm skilled in martial arts.

479
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,980
I'll run away once it's out.

480
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,140
It's been so long.

481
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,460
Why hasn't it appeared?

482
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,220
Didn't you see it?

483
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:39,620
Move to this side.

484
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,700
If you can't see, let me see.

485
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:41,940
Move to this side.

486
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,380
I'm looking.

487
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,020
So annoying.

488
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:45,820
Quit nagging.

489
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:46,620
Fine, fine.

490
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,260
Spotted.

491
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:50,900
It's here.

492
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:51,820
Here it comes.

493
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:52,780
Zoom in.

494
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,180
That clam can fly!

495
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,380
Mu Dai!

496
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,780
Mu Dai! Watch the ground!

497
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,420
Mu Dai!

498
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:11,620
Reverse!

499
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:21,940
This makes no sense.

500
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,780
Winch can't budge it!

501
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:47,860
Mu Dai!

502
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,380
Mu Dai!

503
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:49,860
Go!

504
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,220
Now!

505
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,660
Faster!

506
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,380
Drag it! Harder!

507
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,900
Drag it onto solid ground.

508
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,220
Let's see how this clam fares then.

509
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,060
Workable.

510
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,460
Strand it on the shore.

511
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,300
Almost there.

512
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:31,860
Victory's close.

513
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:31,740
Are you okay?

514
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:38,900
Where is it?

515
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,580
Let's move!

516
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,140
Go.

517
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,580
The car is stuck.

518
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,420
We ran it over
and it's stuck under the car.

519
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,740
Stuck under the car?

520
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:49,740
Now what?

521
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:51,580
What do we do?

522
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,060
This way. Grind it to pulp!

523
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,140
Everyone, get off the car!

524
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:57,620
Get off now!

525
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,020
Get off!

526
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:58,460
I'll go thi way.

527
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,500
No, come this way!

528
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,900
This is your end.

529
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,220
Cao, grab weapons.

530
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:14,980
Take this.

531
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,140
Lift.

532
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,420
Cao.

533
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,820
One, two, three.

534
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,620
Lift!

535
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:46,620
Water.

536
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,420
Relic of ill omen of water.

537
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,140
What is this?

538
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,860
Let go of me!

539
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:17,860
It fears blood!

540
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,860
Blood? Where am I
supposed to get blood?

541
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:20,980
Right, I do have blood.

542
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,180
Smear blood on it.

543
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,580
Don't let it get back into its shell.

544
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,260
Go get water!

545
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,500
Now!

546
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,100
Here.

547
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:07,940
Move aside!

548
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:17,740
Harder!

549
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,420
I've researched this.

550
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:32,900
The lake's disappearance

551
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,340
isn't connected to burning clams.

552
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:37,940
It's geological.

553
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,100
I also

554
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,860
inquired about the old chief.

555
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,460
After leaving Wuzhu Village,

556
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:50,060
his mind deteriorated.

557
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,580
One moment he'd be negotiating
with the God of Water,

558
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,780
and the next he'd say he was cursed
with retribution.

559
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,540
Later, he insisted on returning
to the village,

560
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,420
and his condition improved.

561
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,020
It's just that he can't hear
about clams.

562
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,460
The moment he hears that word,

563
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,340
he goes crazy.

564
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,900
But he'll be fine in a couple of days.

565
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,420
Be fine in a couple of days?

566
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,580
What kind of retribution is that?

567
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:32,980
You stay here with her.

568
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:39,900
I'm going home to check.

569
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:07,260
I'll take care of it.

570
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,100
By the way, Mu Dai,

571
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,380
There's something I've been
wanting to ask you.

572
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,940
Back when we fought the clam,

573
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:24,860
I kept calling for you.

574
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,100
Why didn't you respond?

575
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,260
Did you?

576
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,580
I did.

577
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,220
You seemed like

578
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,020
a completely different person.

579
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:36,180
No... I wasn't.

580
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,620
It was when the clam
clamped down on you.

581
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,060
Mu Dai.

582
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,180
How did it end up with you?

583
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:00,740
Here.

584
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:07,740
Master.

585
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:12,140
Thirteen and the Hongsha had it rough.

586
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,540
Should we go comfort them?

587
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:15,780
Don't.

588
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,900
- Let them process it on their own.
- Let them process it on their own.

589
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:52,700
Dad.

590
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:54,580
Mom.

591
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,140
It's been a while
since you've been home.

592
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,260
I brought you back.

593
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,020
From now on, you'll stay with me.

594
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:11,860
We're not coming back.

595
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:19,900
Alright.

596
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,420
Understood, Mr. Kun.

597
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,580
Mr. Kun mentioned

598
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,620
he's setting up some kind of test.

599
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,420
All five of us need to return.

600
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,420
To Lixi.

601
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,540
Not a single one can be missing.

602
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,260
It's fine.

603
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,100
Then I'll go back with you first

604
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,220
before heading to Huacheng.

605
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,340
Where's Thirteen?

606
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:52,420
He's here.

607
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,020
And he's got a tail.

608
00:41:59,180 --> 00:41:59,860
Jiang Zhao.

609
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,420
Jiang Zhao!

610
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:05,820
Jiang Zhao.

611
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,860
I know I failed you.

612
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:11,060
I failed your family.

613
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:14,860
All these years, I've worried about you,

614
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,780
wondering if a child like you

615
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:19,180
could survive out there on your own.

616
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,260
I know I'm guilty.

617
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,340
The village's destruction

618
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,420
is my retribution.

619
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:29,820
I beg for your forgiveness.

620
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:32,900
Forgiveness?

621
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:46,020
If I forgive you, will that
ease your conscience?

622
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:46,580
No.

623
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,020
No.

624
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,420
You don't have to forgive me.

625
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:54,860
The one who died was my father.

626
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:58,500
He's been lying in the water
for over twenty years.

627
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,020
You should be asking
for his forgiveness,

628
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:00,940
not mine.

629
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:03,780
He's the one who lost everything.

630
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:06,540
What right do I have
to forgive you in his place?

631
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:07,140
No.

632
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:10,380
I don't deserve your forgiveness.

633
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:15,980
I'm guilty. I'm guilty.

634
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:36,140
I heard

635
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:39,860
that due to geological shifts,

636
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:43,180
a vanished lake has reappeared.

637
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:45,260
The pearl disappearance

638
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:48,100
is due to the ecological destruction.

639
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:50,020
Now that the problem's resolved,

640
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:52,140
once the water returns,

641
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:56,220
the fish, shrimp, and clams
will come back too.

642
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:57,620
And then

643
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:03,060
Wuzhu Village will return as well.

644
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,100
But there will never be

645
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:27,860
Jiang Zhao's family
in Wuzhu Village again.
