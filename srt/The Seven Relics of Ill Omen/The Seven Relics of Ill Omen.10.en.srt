6
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,820
As it turns out,

7
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,460
visions are meaningful.

8
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,020
They indicate the location where
the next relic of ill omen will appear.

9
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,460
But why would they give us hints?

10
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,500
True.

11
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,060
That didn't help them.

12
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:31,780
The hint

13
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,660
got the second relic of ill omen caught.

14
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,220
Well...

15
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,420
Everything in this world
is interconnected.

16
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,660
I suspect the relics of ill omen
might be connected too.

17
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:41,940
So far,

18
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,380
we've deciphered two ancient characters.

19
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,740
One is "blade".

20
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,140
The other is "water".

21
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,740
The characters on the relics of ill omen

22
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,180
seem to show how they cause harm.

23
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,500
Water can't contain them at all.

24
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,740
Is there anything in this world

25
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,700
that can actually trap them?

26
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,340
Um... cement?

27
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,740
Blood. My blood.

28
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:02,740

29
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,540

30
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,940

31
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:13,740
Yeah.

32
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,340

33

39
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,460
I'm sure it'll work.

Congrats,

41

56

Why does this image look so familiar?

57
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,460
It's three chickens fighting a dog.

58
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,140
Am I right?

59
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,980
I'm frightened by your ignorance.

60
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,500
Those are three birds.

61
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,380
The one with a crest and three tails
is Feng, a male phoenix.

62
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,860
The one with two tails and no crest
is Huang, a female phoenix.

63
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,380
The remaining one is Luan.

64
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,660
It's recorded in ancient books

65
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,540
that "Colored in five hues,
it represents the herald of dawn.

66
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:32,780

67

standing on a wooden rack.

79

The wooden rack

81

83
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,780
are the Feng, Huang, and Luan
Mr. Mighty mentioned.

84

also had a dog.

a story from long ago.

00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,660
But your son

192
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,740
gambled big and ran up massive debt.

193
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,980
The property won't cover it.

194
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:00,940
It won't.

195
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,020
But have you not thought

196
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,380
that the Yan family

197
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,620
may have some valuable stones
tucked away?

198
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,500
Great.

199
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,300
That's what I wanted to hear.

200
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,860
If you're ready to hand them over,

201
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,260
this will be much easier.

202
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,180
I will clear the debts
within two months.

203
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,540
But you didn't keep the promises

204
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,380
you made before.

205
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,260
I really don't have much faith left.

206
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,740
By the rules,

207
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,300
I'll be taking this with me.

208
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:33,700
Let's go.

209
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,060
Lengquan?

210
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,820
Why does this place

211
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,540
look so familiar?

212
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,780
"Look" familiar?

213
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,540
When the relic of ill omen
possessed Pingting,

214
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,380
she was humming
folk tunes from Lengquan.

215
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,060
It does look familiar.

216
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:56,900
To my ear.

217
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,420
All right, whatever you say.

218
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,860
The earliest stories I recorded
about the relics of ill omen

219
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,820
were collected around Lengquan.

220
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,300
In studying the relics of ill omen,

221
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,100
Lengquan is an unavoidable stop.

222
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,300
So lately,

223
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,300
I've gone through

224
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,820
the local materials again.

225
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,500
These are the murals from Lengquan.

226
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,540
Take a closer look.

227
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,420
Look carefully.

228
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,500
This style of painting

229
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,660
somehow

230
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,300
resembles the Feng, Huang, and Luan
from the shadows of water,

231
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,060
right?

232
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,500
Am I right?

233
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,940
If you insist on saying that,

234
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,140
I...

235
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:23,740
I'll go with it.

236
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,260
Yes.

237
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,260
Since everyone thinks so,

238
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,460
practice will lead us
to real understanding.

239
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,220
I think

240
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,020
it's time we took a trip to Lengquan.

241
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,700
Wait, who agreed?

242
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,420
Why are we suddenly going?

243
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,380
I haven't... finished yet.

244
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,300
Are you okay?

245
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,220
Here's a reminder.

246
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,020
Be extra careful during this time.

247
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,140
Whenever possible,

248
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,380
stay in a group.

249
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:46,980
What do you mean?

250
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,100
Be careful.

251
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,060
Who knows how many more
relics of ill omen there are?

252
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:53,900
You can keep that.

253
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:56,620
What?

254
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:58,740
Oh, right.

255
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,220
During this time,

256
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:03,060
hold your hands, okay?

257
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,220
Spooky.

258
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,180
Scares me.

259
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:18,820
How is this,

260
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:19,820
Mu Dai?

261
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,500
Have you been watching me?

262
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,700
You came to my house this time

263
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,500
not just to pick up
your paycheck, right?

264
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,100
Was it about
your split personality thing?

265
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,100
I'm telling you,

266
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,900
I think you're just overthinking it.

267
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,860
There's no such thing
as a split personality.

268
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,500
You were just overly frightened

269
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,820
and then forgot things.

270
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,380
So I'm that fragile, huh?

271
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,260
All of you were fine.

272
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,180
I'm the only one who forgets things.

273
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,900
Even if you have a split personality,

274
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,780
there's nothing to worry about.

275
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,700
She didn't hurt you

276
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,500
and even helped you out of danger.

277
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,620
Isn't that a good thing?

278
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,780
Is it?

279
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,780
Now I really think

280
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,060
it's good I didn't end up with Luo Ren.

281
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,460
If he found out,

282
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,980
I can't imagine what would happen.

283
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:11,780
Pingting.

284
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:22,700
Luo Ren.

285
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,020
I think there's still
something wrong with her.

286
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,060
She's much better.

287
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,220
Yeah, indeed.

288
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,660
She doesn't eat people anymore.

289
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:39,500
Luo,

290
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,580
where were we?

291
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,820
You and Mr. Zheng
are opening a restaurant?

292
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:42,980
Keep it down.

293
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,860
People are watching.

294
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,260
Yes.

295
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:52,740
Good.

296
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:54,580
This is good.

297
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,300
And how is that good?

298
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,700
Are you open to investment?

299
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,700
I'd like to buy in.

300
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,380
I'll think about it.

301
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:03,420
Great.

302
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,500
Trying to get a share for nothing, huh?

303
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,020
Come on.

304
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,180
Am I that kind of person?

305
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,220
I may have no money,

306
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,580
but I've got pearls.

307
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:12,820
A pearl?

308
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,380
I didn't notice it,

309
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,180
but there are quite a few in here.

310
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,620
Of course.

311
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,260
Did you see how big that clam was?

312
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,340
There have to be pearls.

313
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,660
I'll have someone collect them.

314
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,460
We can each have one.

315
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,340
There'll be enough for everyone.

316
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,020
We'll all have pearls.

317
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:30,940
- For real.
- Pearls?

318
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,300
We can all be shareholders.

319
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:33,940
Luo,

320
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,060
I should be grateful

321
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,220
to be working here.

322
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,300
But every day, people just call me by

323
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:38,900
"Excuse me."

324
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,500
And I'm like, "Yes?"

325
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:40,940
It's nothing to look forward to.

326
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,220
If I become a shareholder,

327
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:42,860
they'll call me

328
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:43,980
"Chairman."

329
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,020
And I'll be like, "Yes?"

330
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,460
Just imagine that.

331
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:47,820
Excuse me.

332
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,340
- Fair.
- Yes?

333
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,300
Yeah?

334
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,340
Don't you think

335
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,540
Chubby is inspiring?

336
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,380
Inspiring?

337
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:11,700
Him?

338
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,060
His pockets are cleaner than his face.

339
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,380
How much could those pearls
even be worth?

340
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,420
And he wants a share?

341
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,740
You call that inspiring?

342
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,740
That's daydreaming.

343
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,380
Right, call it daydreaming.

344
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,740
At least he dares to.

345
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:37,980
I used to think

346
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,300
his dreams were just talk.

347
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,860
I didn't expect him
to actually stick with them.

348
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,020
You see,

349
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,500
he said he'd stop being a bum,
and he did.

350
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,740
He said he'd learn martial arts,
and he found a master.

351
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,340
He said he'd make money,
and now he's working all over.

352
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,700
Don't you find that admirable?

353
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:55,940
Yes.

354
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,420
I know the past is

355
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,460
like a quagmire.

356
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,580
It drags you down.

357
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:08,900
But I think

358
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,180
if you keep moving ahead,

359
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,580
things will change.

360
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,140
Fine.

361
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,980
Since you've got time
to lecture me with life advice,

362
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,700
why not worry about your own stuff?

363
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,420
What stuff?

364
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,980
You think I didn't notice?

365
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,940
Since the fight with the clam,

366
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,060
you and Lady Dai

367
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,460
have been acting weird,

368
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,100
haven't you?

369
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,180
Here, Pingting.

370
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,300
This is for you.

371
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,540
If you offend someone,

372
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,580
just be humble.

373
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,980
Give them a gift. Say something nice.

374
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,300
Is it that hard?

375
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,220
Try harder.

376
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,460
I'm about to go check out
the storefront.

377
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,620
If it works,

378
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,260
I'll have Mr. Zheng follow up with you.

379
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:31,820
Okay.

380
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,260
If you offend someone,

381
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,100
just be humble.

382
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,500
Give them a gift. Say something nice.

383
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:10,740
Hello, sir.

384
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,860
Looking for something?

385
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,260
A gift or for yourself?

386
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,820
Just browsing.

387
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,980
All items here are unique,

388
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,140
one-of-a-kind singles.

389
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,380
My shop is called Lianyan,

390
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,620
meaning it collects
all the beautiful things of women.

391
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,260
Let me show you something special.

392
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,460
This is the Garment of Amorousness.

393
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,140
It's embroidered with a man and woman,

394
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,500
symbolizing togetherness

395
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:53,940
and happiness.

396
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,940
Why do they not have faces?

397
00:20:58,980 --> 00:20:59,820
It's a bit creepy.

398
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,100
Because in ancient times,

399
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,980
unmarried women

400
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,100
made this for themselves.

401
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,020
They didn't know what
their future husbands would look like,

402
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,340
so they left their face empty.

403
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,620
After marriage,
they'd add the facial features

404
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,740
once they saw their husband.

405
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,180
You can buy this for your girlfriend

406
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,220
and have her embroider your face on it.

407
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,460
But

408
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,460
never mind

409
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,660
if you're single.

410
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,060
I'll pass. The symbolism isn't great.

411
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,740
Like a blind marriage

412
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:25,020
where you don't even know their face.

413
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,460
It's kind of miserable.

414
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,660
You like this?

415
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:42,780
Not really.

416
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,580
Would you be interested

417
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,700
in seeing my shop's most treasured item?

418
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,460
Most treasured?

419
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,380
Lian Shu.

420
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:00,900
Luo Ren.

421
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,980
It surely is treasured.

422
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:26,980
The price

423
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,660
is steep.

424
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:32,780
This pair is

425
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,580
called the forbidden shoes.

426
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,620
Do you know why they have bells?

427
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,220
For the sound?

428
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:42,860
No.

429
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:45,740
The bells are there

430
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,340
to remind women

431
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,020
to walk with grace.

432
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,780
Only if she walks stably enough

433
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,140
that the bells don't make a sound,

434
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,140
can she truly be considered graceful.

435
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:01,700
This pair is

436
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,380
Lotus Blooms with Every Step.

437
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,620
As you walk,

438
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,340
power falls with each step.

439
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,100
The lotus design

440
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,100
then leaves a clear print on the ground.

441
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,140
Each step

442
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,660
blooms a lotus.

443
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,780
188,000 for the two pairs?

444
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,100
No, that's for one pair.

445
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,500
But even if someone's willing to pay,

446
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,740
I might not sell.

447
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,780
I'm waiting for a fated buyer.

448
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,260
A fated pervert, you mean?

449
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,980
Or a fated...

450
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,180
object-fetishist.

451
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,260
Folk culture researchers
don't count, of course.

452
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,460
Miss Lian,

453
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,740
you're a woman,

454
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,740
and yet you praise this stuff?

455
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,500
Aren't these food shackles

456
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,460
for ancient women?

457
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,940
And you put them on display
like treasure?

458
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,980
Things like this

459
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,860
should stay buried in a coffin.

460
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,140
Mr. Luo,

461
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,620
it seems you lack
even the most basic courtesy

462
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,460
and respect.

463
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:23,580
Yeah.

464
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,660
I could tell you'd wanted me gone.

465
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,180
I'll see myself out.

466
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,380
Luo Ren,

467
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,100
[Chubby]
Emergency. Come back now.

468
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,900
We've weathered storms, haven't we?

469
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,340
This little challenge won't stop us.

470
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,900
A small restaurant business
is just a piece of cake.

471
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,860
As long as we work hard together

472
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,740
and give it our all,

473
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,060
we'll be the top of the field.

474
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:11,820
- Sure.
- It's our own business.

475
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,220
Let's do our best.

476
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,180
I'm supporting your dream, Cao.

477
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:14,820
Come on.

478
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,060
It's our dream.

479
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:16,540
Sure.

480
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,460
The second important topic...

481
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:22,860
Get a seat.

482
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:23,660
It's the shareholders' meeting.

483
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,860
"Emergency"?

484
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,180
We're in urgent need of money.

485
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,020
Every second is about a lot of money.

486
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:28,540
Come on.

487
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,580
The second on the list.

488
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,580
Let's come up with a name.

489
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,780
Well,

490
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,780
here's my humble opinion.

491
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:37,660
Shoot.

492
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,460
Dancing Phoenix.

493
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,140
Oh, my.

494
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,300
What a tacky name.

495
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,060
Even my grandpa wouldn't use
a name like that.

496
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:44,620
Seriously.

497
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,820
I actually think it's a good name.

498
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,580
Right, Cao?

499
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,820
Backing me up for once, huh?

500
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,860
How about "Phoenix Pavilion"?

501
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,140
We're the Phoenix Squad, after all.

502
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,300
Sounds good to me.

503
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,500
I like it.

504
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,220
I'll go with my master's choice.

505
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,700
I'll follow Lady Dai.

506
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:09,980
Okay.

507
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,420
Phoenix Pavilion sounds good.

508
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:12,940
Okay.

509
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,660
We've got the name.

510
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,300
Here's to...

511
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,100
Phoenix Pavilion's successful opening.

512
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:18,940
- And prosperity.
- A successful opening.

513
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,220
A successful opening!

514
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:22,660
And

515
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,820
let's wish Mu Dai and me

516
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:25,740
a triumphant mission.

517
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:26,860
You got it.

518
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,060
Bring on the meat.

519
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,820
The bowls are all here.

520
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,220
So my part is done, right?

521
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,460
I'll take off now.

522
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,020
Okay.

523
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,100
Is this gig

524
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,660
from Mr. Yan?

525
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:49,940
Yeah.

526
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,580
He paid extra this time,

527
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,300
starting from fifty grand.

528
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,060
Oh, sorry.

529
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,300
I just finished the chore

530
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,060
and didn't see you.

531
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,900
He's opening his private gem well.

532
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,300
Is he short on money lately?

533
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,060
I don't think so.

534
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,180
How could he lack money
with his big family business?

535
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,660
He's an old-school treasure hunter.

536
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,620
The treasures he keeps to himself

537
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,380
are only for emergencies.

538
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,340
If he's opening a new well,

539
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,900
something must have happened.

540
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,740
Seems he's trying to
leave things behind for Hongsha.

541
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,140
My guess is

542
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,260
since he's getting old

543
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,700
and his son suddenly died,

544
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,180
he's rushing
to make arrangements for Hongsha.

545
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,500
What? I'm doing things here.

546
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,300
Some chicken stuff.

547
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,100
What the heck?

548
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,180
Where is the exact location?

549
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,300
That's what I'm getting to.

550
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,180
I'm speechless with the old guy.

551
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,820
He told me it's in Nanling.

552
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:56,980
And what is that?

553
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,500
It spans several provinces.

554
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,460
I asked him

555
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,540
to give me some specifics,

556
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,180
at least a location.

557
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,540
Guess what he said?

558
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,260
I can't tell you the exact location.

559
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,420
It's the rule of treasure hunting.

560
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,140
Even with Hongsha's help,

561
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,460
you couldn't get anything out of him.

562
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,220
In the end, he mentioned
it was somewhere near Pu Zhai.

563
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,500
Ask more and he clams up.

564
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,500
Let him be.

565
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,020
He even tried to fool you with Nanling.

566
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,740
Nanling and Pu Zhai

568
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,100
Exactly.

569
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,140
That guy

570
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,460
is kind of a pain.

571
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,420
I think so.

572
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,420
But Hongsha kept apologizing,

573
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:35,660
saying "Sorry, Mu Dai,

574
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,580
my grandpa's always like that,

575
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,860
acting all mysterious.

576
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,060
I can't help it either."

577
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,420
Well,

578
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,940
probably he does respect the rules.

579
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,500
Don't you think?

580
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,340

Where's my kitty hair tie?

582
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,340
I'll go see if Hongsha has it.

Hurry back after the job's done.

584
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:13,660
We've got the ribbon to cut

585
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,500
and a ton of other stuff to deal with.

586
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,340
All right.

587
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,500
We'll open the business when I get back.

588

589
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,260
She's leaving. Say something.

590
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,540
Where's there to say between me and her?

591
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:25,860
Let's work well together.

592
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,100
Um...

We're making money together.

594

Stay united.

595
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,060
Yeah, yeah.

596

Here's a gift for you.

601
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:41,860
Take it.

602
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:42,700
A gift?

603
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:48,060
You lost your dagger when saving me.

604
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,220
I've got money now,

609
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:03,860
What?

610
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,660
Didn't expect me to say hello?

611
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,020
We got to know each other, after all.

612
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,260
These pastries are really good.

I own the shop called Lianyan
over there.

Hello, I'm Mu Dai.

619
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,340
Luo Ren came to my shop to pick things,

620
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,500
and we talked for quite a while.

621
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,020
What?

622
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,700
He's got quite unique taste.

623
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,460
So I figure his friends

624
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,260
must be interesting people.

625
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,060
Yes, his friends...

626
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,220
Stop by my shop sometime.

627
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,300
I'll make you tea.

643

Aw, my waist. What?

644
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,740
Did you hear the thunder?

645
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:04,660
Thunder?

646
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:09,540
No.

647
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,380
Are you imagining things?

648
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,940
Another vision.

649
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,500
Is there a new relic of ill omen?

650
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,180
Thirteen-Thousand saw a vision again.

651
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,020
There must have been
a new relic of ill omen.

652
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,020
Mr. Kun said not to split up.

653
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,980
You and Hongsha need to
look out for each other.

654
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,780
Heavy rain, deep mountains, a village.

655
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,500
The clues are vague.

656
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:49,140
We'll probably keep seeing
more visions, right?

657
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,140
Pretty much.

658
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,740
If anything happens,

659
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,020
let me know right away.

660
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,420
Don't get me started.

Hongsha's phone

662
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,740
got confiscated by her grandpa.

663
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,700
He said it's "the rules".

664
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,140
I'm not his family,

665
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,460
so he couldn't really get my phone.

666
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,100
But I can't push it too far.

667
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,420
I've got my phone on silent.

668

671
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,820
Has he not told you where?

672

He's tight-lipped.

673
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,060
I can't force it out of him.

674
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,300
I'll see how it goes.

Calm down. Drive carefully.

I talked with the landlord.

697

The rent's not an issue.

Sorry, a second.

I suddenly saw a shadow
outside the window.

707
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,580
Looked like a person.

708
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,220
Was it a man or a woman?

709

Ancient or modern?

710
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,260
Not entirely sure.

711
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,260
Probably modern.

Can you be more specific?

00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,140
Were they standing or sitting?

Facing front or sideways?

716
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,700
The person was standing,

717
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,140
holding something long

718
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,140
in one hand.

719
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,220
The other arm was carrying...

00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,220
Carrying what?

721
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,260
A basket.

722
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,900
You said she was holding something long.

723
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,220
Was it a broom?

Yes.

This is called Sunny Doll.

733
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,820
It dates back to ancient times.

734
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,300
People used it to pray for the rain
to stop and sky to clear.

735
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,340
In the north,
it's called “Sky-Sweeping Doll.”

Not quite.

Some hold the broom high,

741

others let it hang low.

742
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,940
It's region-specific.

743
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:22,980
There's no standard look.

744
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:23,860
So,

Can't remember the exact place.

Somewhere with lots of rain for sure.

748
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,780
People want to sweep away the rain deity
when it rains too much.

00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,020
there's no road ahead.

756
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,380
Luo!

757
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:36,860
I saw a vision.

758
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,380
It's a well.

759
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:46,020
[Rough Amber]

760
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:48,920
[Greed runs as deep as the abyss.
Endless craving leads to utter loss.]

761
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,580
Grandpa,

762
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,740
are you sure you remember the way?

763
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,180
Yes.

764
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,460
But it's already dark.

765
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,740
When are we going to get there?

766
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:09,820
Almost there.

767
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:11,980
Just follow me.

768
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:13,300
Mountains,

769
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,260
rain, a village, and a well.

770
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,860
None of this helps.

771
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,660
What village doesn't have a well?

772
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:19,780
You tell me.

773
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:21,580
The doll was creepy though.

774
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,220
Oh, my.

775
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,500
You've got guts.

776
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,540
A doll?

777
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,660
- No, wait.
- Isn't it a doll?

778
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,980
You call the corpse a doll?

779
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,020
A corpse?

780
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:34,660
Yeah.

781
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:37,620
Wait, no.

782
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:38,940
Cao Yanhua.

783
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,020
We're not seeing the same well.

784
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,380
What was yours like?

785
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:43,940
In a forest,

786
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,460
a clearing in the middle,

787
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:46,740
there's a well.

788
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:47,780
Real spooky.

789
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:48,980
Filled with stones

790
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,020
and a corpse.

791
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,540
Stones?

792
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:52,660
Yeah.

793
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,740
He's an old-school treasure hunter.

794
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,540
If he's opening a new well,

795
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,780
something must have happened.

796
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,340
A gemstone well?

797
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:19,980
Hey, Luo Ren.

798
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:20,980
You're in danger over there.

799
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:21,980
Don't go into that gem well.

800
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:22,740
There's a relic of ill omen.

801
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,140
What did you say?

802
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,660
Your signal's bad.

803
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:26,540
Mu Dai,

804
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:27,540
wait for me.

805
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:28,820
We'll be right there.

806
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:30,620
Right what?

807
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,100
Slow down, Grandpa.

808
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,700
It's a rough road.

809
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,900
Grandpa!

810
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,140
What?

811
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,460
Pack up, hurry!

812
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,100
- Pack up.
- Pack up.

813
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,020
You're a paid bodyguard.

814
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:14,900
Do your job.

815
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,660
If that had been a wild beast,

816
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,300
I would have died by now.

817
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:20,820
Grandpa.

818
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:34,660
Let's go.

819
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:37,780
Mu Dai,

820
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,300
please don't take it personally.

821
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:41,420
That's what my grandpa is,

822
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,420
a grumpy old man.

823
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,940
He doesn't really mean that.

824
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:45,300
It's okay.

825
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,980
I didn't do my job well.

826
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:47,580
Let's go.

827
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,460
What is it, Grandpa?

828
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:06,620
I hear something.

829
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:19,420
Is that...

830
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,620
Is that a will-o'-the-wisp?

831
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:24,980
Don't talk nonsense.

832
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:32,260
Chubby,

833
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,660
we just got back
and now we're leaving again.

834
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,060
What should we tell Mr. Zhang?

835
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,380
If he finds out,

836
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,580
he will chop us up.

837
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,060
He won't actually kill you,

838
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,740
but if my master and Hongsha
run into a relic of ill omen,

839
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:42,820
they could die.

840
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:43,780
We'll take his yelling.

841
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:44,580
Hurry up.

842
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:52,300
[Mr. Zhang, we got an emergency
and didn't have time to ask for leave.]

843
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,950
[Please dock our pay, and we hope
for your understanding. Cao/Thirteen]
