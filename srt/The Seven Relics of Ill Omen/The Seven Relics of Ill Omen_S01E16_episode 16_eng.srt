1
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,760
   

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,020



3
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,390
   

4
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,960
   

5
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,200
   

6
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,060
Too many people have spoiled you.

7
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,700
That's why you're so weak.

8
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,940
Stop struggling. It won't help.

9
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:20,620
I've taken over your life from right here.

10
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,240
Do you know how you came into being?

11
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,300
Do you know how to live properly?

12
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,240
Let me out. Come on.

13
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,000
Now!

14
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,600
Luo Ren left, huh?

15
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,400
Didn't you have a good conversation?

16
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,060
Not bad.

17
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,340
We've talked things out. What's gone is gone.

18
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,500
Mu Dai.

19
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,280
This is the first time I've adopted a child.

20
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,260
Now, as I think about it,

21
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,420
before I even took good care of myself, I had adopted you.

22
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,860
I wasn't a good example.

23
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,640
Nor did I give you proper guidance.

24
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,950
I'm largely to blame

25
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,120
for what you are now.

26
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,340
What I am now...

27
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,040
What's wrong with me?

28
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,320
I think I'm good.

29
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:45,520
Auntie Hong, you adopted me and took care of me, so I didn't die anyway.

30
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,820
When I was in such big trouble, you didn't abandon me either.

31
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,820
You're better than a lot of mothers.

32
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,380
You don't need to feel guilty.

33
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,600
You don't owe me anything.

34
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,180
Auntie Hong.

35
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,620
Do you think I'm sick?

36
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,900
I don't think so.

37
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:24,060
But if you all think I am, I'm okay with it.

38
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,480
It doesn't matter.

39
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,660
 You don't even know what each other can't get over. 

40
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,540
 You're both dishonest. 

41
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,700
 How can you call it "love"? 

42
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,760
 Zha Ma's mom said 

43
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,320
 my future would be brighter. 

44
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:37,800
 But without you in it... 

45
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,600
 Nothing could ever be bright enough. 

46
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,040
 What if I've already moved on? 

47
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,340
 What would you do? 

48
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,160
 Then I'll pursue you. 

49
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,500
 With everything I've got. 

50
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,940
Luo Ren.

51
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,860
Luo Ren.

52
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,380
- What happened? 
 - Luo Ren.

53
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,420
Mu Dai ran away.

54
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,060
Ran away?

55
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,080
She didn't even take her phone. She just left a note.

56
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,220
   

57
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,720
Fresh fruit.

58
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,480
The last sale before the lights go out.

59
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,160
Buy some if necessary.

60
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,420
Peanuts, sunflower seeds,

61
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,020
beer, beverages, and fresh fruit.

62
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,820
- Excuse me. 
 - Hi, Miss.

63
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,020
What would you like?

64
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,440
- How much is this? 
 - 30 yuan per box.

65
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,060
Okay. Thanks.

66
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,240
Peanuts, sunflower seeds.

67
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,740
Help!

68
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,540
Let me go!

69
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,300
Let me go!

70
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,940
Get your hands off me!

71
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,660
Let me go!

72
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,060
Stop struggling.

73
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,740
Don't make a sound.

74
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,940
What's going on here? You disturbed others. You know?

75
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,730
Woman, stay away. Or I'll kill you.

76
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,000
Don't yell. Stop struggling and be quiet.

77
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,120
Come and kill me, then.

78
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,400
Hey, you...

79
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,520
Who is he?

80
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,140
I don't know him.

81
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,100
He stared at me before I boarded.

82
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,880
After I boarded, he moved next to me.

83
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,540
Then he behaved inappropriately in the dark.

84
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,540
Miss, don't trust her.

85
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,560
She's my girlfriend. We were arguing.

86
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,740
You guys go back to sleep.

87
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,470
Stop recording. Don't look anymore.

88
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,640
What's going on?

89
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,880
He's lying!

90
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,060
He's not my boyfriend!

91
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,890
I don't even know him.

92
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,480
What's her name?

93
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,272
It's... Her name...

94
00:07:44,272 --> 00:07:47,300
You don't even know her name. Are you really a couple?

95
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,880
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

96
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,280
- Photograph him. Hurry. 
 - Take his photo. Hurry.

97
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,980
Woman, after we get off, you'll be in trouble.

98
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,565
Let me go!

99
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:03,126
Do you know her?

100
00:08:03,126 --> 00:08:05,366
I'm asking you!

101
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,060
I don't know her. I don't.

102
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,700
This guy deserves this.

103
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,360
He's shameless.

104
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,040
The train cop is here.

105
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,623
The police told me that man was a repeat offender.

106
00:08:22,623 --> 00:08:24,164
Now, he's detained.

107
00:08:24,164 --> 00:08:25,825
You helped me heroically.

108
00:08:25,825 --> 00:08:27,785
So, you'd be all right.

109
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:33,000
Just now, I saw your name Mu Dai on the form.

110
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,200
Can I call you Sister Mu Mu?

111
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,340
Okay.

112
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:43,280
Sister Mu Mu, I don't mean harm.

113
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,180
I really want to thank you for helping me out.

114
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,820
Sadly, you ended up here.

115
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,360
Where will you be living tonight?

116
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,480
My auntie and I will get you there.

117
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,780
I don't know where I'll live.

118
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,740
I'm here to look for someone.

119
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,600
You don't know? Will you stay at a hotel?

120
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,480
I can't afford it.

121
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,880
Sister Mu Mu, how about this?

122
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,000
You come home with me.

123
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,360
In the old town, my auntie has a hotpot restaurant.

124
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,560
She offers food, accommodation, and salary.

125
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,720
And she's well-connected.

126
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,300
Maybe she can help you find that guy.

127
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,340
- Zheng Li. 
 - Auntie.

128
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,680
- Are you okay? 
 - Auntie.

129
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,160
I was so scared.

130
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,300
I'm fine, Auntie. She saved me.

131
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,280
She's Mu Dai.

132
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,800
Thank you.

133
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,980
Auntie, you need a kitchen porter, don't you?

134
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,620
I made her a promise.

135
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,060
Just help me with this.

136
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:43,020
That's not just a job. That's a tough job.

137
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,500
- Move. 
 - She's a pretty girl.

138
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,780
- Behave. 
 - Will she do this job?

139
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,260
- How many times? 
 - Come on, Auntie.

140
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,660
She is good at martial arts.

141
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,540
She'll do a good job.

142
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,160
You're just like your father.

143
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,660
You create problems for me.

144
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,780
So, you're saying "yes."

145
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,000
Let's go.

146
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,820
In recent years, there have been fights near the bridge in the development zone.

147
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,080
You girls don't go there.

148
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:47,970
   

149
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,100
   

150
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,100
Come on.

151
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,172
All right. Here we are.

152
00:11:07,172 --> 00:11:08,640
- Here. 
 - This is it.

153
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,400
Let's get in.

154
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,560
Ms. Zheng.

155
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,700
- Hi, Ms. Zheng. 
 - We're back. Come on.

156
00:11:16,824 --> 00:11:20,000
Here. Take a seat.

157
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,680
Zhang'er, bring us the breakfast.

158
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,340
Yes, Ms. Zheng.

159
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,020
Here's the breakfast.

160
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,780
Enjoy the food.

161
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:34,119
Miss Mu Dai, you saved Li.

162
00:11:34,119 --> 00:11:36,840
I'll offer you a job here.

163
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,160
But as you can see, this is a job in the kitchen.

164
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,780
Look. Something like cutting vegetables.

165
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,480
Can you do it?

166
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,200
I don't use a knife that way.

167
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,940
I'm not used to it.

168
00:11:50,029 --> 00:11:51,080
How about this?

169
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,481
You'll work in the hall with Li.

170
00:11:53,481 --> 00:11:56,780
Serve the dishes?

171
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,580
I'm not good at dealing with diners.

172
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,920
How about I wash dishes?

173
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,240
I can do that.

174
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,780
Wash dishes?

175
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,040
Dishes?

176
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,860
You'll do that?

177
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,160
That's great.

178
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,480
A dishwasher just resigned.

179
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,273
I really need a new one.

180
00:12:14,273 --> 00:12:15,452
- Deal, then. 
 - Let's eat.

181
00:12:15,452 --> 00:12:17,400
Eat.

182
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,840
Go ahead.

183
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,240
This is delicious.

184
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,340
These are what Mu Dai had in her childhood.

185
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,160
Any clues?

186
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:32,580
I can't figure out where she has gone.

187
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,520
I asked someone to look around in Wen's hometown.

188
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,840
But Mu Dai isn't there.

189
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,940
There must be traces.

190
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,740
The Phoenix Pavilion is opening today, right?

191
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,940
Won't you go have a look?

192
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,440
I'll go later.

193
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,180
It's pouring outside. Who would come?

194
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,440
Great discount for our opening!

195
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,240
All kinds of cuisines, 
    

196
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,920
barbecue, snacks, and street food with bold flavors!

197
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,780
You'll enjoy everything here!

198
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,980
   

199
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,180
So, this is the propitious day you've picked?

200
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,040
It's pouring.

201
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,220
Who would come here for a mere discount?

202
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,040
Open for business?

203
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,860
Take your seat.

204
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,360
Wow, you have a really good appetite.

205
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,980
You ate a whole piece of lamb chop.

206
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,460
Uncle Kun.

207
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,460
- We're old friends. 
 - Yes.

208
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,000
Let's not be rhetorical.

209
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,560
Just tell me how the food tastes.

210
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,220
- Great, huh? 
 - Nice.

211
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:57,100
You are our first diner.

212
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,580
On this big day, you came to support us.

213
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,420
If I give you free food, you'll be embarrassed.

214
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,300
But anyway, I won't take too much from you.

215
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,180
How about this? When they're out, I'm in charge.

216
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,060
Give me 88 yuan just for good luck.

217
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,100
Go away.

218
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,560
I got off the train and rushed here without stopping.

219
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,740
I traveled really fast.

220
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,020
I walked with long steps.

221
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,580
Why?

222
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,300
50% off on the opening day. 
    

223
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,780
Free for the first three.

224
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,720
Come over here. It's for everybody.

225
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,680
One for each of you. Pick one now.

226
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,200
The white one is good.

227
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,080
It's the Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle you've talked about?

228
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,280
Come on, Uncle Kun.

229
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,480
Bad quality, indeed.

230
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,240
It's just a fake, representing something lucky.

231
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,560
Um... It will help, anyway.

232
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,640
We have too much bad luck. Let's counteract it.

233
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,920
- Thank you. 
 - You're welcome.

234
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,120
This place used to be a warehouse.

235
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,920
But it's a comfortable room.

236
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,520
In you go.

237
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,380
It's small. Please don't mind.

238
00:15:15,004 --> 00:15:17,280
No one uses this bed.

239
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,420
It's messy. Let me tidy it up.

240
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,060
   

241
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,520
 I've got it.  
    

242
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,980
 Everything ends where it starts. 

243
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,280
 So, I decided to go west to Xiagu Pass. 

244
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,600
 Come on, Radishie. 

245
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,380
 Get back Pocketty as soon as you can. 

246
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:53,540
   

247
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,980
   

248
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,932
   

249
00:16:08,932 --> 00:16:12,520
   

250
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,977
   

251
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,800
 I was abandoned by my mother. 

252
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:12,980
 She walked with a sway in her red high heels. 

253
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:19,420
 Later, she took me to the gate of a welfare house 

254
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:22,329
 and gave me a peach. 

255
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:24,025
 Then she left. 

256
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,260
Is it her mother

257
00:17:29,945 --> 00:17:32,065
that she can't get over?

258
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,120
Sister Mu Mu.

259
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,820
Sister Mu Mu.

260
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:41,241
Sister Mu Mu, this is a gift for your new job.

261
00:17:41,241 --> 00:17:43,722
Check it out. See if you like it.

262
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,120
You asked me to find a round building.

263
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,480
I did it for you.

264
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,520
There are only three in Nantian.

265
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,700
Two of them were dismantled.

266
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,460
This is the address of the last one.

267
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:23,430
   

268
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,660
 Don't look at her. 

269
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,160
 She's awful. 

270
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,066
 I warn you. If you look again, I'll claw your eyes out. 

271
00:18:36,066 --> 00:18:37,806
 Focus on cooking. 

272
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,440
Sister Mu Mu, who are you looking for?

273
00:18:46,182 --> 00:18:48,002
I used to live there.

274
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,820
Little bunny. Adorable, isn't it?

275
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,440
I contacted the welfare house.

276
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,900
Mu Dai was too little when she was abandoned.

277
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,840
She couldn't be identified.

278
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,080
They just knew she had a local accent.

279
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,920
So, her hometown wouldn't be far away.

280
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,460
Where is that welfare house?

281
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,380
In Lingui, Lingui Welfare House.

282
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,505
You think she's back in her hometown?

283
00:19:25,505 --> 00:19:27,205
I should go.

284
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,280
Wan Feng Huo, keep an eye on Lingui Welfare House

285
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,645
and check if Mu Dai is around.

286
00:19:36,645 --> 00:19:38,165
Right.

287
00:19:40,113 --> 00:19:41,893
This one looks good.

288
00:19:43,712 --> 00:19:45,700
Send me the video.

289
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,560
I like it, too.

290
00:19:50,249 --> 00:19:53,551
Fiery? Why are you back?

291
00:19:53,551 --> 00:19:55,212
Are you done with family problems?

292
00:19:55,212 --> 00:19:59,280
Not at all. When I heard Mu Dai was missing, I rushed back immediately.

293
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,600
Nothing has been handled. But look at you.

294
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,420
You're watching videos of pretty girls.

295
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,240
How heartless.

296
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,700
Fiery, you are... You're just like your name.

297
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,540
A fiery temperament. Do you eat people?

298
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,320
Yes.

299
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,840
You get us wrong. It auto-played.

300
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,220
- Flip right up. 
 - Yes, just do it.

301
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,960
It's an ad.

302
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,080
News in Lingui?

303
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,740
That's right.

304
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,900
In this digital age, we should look for Mu Dai in a more flexible way.

305
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,380
Understand?

306
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,880
Simply by watching local videos?

307
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,580
This is targeted advertising.

308
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:39,420
Luo Ren asked Wan Feng Huo for help. What can we do?

309
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,440
We have to do something else.

310
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,460
We picked some famous local vloggers and paid them to post for Mu Dai.

311
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:50,060
Know what this is? Powerful networking and Matthew effect.

312
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:54,460
The point is... It's effective.

313
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,260
- Will it help? 
 - He worked really hard on it.

314
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,240
- He did? 
 - He gave gifts to quite a few local anchors.

315
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,140
He's the top-tipping audience.

316
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,560
They'll keep him informed.

317
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,160
I spent money on ads.

318
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,480
Right. The money from the bar.

319
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,320
Uncle Zhang doesn't know yet.

320
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,720
- Go away. 
 - I'll get you some water.

321
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,940
Mu Dai and Luo Ren have been through enough. How did this happen?

322
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,300
I'm so worried.

323
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,380
Glad you're here. Many hands make light work.

324
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,280
I'm thirsty.

325
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,020
Where's the water?

326
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,280
What's wrong?

327
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,520
Come on. She's thirsty.

328
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,440
I think I saw the vision too.

329
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,400
Where is it?

330
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,640
Where?

331
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,040
There.

332
00:22:32,735 --> 00:22:35,440
- Eight fives. 
 - Let me help you.

333
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,600
Are you okay, bro?

334
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,200
- Hey, Bro. 
 - I'm sorry.

335
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,520
Sorry.

336
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,600
Let's go on.

337
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,000
Come on.

338
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,440
Zhang Tong, do it if you're a man.

339
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,500
Stop hesitating.

340
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,720
- Brother Chao. 
 - Zhang Tong.

341
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,760
How could you be such a coward?

342
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,580
It's not going to kill you.

343
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:04,600
Brother Chao, I heard... That's a scary place.

344
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,720
Nonsense!

345
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,200
There's nothing scary.

346
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,920
I've been there.

347
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:13,860
People say... In that place, at midnight,

348
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:17,560
if you put your ear to the platform, you'll hear the heartbeats.

349
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,580
Thump, thump.

350
00:23:20,195 --> 00:23:21,600
- Oh, Zhang Tong. 
 - Hey, girl.

351
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,500
- Come on. 
 - It's you again.

352
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,960
You said you would drink with me.

353
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,040
Drink it up.

354
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,960
- Come on. 
 - Drink it.

355
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,140
- Go ahead. 
 - Go ahead.

356
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,900
Make her drink.

357
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,520
Stop it.

358
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,460
Brother Chao, she said she couldn't drink.

359
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,640
Well, I'll drink for her again.

360
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,640
- Zhang Tong. 
 - Okay?

361
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,580
Hey, you...

362
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,880
Drink this up.

363
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,680
- Do you enjoy it? 
 - Come on. Drink it up.

364
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,680
Be quick.

365
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:57,600
It's okay. It's okay, Li.

366
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,440
Auntie, they did the same thing last time.

367
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,180
What do we do?

368
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,121
I can't help it.

369
00:24:04,121 --> 00:24:06,141
What can I do?

370
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,440
Whose food is this?

371
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,460
Theirs, of course.

372
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,560
I'm not going.

373
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,700
Neither am I.

374
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,700
Should I go?

375
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,140
They'll make fun of me too.

376
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,680
I'm still cooking.

377
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,280
I'll go.

378
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,600
Miss Mu Dai.

379
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,320
What's going on?

380
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,540
Now, a dishwasher serves the dish?

381
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:53,380
The water went into the dish from your gloves. How dirty!

382
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,420
What's going on here?

383
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,520
How can humans eat this? Where's your boss?

384
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,880
- Madam. 
 - Get her out.

385
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,080
Come on.

386
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,720
You're a dishwasher.

387
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,100
What makes you so proud?

388
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,860
Buddies.

389
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,680
Why did you do this?

390
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,820
Come on. Stab me if you dare.

391
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,700
You're noisy. You know?

392
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,600
It's just a mistake.

393
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,640
It must be.

394
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,520
She's new here. She has a quick temper.

395
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,000
Mistake, indeed. She doesn't know the rules. Go.

396
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,520
You go on playing. Go on.

397
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,300
Another crate of beer for them!

398
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,480
Sister Mu Mu, you're amazing.

399
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,560
All right, Brother Chao.

400
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:53,060
Sister Mu Mu, did you work as a guard? You handled it so smoothly.

401
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,040
No. I've never done this before.

402
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,400
Mu Dai, you'll just stay here.

403
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,260
Don't wash dishes tomorrow. I'll get a new dishwasher.

404
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,760
I can be a dishwasher and bodyguard.

405
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:07,360
Okay. I'll give you a pay rise!

406
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,560
Brother Luo.

407
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,000
Brother Luo.

408
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,560
What do you think?

409
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,400
The vision appeared again.

410
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,640
It's the fourth one.

411
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,960
It's coming. Tell us what to do.

412
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,860
Say no more.

413
00:26:38,762 --> 00:26:42,200
Uncle Kun asked us not to stay alone.

414
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,440
But now, Mu Dai is missing, and she's alone.

415
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:50,280
The fourth relic of ill omen is stirring.

416
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,100
You think she's in greater danger?

417
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,600
   

418
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,260
   

419
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,880
 The legend of the Statue is horrible. I don't dare to go. 

420
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,720
 I wonder if I'm okay with the vibe. 

421
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,760
 I want to take photos there. I'm also from Nantian. 

422
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,200
 A lot of people know this place. 

423
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,320
 - My neck feels cold now. 
 - I heard one would be cursed there 

424
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,680
 As if somebody were blowing. 

425
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,720
 - Oh, gosh. 
 - How I wish to see the Flying Horse Statue! 

426
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,040
 It's really quirky there at night. 

427
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,300
 This legend seems influential. 

428
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,620
 I also want to go there. 

429
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,800
 In red high heels. 

430
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,320
 But I don't want to see anything scary. 

431
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,660
Sister Mu Mu.

432
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,080
You scared me.

433
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,585
Am I that scary?

434
00:27:55,585 --> 00:27:59,680
Look. I'm searching for the red high heels you want to know.

435
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,600
I got to read creepy posts from this forum.

436
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,440
Especially the Flying Horse Statue.

437
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,720
It's the scariest.

438
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,840
It was 20 years ago.

439
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,120
Back then, a new district was being developed in Nantian.

440
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,640
The statue of a flying horse was built.

441
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,440
 But shortly after it was finished, there was a change of plan. 

442
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,440
 So, this place became a suburb. 

443
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,960
 Fewer and fewer people came. 

444
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,900
 Gradually, a weird tale was told. 

445
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:33,400
A young couple dated at the Flying Horse Statue.

446
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:38,380
 The man wanted to write some vows on it. 

447
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:42,672
 But just when he finished his name, he heard... 

448
00:28:42,672 --> 00:28:46,280
 Thump... The pounding of heartbeats. 

449
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,320
 There are really heartbeats. 

450
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,020
 Let me hear it. 

451
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:59,120
 Just then, they suddenly felt some air on their necks 

452
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,160
 as if someone was blowing behind them. 

453
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,760
 They didn't dare to look up. 

454
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,252
 They glanced down, 

455
00:29:04,252 --> 00:29:10,200
 only to see a pair of pale woman's legs behind them 

456
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:14,000
 in red high heels. 

457
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:22,680
Sister Mu Mu, don't you think it's scary?

458
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,760
It is, indeed.

459
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,820
Come on. Don't be a buzzkill.

460
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:31,120
This is the most terrifying place in Nantian.

461
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,560
Many people go there to test how brave they are.

462
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:37,500
If you dare to go there at night, you'll be really bold.

463
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,760
Your shoes look the same, huh?

464
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,580
Hey, Sister Mu Mu. Do you have a boyfriend?

465
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,660
Sort of.

466
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:59,160
What does that mean?

467
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,000
Is he handsome?

468
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,560
That doesn't matter.

469
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,560
Sister Mu Mu, tell me about him.

470
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,200
Wrap it up for me.

471
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,280
Okay.

472
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,920
This one.

473
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,280
- I'll take this. 
 - Enjoy the food.

474
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,440
I'll take this too.

475
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,160
- It's for you. 
 - Okay.

476
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,880
Come next time.

477
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,580
- Cash, huh? 
 - Here it is.

478
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,200
Okay.

479
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,980
 Mom. 

480
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,600
 Mom, wait for me! 

481
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,920
 Don't leave me! 

482
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,140
 Look. Look how she's twisting. 

483
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,660
 Look how she's dressed. 

484
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,920
 How shameless. 

485
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,000
 Mom! 

486
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,520
 Mom! 

487
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,560
 Run! 

488
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,600
 Keep running! 

489
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,640
 Fought back, huh? 

490
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,980
 How daring! 

491
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,720
 Don't hit my mother! 

492
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,180
 Mom. Don't hit her. 

493
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,880
May I ask about someone?

494
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,420
Not until you buy some pancakes.

495
00:32:03,984 --> 00:32:06,284
Two radish pancakes, then.

496
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,220
Just two. Keep the change.

497
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,000
What do you want to know?

498
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,200
Was there a round building like a patio right over there?

499
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,100
I used to live there.

500
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,700
Does anybody live there now?

501
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,040
No. It was deserted years ago.

502
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,080
Do you remember the residents?

503
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,880
Who specifically?

504
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,280
A woman in her twenties.

505
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:40,480
She wore red high heels, dressed herself, and wore makeup.

506
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,360
 She loved to sing, too. 

507
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,360
Oh, her.

508
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,520
You know her?

509
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,280
Yes.

510
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,320
She rented a room there and lived with a little girl.

511
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,480
She seduced a lot of men.

512
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,600
Their wives came to quarrel with her.

513
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,240
Her head was even broken.

514
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,960
 In that building, she had the most active romantic life. 

515
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,560
 I knew she would be in trouble someday. 

516
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,200
This woman was really vicious.

517
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,700
Later, she fell sick. Her body was ruined.

518
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,520
 She deliberately wore a scarf to cover her face. 

519
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:14,320
 She moved along as if she were healthy, trying to infect us. 

520
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,800
What was wrong with her?

521
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,440
Nobody knew.

522
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,920
They said she dated freely and later fell gravely ill.

523
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,600
The doctor didn't cure her, and she made a scene.

524
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,520
She stabbed him with a blade.

525
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,200
She looked horrible.

526
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,360
Terrifying, indeed.

527
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,640
What happened later?

528
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,120
She died.

529
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:39,280
She jumped off a bridge near the Flying Horse Statue.

530
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,000
She actually died.

531
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,640
But bad luck stuck in that building.

532
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,480
The residents fought, divorced, and stole.

533
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,360
In the end, nobody dared to mention her name.

534
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,600
Or bad things would happen.

535
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,760
But I'm not scared.

536
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,460
I'm old enough, after all.

537
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:01,480
Poor little thing. I don't know how her daughter ended up.

538
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,480
She had such a bad mother.

539
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,440
Tragedy, indeed.

540
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,680
Going upstairs, huh?

541
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,700
I'll return it later.

542
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,320
- Okay. 
 - Get the laundry back.

543
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,140
- Won't you cook? 
 - No. We'll eat out.

544
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,740
Don't use so much oil.

545
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,960
What a waste!

546
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,400
It's not about the money.

547
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,600
Cooking, huh?

548
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,000
- I'm off duty. 
 - Have a taste.

549
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,480
- You cook very well. 
 - Of course.

550
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,680
There's news.

551
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,400
Hong Sha, there's finally news.

552
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,080
What's wrong?

553
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:33,480
That famous vlogger sent me this, asking if we were looking for her.

554
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,300
Fast forward.

555
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:41,000
Honestly, my master hit him really hard.

556
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,840
That scoundrel would remember this forever.

557
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:49,480
But anyway, it's okay to hit a rogue like that.

558
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,080
Where did the train go?

559
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,000
- Nantian. 
 - Nantian?

560
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,940
I'll go wash my hands. You send this to Luo Ren.

561
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,200
Okay.

562
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,620
- Why will you wash? 
 - When I got the message, I was peeing.

563
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,920
I got some on my hands.

564
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,060
Cao Yan Hua, you make me speechless.

565
00:37:36,935 --> 00:37:39,320
Who? Who's that?

566
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:43,320
You... You... Aren't you the waitress?

567
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,240
Gosh. You walked so silently.

568
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,180
You scared me.

569
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,320
What are you doing?

570
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,840
People say when there's no moon,

571
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,760
heartbeats can be heard here.

572
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:45,120
Chao, I really left my name on the Flying Horse Statue.

573
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,640
If you don't believe me, go check it.

574
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,920
- Fine, fine. 
 - Go check it.

575
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,920
What's wrong? Why don't you move?

576
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:58,380
Brother Chao, I want to pee.

577
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,120
Want to pee, huh?

578
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,920
Come this way.

579
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,480
Brother Chao, this is way too high.

580
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,560
How about we leave?

581
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:21,760
The higher you stand, the farther you'll pee.

582
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,960
- Move. 
 - Brother Chao, I...

583
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,720
You...

584
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,480
Pocketty?

585
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,800
Why did you do that?

586
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,620
Why?

587
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,080
Sister Mu Mu?

588
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,480
Why did you wake up so early?

589
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,240
Did I go out last night?

590
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,060
Last night...

591
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:44,680
Last night, you did go out. You came back late. Don't you remember?

592
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,080
I mean, did I go out after I fell asleep?

593
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:52,760
After... After you fell asleep, how could you go out?

594
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,280
If you mean sleepwalking, I don't know.

595
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,900
I was dead asleep.

596
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:09,010



597
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:21,040
