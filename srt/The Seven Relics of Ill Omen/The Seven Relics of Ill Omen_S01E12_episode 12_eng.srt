00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,060
   

5
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,980
   

6
00:01:21,463 --> 00:01:24,844
Hey, I mean, it's such a huge piece!

7
00:01:24,844 --> 00:01:25,900
I'm not deficient in calcium.

8
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,480
That savage seems attentive.

9
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,500
Why don't you let her cook for you?

10
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,860
Hong Sha, come out for a moment.

11
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,840
Stop staring. Eat up.

12
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,900
What exactly is going on?

13
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,360
My grandpa killed someone.

14
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,480
That savage gets style, and even wears a necklace.

15
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,600
It's called amber, right?

16
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,780
Is it valuable?

17
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,380
Ask the expert.

18
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,200
Let's go.

19
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:25,220
Sir. About the incident last night, do you have anything to say?

20
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,960
Luo Ren. I've told you everything.

21
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,820
My grandpa was scared today.

22
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,800
- Could you not... 
 - He has to say it himself.

23
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,440
You must tell every detail about the murder.

24
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,800
- Murder of what? 
 - Of a human?

25
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,880
Who do you think you are?

26
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,460
- What gives you the right to question me? 
 - The savage came at you!

27
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,460
Brother Luo. How do you tell that the savage came at him?

28
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,640
The savage attacked you at the gem well.

29
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,720
She chased you here and only took you captive.

30
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,440
Didn't you notice that you had always been her target?

31
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,640
With her strength, she can strangle Mu Dai instantly.

32
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,580
Mu Dai wasn't killed not because we got there in time,

33
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,040
but because the savage didn't intend to kill her.

34
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,640
Sir.

35
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,320
Why would a savage keep chasing after you?

36
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,900
What evil deeds have you done here?

37
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,720
That...

38
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,660
That woman...

39
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,840
This has nothing to do with the savage!

40
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,860
Are you sure?

41
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,880
Sir.

42
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,520
You must tell us everything that happened back then,

43
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,300
so we can prepare in advance.

44
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,020
It's the territory of the savage deep in the mountains.

45
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,340
Everybody's stuck here.

46
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,960
Even if you don't care about us,

47
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,300
you have to think about your granddaughter.

48
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,480
Grandpa.

49
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,060
Just tell them.

50
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,780
Grandpa.

51
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,200
Just say it, Grandpa.

52
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,420
More than 20 years ago,

53
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,300
everyone was ready to leave Yueliang Mountain.

54
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,120
But I didn't want to let others know about the gem well I explored.

55
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,360
 So under the cover of night, 

56
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,180
 I went to conceal it. 

57
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,840
 But without vitality, 

58
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,020
 the treasure's aura would be found sooner or later. 

59
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,980
 Right at that time... 

60
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,520
Didn't you say it was a companion who died of illness?

61
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,380
Grandpa, which of your words is true?

62
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:37,720
Consider herself unlucky by entering the mountains alone!

63
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,180
I'll say it again.

64
00:05:44,422 --> 00:05:47,592
That person is a human.

65
00:05:47,592 --> 00:05:50,433
It was a human, not that savage!

66
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,890
Certainly not the savage.

67
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,500
I fought with that savage.

68
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,320
She is full of strength and in her prime.

69
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,440
More than 20 years ago,

70
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,520
she was still a child, wasn't she?

71
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,480
By calculating the age, that's right.

72
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,160
That woman could practically be her mother.

73
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,080
And there were candies and a little rag doll in that basket.

74
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,440
They seemed to be prepared for kids.

75
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,560
But that gem well is remote.

76
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,080
It's so far from the village.

77
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,800
Who would raise their kids there?

78
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,360
At the very least, even if she was out of her mind

79
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,000
and insisted on raising her kid there,

80
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,700
knowing the danger of delivering food to the mountains at night,

81
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,720
why did she do that all alone?

82
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,560
That makes sense.

83
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,700
You killed someone, you know?

84
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,580
Don't skirt around the main point.

85
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,720
I heard that when some families had abnormal and sick babies back then,

86
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:50,780
they would feel ominous and thus throw those babies into the mountains,

87
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,480
leaving them to their own devices.

88
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,240
But some mothers wouldn't bear it,

89
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,040
so they would secretly enter the mountains to deliver food.

90
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,000
If that's the case,

91
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,820
I'm afraid it's not easy for us to get out.

92
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,940
It's me.

93
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,000
It's raining heavily.

94
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,980
Can't fall asleep?

95
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,560
So much has happened recently.

96
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,880
You should get inside and sleep.

97
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,760
I'll keep watch for you for a while.

98
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,100
It's okay.

99
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:25,900
But you... You must be tired along the way.

100
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,340
I can't sleep either.

101
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,380
It was almost the time that I nearly died yesterday.

102
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,120
You are so young. You won't die.

103
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,800
You don't know this.

104
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,200
Death is actually around us.

105
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,400
Just like last night,

106
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,920
if you were late for just a while, I would have died.

107
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,000
Also...

108
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,300
eight years ago...

109
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,700
Eight years ago?

110
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,220
Never mind.

111
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,520
It's all the past.

112
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,200
Just a minor accident.

113
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,440
Luo Ren.

114
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,100
In the future,

115
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,640
if I change into a totally different person,

116
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,720
will you recognize me?

117
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,420
A different person?

118
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,660
How will you change?

119
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,940
Well...

120
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,512
Same appearance...

121
00:09:33,512 --> 00:09:39,260
But the character and behaviors are totally different.

122
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,980
Mu Dai.

123
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,940
Have you ever heard a saying?

124
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,820
Human body cells undergo constant metabolism.

125
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:02,840
It takes seven years for your body to change all its cells.

126
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,200
So in seven years, we will both become brand-new.

127
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,120
We will both change.

128
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,360
Will we?

129
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,380
When I came back from Heisha,

130
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,820
Ping Ting said to me,

131
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:29,860
"Brother Ren, you seem to be a different person."

132
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:35,320
But I think those who really care about you

133
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,420
will recognize you at a glance, no matter how you change.

134
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,720
Because they not only notice the results,

135
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:49,020
but also the reason why you change.

136
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,100
So you'll recognize me, right?

137
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,720
Yes.

138
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,660
Remember your words.

139
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,280
It's a deal.

140
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,020
Words count.

141
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,520
Deal.

142
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,840
Your hand is so wet.

143
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,680
Luo Ren, you are childish.

144
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:39,320
If you ask me, every wrong has its perpetrator.

145
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,970
- What do you mean? 
 - Let's find a chance

146
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,080
to sell Old Yan out.

147
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,020
Where are your character and conscience?

148
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,900
At the very least, he is Miss Rich's grandpa.

149
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,740
It's not righteous indeed.

150
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:56,980
At most, we can only walk fast and leave him behind.

151
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,720
And then...

152
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,200
That will do.

153
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,500
What are you talking about?

154
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,200
We are wondering if we'll meet the savage today.

155
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,700
Yes.

156
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:14,760
Luo Ren, do you think the savage has the third relic of ill omen on her?

157
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,520
Very possibly.

158
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:20,240
Deep in the mountains, the rain, the village, and the Sunny Doll.

159
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,960
Every one of them is here.

160
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,760
And not only was this savage strong,

161
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,940
but she also faked signs along the way, using the Sunny Doll to confuse us.

162
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:32,240
Such intelligence is suspicious.

163
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,320
The clam was hard to deal with.

164
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,860
This time, what we'll face is a live person.

165
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,360
We...

166
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,300
You still have the mood for scenery.

167
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,540
Master, do the relics of ill omen prefer animals?

168
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,640
They took possession of an old clam and then a savage.

169
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,080
Why can't they find a normal person?

170
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,700
Humans are not easy to deal with either.

171
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,600
Sometimes, humans are much scarier than animals.

172
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,420
Why did you stop?

173
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,720
Go away!

174
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,340
Don't hit them.

175
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,460
Run!

176
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,380
Let's go.

177
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,940
Run!

178
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,360
Run!

179
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,920
Hurry and run!

180
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,480
Go away!

181
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,200
It's useless.

182
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,140
Luo Ren!

183
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,640
The savage captured my grandpa.

184
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,380
Let's go.

185
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,420
Mu Dai!

186
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,640
Thirteen-Thousand!

187
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,640
Chubby!

188
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,120
Grandpa!

189
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,440
Luo Ren.

190
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,160
Hong Sha.

191
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,740
Mu Dai.

192
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,880
- Mu Dai. 
 - Mu Dai, are you all right?

193
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,919
- Are you hurt? 
 - No. How about you?

194
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:39,565
 - We are fine.  
 - Good.

195
00:14:40,106 --> 00:14:42,546
Where are Chubby and Thirteen-Thousand?

196
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,560
Wake up.

197
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,000
Wake up...

198
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,340
Where are we?

199
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,360
The savage! Understand?

200
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,240
Understood.

201
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,969
Where is the savage?

202
00:15:57,969 --> 00:15:58,960
She's not here.

203
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,160
Not here?

204
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,320
- Let's go. 
 - Go.

205
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,780
Let's go.

206
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,440
It's a dead end.

207
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,860
There's light there.

208
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,100
- I'll go first. 
 - Wait for me!

209
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,780
Wait for me!

210
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,760
Be careful.

211
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,760
There's no other way.

212
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,840
This won't do.

213
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,720
We can't go down, but they can come up here.

214
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,200
Fortunately, we are high above.

215
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,440
They can hear us when we shout.

216
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,828
Yes. Yes.

217
00:16:36,828 --> 00:16:38,075
Master!

218
00:16:38,075 --> 00:16:39,120
No!

219
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,840
What if the savage hears that?

220
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,140
What to do now?

221
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,338
- What to do? 
 - Brother Thirteen.

222
00:16:54,338 --> 00:16:56,060
Calm down.

223
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,420
The more dangerous it is, the more calm we should be.

224
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,520
Figure out a way.

225
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,440
Use our brains and save ourselves.

226
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,680
- Right. 
 - We can do it.

227
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,440
We can.

228
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,920
Step one, think about what we're good at.

229
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:12,100
I'm good at drawing and mixology, and I can do a little magic.

230
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,560
I... That's all!

231
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,760
What about you?

232
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,800
I'm good at lock-picking.

233
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,560
And?

234
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,960
We are done for.

235
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,560
It's all your fault!

236
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,120
You kept saying we'd be captured by the savage.

237
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,840
- And now it comes to reality! 
 - It's you to blame!

238
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,380
You even said I could marry into her family!

239
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:34,720
- You jinxed it. 
 - Stop it! Mind your words!

240
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,540
Get down.

241
00:17:41,754 --> 00:17:43,060
What's that?

242
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:46,426
A big lump is rushing towards us.

243
00:17:46,426 --> 00:17:48,706
Don't tell me it's the savage.

244
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,880
Let's go.

245
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,560
Let's just fight her.

246
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,160
Okay.

247
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,100
We'll beat her to death!

248
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,260
Stab her to death!

249
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,820
Over there.

250
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,860
Look.

251
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,960
Let go! Let go!

252
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,060
Cao Yan Hua, you can't do this.

253
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,440
Cao Yan Hua, be righteous!

254
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,920
You are no better than me.

255
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,100
I... She smeared leek flowers on my face.

256
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,380
Let me go!

257
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,300
Don't eat me!

258
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,660
Don't eat me! I'm skinny.

259
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,300
Don't eat me.

260
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,845
We've been searching for so long, but we haven't found them.

261
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,980
Will they possibly be...

262
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,500
It's okay.

263
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,720
No news means good news.

264
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,360
They'll be fine.

265
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,420
That's right.

266
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,380
We need to have faith in them.

267
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,040
Although Thirteen-Thousand and Chubby

268
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,780
don't do well in martial arts, they are quite smart,

269
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:07,020
and they always desire to survive.

270
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,620
Your grandpa will be okay.

271
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,060
He has gone through the mill.

272
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,280
I don't think he survived this.

273
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,600
♫  In the deepest night, longing takes shape  ♫

274
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,140
I saw the savage take him away

275
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,680
with my own eyes.

276
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,000
The savage was targeting him.

277
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,020
I hold...

278
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,300
♫  ... I slowly hold you close  ♫

279
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,880
little hope...

280
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,200
♫  The path of growth is inevitably lonely  ♫

281
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,700
for his survival.

282
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:46,760
♫  But someone will light your way like the stars  ♫

283
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:53,320
♫  Perhaps fate is too muddy, through the storm  ♫

284
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,480
Get some food.

285
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:01,300
♫  Stubbornness and courage keep you strong  ♫

286
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:06,525
♫  In the gaps of time within memories  ♫

287
00:23:06,525 --> 00:23:07,560
This is the stockaded village.

288
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,160
The gem well is to the west.

289
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,740
And to the east are the woods where we encountered wasps.

290
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,660
But the Yueliang Mountain is a vast area.

291
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,280
Which direction should we search?

292
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,360
Every time the savage attacked us,

293
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,620
she intended to take your grandpa away without killing him on the spot.

294
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:25,640
It seemed she wanted to take him somewhere.

295
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,560
If the savage is really that woman's child, think about it,

296
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:34,680
when she finally caught the murderer, where would she want to take him the most?

297
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,680
Let's go to the gem well first.

298
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,140
Okay.

299
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,180
Luo Ren!

300
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,360
Who is it?

301
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,700
Hong Sha.

302
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,500
Hong Sha.

303
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,940
What should we do?

304
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,980
I'll go down and check it.

305
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,020
Hong Sha!

306
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,940
Mu Dai!

307
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,300
Mu Dai!

308
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,220
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm okay.

309
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,160
How did you fall?

310
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,900
The rope suddenly broke, and I fell off before I could turn around.

311
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,680
Will Hong Sha be in danger?

312
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,820
No, I have to get up there.

313
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,680
 Mu Dai, take care of Hong Sha. 

314
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,520
 I'll follow it. Maybe I can find Thirteen-Thousand and the others. 

315
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,140
Hong Sha.

316
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,460
Hong Sha?

317
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,140
Wake up, Hong Sha.

318
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,740
Don't come here!

319
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,200
- Hong Sha? 
 - Don't come here!

320
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,200
Mu Dai.

321
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,380
- What's wrong? 
 - I see a ghost!

322
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,760
There are no ghosts.

323
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,520
No... There was.

324
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,080
I saw it.

325
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,660
You're just scared by the savage.

326
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,340
It's not the savage. It was a woman.

327
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,000
Her face was as pale as a dead one.

328
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,400
I couldn't see any vitality in it.

329
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:38,320
And she was white-haired, in tattered clothes.

330
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,720
Her neck seemed to be sealed with some transparent glue.

331
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:49,720
And... there seemed to be melted amber on her neck.

332
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,760
Transparent?

333
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,320
Do you mean you could see through her neck?

334
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,080
It seemed like someone cut it open.

335
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,340
It was mangled!

336
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:06,420
And she suddenly came towards me.

337
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,020
Luo Ren. Are you okay?

338
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,900
I'll talk to you later.

339
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,680
Luo Ren.

340
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,260
Well...

341
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,780
Mu Dai and I just put my grandpa down.

342
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:07,040
But I really couldn't carry him.

343
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:11,240
Could you help me carry him up.

344
00:36:12,907 --> 00:36:14,647
Please?

345
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:19,162
Hong Sha. I'd like to discuss this with you.

346
00:36:20,231 --> 00:36:22,140
Considering the situation now,

347
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,980
it may not be convenient to take your grandpa away.

348
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:29,900
So, can we leave your grandpa's body here for the time being?

349
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,014
I've seen the temperature below.

350
00:36:33,014 --> 00:36:35,335
The body should last for a few days.

351
00:36:35,335 --> 00:36:39,150
When we get down the mountain safely, we'll have his body delivered.

352
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,280
Is that okay?

353
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,826
Okay.

354
00:36:44,826 --> 00:36:48,440
♫  In the deepest night, longing takes shape  ♫

355
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:55,200
♫  With warm memories, I slowly hold you close  ♫

356
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:02,080
♫  The path of growth is inevitably lonely  ♫

357
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:07,980
♫  But someone will light your way like the stars  ♫

358
00:37:08,975 --> 00:37:15,780
♫  Perhaps fate is too muddy, through the storm  ♫

359
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:22,580
♫  Stubbornness and courage keep you strong  ♫

360
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,240
Be careful.

361
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,900
So that weird white-haired woman

362
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:31,300
is the one killed by Hong Sha's grandpa back then, right?

363
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,120
I suppose so.

364
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:44,040
I think it was the relic of ill omen that kept the woman alive.

365
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,520
Have you noticed this?

366
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:50,060
So far, all people or creatures possessed by those relics of ill omen

367
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,800
were greatly strengthened either in body functions

368
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,660
or in vitality.

369
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:58,080
Luo Wen Miao, Ping Ting, and the clam.

370
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,000
So it seems.

371
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,700
But why was there amber on her neck?

372
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:06,540
Hong Sha. Is amber a kind of gem?

373
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,940
What are its characteristics?

374
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:10,580
Amber is a kind of organic gem.

375
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:14,220
It has a low melting point and is relatively fragile.

376
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,720
It can't stand high temperatures and will melt when heated.

377
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,600
Is it possible that she originally wore the amber,

378
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,640
and when the relic of ill omen had an effect on her wound,

379
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,700
some kind of energy released melted the amber?

380
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:26,940
Yes, it is.

381
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:30,720
The amber on her neck was tight-fitting.

382
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,160
It seemed to have solidified again after it melted.

383
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,500
Then this piece...

384
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,660
It's a very thin flake.

385
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,560
There are irregular fractures on it.

386
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,460
Look here.

387
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,080
There are some red lines.

388
00:38:56,080 --> 00:39:00,420
It looks like some flesh and blood were mixed

389
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,220
when the wound was sealed.

390
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:05,600
Then will there be part of the relic of ill omen inside?

391
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,740
Think about this.

392
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:11,260
After the relic of ill omen took effect, the amber melted.

393
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:14,620
The relic of ill omen, the amber, and the flesh and blood coagulated together.

394
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:17,341
Since the piece taken off contains some flesh and blood tissue,

395
00:39:17,341 --> 00:39:19,921
there must be part of the relic of ill omen as well.

396
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,220
Hong Sha, water.

397
00:39:27,144 --> 00:39:28,604
Here.

398
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:43,384
When the amber was on her neck, I clearly saw some words on it.

399
00:39:45,453 --> 00:39:47,513
Why isn't there any?

400
00:39:47,513 --> 00:39:49,013
Take it.

401
00:39:55,865 --> 00:39:57,546
Recently, I've been studying paleography.

402
00:39:57,546 --> 00:40:00,201
This is an ancient character, "human."

403
00:40:00,201 --> 00:40:02,065
This is a rope.

404
00:40:02,065 --> 00:40:07,017
This rope entangled the person pointing upward.

405
00:40:07,974 --> 00:40:09,832
The meaning is obvious.

406
00:40:09,832 --> 00:40:11,892
This character is "hang."

407
00:40:12,846 --> 00:40:14,520
That's right.

408
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:19,800
So, my grandpa was hanged not just because of the woman's revenge...

409
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:24,159
But also because of the ill omen of the relic.

410
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,475
It seems Uncle Kun is right.

411
00:40:30,475 --> 00:40:35,000
Each ill omen of the relic presents a way for the relic to kill.

412
