1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,900
   

2
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:55,000



3
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,290
   

4
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:05,960
   

5
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,960
   

6
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,900
Seven?

7
00:01:31,718 --> 00:01:33,546
Seven?

8
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,140
Seven?

9
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,330
Seven?

10
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:49,141
Three to go.

11
00:01:49,141 --> 00:01:50,971
Glad we have the number now.

12
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,330
The wedding in Cao Village is really glorious.

13
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,130
The feast will last three days.

14
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,660
Yesterday, in the market, the pork was sold out.

15
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,430
The Cao family had bought all of it.

16
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,730
That's right.

17
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:34,200
I heard those who worked outside were on their way back.

18
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,630
Why is Qing Shan so popular?

19
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,230
You don't know, huh?

20
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,960
Villagers there had a kiln for a living.

21
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,960
Over 20 years ago, the kiln exploded.

22
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,330
Qing Shan's parents lost their lives to save others.

23
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,600
The villagers were grateful and took care of him, one way or another.

24
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,030
This time, the whole village contributes to his wedding.

25
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,930
Well, Qing Shan is quite lucky.

26
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,530
A lot of guys work in town.

27
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,860
Only he brought back a wife from there.

28
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,660
I've heard that's a pretty girl.

29
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,530
Taste it.

30
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:08,160
- Can I use it? 
 - Yes.

31
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,541
 Hello? 

32
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:18,200
Thirteen, it's me.

33
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,200
 Brother Cao? How's everything going? 

34
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,900
Here's the thing.

35
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,100
These days, it's been raining heavily.

36
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,400
There are even mudslides and the roads are blocked.

37
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,030
The worst is that the base station is also broken.

38
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:31,700
So now, I have to go a really long way into the village.

39
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,860
What's worse, there's no signal.

40
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,100
 Sounds terrible. 

41
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,660
 Be careful during your investigation. 

42
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,200
 Don't act rashly. 

43
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,630
 Stay alert. 

44
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,200
 Call me every day. 

45
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,630
 If necessary, call the police. 

46
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,300
 There's a phone outside the village, right? 

47
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,225
Yes, I'm using it now.

48
00:03:48,225 --> 00:03:49,400
 Despite the long way, 

49
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,260
 you'll get there, gasping and panting. 

50
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,570
It's easy for you to say.

51
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,530
- How much? 
 - 10 yuan.

52
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,300
- What? 
 - 10.

53
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,430
   

54
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,060
I can't make too many calls, then.

55
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,600
Here's the money.

56
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,060
Let's go.

57
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,830
- Goodbye, Sir. 
 - See you.

58
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,400
Mr. Shi, a bottle of water, please.

59
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,160
And you are...

60
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,760
I'm Jin Hua,

61
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,160
Cao Jin Hua.

62
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,430
Oh, Tubby.

63
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,560
Yes, it's me.

64
00:04:34,584 --> 00:04:36,530
It's been a few years. You look prettier.

65
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:37,940
I do, don't I?

66
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:41,000
Oh, Mr. Shi. Don't call me Cao Jin Hua.

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,230
I've changed my name.

68
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,530
It's Jenny.

69
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,600
- Je... 
 - Jenny.

70
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,500
- Je... 
 - All right, Mr. Shi.

71
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,700
Just call me Cao Janni

72
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,160
- Water, please. 
 - Okay.

73
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,260
How much?

74
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,330
It's on the house.

75
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,560
- You're too kind. 
 - Just enjoy it.

76
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,300
Thanks, Mr. Shi.

77
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,300
I won't keep you long.

78
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,340
Bye, Mr. Shi.

79
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,300
Jenny?

80
00:05:27,955 --> 00:05:29,572
   

81
00:05:29,572 --> 00:05:31,527
   

82
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,300
Be careful on the chair.

83
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,920
Need a table here.

84
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,530
One more table over here, thanks.

85
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:40,600
Right.

86
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,330
Okay.

87
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,460
- Done. 
 - Flowers.

88
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,660
Hey.

89
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,860
Qing Shan.

90
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,730
Come here.

91
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,260
It's me.

92
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,950
Yan Hua!

93
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,860
Why didn't you tell me you were coming back?

94
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,400
I thought you wouldn't come.

95
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,430
Come on. Get in here.

96
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,630
It's been about six years since we last met.

97
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,530
You're getting chubbier.

98
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,700
Did you see your parents?

99
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,300
Here's the thing.

100
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,300
Marriage is a big thing for you.

101
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,900
It's once in a lifetime.

102
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,500
As your cousin, I must come back,

103
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,130
but I won't see my parents.

104
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,900
Only you know I'm back here.

105
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:41,300
It's been so many years after you ran away from your wedding.

106
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,330
Your parents don't mind it anymore.

107
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:46,460
I guess they are decorating the wedding scene in the square.

108
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,600
How about this? We'll go there together.

109
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,660
No, no. Calm down.

110
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,830
I'm back only for two things.

111
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:58,830
First, I want to take a good look at you and give you some lucky money.

112
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,300
Wow.

113
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,730
Aren't you a handsome guy now?

114
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:05,300
Second, I'll meet your wife.

115
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,360
Then, I'll leave.

116
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,860
Fine then.

117
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:13,630
Come on in. Rest and grab something to eat.

118
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,500
I'll lock the door.

119
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,900
You came back here without telling me.

120
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,860
You must've got caught in the rain.

121
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,900
Let's go. It's a sudden rain, indeed.

122
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,300
Yan Hua, the steps are slippery.

123
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,700
Be very careful.

124
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,207
When you were little, you flushed when you met a girl.

125
00:07:34,207 --> 00:07:37,067
Now, you're getting married before me.

126
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,300
I heard you met that girl when you were working in town.

127
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,700
- What's her name? 
 - Ya Feng.

128
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,560
She's pretty.

129
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,380
I don't know why, but she's in love with me.

130
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,750
Don't show off.

131
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,430
Why are both the front and the back doors locked?

132
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,930
They used to be open.

133
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,700
They were open because we had nothing valuable.

134
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,330
But now, things have changed.

135
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,700
It makes sense.

136
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,130
All right. Let's get in.

137
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,530
When I'm done with the trifles, I'll take you to see Ya Feng.

138
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:24,960
She's very shy of people.

139
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,260
Can I see her?

140
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,900
We have a rule, after all.

141
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,430
The bride can't see strangers before the wedding.

142
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:34,100
I know.

143
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,300
But that's a rule from the old generations.

144
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,660
Just don't let them find out.

145
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,530
Besides, you aren't a stranger.

146
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,430
You're my cousin.

147
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,360
Don't worry.

148
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,930
Well, take your time with the food.

149
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,330
I need to entertain some guests out there.

150
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,900
I should go.

151
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,630
Off you go.

152
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:55,200
I'll close the door, then.

153
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:07,630
If your parents forced Qing Shan to write this letter,

154
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:11,047
 he would have left some codes. 

155
00:09:11,047 --> 00:09:12,030
 Look. 

156
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,300
 Nothing looks weird to me. 

157
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,530
 I'll be relieved, then. 

158
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,330
 What's wrong? 

159
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:27,960
 There are traces of some words. 

160
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,400
   

161
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,630
Ya Feng.

162
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,660
Ya Feng.

163
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:11,830
Ya...

164
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,700
Ya Feng.

165
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,900
Ya Feng.

166
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,960
It's me.

167
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,930
I'm Cao Qing Shan's cousin.

168
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,860
Are you abducted?

169
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:46,300
Help me. Get me out.

170
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,200
It's something so serious.

171
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,130
Why did you keep the secret for him?

172
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:34,300
I didn't mean to.

173
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,930
Chubby said there was only one line.

174
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,400
If it was just a prank, telling you wouldn't help.

175
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,400
If it was true, his family would be doing a crime.

176
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,032
And he'd feel ashamed, so...

177
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:47,800
So, he didn't tell you.

178
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,930
How long has he been out of contact?

179
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,900
For 48 hours, I think.

180
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,300
The base station there doesn't work. No signal.

181
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,802
And the wedding thing.

182
00:12:56,802 --> 00:13:00,660
So, I can't reach him.

183
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,460
It's a complicated case.

184
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:07,330
If Chubby mishandles it and the traffickers catch him...

185
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,500
How about this?

186
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,860
I'll ask Wan Feng Huo to inquire about the Cao Village.

187
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,400
If something's fishy, we'll go there.

188
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,930
Okay.

189
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,400
Who painted this?

190
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,300
What's wrong? Are you okay?

191
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,930
Umm... I don't know.

192
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,900
A drunk customer, I guess.

193
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:49,460
You know how they are like. They break up, get divorced, or lose their jobs. Everything.

194
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,400
Maybe someone got drunk and wanted to paint.

195
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,000
Right? Look at the numbers.

196
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,530
No normal guys would write like that.

197
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:58,230
7786, it's...

198
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:02,700
Are you okay?

199
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,060
I'll replace the board later.

200
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,660
I'm fine.

201
00:14:08,763 --> 00:14:11,600
All right. Go back and pack your things.

202
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,560
If we need to go, we must be prepared.

203
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,330
Why did he take a photo?

204
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:33,130
I could do better.

205
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,500
I'll replace it tomorrow.

206
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,830
 Luo. 

207
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,700
Aoki?

208
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,000
So, did you paint the leopard?

209
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,300
 You left a number in such a complicated way. 

210
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,530
 That's not your style. 

211
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:26,630
I tried to find you recently. But you weren't in.

212
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,200
I have an emergency.

213
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,430
Tomorrow night, at the old street.

214
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,860
I won't be available then.

215
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,560
 You decide whether to come or not. 

216
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,830
Did Wan Feng Huo confirm that no one was abducted?

217
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,000
He isn't sure about that.

218
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,830
But he's sure about two things.

219
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,930
First, there will be a big wedding.

220
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,000
A lot of people will attend.

221
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,500
Second, the bride's name is Ya Feng, a girl born and raised in town.

222
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,860
She was a waitress in a food plaza.

223
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,130
Many of her friends will come too.

224
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:18,060
It doesn't sound like an abduction.

225
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,560
Boss Lady Dai.

226
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,600
Did they lure Chubby back for the marriage thing?

227
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,760
What if we arrive and find that he's getting married?

228
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:32,930
Should we offer a gift or save the groom?

229
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:46,800
 Ready to go. 30 kilometers in total. 

230
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,160
 It will take 35 minutes. 

231
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,760
 Turn right in 40 meters. 

232
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,630
Is that village nearby?

233
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,800
No. I'm driving you to the airport.

234
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,230
We'll fly there?

235
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,730
I have an emergency.

236
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,500
I can't go with you.

237
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,660
So, I bought you flight tickets.

238
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,300
Okay.

239
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:11,300
Then, join us when you're done.

240
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,500
Wrong lane. I'll drive back.

241
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,131
No need. We'll get off here.

242
00:17:36,131 --> 00:17:39,050
- Let's go, Thirteen-Thousand. 
 - I'll take the luggage for you.

243
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,500
He didn't tell you that, did he?

244
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,930
You should have asked.

245
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:49,442
Why bother? He didn't want to tell.

246
00:17:49,442 --> 00:17:51,000
Don't say that.

247
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,300
He's your boyfriend. You're in a relationship.

248
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:58,260
Mu Dai, when you get there, we should make contact at least once a day.

249
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,960
I know the base station is broken.

250
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,230
But there's a phone outside the village.

251
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:04,030
You just have to go a long way.

252
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:07,760
When I practiced qinggong, I used to run for a dozen miles before bedtime.

253
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,530
That village road won't scare me.

254
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:10,830
I'll just take it as daily exercise.

255
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,400
I'll give you a call every day.

256
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,240
Let's fix it... at 10 p.m.

257
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,730
What's the look? Let's go.

258
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,360
- Let me walk you there. 
 - No need.

259
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,930
You seem to be very busy.

260
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,800
Do what you have to do.

261
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,930
Boss Lady Dai, you did a good job.

262
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:30,460
You should play hard to get.

263
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:34,030
You must show him you're angry at his changed plan, and you do have a temper.

264
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:37,300
Now, blow the horn.

265
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,900
Take it.

266
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:51,140
- What's wrong? 
 - I forgot to tell you something.

267
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:56,400
I know. You must have something crucial at hand, so you can't go with me.

268
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,400
It's okay if you don't want to tell me now.

269
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,730
I respect your decision.

270
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:04,030
But listen, if you keep it from me

271
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:08,760
because you want to protect me or keep me safe, that's not necessary.

272
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:14,530
If we're going to be in a long relationship,

273
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:17,800
we'll have to go through a lot.

274
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,800
You can't always shield me under your wings whenever we're in trouble.

275
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,700
It won't make me safer this way.

276
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:28,260
Instead, it'll take away my ability to solve any problems.

277
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,380
I want you to have confidence in me, your girlfriend.

278
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:40,430
I can fly with you instead of flying under your protection.

279
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:45,530
Maybe I have stronger wings than yours and can fly ahead to protect you.

280
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:54,600
All right.

281
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,930
Good luck with our trips.

282
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,530
All right.

283
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,930
I should go.

284
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,100
Keep up with me.

285
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,800
How could you...

286
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:35,100
Just then, Bo Yang Zi, the Great Virtuous One...

287
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:40,810
He took up his wooden slips and fought those devils.

288
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:42,800
Just like this.

289
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,700
It was such a fierce and cruel fight.

290
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,600
Then whoosh...

291
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,630
He conquered all those relics of ill omen.

292
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:52,460
Wait.

293
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,560
- It's not right. 
 - Why?

294
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,500
What's in your hand?

295
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,360
It's a pancake.

296
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,930
Indeed.

297
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:04,530
My grandpa said...

298
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:07,030
the Great Virtuous One was holding

299
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,760
the imperishable wood.

300
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,730
Imperishable wood?

301
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,330
What is that?

302
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:23,267
A kind of wood that won't decay in water

303
00:21:23,267 --> 00:21:26,330
or deform in fire.

304
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:29,700
Where does it come from?

305
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,500
Where?

306
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:35,900
The imperishable wood.

307
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,600
Feng and Huang live on it.

308
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,780
Feng and Huang live on it.

309
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,713
Its name is Feng...

310
00:21:44,713 --> 00:21:46,481
Feng... And?

311
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:49,700
Feng... What?

312
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,100
Starts with Feng and ends with Hill.

313
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,130
I can't remember the name.

314
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,530
Feng... Hill.

315
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:00,900
The Great Virtuous One

316
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:08,120
conquered the relics of ill omen and carved on them.

317
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:15,030
One character on each piece to convict them.

318
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:18,760
Are you saying the Great Virtuous One

319
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,800
conquered the relics and carved the characters on them?

320
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:27,100
Then... The... Feng, Huang...

321
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:33,300
The three divine birds, Feng, Huang, and Luan, descended from the sky.

322
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,830
That's right.

323
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,530
That is...

324
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,930
the Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle.

325
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:49,300
With the lock, the relics of ill omen couldn't get away.

326
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,000
Then, they stayed low.

327
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,209
Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle.

328
00:22:54,209 --> 00:22:56,030
The hill.

329
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,900
Can you think of its name?

330
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,900
Yin.

331
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:04,360
Yin.

332
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,830
Feng... Hill.

333
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:15,900
Thank you so much.

334
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,500
- Thank you. 
 - Mr. Qing Shan.

335
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,300
- They're from Yan City. 
 - Thanks.

336
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,967
- From Yan City? 
 - Yes.

337
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:23,660
All right. Kids, go back.

338
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,130
- You can find the candy, right? 
 - Yes.

339
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:26,560
There you go.

340
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,300
Qing Shan.

341
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,600
Long time no see.

342
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,630
You've grown taller.

343
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,500
And you are...

344
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,360
Don't you remember?

345
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,360
Your cousin. Your cousin Cao Yan Hua.

346
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,600
We're his friends.

347
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,860
We traveled here from Yan City.

348
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,730
Oh, I see.

349
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:52,300
Now that my cousin brings back some friends,

350
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,900
his father won't be angry with him.

351
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,260
Well, you know it.

352
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,730
Where's my cousin, then?

353
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:08,500
The village isn't as comfy as the city.

354
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,600
Please make do with it.

355
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,900
Come on. Take a seat.

356
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,600
Have some hot tea and rest for a while.

357
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,430
I'll tell my aunt to get you two rooms.

358
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:25,530
Thanks.

359
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:28,000
I should go.

360
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:38,260
Villagers here don't seem to be fatuous or ignorant of laws.

361
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,830
It's hard to tell.

362
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:42,960
We were led all the way here.

363
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,860
Have you found anything fishy?

364
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,230
Not yet.

365
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:50,730
Guys, be careful with the slippery ground.

366
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:52,460
What are you looking at?

367
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,530
Thanks.

368
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:56,830
Right, put it there. Over there.

369
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:59,940
- It's okay. 
 - Did you see that old man?

370
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:02,600
- The one with gray hair. 
 - Who is he?

371
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,030
- Don't touch that. 
 - Chubby's father.

372
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,860
My wife wanted it to be there.

373
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,860
Qing Shan's parents died at a young age.

374
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:11,200
His uncle Mr. Cao was just like his father.

375
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,200
If...

376
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,030
If Ya Feng is abducted, Mr. Cao must be involved.

377
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:20,530
Maybe, Chubby is being detained because of Ya Feng,

378
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:22,360
but he's the son, after all.

379
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,630
He'll just be kept somewhere.

380
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:24,700
Nothing serious will happen to him.

381
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,330
That makes the two of us.

382
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:30,600
But I'm afraid Chubby didn't make it back home.

383
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,400
Qing Shan looks really honest.

384
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,330
He told me Chubby didn't come back.

385
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:37,160
I trust him, anyway.

386
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,330
But Chubby called me once in the grocer.

387
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:43,160
So, I guess something may have happened to him

388
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:46,130
on his way back to the village.

389
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:48,830
 Oh, the young man. I remember now. 

390
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:53,030
 He arrived just before Tubby. 

391
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,760
 Tubby? 

392
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,700
 Yes. Cao Jin Hua. 

393
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,900
 But she has changed her name to Jenny Cao. 

394
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:03,330
Do you mean Cao Jin Hua did something?

395
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:06,430
I don't think so. They haven't met for about eight years.

396
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:09,800
You know too little about human nature.

397
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,530
Chubby broke off their engagement.

398
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:14,500
It was a big scandal, and everybody knew that.

399
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,600
She must have hated him.

400
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,400
As time went by, she was obsessed.

401
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:24,400
On Chubby's way back to the village, he met Cao Jin Hua.

402
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,200
She then wanted to take revenge.

403
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,400
So, she... She...

404
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,530
I'm not sure, though.

405
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:39,360
Maybe the fifth relic of ill omen is in Cao Jin Hua.

406
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,600
Boss Lady Dai, don't you believe me?

407
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,760
Three relics of ill omen are still out there.

408
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,330
We can't let our guard down.

409
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:48,500
We'd better suspect everyone than neglect any details.

410
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,000
I heard some guests came from Yan City.

411
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,060
They're sort of my homies.

412
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,600
It must be the two of you.

413
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,930
You're so exquisitely dressed.

414
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:58,600
City folks, obviously.

415
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,030
Be seated, please.

416
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,360
Come on.

417
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,700
I'm a local villager.

418
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,600
I've worked in Yan City for five years or so.

419
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,360
I heard some guests came from there. I felt so happy.

420
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,930
So, I came to say hello.

421
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:10,700
Oh, I'm Jenny Cao.

422
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,900
Just call me Jenny.

423
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,400
I live in Heding District of Yan City.

424
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,860
And you? Where do you live?

425
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,523
We?

426
00:27:19,523 --> 00:27:24,400
We live in... Luori District.

427
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,860
Luori District?

428
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,560
The central district.

429
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,800
You must be rich.

430
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:33,030
Oh, how did you know Qing Shan?

431
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:35,900
He barely left the village.

432
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,879
On our... Travels.

433
00:27:37,879 --> 00:27:39,760
Right. We love to travel.

434
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,600
That's great. What does it mean?

435
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,100
It means you have a lot of time and money.

436
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:48,468
People like me who work in the city are just too busy to go traveling.

437
00:27:48,468 --> 00:27:50,600
Do you live near the subway?

438
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,200
Well, I'm sure you have a car.

439
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,300
That's good.

440
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:56,130
Regardless of the bad traffic, you can at least have a seat.

441
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:57,700
- Yes. 
 - That's right.

442
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,752
Well...

443
00:27:59,752 --> 00:28:03,560
Honestly, whether you travel or drive a car,

444
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,960
you're under some kind of a risk.

445
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:11,300
It's normal that some people leave home in the morning but fail to come back.

446
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:15,330
Some people walk on the street and lose their lives out of a blue.

447
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:18,100
What do you think? Am I right?

448
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,500
What do you mean?

449
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,432
I mean...

450
00:28:21,432 --> 00:28:25,900
Accidents happen and we can never predict.

451
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:29,630
A wise person should be prepared.

452
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:30,980
This is my card.

453
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:33,432
You know what? Risks are everywhere.

454
00:28:33,432 --> 00:28:36,860
Just like the storms in nature
that will bring us down.

455
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,430
Insurance. What is insurance?

456
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:43,000
It's the umbrella that shields you from the impending danger.

457
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,572
It can keep you out of the rain and sun...

458
00:28:44,572 --> 00:28:46,841
- I have no money.
- And...

459
00:28:46,841 --> 00:28:49,500
Huh? No money?

460
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,760
In this case, you need insurance more.

461
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,660
Think about illnesses and disasters.

462
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,330
Rich people can handle the problems.

463
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:58,530
What about poor guys?

464
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:01,530
Only insurance can help them.

465
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:05,730
I'm still young. Maybe later.

466
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:07,730
Where are you going, handsome?

467
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:10,600
I... I dropped some peanuts.

468
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,700
Peanuts? We have a lot of them.

469
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,900
Eat as many as you want.

470
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,660
Here. Have some peanuts, pretty.

471
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,060
You know what, pretty?

472
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:21,630
Young age is your advantage when buying insurance.
It gives you a lower rate.

473
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:26,160
People in their 40s have to pay twice the cost of people in their 20s.

474
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,230
- Buy it when you're young.
- Jenny.

475
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:28,430
The earlier, the better.

476
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,540
- Eat some.
- Jenny.

477
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,600
Jenny.

478
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,160
- I think you have a point.
- I do, huh?

479
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,430
I do need some insurance.

480
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:35,130
Do you have a pen?

481
00:29:37,013 --> 00:29:38,683
A pen?

482
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:43,360
Yes. Yes, I do.

483
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,530
Here.

484
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:46,100
Look. Everything's ready.

485
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,030
- Thanks.
- Come on.

486
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:50,860
- There you go.
- My family is strict with me.

487
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:53,030
So, my brother keeps all of my salary.

488
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:56,260
I'm giving you his phone number.

489
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,660
If you need anything, just call him.

490
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,600
So, he'll pay for your insurance, right?

491
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,900
Exactly.

492
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,300
What's his name, then?

493
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,932
His name is Luo...

494
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,960
I'll put it down.

495
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,500
Henry Luo.

496
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,960
- Henry?
- That's right.

497
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,960
My brother is Henry.

498
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:19,460
Handsome, what about you?

499
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,860
Me?

500
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,300
I... That's my brother, too.

501
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,100
She and I share a brother.

502
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,420
We have the same brother. He'll pay.

503
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:30,030
- He'll also pay for your insurance?
- Yes.

504
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,960
- You two have the same brother, huh?
- Yes.

505
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,230
That's great.

506
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:36,630
Three pieces of insurance.

507
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:38,760
Three birds with one stone.

508
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:46,030
I'm taking you to the rooms on the second floor.

509
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:50,600
Qing Shan.

510
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,460
Give me a hand.

511
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:55,500
Be right there. A minute, please.

512
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,171
Do you still suspect Cao Jin Hua?

513
00:31:00,171 --> 00:31:02,701
Is there a relic of ill omen in her?

514
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:07,520
No, unless the fifth one loves to sell insurance.

515
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,760
All right. It's a dead end.

516
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,600
Qing Shan looks clean to me.

517
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,230
So does Jenny Cao.

518
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:17,100
Even the whole village is all right.

519
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,960
Then, where is Chubby?

520
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,900
I think we should see Ya Feng.

521
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,930
She's the key.

522
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,700
Qing Shan, when can we see the bride?

523
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,500
Yes. We want to see her.

524
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,830
In three days, I guess.

525
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,600
The wedding is three days away.

526
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,230
Three days?

527
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:41,630
Well, we have a rule here.

528
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:45,530
Before the wedding, the bride can't see anyone, including her husband.

529
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:47,930
I know. City folks like you find it unnecessary.

530
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:49,160
I quite agree.

531
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,060
But anyway, the older generations insist.

532
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,130
Oh, what a pity.

533
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:56,130
We...

534
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:58,030
We can't see the bride, then.

535
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,060
Yes.

536
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,800
What a pity.

537
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,000
Why?

538
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,530
Because our work needs us back home.

539
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:07,430
We spared some time to come here on behalf of your cousin.

540
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:09,430
Tomorrow, we're leaving.

541
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:12,273
If we can't see the bride, we'll be disappointed.

542
00:32:12,273 --> 00:32:13,430
That's right.

543
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:15,960
What a shame.

544
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,360
How about this?

545
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,630
I'll take you to your rooms.

546
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:22,960
Later, I'll talk to my aunt.

547
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,160
Okay. Thanks.

548
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,030
Come in.

549
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:48,600
Yesterday, Qing Shan told me you came all the way here

550
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,400
just to congratulate the bride and give her some lucky money.

551
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:57,060
We do have this rule, but we can play it by ear.

552
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:02,130
But that young man is male. He can't come.

553
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:04,600
Okay. I'll do it on his behalf.

554
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:11,930
Is the bride staying alone at the back?

555
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:14,600
What about her family?

556
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,930
Ya Feng is a poor girl.

557
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:18,630
She doesn't have a family.

558
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:22,530
I heard some friends of hers would come tomorrow.

559
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:26,100
- Let's go. 
 - How did she meet Qing Shan?

560
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,930
Some time ago, Qing Shan had no work at home.

561
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:31,930
So, he went to town and had a job for three months.

562
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:34,960
Ya Feng and he met over a meal.

563
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,000
Gradually, they fell in love.

564
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,130
Soon, they said they would get married.

565
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:42,260
We also thought it was too quick.

566
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:45,360
But anyway, Qing Shan is at wedding age.

567
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,790
It's good to enter this big life chapter.

568
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:53,000
To think about it, Qing Shan is getting married.

569
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,232
But my son...

570
00:33:55,232 --> 00:34:00,600
Ya Feng, I'm here to see you with Qing Shan's friend from town.

571
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:04,960
Come on.

572
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,560
Ya Feng.

573
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:11,700
Ya Feng.

574
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,460
Ya Feng.

575
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,900
Look at her.

576
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,930
Why is she so shy of people?

577
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:23,330
Ya Feng, she's Qing Shan's friend from town.

578
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:25,160
She wasn't like this before.

579
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:28,630
Maybe the wedding makes her nervous.

580
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,460
Here.

581
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,630
It's for you.

582
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:36,300
Wish you a happy marriage with Qing Shan.

583
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:39,500
Take it.

584
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:42,560
Come on.

585
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:46,260
Ya Feng, just take it.

586
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,100
Well, I saw her and gave her the money.

587
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,230
I'll leave her alone, then.

588
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:06,000
Okay.

589
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:21,025
It's just a dozen-minute walk.

590
00:35:21,025 --> 00:35:23,429
Why bother to ride a camel?

591
00:35:23,429 --> 00:35:25,859
Because I need to walk them.

592
00:35:28,728 --> 00:35:30,498
All right, all right.

593
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:50,400
Here we are.

594
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,060
Wait.

595
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,200
It's not right.

596
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,300
It's a cloudy day.

597
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,900
Why can we still see?

598
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:30,060
That's the magic of the Stargazing Platform.

599
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:33,700
Be it a rainy day or a cloudy day, we can see.

600
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,130
Is it really a stone?

601
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:37,300
It is. It's a stone.

602
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,900
But not an ordinary stone.

603
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:42,860
My grandpa said it fell from the sky.

604
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,730
Meteorite?

605
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:48,000
Oh, gosh.

606
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,430
Such a big meteorite.

607
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:52,230
So big.

608
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:54,330
How rare and precious!

609
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:56,253
Rare and precious!

610
00:36:56,253 --> 00:36:58,180
No. Only the middle part is.

611
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:02,246
The stones around it gradually attach to it as time went by.

612
00:37:02,246 --> 00:37:03,730
I have a question here.

613
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:08,330
You said Bo Yang Zi, the Great Virtuous One, left a stone when he passed by this place.

614
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:11,960
Turns out he didn't leave it, but discovered it.

615
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,232
Also...

616
00:37:13,232 --> 00:37:18,230
Didn't you say there were seven reflection points in it?

617
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:22,500
Why can I see five only?

618
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:24,960
Watch carefully.

619
00:37:25,928 --> 00:37:31,130
It's like when you're looking into the sky, you only focus on the brightest stars.

620
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:33,700
The dimmer ones around them

621
00:37:34,312 --> 00:37:36,142
are usually neglected.

622
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:44,360
Here is one.

623
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:48,985
And another one here.

624
00:37:48,985 --> 00:37:50,600
Seven.

625
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,830
Seven, indeed.

626
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,530
This shape...

627
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,230
What pattern is it?

628
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:20,600
It looks like "seven."

629
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,680
This is...

630
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,660
Tiankui Seven-Star.

631
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,930
What is that?

632
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:29,630
Yin, look.

633
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,260
Forget it. You can't see now.

634
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:34,900
When the sky was studded with stars,

635
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:40,130
ancient people gave a name to the combination of the stars.

636
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:42,300
In the West, these names are star signs.

637
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,860
In our country, they're constellations.

638
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:48,330
Tiankui Seven-Star is one of the 36 constellations.

639
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:52,030
It looks like the ancient character "seven."

640
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,530
It consists of seven stars.

641
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:56,330
Tiankui Seven-Star, seven relics of ill omen.

642
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:59,430
One star for one relic of ill omen.

643
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:02,500
We conquered four.

644
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,530
Three are on the loose.

645
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:08,800
But why are five points lit?

646
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:17,870



647
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:22,820
 'Palm Print' - An Qi 

648
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:27,240
♫  The sky splits the dawn's horizon  ♫

649

♫  It's telling me the end  ♫

666
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,040
♫  (The end) Is about to gently appear  ♫

667
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:55,760
♫  Like a whisper in my mind, a fleeting touch across my face  ♫

668
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,316
♫  Yet I find myself in the dark  ♫

669
00:40:59,316 --> 00:41:03,640
♫  The sky splits the dawn's horizon  ♫

670
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:07,904
♫  It's telling me the end  ♫

671
00:41:07,904 --> 00:41:12,300
♫  (The end) Is about to gently appear  ♫

672
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:19,020
♫  Like a whisper in my mind, a fleeting touch across my face  ♫

673
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:25,480
♫  Yet I find myself in the dark  ♫

674
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:38,800
♫  The sky splits the dawn's horizon  ♫

675
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,930
♫  It's telling me the end  ♫

676
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:47,400
♫  (The end) Is about to gently appear  ♫

677
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:54,360
♫  Like a whisper in my mind, a fleeting touch across my face  ♫

678
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:59,530
♫  Yet I find myself in the dark  ♫
