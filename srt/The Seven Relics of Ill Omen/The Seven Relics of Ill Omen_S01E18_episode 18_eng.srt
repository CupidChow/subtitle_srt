1
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,940
   

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:25,050



3
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,340
   

4
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,080
   

5
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,867
   

6
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,780
Let's get out of here. I feel uneasy here.

7
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,940
What happened to your hand?

8
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,680
It's nothing.

9
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,780
Oh, this was a complete waste of time.

10
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,700
You people just lie through your teeth, huh?

11
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,740
You think you can walk away without even an apology?

12
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,420
This happened so suddenly.

13
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,565
Shouldn't we be forgiven for making a mistake?

14
00:01:36,565 --> 00:01:38,500
A mistake?

15
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,380
You claim it was a mistake when there's surveillance footage.

16
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,000
But what did you say when there was none?

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,540
You called him a murderer.

18
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,280
What gives you the right, huh?

19
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,680
Let's just drop it now that it's cleared up.

20
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,140
Why are you being so relentless, girl?

21
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,380
Drop it?

22
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,460
Why should I?

23
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,660
My friend was framed for no reason.

24
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,700
He's traumatized!

25
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,740
Can you take responsibility for that?

26
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,620
Every single one of you just spews lies without a second thought!

27
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,460
I'm suing you! Just you wait!

28
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,540
Listen to you, running your mouth like that.

29
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,760
The person involved isn't even saying anything.

30
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,700
- Why do you have so much to say? 
 - What, you want a fight?

31
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,460
Bring it on!

32
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,180
What's going on?

33
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,120
You want to throw hands?

34
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,760
- I'm sorry. 
 - I'm sorry.

35
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,600
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,660
Stop right there!

37
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,400
Did I say you could leave?

38
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,220
- Come back anytime. 
 - Why are you stopping me?

39
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,580
- Make yourselves at home. 
 - Enough.

40
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,540
So infuriating.

41
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,740
Let's go.

42
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,640
We need to talk.

43
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,140
Does it have to be here?

44
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,960
That cop just reminded me of something important.

45
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,460
Why was I chasing him?

46
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:57,460
Come on, he threw a hotpot at me!

47
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,020
So, why did he throw a hotpot at you?

48
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,820
He told me he had a dream last night.

49
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,540
He dreamed about... About that Zhang Tong guy.

50
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,660
Then, I made one extra comment.

51
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,100
I shouldn't have run my mouth.

52
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:14,740
I said, "Well, it was just you and that woman on the bridge."

53
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,860
"You didn't kill her, did you?"

54
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,300
The moment he heard that, his face went pale.

55
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,380
Then, suddenly, he flung the hot pot at me.

56
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,300
Shouldn't I chase him?

57
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,200
Then, how did he get those injuries on his face?

58
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,020
He...

59
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,140
This is it.

60
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,320
I chased Ma Chao all the way, tripped,

61
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,700
and my hands were covered in blood.

62
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,700
Then, I pinned him down.

63
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,860
He was writhing in pain.

64
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:49,160
His face had these blisters, like burns.

65
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,320
In this shape.

66
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,440
What is that?

67
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,020
The character "ri"* missing a stroke? 
  (*"Ri" means "sun" in Chinese) 

68
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,400
Looks like a tongue to me.

69
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,700
- A tongue? 
 - Think about it.

70
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,660
The situation with Thirteen-Thousand and Mu Dai is kind of similar.

71
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,180
They said they were the murderers.

72
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,560
So, everyone believed they were.

73
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,980
A few careless words.

74
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,960
Killing with speech.

75
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,600
This is the ancient character for "mouth."

76
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,060
Ancient script?

77
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,480
The relic of ill omen?

78
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,760
Is the relic of ill omen inside Ma Chao?

79
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,320
Now it all makes sense.

80
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,900
The relic of ill omen fears our blood.

81
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,460
That's why his skin had such a severe reaction on contact.

82
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,680
But if the relic of ill omen is inside Ma Chao,

83
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,100
what about Song Tie and Wu Yu Ping?

84
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,420
And there's no way everyone who accused Thirteen-Thousand

85
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,480
has the relic of ill omen inside them, right?

86
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,740
Three o'clock.

87
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,900
Still doing rounds this afternoon?

88
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,300
- You go at three. 
 - All right.

89
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,600
 If someone is possessed by the relic of ill omen, 

90
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,161
 their regenerative abilities far exceed normal humans. 

91
00:05:41,161 --> 00:05:43,781
 There's no way he'd remain unconscious. 

92
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,200
Where's my access card?

93
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,980
Are you okay? Do you need help?

94
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,820
 You didn't get burned, did you? 

95
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,260
Thanks.

96
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,860
What are you doing here?

97
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,160
Don't trust me to handle it?

98
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,700
Having backup is always reassuring.

99
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,140
Is the relic of ill omen inside Ma Chao?

100
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,540
Strange.

101
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,100
It's not inside him.

102
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,560
But there's no trace of it leaving either.

103
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:52,060
Yet he was clearly terrified of Thirteen-Thousand's blood.

104
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm confused.

105
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,480
We'll figure it out.

106
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,540
That optimistic?

107
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,780
Or else?

108
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,280
It's always like this.

109
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,680
From complete obscurity to unraveling the threads.

110
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,860
The truth always comes to light.

111
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,940
Here, An An.

112
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,180
Have some more.

113
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,620
Look how thin you are.

114
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:15,580
You need to eat more to grow tall.

115
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,140
Open your mouth.

116
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,260
One more bite. One more.

117
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,900
 Mom, I'm hungry. 

118
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,200
 Are you a bottomless pit? 

119
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,940
 You just ate lunch! 

120
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,000
 But I'm still hungry. 

121
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,100
 Look over there. Go stand over there. 

122
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,420
 Stand over there. 

123
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,900
 Go! 

124
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,100
 What a deadweight. 

125
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,980
 Unbelievable. 

126
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,680
Some kids are precious ones.

127
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,220
Some are just deadweights.

128
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,840
Why?

129
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,980
Maybe...

130
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,080
love comes in measures.

131
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,800
There's just a fine line between trouble and love.

132
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,640
If someone loves you deeply,

133
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,140
no matter how much trouble you cause,

134
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,320
you're still their treasure.

135
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,580
If they don't love you enough,

136
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,660
no matter how well-behaved you are,

137
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,880
you're just a nuisance.

138
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,500
 Get lost! 

139
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,180
 Get out! 

140
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,760
 Out! 

141
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,500
 Mom! 

142
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,720
Here, your favorite fries.

143
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,260
Yes.

144
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,480
Come on.

145
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,420
Have you found your mom?

146
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,620
People told me she's dead.

147
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,200
They said she jumped off a bridge.

148
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,900
After everything that's happened lately,

149
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:08,160
I've come to dread the phrase "they say."

150
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,540
Yes.

151
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,380
Mu Dai...

152
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,140
do you need help?

153
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,540
Having someone else around is nicer.

154
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,740
Don't forget.

155
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,920
We still have our wild card, Wan Feng Huo.

156
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,180
I don't remember her name.

157
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,740
She loved wearing red high heels.

158
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,760
Lived in one of those round buildings in the old district.

159
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,120
But that place has been abandoned for years.

160
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,380
Later, she got sick.

161
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,520
Terminally ill.

162
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,620
She blamed the doctor for not curing her and stabbed the doctor.

163
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,200
This makes things easier.

164
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,700
Nantian isn't big.

165
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,060
We'll start from the hospital.

166
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,860
It shouldn't be hard.

167
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,460
But Mu Dai...

168
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:02,480
have you thought about why you're looking for her?

169
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,960
Does there need to be a reason?

170
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,840
I mean,

171
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,080
are you trying to reclaim lost family ties?

172
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,060
Hoping to reunite?

173
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,660
No.

174
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,200
I just...

175
00:10:17,862 --> 00:10:22,443
I want to return to where I began and see the place I came from.

176
00:10:22,443 --> 00:10:24,623
And maybe ask her why she hated how much I ate,

177
00:10:24,623 --> 00:10:28,728
how I dirtied my clothes, and how I splashed water out of the tub.

178
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:33,320
I tried so hard, eating less, keeping myself spotless,

179
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,813
and wiping the floor dry after every bath.

180
00:10:35,813 --> 00:10:37,993
But she still threw me away.

181
00:10:39,695 --> 00:10:42,120
Love comes in measures.

182
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,060
I know that.

183
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,040
But those words still cut deep.

184
00:10:53,673 --> 00:10:56,420
Heaven gives every child a mother.

185
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:59,640
Why couldn't they come with equal love?

186
00:11:01,498 --> 00:11:03,618
I don't understand.

187
00:11:12,704 --> 00:11:15,244
I won't chop your hands off.

188
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,400
All right, let's go home.

189
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,920
Okay.

190
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,560
Did you have fun today?

191
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,720
Yes.

192
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,680
Want to watch cartoons when we get back?

193
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,120
Yes.

194
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,120
Let's go home.

195
00:11:30,441 --> 00:11:33,582
Mu Dai. It'll get better.

196
00:12:01,613 --> 00:12:03,894
 The relic of ill omen isn't inside Ma Chao. 

197
00:12:03,894 --> 00:12:06,299
 That actually makes sense. 

198
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:11,700
If Ma Chao were a host, he'd be pathetically weak compared to the others we've seen.

199
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,200
Look at you, so sharp.

200
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,780
With those skinny arms of yours, no way you could take down

201
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,240
someone possessed by the relic of ill omen.

202
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,340
I'm lean, not weak.

203
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,180
Could it be a fragment of the relic of ill omen?

204
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,924
A fragment?

205
00:12:22,924 --> 00:12:24,441
Ever heard of "Journey to the West"?

206
00:12:24,441 --> 00:12:28,120
Sun Wu Kong can pluck a hair and create clones of himself.

207
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,600
But they're nowhere near as strong as the original.

208
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,740
So, maybe Ma Chao had something like a fragment of the relic of ill omen on him,

209
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:38,500
which dissipated on contact with your blood?

210
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,540
Hong Sha's theory is interesting.

211
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,481
Then, when was this "fragment" placed on him?

212
00:12:45,481 --> 00:12:46,782
That's the key.

213
00:12:46,782 --> 00:12:50,423
Mu Dai's case seemed premeditated, planned.

214
00:12:50,423 --> 00:12:52,864
But Thirteen-Thousand's was sudden.

215
00:12:52,864 --> 00:12:54,385
No way it was arranged in advance.

216
00:12:54,385 --> 00:12:56,786
So, it had to be done on the spot?

217
00:12:56,786 --> 00:12:58,587
Let's go back and check the surveillance footage.

218
00:12:58,587 --> 00:13:01,134
Might find some clues.

219
00:13:01,134 --> 00:13:05,700
If Hong Sha's theory is correct, should we test  those

220
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:10,040
who accused Thirteen-Thousand and Mu Dai with our blood?

221
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,781
Give me that.

222
00:13:14,781 --> 00:13:16,761
Thanks.

223
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,960
I've already told you everything I know.

224
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,956
I just have some new questions.

225
00:13:36,956 --> 00:13:39,596
Don't worry. You'll be paid.

226
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,540
All right.

227
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,680
Who did this?

228
00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:03,340
Have you seen them before?

229
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,840
I've never met any of these three girls.

230
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,020
Think harder.

231
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,880
I really don't remember.

232
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,840
Last time, you said you had.

233
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,040
Last time?

234
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,600
Do you remember when you went to the bridge?

235
00:14:18,537 --> 00:14:20,677
How many girls were there?

236
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,620
Do you remember their faces?

237
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,720
I've never met any of these three girls.

238
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,920
Think harder.

239
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,280
I really don't remember.

240
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,960
Just as we thought.

241
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:45,040
After contact with our blood, they all retracted their earlier statements.

242
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,960
 Thank you for turning yourself in, cooperating with our investigation, 

243
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,880
 and providing such crucial leads. 
   

244
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,800
We're aware of the recent situation.

245
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,440
Just sign here and you're free to go.

246
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,580
We appreciate your cooperation.

247
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,620
We may contact you again if we have further questions.

248
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,880
Perfect.

249
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,440
Ma Chao is now under police supervision.

250
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,160
Just need to wait for him to wake up.

251
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,080
But, well, my master's name has been cleared anyway.

252
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,240
Congratulations.

253
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,940
Whether Ma Chao wakes up or not doesn't even matter.

254
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,920
Now we just wait for Thirteen-Thousand.

255
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,660
Hope it's good news.

256
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,500
What good news?

257
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,720
How did it go?

258
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,120
What do you think?

259
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,920
The Traffic Management Office refused, saying that regulations forbid showing the footage.

260
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,021
But!

261
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:57,182
Remember who I am?

262
00:15:57,182 --> 00:16:01,380
I switched tactics and went door-to-door

263
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,788
checking security cameras along the street.

264
00:16:03,788 --> 00:16:04,769
And sure enough.

265
00:16:04,769 --> 00:16:07,780
Persistence pays off.

266
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,380
Hand it over.

267
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,320
Pause.

268
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,560
See that?

269
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,720
Everyone's watching the show, except her.

270
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,540
She looks like she doesn't care.

271
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,000
Doesn't care?

272
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,220
If she really didn't care, she wouldn't have gone near it.

273
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:45,160
She clearly approached, then walked away.

274
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,220
Any other angles?

275
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,980
Here. Isn't that her?

276
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,880
Dressed head to toe in red.

277
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,780
Creepy.

278
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:05,160
Yes. Her fashion sense is something else.

279
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,580
It's indeed a bit weird.

280
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:19,680
Do you think the fragment of the relic of ill omen came from the woman in red?

281
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,780
That should be my mother.

282
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,860
Mu Dai, you haven't seen your mother in over 20 years.

283
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:36,640
And the footage is too blurry to make out her face.

284
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,390
Are you sure?

285
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,600
Just a feeling.

286
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,700
In my memories, she always wore red high heels.

287
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,600
Every single pair was red.

288
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,040
And even though I can't see her face clearly,

289
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:52,360
the moment I saw her, I felt something.

290
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,640
Is there anything else I need to do?

291
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,220
You've already done a great job.

292
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,180
So, no.

293
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,780
Stopping so soon?

294
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,760
But I haven't had enough fun yet.

295
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,800
The game shouldn't always be yours to play alone.

296
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,760
Others are waiting for their turn.

297
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,753
Others?

298
00:18:46,753 --> 00:18:50,013
People like me?

299
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,840
Will I get to meet them?

300
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,720
Yes.

301
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,060
Because you're not alone.

302
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,180
One day,

303
00:19:04,736 --> 00:19:07,296
we'll never be apart again.

304
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,780
Ding Guo Hua...

305
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,367
a doctor with a Ph.D. from Changqing Medical University

306
00:19:37,367 --> 00:19:41,167
and the academic leader in dermatology at the county hospital,

307
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,720
quit his job to open a bookstore.

308
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,460
A bookstore?

309
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:52,000
A promising doctor like him just opened a bookstore?

310
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,620
There's more.

311
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,900
Keep reading.

312
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,280
He was stabbed by your mother.

313
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,620
Shortly after, he resigned.

314
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:04,760
But he never pressed charges against her.

315
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,980
Also, your mother's surname is Xiang.

316
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,440
Xiang Si Lan.

317
00:20:17,021 --> 00:20:19,621
Xiang Si Lan?

318
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,940
Would he know where my mother is?

319
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,700
There must be some connection

320
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,700
between him and your mother.

321
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,320
Don't worry.

322
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:54,235
   

323
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,070
   

324
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,281
Storewide 20% off.

325
00:21:17,281 --> 00:21:19,692
Feel free to choose.

326
00:21:19,692 --> 00:21:22,192
Excuse me, is Dr. Ding Guo Hua here?

327
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,140
Who are you?

328
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,900
What do you want?

329
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,720
You're Dr. Ding Guo Hua, right?

330
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,320
What do you want?

331
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,020
We'd like to consult you on some medical matters.

332
00:21:48,417 --> 00:21:50,177
Medical consultation?

333
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,520
This way.

334
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,720
Come on.

335
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,060
Here.

336
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,440
Have a seat.

337
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,460
Who needs medical consultation?

338
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,840
I'm here for my mother.

339
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,140
Who?

340
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,820
I'm here for my mother.

341
00:22:21,999 --> 00:22:23,820
- How long has she been ill? 
 - A long time.

342
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,800
Then, have her come in now.

343
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,320
You treated her before.

344
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,940
Diagnosed her with squamous cell carcinoma.

345
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,500
Said it was terminal. Incurable.

346
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,520
What... What was her name?

347
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,300
Xiang Si Lan.

348
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,100
You treated her before, didn't you?

349
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,420
Do you know where she is?

350
00:22:42,937 --> 00:22:44,517
There!

351
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,640
Xiang Si Lan.

352
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,545
Squamous cell carcinoma.

353
00:22:54,545 --> 00:22:57,600
From diagnosis to prescription. Nothing wrong.

354
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,580
I cured her! I cured her!

355
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,860
Why are you saying I didn't?

356
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,940
You're slandering me!

357
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,460
What do you want?

358
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,680
What are you doing?

359
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,660
Calm down.

360
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,320
I can't say.

361
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,900
If I do, I'll make a mistake.

362
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,780
I can't say.

363
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,280
Dad?

364
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,900
Dad!

365
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,580
I'm his daughter.

366
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,460
Dad, it's me.

367
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,900
Actually...

368
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,245
he's always been ill.

369
00:23:49,245 --> 00:23:55,340
But I'm busy with work, so I keep him with me to look after him.

370
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,620
He rarely has episodes now.

371
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,940
Just gets disoriented occasionally.

372
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:05,140
When he's like that, he insists on treating patients.

373
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,520
People just humor him.

374
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,700
So, when did his condition start?

375
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,540
About 20 years ago.

376
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:18,641
Back then, he began misdiagnosing every patient.

377
00:24:18,641 --> 00:24:21,302
He said whenever he saw medical records,

378
00:24:21,302 --> 00:24:26,520
he felt an uncontrollable urge to lie.

379
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,780
And at the time, he was a renowned doctor.

380
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:33,285
So, he misdiagnosed many people.

381
00:24:33,285 --> 00:24:35,685
Including your mother,

382
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:39,070
Xiang Si Lan.

383
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:00,140
 Well, your condition will only deteriorate. 

384
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,210
 I've done all I can. 

385
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,200
 So, you're saying... 

386
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,260
 it can't be cured? 

387
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:14,460
 Currently, there aren't any better options for your illness in the medical field. 

388
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,744
 It's fine. 

389
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:37,324
 It's all right. 

390
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,740
 It can't be cured. 

391
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,600
What happened after that?

392
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,840
After you found out, did you just let it continue?

393
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:07,520
One night, my father suddenly realized what was happening.

394
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,680
He was horrified.

395
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:13,020
He said he'd take all the misdiagnosed records to the hospital director.

396
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:18,400
But the next day, he was like a different person.

397
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,300
Cunning and shady.

398
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,060
He even tried to keep lying.

399
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:29,540
I was too young back then. I couldn't do anything.

400
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,100
Every day, I just watched him

401
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,540
swing back and forth between those two states.

402
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,020
Your mother was the worst case.

403
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:43,420
Her treatment was delayed until it was too late.

404
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:47,640
Then one day, my father...

405
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,320
 Did you see it? 

406
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,520
 See that? Who is that? 

407
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,800
 Look at her face! 

408
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,500
 - Careful. 
 - Disgusting. 

409
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,180
 How dare you show your face here? 

410
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,980
 She actually has the nerve to come back. 

411
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,320
 Covered up like that. Too ashamed to show your face? 

412
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,120
 You're not leaving until you explain yourself! 

413
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,220
 Tell us the truth! 

414
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,460
 - Explain yourself! 
 - Don't go! 

415
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,640
 - Stop her! 
 - Don't let her go! 

416
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,200
 Behave! 

417
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,820
 You want to see it? 

418
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,500
 Then, take a good look. 

419
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,180
 Listen here, you shameless wretch! 

420
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,720
 What did you put in people's food? 

421
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,860
 Your blood is disgusting. 

422
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:32,000
 Exactly! You being dirty is one thing. 

423
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,460
 But dragging everyone else down with you? That's just evil! 

424
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,360
 You're despicable! 

425
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,860
 You're lying! You're all lying! 

426
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,080
 - Did you see it? 
 - I saw it! 

427
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,120
 - Did any of you see it? 
 - You lifted every lid on those pots. 

428
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,240
 What else could you do? 

429
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,920
 Spat in it or dripped your blood, right? 

430
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,680
 - That's right! 
 - Absolutely! 

431
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,080
 Then, sue me! Have the police arrest me! 

432
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,600
 - We're calling the police! 
 - We're calling them! 

433
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,640
 You claim I spat and dripped my blood. 

434
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,760
 Now I'll... 

435
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,540
 You're vile. 

436
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,905
 Ms. Xiang, put the knife down. 

437
00:28:05,905 --> 00:28:07,900
 No, no. Stay calm. Come on. 

438
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,000
 Your condition is treatable. 

439
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,440
 No, it's not. Not after all this time. 

440
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,740
 Even if it were treatable, it's too late now. 

441
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,800
 It is treatable. I'll find you another doctor. 

442
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,020
 I'll make sure you're cured. 

443
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,080
 Put the knife down. 

444
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:23,420
 This isn't contagious. Stop this! 

445
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,700
 Just go home. 

446
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,460
 It's incurable. Incurable. 

447
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,180
 - What are you doing? 
 - What are you doing? 

448
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,280
 Don't move! 

449
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,940
 Let me go! 

450
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,920
 Let go of me! 

451
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:50,900
 It was urgent. I rushed him to get his wounds treated. 

452
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:54,880
The doctor told me a large patch of skin on his back was missing.

453
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,040
But he'd only been slashed once.

454
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:02,140
So, you never saw her again after that?

455
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:05,180
A long time later, I thought I spotted someone who looked like Xiang Si Lan

456
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,980
near the Flying Horse Statue.

457
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,860
But it couldn't have been her. Her skin was flawless.

458
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,300
The Flying Horse Statue.

459
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,680
The Flying Horse Statue.

460
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:39,440
We're using a thermal imager to detect life signs.

461
00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:46,891
- What's wrong? 
 - Head!

462
00:29:46,891 --> 00:29:47,947
- What? 
 - Head! The head!

463
00:29:47,947 --> 00:29:49,072
- Head? 
 - Yes.

464
00:29:49,072 --> 00:29:54,260
The wind just flattened the grass. And I saw a huge head flash by.

465
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:57,300
- Are you hallucinating, Brother Cao. 
 - No way.

466
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,100
- See it? 
 - A mass.

467
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,380
A head flashed by?

468
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,900
- That's ridiculous. 
 - No way.

469
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,700
You think we're filming a TV drama?

470
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,460
Even if we were, you'd be in charge of comedy.

471
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:10,020
Horror isn't your department.

472
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,720
Was I just imagining things?

473
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,020
Look.

474
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,780
It's Wu Yu Ping.

475
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:23,340
Never thought she had a rebellious youth.

476
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:27,940
Such an honest person actually checked in at the Flying Horse Statue. 
    

477
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,620
Look for the check-in records of Song Tie, Ma Chao,

478
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:32,060
and those who accused Thirteen-Thousand.

479
00:30:32,918 --> 00:30:35,680
- Right. 
 - Ma Chao's here!

480
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,160
Song Tie!

481
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,120
This one. Liu Yi Le.

482
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,478
I remember clearly, like "Happy Children's Day." 
    

483
00:30:42,478 --> 00:30:44,660
He was one of my accusers.

484
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,700
I get it now.

485
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:49,100
Everyone who came to the Flying Horse Statue was touched by the wind.

486
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,420
That wind is the key.

487
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,380
Wind?

488
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:57,400
The illusion caused by the relic of ill omen also started with a strange gust.

489
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:01,480
This wind must be some kind of marker.

490
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,140
People thought they were checking in at the Flying Horse Statue.

491
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,020
Instead, they got checked

492
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:08,240
and tagged with the fragment of the relic of ill omen.

493
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,660
Fragment of the relic of ill omen?

494
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,540
I've got a plan...

495
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,160
to lure it out.

496
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,720
Well, from where I'm standing,

497
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,340
the Flying Horse Statue looks just like a grand altar.

498
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:40,200
Chubby's kneeling there like he's paying homage.

499
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,560
Quite ceremonial.

500
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,100
What kind of plan is this?

501
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,320
Just throwing me to the wolves, huh?

502
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,800
Here it comes.

503
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,440
The head looks bizarre.

504
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,880
It's orange.

505
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,080
The rest is pitch black.

506
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,160
The chest is like a swirling vortex.

507
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,100
Utter darkness.

508
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:20,140
Cao Yan Hua, get down!

509
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,680
After it!

510
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:24,920
Are you okay?

511
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,360
Master.

512
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,360
I'm not okay. Don't leave!

513
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,420
Mu Dai! Stop chasing.

514
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,980
It's gone.

515
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,500
The imager has a limited range.

516
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,560
Don't worry. She might come back.

517
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,200
Let's go.

518
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,660
- Oh, no. 
 - Brother Cao.

519
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,106
- Oh, my gosh. 
 - What's wrong?

520
00:33:04,106 --> 00:33:05,419
- I was hit by the wind. 
 - A stroke?

521
00:33:05,419 --> 00:33:08,720
That was no ordinary wind.

522
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,361
My skull is ice-cold, and my spine's gone numb.

523
00:33:12,361 --> 00:33:14,560
Hong Sha, you're on watch.

524
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,960
Got it.

525
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:21,480
Master, I feel awful.

526
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,740
If I'm right, the fragment of the relic of ill omen is a misnomer.

527
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:27,020
Xiang Si Lan influences people through that cold wind.

528
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:31,460
To put it simply, it's like infecting someone with a virus.

529
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,500
A virus?

530
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,880
Normally, there's no sign.

531
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,520
But once activated, it takes effect immediately.

532
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,100
Virus of the relic of ill omen?

533
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,140
Virus of the relic of ill omen?

534
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:41,200
T-Then we're fine.

535
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,920
We're immune.

536
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,100
Exactly. We've got an edge.

537
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,740
Right. So why are you suffering?

538
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:48,700
Do you still feel that chill in your skull and numbness in your limbs?

539
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,480
I'm feeling much better.

540
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,340
- Go on. 
 - What virus did you just mention?

541
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,580
What's its effect?

542
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,780
An enhanced version of rumor-spreading.

543
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:00,980
It makes the rumor-mongers truly believe their own lies

544
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:04,600
as if they'd personally witnessed or experienced it.

545
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,020
I need to sort this out.

546
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,520
Take my case as an example.

547
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,420
When the car crash happened, there were many people at the scene.

548
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:15,980
Chances are one or two of them had been to the Flying Horse Statue

549
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,440
and were already affected.

550
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,900
Xiang Si Lan was also there.

551
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,160
She immediately activated those people.

552
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,800
Even though they didn't know each other and couldn't have colluded,

553
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,340
they still gave identical testimonies.

554
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,860
Mu Dai's case is similar.

555
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,700
It was even more advanced.

556
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,260
At least you were at the crash site.

557
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:36,000
But Mu Dai wasn't even on the bridge.

558
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,280
Yet Xiang Si Lan still used Mu Dai's image to influence them.

559
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:45,960
So, when Xiao Luo said my master seemed to just appear out of nowhere,

560
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,060
it was image implantation.

561
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:51,000
Even the fiercest won't harm its own.

562
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,320
You're her daughter.

563
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,660
And she used such tactics on you.

564
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,980
You're wrong.

565
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,560
Mu Dai's been away for years.

566
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,340
Xiang Si Lan had no idea of her true identity.

567
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,800
She targeted her simply because

568
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,160
she was exposed.

569
00:35:07,669 --> 00:35:09,190
When was I exposed?

570
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,031
Both you and Zhang Tong came here.

571
00:35:11,031 --> 00:35:12,056
Zhang Tong got infected.

572
00:35:12,056 --> 00:35:13,420
But you remained unaffected.

573
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:16,280
Xiang Si Lan must've seen you as a threat.

574
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,640
And you, your blood got on Ma Chao's face.

575
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,920
 That exposed you, too. 

576
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,000
I was exposed?

577
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,960
So, that's why she pulled out all the stops against us?

578
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,820
Earlier, you said it felt like an altar.

579
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,740
I agree.

580
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:38,880
Those lured by curiosity are seen as worshipping the relic of ill omen

581
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,400
and marked in the process.

582
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,960
All these years, and all these names.

583
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,660
Xiang Si Lan must've frequently wandered around the town, appearing harmless.

584
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:50,200
But no one knows what kind of words she sowed

585
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,880
or what horrors festered from them?

586
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,060
- It's here. 
 - Where? Where?

587
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,260
What's the direction?

588
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:07,360
One o'clock.

589
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,940
Stay with me.

590
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:21,380
Let's pretend to write like this.

591
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,840
A 100 meters away from us.

592
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,440
50.

593
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,720
40.

594
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,000
30.

595
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,100
20.

596
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,640
10.

597
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,120
Mu Dai.

598
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,495
Never thought...

599
00:38:38,495 --> 00:38:41,935
it'd be more fun after he left.

600
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,900
 Mom! 

601
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,320
You deadweight.

602
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:46,140
Why aren't you dead yet?

603
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,840
 Do you know how to live properly? 

604
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,820
 No! 

605
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:09,896
 What are you doing? 

606
00:40:09,896 --> 00:40:12,501
 Some kids are precious ones. 

607
00:40:12,501 --> 00:40:16,240
 Some are just deadweights. 

608
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,705
 Love comes in measures. 

609
00:40:18,705 --> 00:40:20,838
 I know that. 

610
00:40:20,838 --> 00:40:22,938
 But those words 

611
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,560
 still cut deep. 

612
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:40,010



613
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:56,410
 'Palm Print' - An Qi
