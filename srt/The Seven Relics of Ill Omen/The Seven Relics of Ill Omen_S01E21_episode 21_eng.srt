7
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,480
Watches, gold necklaces, gold rings.

8
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,280
Take a look, Sir.

9
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,920
Don't go.

10
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,730
- This one's nice. 
 - Good.

11
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,180
Good.

12
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,660
   

13
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,720
   

14
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,150
Aoki.

15
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,350
It's been ages.

16
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,820
Have you been home...

17
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,510
these past two years?

18
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,207
My friends will never make it back.

19
00:03:39,207 --> 00:03:41,700
I don't deserve to go home.

20
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,570
Luo. I went to Lixi looking for you.

21
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:49,420
You opened a restaurant, became a boss,

22
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,610
and made new friends.

23
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:56,200
I heard you've got yourself a beautiful girlfriend

24
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,430
and that she has a sweet smile.

25
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,660
Congratulations.

26
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,220
And congratulations

27
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,920
on having forgotten us and your adorable little daughter.

28
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,860
You left us behind to live your perfect life.

29
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,780
No, I didn't!

30
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,650
I could never forget! Ever!

31
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,310
 Tasha. 

32
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,340
 - Daddy! 
 - What are you doing? 

33
00:04:24,361 --> 00:04:26,700
 Does it look good? 

34
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,930
 Leopard killed Tasha to force you to comply. 

35
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,020
 Sorry. 

36
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,530
That day, you were shot, delirious.

37
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,260
I thought you were dying.

38
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,380
You said so much to me.

39
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,570
You said you had to come back to your hometown!

40
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,300
That's why...

41
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,360
you just dumped me here?

42
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,820
What's wrong with this place? It's right next to the old street, so lively!

43
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,250
Luo, you should be grateful.

44
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,580
At least, you were still breathing then.

45
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,460
What about them? They were waiting for me to collect their bodies!

46
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,040
Do you think I want to live?

47
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,350
I wish it had been me who died!

48
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,120
Luo. I can't bring myself to remember.

49
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,760
It was too brutal.

50
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,390
I went back to the Leopard's hideout.

51
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,637
 It was like the fight had just ended. 

52
00:06:08,637 --> 00:06:10,717
 Like a haunted house. 

53
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,460
The locals won't go near it.

54
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,850
I remember she took multiple bullets.

55
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,240
You even threw a blade into her eye.

56
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,580
But I never found her body.

57
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,640
She had so many followers.

58
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,930
They...

59
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,310
might've taken it away.

60
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,790
That's what I thought too.

61
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,020
But what if she was still breathing?

62
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,490
What if her people saved her?

63
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:44,360
You know I can't move on

64
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,845
without confirming her death.

65
00:06:47,438 --> 00:06:49,208
So...

66
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,010
I burned the hideout to the ground.

67
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:59,180
I buried their ashes near the cabin where we used to vacation.

68
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,390
 There were no provocations or threats from Leopard. 

69
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,000
After that, I continued to search for any trace of Leopard.

70
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,770
But I got nothing.

71
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,680
It was like she had died too.

72
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,610
Her men joined other factions.

73
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,880
I know.

74
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,560
I checked them all as well.

75
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,500
I thought it was over.

76
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:18,740
Maybe it was time to go home.

77
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,420
I'm exhausted.

78
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,542
I just want to be with Noriko again.

79
00:08:24,542 --> 00:08:26,252
So, Aoki.

80
00:08:27,404 --> 00:08:29,504
Why did you suddenly call me?

81
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,750
What on earth happened?

82
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,490
I think Leopard is still alive.

83
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,940
What?

84
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:52,260
Something strange happened recently.

85
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,690
Yuris' grave was dug up.

86
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:57,650
His ashes...

87
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,810
were scattered everywhere.

88
00:09:02,754 --> 00:09:05,133
Are you sure?

89
00:09:05,133 --> 00:09:08,000
She was badly wounded. How could she have survived?

90
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,300
You know how she operates.

91
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,920
No one else would pull something this despicable.

92
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,880
No wonder you came to me.

93
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,520
If she's alive...

94
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,430
she'll try every way to find me and kill me.

95
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,590
Luo, whatever you think,

96
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,710
I've already made up my mind to seek revenge.

97
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:09,990
I'll leave from Wubang, take a boat to Laima, and then transfer to Bahu.

98
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,880
A speedboat will pick me up.

99
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,330
I'm going to Old Heisha Island.

100
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,800
When?

101
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,940
10 days from now.

102
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,780
Are you coming with me?

103
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,340
Yes.

104
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,360
But on one condition.

105
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,160
This time...

106
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,220
we both come back alive.

107
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,760
Remember, 10 days from now.

108
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:53,900
Luo, neither of us will have peace until Leopard is dead.

109
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,000
It's not just you. Everyone you love

110
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,900
and all your friends will become her targets.

111
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,400
They'll end up like Tasha.

112
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,260
Oh, one more thing.

113
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,230
Noriko and I broke up.

114
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,720
Qing Shan seems honest.

115
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,260
Ya Feng looks trafficked.

116
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,700
And Cao Jin Hua looks like an insurance agent.

117
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,800
One of them is definitely putting on an act.

118
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,180
But I can't figure out who.

119
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,300
Boss Lady Dai, are you really going out?

120
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,400
I promised Luo Ren I'd check in by ten.

121
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,840
Sure you won't come with me?

122
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,960
No.

123
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,700
That's a 10-kilometer round trip. Are you kidding me?

124
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,880
You know martial arts so you can take it as exercise.

125
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,600
But what about me? How am I supposed to keep up?

126
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,060
But I'm a girl.

127
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,160
Walking alone into the mountains in the dark?

128
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,080
I'm scared.

129
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,531
Scared? How rare!

130
00:12:25,531 --> 00:12:27,816
And me? I don't know martial arts.

131
00:12:27,816 --> 00:12:30,177
I'm a slow runner, and I'm a coward.

132
00:12:30,177 --> 00:12:34,680
Sure, I'm a guy, but I'm scared of the dark too.

133
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,520
Well, good luck then.

134
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,200
You're here alone.

135
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,800
I'm not afraid to be left alone. I'm a skilled fighter after all.

136
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,240
But you?

137
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,180
Don't let me find you gone and the bed empty when I come back.

138
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,840
Bye.

139
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,360
You witch.

140
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,760
- Not coming? 
 - No.

141
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,880
- Really? 
 - Yes.

142
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,120
Last chance.

143
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,980
- No. 
 - Don't regret it later.

144
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,180
- Bye. 
 - Bye.

145
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,740
Help!

146
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,700
Help.

147
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:10,000
Help.

148
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,080
Help.

149
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,580
Help.

150
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,160
 No way a scream could carry that far outside. 

151
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,720
 Is someone playing tricks? 

152
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,840
Help!

153
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,260
Chubby? Chubby?

154
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,680
Master.

155
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,820
- Master! 
 - Chubby.

156
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,400
No!

157
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,820
Hello?

158
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:55,614
Listen, Yin Er Ma's grandfather told him

159
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:59,739
the Stargazing Platform can track the movements of the seven relics of ill omen.

160
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,960
Hello?

161
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,405
   

162
00:17:20,405 --> 00:17:21,505
   

163
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,880
Hello?

164
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,680
You mentioned the Stargazing Platform and the relics of ill omen just now.

165
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,880
What's the connection between them?

166
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,320
I suspect the seven relics of ill omen

167
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,060
are linked to Tiankui Seven-Star.

168
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,520
Tiankui Seven-Star?

169
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,420
From an alien world?

170
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,600
That's a bit over the top.

171
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,560
My theory is that each star on the Stargazing Platform

172
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,080
 corresponds to one relic of ill omen. 

173
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,680
 Their brightness indicates whether a relic of ill omen has emerged. 

174
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,980
By that logic,

175
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:01,220
four stars should be shining on the Stargazing Platform.

176
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:04,600
But the truth is, there are five.

177
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,280
Five.

178
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:11,097
 Do you remember that Xiang Si Lan mentioned a man? 

179
00:18:11,097 --> 00:18:15,080
 A man told me to do it. 

180
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:22,525
 He said this game wasn't for me alone. 

181
00:18:22,525 --> 00:18:25,720
 Others were waiting for their turn. 

182
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,860
 Radishie, listen, 

183
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:30,820
 this one might be even harder to deal with. 

184
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:34,280
Did you notice? It actively reaches out to others,

185
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,080
and it changes their thoughts.

186
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,300
That makes it more powerful.

187
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,020
Do you understand?

188
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,100
Did any strange things happen around you guys lately?

189
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,318
What do you mean?

190
00:18:45,318 --> 00:18:46,560
 More advanced. 

191
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,061
 Don't you understand what that means? 

192
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:49,906
It might employ strategy.

193
00:18:49,906 --> 00:18:54,500
Like... Taking the initiative.

194
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,440
   

195
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,260
   

196
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,760
 Why hasn't Mu Dai replied? 

197
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,681
People in love are truly hopeless.

198
00:19:22,681 --> 00:19:25,340
They can talk on the phone forever.

199
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,860
No more waiting.

200
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,580
I'm going to bed.

201
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,720
What an unreliable woman.

202
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,180
She knows I'm scared of the dark, but still leaves me defenseless.

203
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,380
Where am I?

204
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,820
Who's there?

205
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,620
Stay quiet. Don't draw them here.

206
00:21:47,385 --> 00:21:49,843
You... You are...

207
00:21:49,843 --> 00:21:51,743
Ya Feng?

208
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,640
Can you get me out?

209
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,261
Don't trust them.

210
00:22:01,261 --> 00:22:03,480
Just don't trust them.

211
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,260
Leave. Before it's too late.

212
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,580
Boss Lady Dai?

213
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,517
Boss Lady Dai?

214
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,720
Got lucky.

215
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,400
   

216
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:28,300
   

217
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,900
   

218
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:40,607
   

219
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,885
Mr. Shen.

220
00:24:49,885 --> 00:24:51,745
Pass me the bowl.

221
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,420
Is it enough for you?

222
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,680
Yes, sure.

223
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:20,000
Four relics of ill omen subdued, yet five stars lit.

224
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,320
Where's the fifth one?

225
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:43,033
   

226
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,720
 Sorry. The subscriber you dialed can not be connected for the moment. 

227
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,700
 Sorry. The subscriber you dialed can not be connected for the moment. 

228
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,720
 Please redial later. 

229
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,180
 Sorry, the subscriber you've dial... 

230
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,340
   

231
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,900
   

232
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,680
- Hello? 
 -  Hey, Luo Ren. 

233
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,440
 I've wrapped things up here. 

234
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,286
 I'll be heading back to Lixi tomorrow. 

235
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:29,000
I was just about to call you.

236
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,640
Mu Dai and the others seem to have gone missing.

237
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,880
 What happened? 

238
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,000
 From the group chat, I learned she and Thirteen-Thousand went to Cao Village. 

239
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,160
Right. Chubby went missing, so they went to investigate.

240
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:43,151
But now they've lost contact too.

241
00:26:43,151 --> 00:26:44,940
It's been over 10 hours.

242
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,280
- I'm on my way to Cao Village now. 
 -  I'll go with you. 

243
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,960
 I'll arrive later than you. 

244
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,080
It's all right. It'd be better you stay at the base.

245
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,040
If I also go missing, at least there's a backup.

246
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,300
 Hey. Don't jinx it. 

247
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,840
 Send me the location of Cao Village. 

248
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,920
I'll enter the mountains later.

249
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,080
I brought a satellite phone with me.

250
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,720
If I lose contact, you know what to do.

251
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:26,120
Qing Shan, let's set up two more tables before the stage.

252
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,120
Like this.

253
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,800
What do you think?

254
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,060
Oh, I see.

255
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,640
This rain won't let up.

256
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:41,040
What if it doesn't stop by then?

257
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:45,520
Auntie, rain on the wedding day is considered auspicious.

258
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,420
We shouldn't complain.

259
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,220
All right.

260
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:07,780
Excuse me, is Cao Qing Shan home?

261
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,240
Yes. How can I help you?

262
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,080
Are you Cao Qing Shan?

263
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,440
That's right.

264
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,940
I'm looking for my friends.

265
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:25,281
They arrived yesterday. A man and a woman.

266
00:29:25,281 --> 00:29:27,086
Qing Shan, I'll leave you to it.

267
00:29:27,086 --> 00:29:28,627
I'll double-check it.

268
00:29:28,627 --> 00:29:30,008
Thanks, Auntie.

269
00:29:30,008 --> 00:29:32,078
No worries.

270
00:29:32,078 --> 00:29:34,318
Let's talk over here.

271
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:42,500
They're from Yan City and are here to meet my cousin Cao Yan Hua.

272
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,280
- Right? 
 - Yes.

273
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,720
They left early this morning.

274
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,680
- Left? 
 - Yes, they're gone.

275
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,280
They did mention they wouldn't stay long.

276
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,770
But I didn't expect them to leave so soon.

277
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:01,200
They only checked in yesterday.

278
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,900
But when I came by this morning, they had already gone.

279
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,200
And you are...

280
00:30:22,751 --> 00:30:24,792
I'm Luo, also a friend of Cao Yan Hua's.

281
00:30:24,792 --> 00:30:28,160
I was supposed to arrive yesterday but got delayed.

282
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,660
Thought they'd still be waiting for me.

283
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,480
But who knows?

284
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:37,980
This is a big room.

285
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:44,680
My place may be simple, but the surroundings are pleasant.

286
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,900
Indeed.

287
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:50,900
Brother Luo, this rain shows no sign of stopping.

288
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,320
Here's an idea.

289
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,920
Why don't you stay here tonight?

290
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,360
Well, my cousin's friend is my friend.

291
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,100
That's very kind of you to offer.

292
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,460
- Sorry for the trouble. 
 - No worries.

293
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,200
Speaking of which,

294
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,480
were you all invited by my cousin as wedding guests?

295
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:15,020
Why hasn't he shown up yet?

296
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:18,560
Maybe he's saving the surprise for the wedding.

297
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,300
Could be.

298
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,480
Makes sense.

299
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,060
With so many people at the wedding, my uncle wouldn't dare punish him.

300
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,940
Did my two friends talk with anyone during their stay?

301
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:37,400
They did. With Sister Jin Hua.

302
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,920
Sister Jin Hua?

303
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,340
Cao Jin Hua.

304
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,740
They spoke for quite a while.

305
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:47,480
Well, anyone else?

306
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,640
Also...

307
00:31:50,983 --> 00:31:55,280
The girl met Ya Feng.

308
00:31:55,280 --> 00:32:01,280
My aunt told me she gave Ya Feng a red envelope and left.

309
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,450
Sorry.

310
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:07,300
Ya Feng is my fiancée.

311
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,540
Excuse me, is Cao Jin Hua home?

312
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,860
Looking for you?

313
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,980
Is Cao Jin Hua here?

314
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,380
You're Cao Jin Hua?

315
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,600
Could we speak in private?

316
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,505
Just give me a moment. I'll be right there.

317
00:33:37,505 --> 00:33:39,066
Hold on. Just a second.

318
00:33:39,066 --> 00:33:40,946
I'll be right back!

319
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,770
Come in.

320
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,940
Come on in.

321
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:59,244
This is my place. Make yourself comfortable.

322
00:33:59,244 --> 00:34:00,724
Have a seat.

323
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,500
So, what brought you here?

324
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:13,073
Here's the thing. Two days ago, you spoke with two people at Qing Shan's place.

325
00:34:13,073 --> 00:34:15,820
- A man and a woman. 
 - That's right.

326
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,205
And you are?

327
00:34:18,205 --> 00:34:20,880
Oh, I get it. You must be Henry, right?

328
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,280
- Henry? 
 - Yes, their brother.

329
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,400
 Henry Luo. 

330
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,181
 We share the same brother. 

331
00:34:26,181 --> 00:34:27,682
 Her brother is my brother. 

332
00:34:27,682 --> 00:34:29,602
 My brother will pay. 

333
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,640
I heard you guys talk for a long time.

334
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,540
- About what? 
 - Insurance.

335
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:36,320
- Insurance? 
 - Yes, insurance.

336
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,840
The risks lurking everywhere are like storms battering our lives.

337
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,000
And what is insurance?

338
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,200
It's the umbrella over your head when disaster strikes.

339
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,860
It shelters you from wind and rain,

340
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:49,380
- from the scorching sun— 
 - Risks are everywhere.

341
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,440
Did you buy insurance for yourself?

342
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:57,760
I... Well, I did.

343
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,860
How can clients trust me if I don't even buy it myself?

344
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,280
I really did.

345
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:09,400
Here. I'll show you my business promotion materials.

346
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,900
Take a look.

347
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:21,260
Well, you're handsome, but way too impulsive.

348
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,640
So, you only talked about insurance?

349
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,840
Yes, really.

350
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,920
Ask me anything, and I'll tell you.

351
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,500
Oh, right, this phone has a number.

352
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,020
It was left by the girl.

353
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:34,140
She said Henry kept all her money, 
    

354
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,680
and I should talk to Henry about buying insurance.

355
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,540
See for yourself.

356
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,560
Sorry. I may have misunderstood something.

357
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,440
No, no misunderstanding.

358
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,100
- Wait... 
 - Where did they go afterward?

359
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,720
Mrs. Cao said she took the girl to meet the bride.

360
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,440
I wanted to talk to them about their needs,

361
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,000
but Qing Shan said they left early.

362
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:07,500
Ya Feng, I'm heading out.

363
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,505
Are you Ya Feng?

364
00:36:34,505 --> 00:36:36,565
Who are you?

365
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,000
I'm looking for some people.

366
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,120
First, a chubby guy named Cao Yan Hua.

367
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,700
He's Qing Shan's cousin.

368
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,560
Then a young lady. She gave you a red envelope.

369
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,200
Remember?

370
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:55,280
Just go. Stop looking for them.

371
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,720
Or it'll be too late.

372
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,180
You know where they are, don't you?

373
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,420
Ya Feng, tell me.

374
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:07,400
- Please leave. 
 - Ya Feng, you have to tell me!

375
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:52,120
If they find out I tell you this, they'll kill me.

376
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:56,040
Trust me. They won't know.

377
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,100
That mountain is quite tall,

378
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,540
with a flat peak, as if it were sliced off.

379
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:09,440
Easy to spot.

380
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,000
The cave's halfway up the mountain.

381
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,640
Remember, I was never here.

382
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,160
And you never saw me.

383
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,300
We'll come back for you.

384

♫  One offers blessings  ♫

♫  One waits in silence  ♫

394

♫  If you were me  ♫

♫  I'd feel each breath you take  ♫

401

♫  Then we'd move forward  ♫
