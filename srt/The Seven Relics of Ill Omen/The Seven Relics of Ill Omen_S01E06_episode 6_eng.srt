5
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,740
This... What is this?

6
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,720
Here.

7
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,700
- Here, hold her. 
 - Be careful.

8
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,440
Luo Ren!

9
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,460
What now? What should we do?

10
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,360
Close the door.

11
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,220
Boss Lady Dai.

12
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,620
Boss Lady Dai, let's go.

13
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,760
Mu Dai, don't touch it!

14
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,820
I can't control it!

15
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,740
So disgusting.

16
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,240
Go away!

17
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,900
Luo Ren.

18
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,580
Is it dead?

19
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,200
Knives can't kill it.

20
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,780
We have to find other tools.

21
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,100
I'll get a weapon.

22
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,440
Chubby, open the door now!

23
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,280
- Watch out!
- I got the oil basin, move!

24
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,540
I'll burn you to death!

25
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,900
Here.

26
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,260
Is it killed?

27
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,160
I'll open it now that it's dead.

28
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,680
What is this?

29
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,280
This is an ancient character, "blade."

30
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,800
It's afraid of water.

31
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,600
- Get some water! 
 - Okay.

32
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,320
Mu Dai!

33
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,400
Here.

34
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,640
Well...

35
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,300
Missy.

36
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,960
Tell us, what it is.

37
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,300
And the girl upstairs.

38
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,840
She got such strength

39
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,380
that she pulled me in directly through the iron gate.

40
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,700
And me.

41
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,960
Is she even a human?

42
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,480
And Luo Ren.

43
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,080
What actually does that guy do?

44
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,960
He threw a knife like that.

45
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,760
It feels like a haunted house right now.

46
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,620
It was mutton that the old man gave us, right?

47
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,480
I've had it anyway.

48
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,500
Thank you for just now.

49
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,720
Ping Ting should be fine.

50
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,040
She got a little wounded.

51
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,240
The doctor is dealing with it.

52
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,081
Mu Dai, did you get hurt?

53
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,520
All right.

54
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,720
That stuff is stuck here.

55
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,580
Ping Ting is safe now.

56
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,920
I've finished my business here.

57
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,400
Pack your things.

58
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,080
We'll go back to Lixi.

59
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,380
Let's go.

60
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,520
- Let's fly back, should we? 
 - Keep an eye on it for me.

61
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,120
Thank you.

62
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,840
He left it to us?

63
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,080
- Your knife. 
 - Thank you for just now.

64
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,840
No need. It was yours in the first place.

65
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,160
It's useless for me to keep it.

66
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,700
I didn't tell you because if I had,

67
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,760
you would've definitely objected.

68
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,280
Ping Ting is my cousin.

69
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,440
I can't just watch her suffer.

70
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,000
I thought the relic of ill omen wouldn't work immediately

71
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,660
when it took possession of me.

72
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,120
And my willpower was stronger than that of Ping Ting.

73
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,620
So, it couldn't control me easily.

74
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,600
You cry a lot, don't you?

75
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,000
I have a reason to cry.

76
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:51,460
It's so hasty and reckless for you to do so.

77
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,540
After death, the relic will detach.

78
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,520
That's only an assumption by Master Kun.

79
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,240
How dare you gamble with both Ping Ting's life and yours?

80
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,052
What if Ping Ting...

81
00:08:01,052 --> 00:08:02,760
I know.

82
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,100
It's my mistake.

83
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,900
And also, how confident are you, you won't be controlled?

84
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,180
If you had been controlled,

85
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,080
your power would have been much greater than hers, you know?

86
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,233
Anyway, as your friend, I have to tell you that your behavior today...

87
00:08:18,233 --> 00:08:21,992
Your sloppy attitude towards life was so...

88
00:08:21,992 --> 00:08:23,780
I'm sorry.

89
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,640
It was so wrong.

90
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,720
I know.

91
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,720
As for the incident today,

92
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,800
it was indeed my problem.

93
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,680
The responsibility is on me.

94
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,640
Can you stay for a few more days?

95
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,120
Although the relic has been trapped in water,

96
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,720
I don't think it will stay like that.

97
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:11,640
Let's call Master Kun later for his opinion, okay?

98
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,660
Please don't be mad.

99
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,720
Thirteen-Thousand is still downstairs, watching over the relic.

100
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,360
I owe them an explanation on this matter.

101
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,200
Please stop packing.

102
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,080
So, the relic of ill omen really exists?

103
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,820
You guys can take a moment to digest it.

104
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,520
Digest?

105
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,060
Did he mean something else?

106
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,960
Mutton?

107
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,320
So, you've known everything?

108
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,500
Is there anything you'd like to say?

109
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,260
I don't have anything to say.

110
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,720
Then, I have a question.

111
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,500
There's a friend of mine.

112
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,740
She met a guy and then...

113
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,660
By the way, they are just friends.

114
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:38,400
When that guy was chatting with her, he suddenly touched her hair like this.

115
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,420
What do you think this means?

116
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:46,820
Did he see something like dandruff on your friend’s head and brush it off?

117
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:50,540
That's not it. As I remember, no.

118
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,880
A friend of yours, huh?

119
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,940
So, Luo Ren touched your hair.

120
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,200
She said a friend sent her...

121
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,920
What's with the hair? Gosh.

122
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,500
I know you'd think it was me.

123
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,060
But it was indeed my friend.

124
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,420
Come on.

125
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,340
Don't take us as fools, okay?

126
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:12,460
I can tell everything from your expression.

127
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,060
Only a fool would believe you.

128
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,840
It must be Luo Ren.

129
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,300
Chubby. Hit him.

130
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,309
Hit him?

131
00:11:20,309 --> 00:11:23,269
Beat him, and you can be my disciple.

132
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,920
Master.

133
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,820
It's understandable, right?

134
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,760
I was in a rush to get a master.

135
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,420
It was just a joke.

136
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,520
Don't you know how heavy you are?

137
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,120
You went too far!

138
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,400
Come on. You didn't spare me either.

139
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,520
Look how you scratched me.

140
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,040
See this?

141
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,200
I was lucky to break your defense.

142
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,140
It's in place now.

143
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,300
- I feel fine now. 
 - Good.

144
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,500
I can talk normally now.

145
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,100
Mu Dai.

146
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,320
What's the matter? What's this about?

147
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,020
- Let's go. 
 - Are you recording it?

148
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,580
Right.

149
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,100
What are you going to do?

150
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,760
Mr. Shen wants a real-time video call.

151
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,120
It's... You just uncovered it like that?

152
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,300
If it's really going to come out, do you think the plastic wrap can stop it?

153
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,300
You're right.

154
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,020
Yeah.

155
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:44,000
Just now, didn't you see a flash of light above?

156
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,100
Don't scare me.

157
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,580
Is it a shadow?

158
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,140
I did see it.

159
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,120
It couldn't be a shadow.

160
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,120
I'll turn off the lights.

161
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,800
I don't get it.

162
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,380
What kind of light is this?

163
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,260
It can't be captured by the camera.

164
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,260
And it's not the same as last time.

165
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,980
It's got strokes, like a painting.

166
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,360
Does the painting mean anything?

167
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,520
I'll get a pen.

168
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,340
I've done drawing.

169
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,740
It's finally done.

170
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,600
How's the drawing?

171
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,820
Well...

172
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,980
So, you spent the whole night and this is what you drew?

173
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,420
Hey, what do you mean?

174
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,380
I was drawing without the lights.

175
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,380
I couldn't even see the paper.

176
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,880
This is pretty good under the circumstances.

177
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,880
What does this mean?

178
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,520
Are these three chickens?

179
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,620
Is this a wolf?

180
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:27,140
More like a dog.

181
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,400
What does it mean by chickens and dogs?

182
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,780
I don't know.

183
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,460
It's quite obvious.

184
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:36,220
The relic of ill omen got caught by us

185
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,140
and bore hatred in its heart. How evil it is!

186
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,080
We are three men and one woman.

187
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,700
It drew three chickens and one dog. What does it mean?

188
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,635
- It was cursing at us. 
 - Could it be?

189
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:48,480
It cursed at us for the whole night?

190
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,820
Seriously?

191
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:58,660
It's 4K HD with bulletproof glass.

192
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,220
The water temperature is controllable.

193
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:04,680
Its monitor can be connected via Bluetooth.

194
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,140
My goodness.

195
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,100
What a luxurious dwelling you're providing it!

196
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,460
The point is, it's sturdy.

197
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,420
Although it got still in the water,

198
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,560
we can't be sure whether it's faking it

199
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,360
and for how long it will keep still.

200
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,620
We can't let our guards down.

201
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:21,200
Okay. But you must have spent a fortune.

202
00:15:21,913 --> 00:15:23,740
Boss Lady Dai. Oh, my.

203
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,140
Uncle Zhang asked when you would go back.

204
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,000
He's almost going mad.

205
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,300
Tomorrow or after.

206
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,300
The day with the best flight deals.

207
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,460
She said tomorrow or after.

208
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,880
See which day has the best flight deals.

209
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,360
Its new home?

210
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,680
You treat it really well.

211
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,780
The money is worth it though.

212
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,840
Are you leaving tomorrow?

213
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,560
We're almost done.

214
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,900
And you're pretty busy.

215
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,080
We should go back.

216
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,600
I see.

217
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,660
How about I treat you guys to lunch tomorrow?

218
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,780
Thanks to you these days, things are solved.

219
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,560
It's just a pity that I didn't get to show you around.

220
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,980
How about this?

221
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,980
Would you like to go to the desert at night?

222
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,880
There will be a bonfire and camel riding.

223
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,640
That's great!

224
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,560
I love deserts and camels.

225
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,780
- Me, too. 
 - Right?

226
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,080
You love deserts and camels?

227
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,220
Camels are very seductive.

228
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,820
Brother Cao. You don't like camels.

229
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,220
Why?

230
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,620
- Tell me, how many eyes does a camel have? 
 - Two.

231
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,360
- And how many humps does it have? 
 - Two.

232
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,520
And how many nostrils?

233
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,680
Two.

234
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,800
How many people can ride on it?

235
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,260
I don't like camels.

236
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,260
I hate camels!

237
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,660
- It's okay. 
 - Then...

238
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,880
- Let's play something else. 
 - Neither of them wants to go.

239
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,400
Are we still going?

240
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,640
Well...

241
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,480
Do you want to go?

242
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,940
It's so great now.

243
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:07,180
After the relic incident was settled, I feel much more relaxed.

244
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,440
It's over, I guess.

245
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:14,980
But for me, it's more important than anything that Ping Ting gets better.

246
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:18,780
I'm not interested in the relic of ill omen at all.

247
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:24,000
So, I guess for both of us, it is over now.

248
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,940
I wonder when we'll meet again.

249
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,280
I'm sorry.

250
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,420
I planned to drive you back.

251
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,940
But the doctor told me

252
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,880
Ping Ting should have treatment in a major hospital as soon as possible.

253
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,240
It's all right.

254
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,900
Ping Ting's matter is more important.

255
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,900
Mu Dai.

256
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,480
I suppose we're good friends now.

257
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,160
If you have something on your mind, you can tell me.

258
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:07,860
Since we’re close friends, of course, I feel down about us parting.

259
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:14,420
After that, we might not be able to meet again for many years.

260
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:19,420
You just said you didn't know when we would meet again.

261
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,320
You said it so easily.

262
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,500
Wait, I didn't say that we wouldn't see each other again.

263
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,460
I meant I didn't know when we would meet.

264
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,700
Is there a difference?

265
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,220
Sure, it's different.

266
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,900
So...

267
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,420
You still want to see me?

268
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,820
Do you want to see me?

269
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,800
Sure.

270
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,660
Then, I do as well.

271
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,860
You even set a condition.

272
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,140
- What if I don't want to? 
 - Then I don't want to, either.

273
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,880
Why would I want to if you don't?

274
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,520
The doctor told me that Ping Ting

275
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,240
couldn't have a good recuperation in Xiaoshang River.

276
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,760
We have to go to the south.

277
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,540
The moment he said that, I thought of Lixi.

278
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,320
You know, I rented a house in Lixi.

279
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,960
I am considering whether to renew my lease.

280
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,100
But I don't want to be a nuisance.

281
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,552
Someone might say,

282
00:19:18,552 --> 00:19:21,760
"Luo Ren, why are you here again?"

283
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,360
But now, it's fine.

284
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,800
Since both of us want to meet,

285
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,080
then, Boss Lady Dai, please help me take care of the house.

286
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,200
When Ping Ting gets the treatment, let's go back together, okay?

287
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:40,500
In this case, I'll reluctantly help you take care of it when I'm not busy.

288
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,580
 Why do the visions show the roof corner of the ancestral hall? 

289
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:27,131
   

290
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,760
Please let me have this. Please...

291
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,580
What's this?

292
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,680
Why am I seeing this?

293
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,540
I must be working too hard.

294
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:28,040
I've even seen the vision.

295
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,101
   

296
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,420
We're back to Lixi.

297
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,100
Master Kun happened to plan to come over.

298
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,920
I'll pick him up at the station.

299
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,540
 Really, when? 

300
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,040
Right now.

301
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,640
Then, why didn't you say it earlier?

302
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,380
I would've gone with you.

303
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,120
Wouldn't it be the same if you saw him later?

304
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,140
How can that be the same?

305
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,960
That's Uncle Kun.

306
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,017
Who wouldn't want to be the first to meet such an interesting man?

307
00:23:04,017 --> 00:23:05,260
 I was the one who knew him first. 

308
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,960
 Why did you get to see him before me? 

309
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,360
Tell me about it.

310
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,400
What does Uncle Kun look like?

311
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,600
I haven't seen him yet.

312
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,780
 Is he dashing, individualistic, 

313
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:19,600
 handsome and otherworldly? 

314
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,420
Mu Dai.

315
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,860
What you are talking about is not Master Kun,

316
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:27,040
but the male protagonist of an idol drama.

317
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,640
 Maybe I'm right. 

318
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,920
 Is he there yet? 

319
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,880
Radishie.

320
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:38,000
When you're in a bad mood, you can get a little fried food.

321
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Have some if you want.

322
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,500
You...

323
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,980
Are you Uncle Kun?

324
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,240
Pocketty.

325
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,160
Come on. This must be grasped by hand.

326
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,260
If you use chopsticks, it would be less delicious.

327
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,580
With a knife and fork, it would taste even worse.

328
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:12,100
Come on. Grasp one.

329
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,900
Okay, okay.

330
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,320
He is skinny.

331
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,240
I'd say he vomited in the car.

332
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,540
He doesn't look like an explorer who braves wind and rain.

333
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,700
Brother Cao.

334
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,500
You've been with me for so long.

335
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,640
Don't you know what's called lean and strong?

336
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,160
You're so chubby.

337
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,340
Of course, you think others are skinny.

338
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:50,220
If Master Shen is as chubby as you, how can he explore?

339
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,940
Will he even be able to move?

340
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,972
Look at yourself...

341
00:24:53,972 --> 00:24:57,660
If I may ask, where is the shadow in water you just mentioned?

342
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,100
Is it still there?

343
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,680
Can you see it now?

344
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,480
It's on the surface of the water.

345
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,100
Where?

346
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,740
That's it. It appeared.

347
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,960
It flashed for a moment.

348
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,040
Where's it?

349
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,000
Uncle Kun, several of them flashed.

350
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,200
Haven't you seen any of them?

351
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,760
I didn't see any.

352
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,300
Where exactly is the shadow in the water you mentioned?

353
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:28,500
How about you change the direction and look from this side?

354
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,180
This man is miserable.

355
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:34,440
He’s skinny and has poor eyesight.

356
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,180
Is it just Master Shen who can't see it?

357
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:42,500
Or rather, only we can see it?

358
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,260
No way.

359
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,840
 Maybe he doesn't have feelings for me. 

360
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,200
A line of little folks.

361
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,580
Radishie saw them.

362
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,920
Pocketty saw them.

363
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,080
Chubby saw them.

364
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,560
And Little Thirteen?

365
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,680
I didn't see them.

366
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:39,480
I guess it won't be long before you can see them.

367
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,020
Now it seems there are two consequences after subduing the relic.

368
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:48,180
The water shadow in the fish tank, and the visions that each of you saw.

369
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,820
I have an idea.

370
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,900
We caught the relic of ill omen, right?

371
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,340
It bears anger inside.

372
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:01,200
That's why it plays confusing tricks to put mental pressure on us.

373
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,960
Anyway, just leave it alone.

374
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,580
Who would you ignore?

375
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,700
Uncle Zheng.

376
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,740
Hello, everyone.

377
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,900
Come on.

378
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,000
Slowly, careful.

379
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,940
Uncle Zheng.

380
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,560
A little gift from the bar.

381
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,260
- Thank you. 
 - Welcome to Lixi.

382
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,680
My share is in there, too.

383
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,580
Thank you.

384
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:21,080
Brother Ren.

385
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,960
Ping Ting.

386
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,180
That's not him.

387
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:26,060
You've mistaken the person.

388
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,300
Brother Ren.

389
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,560
I'll show you a treasure. Come here.

390
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,820
- Come on. 
 - Okay.

391
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,560
Luo Ren.

392
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,780
Everybody, sit down. Sit.

393
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,360
Please stay for dinner.

394
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:46,660
I'll make some pancakes for you to taste.

395
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,440
Enjoy your meal here.

396
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,120
I'm here to chat with Uncle Kun about something.

397
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,780
I still have work to do.

398
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:56,480
Uncle Kun, I have to go now.

399
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,300
Stay for breakfast.

400
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,340
Scallion pancakes...

401
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,480
Uncle Zheng, I've got some work to do at the bar.

402
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,740
I'll go now.

403
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,460
T-Take care.

404
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,120
Bye.

405
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,980
Luo, did you somehow offend my master?

406
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,500
Murderer!

407
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,840
I'm really sorry.

408
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,060
Did you get scalded?

409
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,780
I...

410
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,840
You...

411
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,700
What are you doing?

412
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,280
It's not me. I don't know what's going on.

413
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,820
Luckily, the soup wasn't hot.

414
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,100
Did she do it?

415
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,620
Forget it.

416
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,620
Don't be afraid, I'll take care of it.

417
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,140
- Forget it, Ren. 
 - I'll deal with it. Don't worry.

418
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,680
I said forget it!

419
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,500
I'm sorry.

420
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,040
Mu Dai.

421
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,600
I want to take a bath.

422
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,660
It's okay, come home with me.

423
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,780
Do you want to talk

424
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,980
about what just happened?

425
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,780
 Luo Ren. What do you do? 

426
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,960
 Don't you have to work? 

427
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,520
 Oh, right. 

428
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,420
 You are from a rich family. 

429
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,460
I stayed on the Old Heisha Island

430
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,380
for three or four years.

431
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,960
Old Heisha Island?

432
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:15,100
Isn't that a war-torn area abroad?

433
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,920
It had serious security issues.

434
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,800
Heavy security was needed.

435
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,520
I was employed by a security center of a hotel group.

436
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,360
Wasn't that the same situation as mine?

437
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,380
When I asked my senior to help me get a job,

438
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:30,020
it was also for a bodyguard position.

439
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:35,480
If you think we were in the same industry, I guess you can say that.

440
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,680
All right. I'm done with my story.

441
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,260
It's your turn.

442
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:43,080
You were adopted by Huo Zi Hong as a child.

443
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,360
Do you remember what happened before that?

444
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,960
You can't do that.

445
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,920
I remember only a little.

446
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,920
I was abandoned by my mother.

447
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:11,420
I can't remember what she looked like.

448
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:15,280
I only remember that she took me away.

449
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:21,000
She walked with a sway in her red high heels.

450
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,620
I kept staring at her feet, afraid that she'd fall.

451
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:32,860
Later, she took me to the gate of a welfare home and gave me a peach.

452
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,320
Then she left.

453
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,860
 I kept waiting for her. 

454
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:41,700
 At that time, I just heard the story of Kong Rong sharing pears. 

455
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:46,640
 So, I thought when she came back, I'd give her the peach. 

456
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,140
 She would know I was well-behaved and filial. 

457
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,760
 She would definitely be happy. 

458
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,800
And then?

459
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,720
Later, I was taken in by the welfare home.

460
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:08,760
I never ate that peach until it...

461
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:12,180
was completely rotten and thrown in the trash.

462
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:15,860
After that, I get allergies as soon as I eat peaches.

463
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,160
After chatting, don't you think we're quite alike?

464
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:27,980
We are in the same industry and have similar family backgrounds.

465
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,900
That's true.

466
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:36,060
We feel sorry for each other.

467
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,400
We should have a toast.

468
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,920
Even if we don't have wine?

469
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,100
Wine doesn't matter.

470
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,280
Our mood does.

471
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,220
Right.

472
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,080
Then we should drink like this.

473
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,860
I'll use a bowl.

474
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:20,100
   

475
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,880
Thank you for your support of my research.

476
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,600
There are only two things that you wouldn't let me do.

477
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,840
This and that.

478
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,560
Am I here for nothing?

479
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,360
Your research is too radical.

480
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,320
Can we take our time?

481
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,560
How to do that?

482
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:37,040
For example, taking a little water sample of the relic for research is okay.

483
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,280
Very good.

484
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,460
But what do you mean by heating it and adding salt and vinegar?

485
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,160
Do you think it's appropriate?

486
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:47,460
Then, how about adding some liquor, chilie,s and Huangjiu to stimulate it?

487
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:50,500
- Maybe... 
 - How about I make you a hotpot?

488
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,180
This way.

489
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,400
Where... Where are you going?

490
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,140
- Here. 
 - Here!

491
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,480
It went inside.

492
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,960
Ping Ting, here.

493
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,240
Drink it.

494
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,280
Ping Ting, have some water.

495
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,020
Let me do it, Uncle Zheng.

496
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,440
All right.

497
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,560
Don't let her choke.

498
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,100
Rest assured.

499
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,380
Ping Ting.

500
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,900
Ping Ting. Here, have some water.

501
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:17,280
You're so patient, young man.

502
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,760
No wonder Ping Ting likes you.

503
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,640
You're not like that Ren.

504
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,140
I have no idea what he's doing all day long.

505
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,440
You're obviously targeting me.

506
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,940
You've got two glasses there.

507
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,880
I drank from this one.

508
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,600
Ping Ting.

509
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,680
Brother Ren.

510
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,960
What's wrong?

511
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,120
Brother Ren.

512
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,140
Can you buy me a doll?

513
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,960
Lots of dolls.

514
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,140
Okay.

515
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:50,440
I'll bring some to you next time.

516
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,600
There!

517
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,840
Ping Ting already has two dolls.

518
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,040
And you are buying her more?

519
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,860
You can't spoil her like this, can you?

520
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:14,020
Uncle Zheng, maybe when Ping Ting recovers, she won't need these dolls.

521
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,940
Just do as she asks now.

522
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,340
Listen to me...

523
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,600
Ping Ting.

524
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,660
You got more dolls?

525
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,660
That's great.

526
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,400
All are here now.

527
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,260
All!

528
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:17,180
Uncle Kun. Isn't the relic of ill omen still in that fish tank?

529
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:19,260
We all misunderstood.

530
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,960
The human skin is not the relic of ill omen.

531
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,280
It’s just tissue that comes out when the relic leaves the body.

532
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,760
We've never seen what the relic of ill omen is like.

533
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:32,520
Then... Will it return to Ping Ting again?

534
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,880
Judging from her status now, it's very likely.

535
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,000
Seems it can't be controlled by water.

536
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,620
So, what do we do now?

537
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:42,320
Is there no other way to solve this?

538
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,640
At such a critical time, we should keep calm in mind, right?

539
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,140
Look for all possible breakthroughs.

540
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:50,120
The relic of ill omen is next level.

541
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,100
How can there be a breakthrough?

542
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,900
There is.

543
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:01,760
Have you forgotten that, except for Little Thirteen, the three of you all saw a line of folks?

544
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:06,760
That was a message released by the relic of ill omen that only you guys can receive.

545
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,280
It must have its meaning.

546
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:12,160
I don't believe it can send us any good information.

547
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:16,280
Right. It must be one of its tricks, some passive information.

548
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:20,200
Even if it's a trick, that's the only clue we have so far.

549
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,120
Look, you can decide whether to explore this clue or not.

550
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,140
All right...

551
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,080
The first one is a man riding an animal.

552
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,520
The second is a phoenix.

553
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,740
The third is a lion.

554
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:36,440
The last one is a monkey with wings.

555
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,120
They seem like tile cats.

556
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,160
Tile cats?

557
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,540
On the roofs of many old houses in Lixi,

558
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,340
there are tile cat statues to attract blessings and suppress evil.

559
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,640
They look exactly like them.

560
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,340
One row...

561
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:52,160
Divine beasts on the roof ridges,

562
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,480
Immortals Leading the Way.

563
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,500
- Immortals leading the way? 
 - You guys are so lacking in knowledge.

564
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,060
When people built houses in the past,

565
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,760
they would always build cornices.

566
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,720
Immortals Leading the Way is the most common kind.

567
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:09,220
Buildings decorated with the style of Immortals Leading the Way are everywhere in the country.

568
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,240
It's hard to specify.

569
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,460
There's a distinctive point in your visions.

570
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,720
That hand.

571
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,000
Right.

572
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,720
This winged monkey is called Hang Shi.

573
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,500
In Mu Dai's vision, it was snatched by a hand.

574
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:31,340
So, you should be looking for Immortals Leading the Way without a Hang Shi.

575
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:34,360
A missing monkey doesn't make it much easier to find.

576
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,040
It helps a lot.

577
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:39,160
It will be so obvious.

578
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,920
You guys can go back now.

579
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,600
I need...

580
00:40:43,448 --> 00:40:47,629
to take measures here in case Ping Ting gets out to hurt someone.

581
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,340
Go now.

582
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,160
What should we do?

583
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,780
The water can't suppress the relic of ill omen.

584
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,400
Where can we find the Immortals Leading the Way?

585
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,160
Master.

586
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,080
Ping Ting is pitiful.

587
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:38,160
- That's right. 
 - Brother Luo said measures should be taken.

588
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,860
I guess he'll seal the doors and windows again.

589
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:42,040
Maybe a sedative?

590
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:45,280
He might even tie her up, lest she harm herself.

591
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,060
Indeed.

592
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,600
Where are you going?

593
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,520
Watch where you are going!

594
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,760
- Are you blind? 
 - Luo Ren.

595
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,520
Luo Ren!

596
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:03,560
Luo Ren!

597
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:10,720
Luo Ren!

598
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,840
Thirteen thousand, what are you doing?

599
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,740
Mind the store.

600
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,780
Luo Ren. You gave her this stuff again!

601
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,640
Thirteen Thousand.

602
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,600
Yeah.

603
00:42:43,147 --> 00:42:47,127
Besides this, I'll also set cameras inside and out,

604
00:42:47,127 --> 00:42:48,855
reinforcing doors and windows.

605
00:42:48,855 --> 00:42:52,736
Or to make it safer, I'll find a way to make her unconscious,

606
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:54,917
and keep her alive with nutritional injections.

607
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:57,900
Luo Ren. She's your cousin.

608
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:59,040
She's a human being!

609
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:03,700
If she goes to kill others like my uncle, would you still dare to say this?

610
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:07,520
Shush, don't wake Ping Ting up. Let go of each other.

611
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,440
From now on...

612
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:24,200
don't come over here.

613
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:29,660
Only by finding clues of the Immortals Leading the Way

614
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:32,440
can we possibly save Ping Ting.

615
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:45,460
Let's go, Thirteen Thousand.

616
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:46,940
Let's go.

617
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:48,920
Immortals Leading the Way...

618
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:52,440
I know where it is.
