3
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:02,980
   

4
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,000
   

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,226
   

6
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,400
It smells terrible.

7
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,100
Step back.

8
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,420
This place hasn't been ventilated in ages.

9
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,140
Let's wait here for a while.

10
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,420
Here's the auspicious moment

11
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,600
Thank you.

12
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,180
Why are you looking over there instead of at the wedding altar?

13
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,820
Thank you all for joining us to celebrate the union of Qing Shan and Ya Feng.

14
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,920
Let the ceremony commence!

15
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,560
 Great! 

16
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,020
May all guests please rise!

17
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,580
Bow to the memorial tablet.

18
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,880
Why are we bowing to this?

19
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,840
Madam, do in Rome as the Romans do.

20
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,860
This tablet bears the ancient character for "Earth."

21
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,960
Rise.

22
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,640
Bow to heaven and earth!

23
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,440
Wonderful!

24
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,920
Cao village once thrived on pottery.

25
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,140
This tablet honors the clay that sustained us through pottery.

26
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,560
We pay tribute to the land's bounty.

27
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,000
It's a tradition passed down through generations.

28
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,160
Bow to the elders!

29
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,880
Wonderful!

30
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,180
Exchange the tokens.

31
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,120
Perfect!

32
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,820
- Great! 
 - Good.

33
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,360
Wonderful!

34
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,040
Lovely.

35
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,940
 Wasn't she trafficked here? 

36
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,320
 Why does she look so happy? 

37
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,760
Why use matches? They're so archaic.

38
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,900
Lighters are much more convenient.

39
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,980
Fire-starting tools in a tactical backpack typically include matches and flint.

40
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:12,360
Lighters may be handy, but they're useless in extreme conditions.

41
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,620
Look at this.

42
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,360
The wax on match heads protects against water

43
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,220
and prevents self-ignition from friction.

44
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,620
Understand?

45
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,940
Luo Ren, you seem to enjoy teaching me things.

46
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,660
I'm more experienced.

47
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:43,601
That's why I want to share all my knowledge and skills with you.

48
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,960
So, even if I'm not around one day,

49
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,040
you'll be able to protect

50
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,740
and take care of yourself.

51
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,480
You initially refused to join us in Cao Village.

52
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,740
Something happened, didn't it?

53
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,840
Remember when I told you...

54
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,860
I once stayed on Old Heisha Island?

55
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:20,680
I left because I crossed a powerful figure there.

56
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,340
So, I had no choice but to leave.

57
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,440
Later, I thought the matter was over.

58
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:36,040
But recently, I learned she's planning to retaliate against me.

59
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,980
Her usual tactic...

60
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,940
is to target people close to her enemies.

61
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,840
So...

62
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,540
No wonder you've been on edge.

63
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:51,900
Still, if even you're wary of her, she must be formidable.

64
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,940
That's so low. Targeting one's friends and family?

65
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,360
My master always said only petty cowards

66
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,160
would go after innocent women and children.

67
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,800
But don't worry. I'm tough, too.

68
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,540
I can help protect the people around you.

69
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,980
That impressive?

70
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,680
And if things get really bad, I've got my master and my senior.

71
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,720
We'll all pitch in.

72
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,140
Don't worry.

73
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,180
Let me play you a tune.

74
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,800
What's wrong?

75
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,020
Nothing.

76
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,620
Let me see.

77
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,660
How do you do that?

78
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,280
Why can I only make a basic whistle sound?

79
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:38,680
Not telling you. It's my signature trick.

80
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,480
Not even me?

81
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,400
Rules are rules.

82
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,880
It's passed down to sons, not daughters.

83
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,700
Sons only, no daughters-in-law.

84
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,460
What's wrong with daughters?

85
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:59,180
Sons can learn it to impress girls.

86
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,740
Daughters don't need to.

87
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,580
They just wait to be wooed.

88
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,540
All right.

89
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,880
Almost done. Come take a look.

90
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,000
The air's clear now.

91
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,320
It's not a dirt path. It's rocks.

92
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:41,300
Thought if it was mud, it'd be easier to dig.

93
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:45,900
The mud sealing the entrance must've been brought in from outside.

94
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,880
Should we go down?

95
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,160
- I'll go first. 
 - All right.

96
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,300
If Ya Feng falls short in any way, I ask for your patience.

97
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,180
Just let me know if anything's wrong.

98
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,900
- A toast to you all. 
 - Come on.

99
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,300
 Wishing you a happy marriage. 

100
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,220
Thank you.

101
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,320
Thanks.

102
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,580
Enjoy the feast.

103
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,920
All right.

104
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,860
- Come on, keep drinking. 
 - Refill, refill.

105
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,200
Pour it.

106
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,300
Here, here.

107
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,580
- Pour it. 
 - Come on.

108
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,140
Here.

109
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,760
Come on. Here.

110
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,180
Bottoms up.

111
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,220
Down it.

112
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,380
- Bottoms up. 
 - All right.

113
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,320
All right, thank you.

114
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,780
- Thanks. 
 - This way.

115
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,540
Take it slow.

116
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,560
We're here to toast.

117
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,380
- Glasses full, everyone. 
 - Here.

118
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,780
- A toast to all. 
 - Enjoy the food and drinks.

119
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,480
Come on.

120
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,740
What's wrong?

121
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,818
- Are you all right? 
 - Here.

122
00:09:51,818 --> 00:09:54,180
- Easy with the drink. 
 - Ya Feng.

123
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,500
- What's wrong? 
 - I'm fine.

124
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,180
Just had a bit too much.

125
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,780
- No worries. 
 - It's all right.

126
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,760
Then, we'll raise a toast to everyone. Enjoy the feast.

127
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,380
Come on, let's drink.

128
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:05,320
- Drink up. 
 - Cheers.

129
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,020
Enjoy the food and drinks.

130
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,100
- This way. 
 - Here.

131
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,140
Enjoy the food and drinks.

132
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,180
 She's reacting to my blood? 

133
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,780
 Is the relic of ill omen inside Ya Feng? 

134
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,480
We're here to toast.

135
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,060
Here.

136
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,980
 Where's Cao Jin Hua? 

137
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,020
The drinks.

138
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,980
- The drinks. 
 - Here.

139
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,740
- Come on. 
 - Thank you.

140
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,900
- Cheers. 
 - Let's raise our glasses.

141
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,940
Here, thank you.

142
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,887
So, it really is you.

143
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:56,687
Pudgy?

144
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,520
Cao Jin Hua!

145
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,180
What's gotten into Qing Shan?

146
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:13,380
Jin Hua, no time to catch up now.

147
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,760
Untie me, now.

148
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,005
Qing Shan... He seems possessed.

149
00:11:18,005 --> 00:11:20,180
You didn't do anything to wrong him, did you?

150
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,980
I swear that in this whole village, you're the only one I've wronged.

151
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,340
I'll make it up to you later, all right?

152
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:28,220
Just untie me now. This is a matter of life and death.

153
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,020
Listen well, Pudgy, I'll untie you.

154
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,700
But don't get any ideas.

155
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,740
This doesn't mean I forgive you.

156
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,880
I'm... I'm heartless.

157
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,300
Hurry!

158
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,500
Hong Sha.

159
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,780
Hold it back.

160
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,260
Thirteen-Thousand was buried alive for ages, and he didn't cry.

161
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,760
- Look at you, all weepy. 
 - Buried alive?

162
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,380
Let me make this quick.

163
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,740
After entering the village, the first person I met was Thirteen-Thousand,

164
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,960
and the second was you.

165
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,900
There's still no word from Luo Ren or Mu Dai.

166
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,800
Have you seen them?

167
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,360
So, where are they?

168
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,780
Halfway up the mountain.

169
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:08,380
I did see them. But they fell into a trap.

170
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,820
You don't know how deep that pit is.

171
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,492
I'm afraid they might have...

172
00:12:11,492 --> 00:12:14,020
Don't jinx it. No way.

173
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,360
With their skills, they'll be fine.

174
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,040
Oh, my goodness.

175
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,100
We can't leave her here.

176
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,720
If she wakes up and starts screaming, we'll be in trouble.

177
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,940
And I've already tested them.

178
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,140
They're not as simple as they seem.

179
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,380
- Ya Feng... 
 - There's something off about her.

180
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,380
Here's the plan. Take her to the mill at the foot of the mountain.

181
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,240
I'll meet you there.

182
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,861
- Stay safe. 
 - Be careful.

183
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,420
Wow, you've changed a lot.

184
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,480
Brother Yan Hua.

185
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,520
Oh no.

186
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,472
No one's here.

187
00:13:24,472 --> 00:13:27,620
- Is my bag still there? 
 - Right here.

188
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,260
Wait a second.

189
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,140
If this were her as a kid, I'd never be able to move her.

190
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,700
How much farther is the cave?

191
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,660
Doesn't look far, but it's still halfway up. Let's hurry.

192
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,100
Let's go.

193
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,860
Why aren't you carrying her?

194
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,540
Why bring her? Just leave her there.

195
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,940
No, what if she wakes up

196
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,920
and tells everyone in the village she saw Pudgy and that Qing Shan kidnapped him?

197
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,080
What would we do then?

198
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,560
Just like my father warned me, I never should've left Jin Hua.

199
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,160
Here.

200
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,640
Something's up ahead.

201
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,880
Wait.

202
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,740
This is...

203
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,580
Mu Dai, there are bones here.

204
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,220
Is this a burial chamber?

205
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,780
That's right.

206
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,620
Molten bronze and iron?

207
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,880
In ancient times,

208
00:16:23,808 --> 00:16:26,208
these people were buried alive.

209
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,720
I've studied ancient scripts before.

210
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,640
This says "Seven-Star Return to Their Positions."

211
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,900
Seven-Star Return to Their Positions?

212
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:01,180
Mu Dai, this cave might be connected to the relics of ill omen.

213
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:05,260
Mighty Kun once said each relic of ill omen represents a star.

214
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,660
So, seven relics of ill omen mean seven stars.

215
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:11,060
He suspects they all originate from Tiankui Seven-Star.

216
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:14,060
Then what does "Seven-Star Return to Their Positions" mean?

217
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,440
Have all seven relics of ill omen emerged?

218
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,460
Not sure.

219
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:23,020
But it also says "all efforts wasted."

220
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,660
Does that mean the return failed?

221
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:33,280
"Lured into the trap, molten bronze poured overhead."

222
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,060
"No escape left, the Star Lord perished."

223
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:41,520
"The servants follow in death."

224
00:17:43,181 --> 00:17:45,341
Star Lord?

225
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,860
Could the Star Lord be someone possessed by the relic of ill omen?

226
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,560
Likely.

227
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,140
And they call that a Star Lord?

228
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:02,580
Remember, those possessed by the relic of ill omen gain supernatural abilities.

229
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,660
This "servant" is the literal meaning,

230
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,280
likely referring to the followers of the Star Lord.

231
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,960
Look, there's a star on each of these pottery figurine masks.

232
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,215
This was an organization.

233
00:18:21,215 --> 00:18:25,295
If these people were buried here,

234
00:18:25,295 --> 00:18:28,320
where did the sacrificial offerings and figurines come from?

235
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,880
I guess some of those who were buried alive might have escaped.

236
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,020
They dug a tunnel and escaped.

237
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,000
Back then, there were no trapdoors.

238
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,580
Just a natural exit.

239
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,540
Later, he came back.

240
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:47,140
That's why there's a coffin platform and kneeling figurines.

241
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:51,220
Finally, they sealed the cave and set up a trapdoor.

242
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:54,760
Why bother with the trap if they had come back?

243
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,060
Probably to worship while keeping intruders out.

244
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,580
So, he set up the trap.

245
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:03,680
Then, were those two skeletons of the unlucky trespassers?

246
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,000
Poor things.

247
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,640
Do you think there might be clues over there?

248
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,600
Let me check. Hold this.

249
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,660
It's too heavy to move, Luo Ren.

250
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,460
Be careful.

251
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,140
Careful.

252
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,060
Can't move it.

253
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,840
Too heavy.

254
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,160
We need more professional tools.

255
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,920
Is anyone chasing us?

256
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,580
No. Hurry.

257
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,760
Almost there.

258
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,390
Well?

259
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,960
Move.

260
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,300
Listen, Thirteen-Thousand got it wrong.

261
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,180
The relic of ill omen isn't with Qing Shan.

262
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,740
Ya Feng is the host.

263
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:51,220
And this relic of ill omen should've gone into acting.

264
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,760
 The way it played the weeping victim. 

265
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,540
 I actually believed she'd been trafficked. 

266
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,620
I got carried away and brought her out.

267
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,580
 I'm exhausted. 

268
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,420
 I can't run anymore. I need to rest. 

269
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:09,520
 Relax. They won't catch up anytime soon. 

270
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,180
 Aren't you tired? 

271
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:16,140
 Hey, Fatso. You're alone here? 

272
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,960
 Yes, just me. 

273
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:25,760
 Well, if you went missing, 

274
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:31,500
 would your friends come to rescue you? 

275
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:01,220
Does this relic of ill omen seem weaker than the others?

276
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:05,200
Weaker? She knocked me out cold with two hits.

277
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,900
And she's vicious.

278
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,880
I was tied up in that cave, gagged. I couldn't do anything.

279
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:15,760
I could only watch as she lured my master and Luo into that trap.

280
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,270
No idea if they're even alive.

281
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,500
Let's go now.

282
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,200
Look. See it?

283
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,480
We're here.

284
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,960
Wait for me.

285
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,780
Bats.

286
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,840
I'm used to them by now.

287
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,920
Where's the trap?

288
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,600
Wait, wait.

289
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,000
Right here in the middle.

290
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,860
It's deep. Don't fall in.

291
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,240
Where's the trigger mechanism?

292
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,800
I was tied to that rock over there.

293
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,680
They were fighting around here, and then they just fell in with a thud.

294
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:13,280
Qing Shan always stood there, I think.

295
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,060
Be careful.

296
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,460
If you fall, we're done for.

297
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,440
Found it?

298
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,480
I-It's the same color as the rocks.

299
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,520
Hard to spot.

300
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,020
Is that rope secure? You don't want to fall down.

301
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,940
Yan family's secret knot. Won't loosen.

302
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,880
Most can't untie it.

303
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,900
Give me a piggyback ride.

304
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,340
I'll carry you.

305
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,780
Come on.

306
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,380
It seems Jin Hua has woken up.

307
00:23:09,309 --> 00:23:11,920
- Knock her out again. 
 - No, no, no, don't.

308
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,820
She'll get brain damage.

309
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,520
And she has a really bad temper.

310
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,560
Always beat me up when we were kids.

311
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,040
Risks are indeed everywhere.

312
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,780
Good thing I bought insurance.

313
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,460
It covers 80% of the payout.

314
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:33,820
If I'm hospitalized, there's also a daily subsidy of 120 yuan.

315
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,180
Madam Maria?

316
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,040
Jenny.

317
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,400
Hong Sha, keep looking.

318
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,340
I'll handle her while she's still dazed.

319
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,212
Jin Hua, look, we're...

320
00:23:58,212 --> 00:24:01,320
We're not good people.

321
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,400
No, I mean we don't do good things.

322
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,440
Look at me, I'm so clumsy with words. I couldn't possibly be a bad guy.

323
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,800
Think about it, if I were, just now when you fainted,

324
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,260
I would've taken advantage of...

325
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,320
I couldn't do that, you know.

326
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,780
I'll take responsibility.

327
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:21,720
Jin Hua, I'm really sorry drag you into this.

328
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,240
I'll cover all your medical expenses.

329
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,760
If you end up with any after-effects, I'll take care of you.

330
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,880
What's Madam Maria looking for?

331
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,160
The trigger mechanism. Checked everywhere.

332
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,780
Still couldn't find it.

333
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,800
What about the ground?

334
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,060
The ground?

335
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,360
It must be this.

336
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,380
That's just evil.

337
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,420
Mu Dai.

338
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,060
Giving up already?

339
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:46,120
It's alright. I believe we'll get out of here.

340
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:54,461
You have to believe that our friends will come to rescue us.

341
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,600
They say sweets make people happy.

342
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,500
It's not mealtime yet, but have some anyway.

343
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,160
You eat first. You haven't had a single piece.

344
00:26:22,234 --> 00:26:25,540
- I did. 
 - No, you didn't!

345
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,940
I'm ready. Let's do it.

346
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,040
Be careful.

347
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,760
One, two, three!

348
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,320
- Did you press it? 
 - I'm still pressing it.

349
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,040
Press it again. My lamp has poor contact.

350
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,180
Keep pressing. Don't let go.

351
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,520
Step on it.

352
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,520
Will this work?

353
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,000
Hong Sha!

354
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,260
- Madam Maria! 
 - Hong Sha, I...

355
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,315
Mu Dai, it's Hong Sha.

356
00:27:39,315 --> 00:27:41,360
Well, sorry. I didn't hold onto the bag tightly.

357
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,660
Didn't it hit you guys, did it? There are wedding candies inside.

358
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,160
Have some if you're hungry.

359
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,560
Hong Sha, are you okay?

360
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,040
I'm fine! And they're both safe.

361
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,020
All good. See, I told you.

362
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,200
We're all okay.

363
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,640
Chubby is up there.

364
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:02,440
Wait, there's a trap here?

365
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,160
There's someone else down there?

366
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,380
- Did they fall in? 
 - Yes.

367
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,260
I... I'm just as puzzled.

368
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:11,720
Did you two ever imagine that an angel like me

369
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:16,600
would come swooping in to rescue you from this mess?

370
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,161
If you're both okay, come on up now.

371
00:28:19,161 --> 00:28:22,064
Once Qing Shan and Ya Feng catch up, we won't be able to hold them off.

372
00:28:22,064 --> 00:28:25,518
Aren't they in the middle of their wedding?

373
00:28:25,518 --> 00:28:26,959
How could they possibly come?

374
00:28:26,959 --> 00:28:29,739
I'll explain everything later, alright?

375
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,840
Jin Hua. Do me a favor.

376
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:51,760
Use your feet to brace the door like I'm doing.

377
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,380
It's so heavy.

378
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,000
Make sure the door doesn't close.

379
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,320
Got it.

380
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,360
Grab the rope tight so you can push with your feet.

381
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,340
Just you?

382
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,620
I...

383
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,520
Qing Shan!

384
00:29:23,317 --> 00:29:24,720
- Qing Shan! 
 - Don't blame me for this.

385
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,360
- Stop right now! 
 - I didn't mean to. Don't blame me.

386
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,120
Hong Sha!

387
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,160
What's going on?

388
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,200
Chubby?

389
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,780
I...

390
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,860
Cao Jin Hua, don't let him untie!

391
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,307
Mu Dai, they can't hold on much longer up there.

392
00:29:59,307 --> 00:30:00,720
Can you do a gecko-on-the-wall climb?

393
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,560
Not really. I can't climb fast enough.

394
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,440
Use the rope then.

395
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,260
Give me the rope!

396
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:11,020
Don't blame me for this.

397
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,420
- Is the backpack fully packed? 
 - Yes.

398
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,500
Turn your back to me!

399
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,440
Ya Feng. I... I'm fine.

400
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,920
You don't need to check on me.

401
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,300
Ya Feng, I know you're a good girl.

402
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,520
You...

403
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,300
Stop pulling! There are people down there, Ya Feng.

404
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,080
God, someone save me!

405
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,140
Chubby!

406
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:18,520

Take her down.

411
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,960
Who's stronger? I'll fight them.

412
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,705
The woman.

413
00:31:31,705 --> 00:31:34,040

Hey, are you guys done fighting?

432
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,200
Hello?

433
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,500
Did you forget about me?

434
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:39,300
How about pulling up your savior?

435
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,360
Behave.

436
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:22,860
You're not that old, but you're quite scheming.

437
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,700
You won't get anything from me.

438
00:34:33,051 --> 00:34:36,760
- Are you all right? 
 - I swear I'll... I...

439
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,280
You're done for. Just you wait.

440
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,050
Where's Qing Shan?

441
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:44,700
- He ran away in the chaos. 
 - Ran away?

442
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,920
It's fine. Didn't you say she was the real host?

443
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,920
That Qing Shan guy is just a small fry. Doesn't matter.

444
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,520
Let's extract the relic of ill omen.

445
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,920
- Where's Thirteen-Thousand? 
 - In your car.

446
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,420
He was buried alive by Qing Shan.

447
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:01,265
He was badly hurt, so I didn't let him come.

448
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,280
Sorry, everyone.

449
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,680
My cousin... I'll beat him senseless when I see him.

450
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,940
Buried... Buried alive?

451
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,580
How did that even happen?

452
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,040
Sister Cao, thank you for your help.

453
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,120
You should go home first later.

454
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,920
Oh, and please keep this to yourself.

455
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,040
We don't need complications.

456
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,000
You... You should go home and rest.

457
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,660
Let's go.

458
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,960
Jenny, we'll contact you when we need insurance.

459
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,140
Really?

460
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,680
- Let's get out of here first. 
 - That's great. Please contact me.

461
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,040
Ask me anything if you don't understand.

462
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,520
All right.

463
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,680
Why is he here?

464
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,240
Could it be...

465
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,960
Fiery?

Wait, no.

483
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,300

♫  Following the traces left behind  ♫

495
00:38:34,077 --> 00:38:36,560
♫  If you were me  ♫

496
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:43,960
♫  You'd understand every tear of mine  ♫

497
00:38:44,765 --> 00:38:45,880
♫  (The reason they fall)  ♫

498
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,383
♫  If I were you  ♫

499
00:38:48,383 --> 00:38:55,400
♫  I'd feel each breath you take  ♫

500
00:38:56,147 --> 00:38:57,807
♫  Then we'd move forward  ♫

501
00:38:57,807 --> 00:39:02,243
♫  The sky splits the dawn's horizon  ♫

502
00:39:02,243 --> 00:39:06,639
♫  It's telling me the end  ♫

503
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:10,960
♫  (The end) Is about to gently appear  ♫

504
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:18,003
♫  Like a whisper in my mind, a fleeting touch across my face  ♫

505
00:39:18,835 --> 00:39:20,963
♫  Yet I find myself in the dark  ♫

506
00:39:20,963 --> 00:39:25,579
♫  The sky splits the dawn's horizon  ♫

507
00:39:25,579 --> 00:39:29,850
♫  It's telling me the end  ♫

508
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:34,300
♫  (The end) Is about to gently appear  ♫

509
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:41,340
♫  Like a whisper in my mind, a fleeting touch across my face  ♫

510
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:47,530
♫  Yet I find myself in the dark  ♫

511
00:39:56,142 --> 00:40:00,669
♫  The sky splits the dawn's horizon  ♫

512
00:40:00,669 --> 00:40:04,897
♫  It's telling me the end  ♫

513
00:40:04,897 --> 00:40:09,311
♫  (The end) Is about to gently appear  ♫

514
00:40:09,311 --> 00:40:16,460
♫  Like a whisper in my mind, a fleeting touch across my face  ♫

515
00:40:17,195 --> 00:40:21,285
 ♫ And I remain in darkness ♫
