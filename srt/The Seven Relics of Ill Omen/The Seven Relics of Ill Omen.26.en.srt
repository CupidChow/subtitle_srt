5
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,740
Handsome.

6
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,420
You look handsome.

7
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,220
Yin, turn around.

8
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,180
Turn around. That's right.

9
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,580
This is the famous stargazer,

10
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,420
Mr. Yin.

11
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,740
How about

12
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,260
you give an introduction?

13
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:24,900
This is

14
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,660
the Stargazing Platform.

15
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,180
It's a huge stone.

16
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,260
According to Kun, it's...

17
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,340
Stone from the...

18
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,620
Stone from the sky.

19
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,180
It's scarce.

20
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,660
Something like a meteorite.

21
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,340
And this is

22
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,980
the Magic Hole.

23
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,220
Inside the hole,

24
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,340
the stars are reflected.

25
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,780
Let's take a look.

26
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,900
Yin, smile.

27
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,140
Don't be so serious.

28
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,140
Six stars.

29
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,620
Mingshan.

30
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:15,900
Hi, Mingshan.

31
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,460
There you are, Dai.

32
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,900
How is Master?

33
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,300
She took her medicine and fell asleep.

34
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,500
Don't worry. She's all right.

35
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,820
I told her you would arrive.

36
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,540
She said she wouldn't wait.

37
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,620
She's the master, after all.

38
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:33,860
Don't worry.

39
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,820
Tomorrow morning, you'll serve her tea.

40
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:36,420
Okay.

41
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,100
Mingshan,

42
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,820
you have a new look, huh?

43
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,220
I don't.

44
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,500
I haven't washed my hair.

45
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:46,940
So I used a hood.

46
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,100
Or Master would keep nagging.

47
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,620
How have you been?

48
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,140
Who is this?

49
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,580
My...

50
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:57,820
My disciple.

51
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,500
Actually, we met before.

52
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,220
You may not remember me.

53
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,020
I'm Cao,

54
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,020
Cao Yanhua.

55
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,420
You're my senior master.

56
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,300
I'll learn from you then.

57
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,260
You aren't experienced yet.

58
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,900
How could you have a disciple so early?

59
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,180
There's a procedure for disciples.

60
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,420
You get famous,

61
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,860
set up a sect, and then take disciples.

62
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,620
Why are you doing this backward?

63
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,580
You took a disciple quite early.

64
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,700
And who is this?

65
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,140
My...

66
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,180
My boyfriend.

67
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,140
Have martial arts, huh?

68
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,420
He's good.

69
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:20,340
Master,

70
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,420
let's not stand here.

71
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,460
Shall we get in?

72
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:23,980
You can't get in

73
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,020
just as you wish.

74
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,540
It depends on what you can do.

75
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:30,580
Come on.

76
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:33,940
Right here,

77
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,740
kick over the bowl

78
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,060
and you'll get in.

79
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:41,820
Well...

80
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,940
Is it appropriate?

81
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,060
You haven't eaten a lot.

82
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,220
The food will be wasted.

83
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,140
Does it count?

84
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,060
What do you think?

85
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,740
Sorry.

86
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,580
What else can you do?

87
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,780
Bring it on.

88
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,860
Do the best you can.

89
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,340
I will, then.

90
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,540
You're here, Grandmaster.

91
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,780
The bowl isn't flipped.

92
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,220
You lost.

93
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,300
What a waste of your muscle.

94
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,460
Next one.

95
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:43,740
Hey,

96
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,420
it's my first time here.

97
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,900
How could I kick over your bowl?

98
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,660
Enjoy the food.

99
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,740
You're polite

100
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,380
and you behave.

101
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,100
Come in with me.

102
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,020
What?

103
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:09,900
Are you kidding me?

104
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,060
It's not about martial arts

105
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,540
but manners, huh?

106
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,420
This is unfair.

107
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,460
Tonight,

108
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,900
you two will live here.

109
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,580
Get the quilts yourselves.

110
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,180
In the wardrobe, I think.

111
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,580
If you can't find any,

112
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,820
just make do with it.

113
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,420
Dai will live in the backyard

114
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,700
just like before.

115
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:51,700
Mingshan,

116
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:52,740
only one bed?

117
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,460
Another one is in the inner room.

118
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:56,780
Let's go.

119
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,220
Quilt delivery?

120
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,740
A girl really cares for her boyfriend.

121
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,540
Glad I have some wine.

122
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,340
Yuris!

123
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,180
What's wrong?

124
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,580
What happened, Ren?

125
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,500
I dreamed of Yuris.

126
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,380
Leopard is here.

127
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,060
She'll take revenge.

128
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,340
Are you scared?

129
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,060
Leopard.

130
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,100
I lost to her twice.

131
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,500
She took away those I cared most for.

132
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,860
I watched her kill them

133
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,820
and couldn't do anything.

134
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,980
Back then, I was so powerless.

135
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,900
I'm getting scared
even before I see her.

136
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,580
She's the demon in my mind.

137
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,740
There was a demon in my mind too.

138
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,860
That's a mental barrier.

139
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,180
Just break it down.

140
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,500
Master once said something.

141
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:56,820
I'm saying it now.

142
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,820
We can break down anything.

143
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,020
Let's just do it.

144
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,100

here's your tea.

149

Master, have some tea.

150
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,060
Get up.

151
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,820
Kneeling will tire you out.

152
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,580
I'm nervous.

153
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,100
So am I.

154
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,260
Master,

155
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,180
did you miss me?

156
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,500
If you missed me,

157
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,460
so would I.

158
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,580
If you didn't,

159
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,820
I had no time to think of you either.

160
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,020
I heard you came back

161
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,780

162
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,500
Which one?

163
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,100
Greetings, Grandmaster.

164
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,180
Don't do this.

165
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,900
This isn't my rule.

166
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,060
He is Cao Yanhua.

167
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,620
He's my disciple now.

168

169
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:41,940
forget it.

170
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,060
Hey, don't.

171
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,220
What's good about him?

172
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,180
Oh, him.

173
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,340
He's honest and cute.

174
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,580
He learns from his mistakes.

175
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,900
He's sympathetic

176

In Wujiang,

181

00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,580
I can't lie about this.

183
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,100
I know you hate that most.

184
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,340
Senior Master stole things

185
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,900
and you broke his legs.

186
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,540
Right? Don't be embarrassed.

187
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,700
We deserve this.

188
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,620

Only in this way can we stop.

190
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,740
I stopped.

192
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,500

00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,540
I caught two thieves on the train here

196
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,940
and saved people from losing things.

197
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,900
Times have changed.

198
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,740
Martial arts are fading.

199
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,340
Why do you want to learn?

200
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,460
To be a star.

201
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,420
To earn...

202
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,300
Earn...

203
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,220
When I get famous,

204
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:13,420
I can better promote martial arts.

205
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,860
When I have money, I'll share it

206
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,300
with people in need.

207
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,660
I've had this dream since childhood.

208
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,820
But later,

209
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,180
I went the wrong way.

210
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,220
Luckily, I met my master.

211
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,220
I guess this is what people call

212
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,620
"fate".

213
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:28,900
Something like that.

214
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,220
It's like

215
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,540
she's my heaven-sent savior.

216
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,180
Come over.

217
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,420
Mu Dai, it's your fault.

218
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,860
You didn't teach him a lot.

219
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,740
He can't even do basic moves.

220
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:03,620
Master,

221
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,380
I've been too busy

222
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,460
to teach him.

223
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,180
That's not an excuse.

224
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,380
Why aren't you too busy to eat or sleep?

225
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,380
A master

226
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,940
must be responsible.

227
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,460
Among all relationships,

228
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,700
mentorship ranks fifth.

229
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,180
He calls you Master

230
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,180
and that's not for fun.

231
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:24,940
Grandmaster,

232
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,180
Master taught me something.

233
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,980
I was just too lazy

234
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:29,860
to practice.

235
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,060
I've been busy too.

236
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,380
I run a restaurant.

237
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,340
I'm also busy.

238
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,460
He's a good disciple.

239
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,580
He defends you.

240
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,460
Get up.

241
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:52,860
And who is this?

242
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,100
Hi. I'm Luo Ren.

243
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,140
He's my...

244
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:03,820
Boyfriend.

245
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,180
What's good about him?

246
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:09,780
He...

247
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,940
Nothing special. I just...

248
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,020
I just like him.

249
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,820
In this case,

250
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,180
I won't bother.

251
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,380
Master,

252
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,860
don't embarrass him.

253
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,580
Tell me.

254
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,500
What's good about Mu Dai?

255
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,020
I think

256
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,620
everything is good about her.

257
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,220
Go over there.

258
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,900
Stand beside him and I'll see.

259
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,220
You look perfect together.

260
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:30,860
That wasn't easy, huh?

261
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,500
You're a lucky dog.

262
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,940
She asked me so much

263
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,180
but approved of you quickly.

264
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,420
Do you really think

265
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,660
she approved of me?

266
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:40,900
She didn't?

267
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,740
Mingshan told me

268
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,580
you'd bring back a boyfriend.

269
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,780
I didn't believe it at first.

270
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,500
It's been eight years.

271
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,020
You've grown up.

272
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:31,740
Master,

273
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,820
stay alive and well.

274
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,660
I'll take care of you for many years.

275
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,140
People get sick and die.

276
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,500
That's unavoidable.

277
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,300
Don't be sad.

278
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,260
Everyone is an island on the sea.

279
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:52,300
Islands appear and sink.

280
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,580
You just appeared later than me

281
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,700
and I will sink before you.

282
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:02,940
Master,

283
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,380
do you not like Luo Ren?

284
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,380
If I don't,

285
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,860
will you break up?

286
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,420
He may be a good guy.

287
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,060
I know you brought him here

288
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,100
for my approval.

289
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,460
But sadly,

290
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,820
I have no time to know him or like him.

291
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,580
Instead of Luo Ren,

292
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,100
I would rather rely on you.

293
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,220
Rely on me?

294
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,780
About what?

295
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,100
In the past,

296
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,740
when a girl got married,

297
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:50,140
her mother gave her a lot of advice.

298
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,180
But I'm too old.

299
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,820
I won't make it

300
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,980
to your wedding.

301
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,940
You've brought him here.

302
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:58,900
That's good.

303
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,580
There's something

304
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,420
I can tell you now.

305
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,740
I don't know about Luo Ren.

306
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,100
He doesn't satisfy me either.

307
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,900
Mingshan and I think

308
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,140
his background

309
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,700
may be much more complicated.

310
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:23,780
In the future,

311
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,340
you may marry Luo Ren

312
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:29,460
or someone else.

313
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,500
But however good that guy is,

314
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,980
do not rely on him.

315
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,820
Whatever the circumstances,

316
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,340
be yourself.

317
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:37,980
You're Mu Dai

318
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,220
before you're my disciple

319
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,580
or some guy's wife.

320
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,460
Only when you're confident enough

321
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,860
will you attract others.

322
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,700
If you like him,

323
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,100
stay with him.

324
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,220
If one day,

325
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,180
you think you have the wrong husband,

326
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,740
then leave him

327
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,100
and get a better one.

328
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,140
As the old saying goes,
"A bad marriage ruins any life."

329
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,620
That's nonsense.

330
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,140
In this case,

331
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,540
you can just break up.

332
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,020
Follow your heart

333
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,700
and you won't be scared of anything.

334
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,340
If he bullies you,

335
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,740
give him a good lesson.

336
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:14,980
If you can't beat him,

337
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,420
ask Mingshan and your disciple for help.

338
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,460
I'm tired

339
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,500
after this long speech.

340
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,140
After dinner,

341
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,380
come to my room.

342
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,460
I'll talk to you

343
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,940
about the inheritance.

344
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,620
Hey, Aoki.

345
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:54,940
Everything's ready.

346
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,220
As you requested,

347
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,260
I settled Mr. Zheng and Pingting

348
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,940
in a secret place nearby.

349
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:01,980
I'm guarding the bar

350
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:03,980
and protecting your friends.

351
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,020
Thanks.

352
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,700
Any news on Leopard?

353
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:09,700
No.

354
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,540
But an informer told me

355
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,260
Leopard's minions

356
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,700
came to our country over a year ago.

357
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,980
Over a year ago?

358
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,140
Weird, isn't it?

359
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,860
They didn't give you trouble.

360
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,740
They went to a place

361
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,540
named Xiacheng Town

362
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,660
and stayed for months.

363
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,020
Xiacheng Town?

364
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,740
Why did they go there?

365
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,180
I'm not sure.

366
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,860
That's a small town.

367
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,540
The biggest news

368
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,860
was a murder.

369
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,460
But they didn't do that.

370
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:39,900
The murderer ran away.

371
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,460
What else do you know?

372
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,060
And...

373
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,300
Mr. Zhang.

374
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,180
How dare you?

375
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,140
You got into the room!

376
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:47,660
Very well.

377
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,460
I'll show you who's in charge.

378
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,300
And what kind of friends do you have?

379
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,380
Friends?

380
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,660
They stay around a pheasant.

381
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,260
I'll stew it sooner or later.

382
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,620
Mr. Zhang, it's just a pheasant.

383
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,460
Don't be angry with its noises.

384
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,860
It was crowing all night.

385
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,820
Without a punishment, it won't stop.

386
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,540
Stop right there!

387
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:07,860
You know what this is?

388
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,500
Yes.

389
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,740
This is a knife.

390
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,060
The pheasant has a thin neck.

391
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:11,980
When I cut it,

392
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,020
it will die immediately.

393
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:13,740
Yes, yes.

394
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:14,500
Understand?

395
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,500
Yes, yes.

396
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,940
Then make it nod.

397
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:17,780
Make it nod.

398
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:19,780
It understands now.

399
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,460
It really does.

400
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,180
No more crowing tonight.

401
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,660
Or I'll just kill it.

402
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,620
I mean what I say.

403
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,340
Don't worry. It won't crow anymore.

404
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,860
If it crows again, you...

405
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:30,940
just kill me.

406
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,540
I crowed.

407
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,180
Bad pheasant.

408
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:45,300
It was almost killed.

409
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,260
Yin.

410
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:07,820
Does this look like Tiankui Seven-Star?

411
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,220
When it grows, it'll be like...

412
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,060
Will it grow like this?

413
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,060
Or like this?

414
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:15,900
No idea.

415
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,660
I see that now.

416
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:24,220
You're not good at lying.

417
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,900
Your ancestors didn't only

418
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,980
treat the Great Virtuous One for dinner.

419
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,100
And you don't watch the stars
just for a hobby thing.

420
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:33,900
Who told you?

421
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:36,860
What I've told you

422
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,060
is true.

423
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,380
From a scientific perspective,

424
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,660
when you were talking,

425
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,860
you avoided eye contact.

426
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,100
Your voice trailed off

427
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:46,980
and sounded uncertain.

428
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,420
And your head tossed all the time.

429
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,300
So, you must have lied!

430
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:52,620
Fine.

431
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,500
You're smart.

432
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,220
You know everything, okay?

433
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,060
Come on, Yin.

434
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,140
Hey, brother. We're good buddies.

435
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,020
Now, you and I

436
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,700
even share a bed.

437
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,780
Tell me about it.

438
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,780
Where are the relics of ill omen from?

439
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,060
The imperishable wood

440
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:10,940
and Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle.

441
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,140
Where on earth are they?

442
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,420
I don't know.

443
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,620
Six stars are lit now!

444
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,900
What about the seventh?

445
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,300
What will happen?

446
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,620
What can we do?

447
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,500
You...

448
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:24,620
Kun.

449
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,340
I can't tell you.

450
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,740
Don't push me.

451
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,820
You know everything

452
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,940
but you don't tell me.

453
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,260
Yin,

454
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,460
you broke my heart!

455
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,780
That is to say,

456
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,780
he does know a lot.

457
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,420
Yin Erma is an honest guy.

458
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,740
He...

459
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,740
He won't confess, anyway.

460
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,260
I believe he has a reason.

461
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:16,860
What do we do then?

462
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,860
I'll just keep asking him.

463
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,340
As the old saying goes,

464
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,500
perseverance will prevail.

465
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,660
I'll keep asking him.

466
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,780
Eventually, I'll get some information.

467
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,020
Is the map ready?

468
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,300
Wait a minute.

469
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,460
Okay. There you go.

470
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,540
These days, when I was

471
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,820
studying the map,

472
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,140
something occurred to me.

473
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,620
You map out

474
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,020
the location of Xiaoshang River,

475
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,180
Wuzhu Village,

476
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,060
Yueliang Mountain, Nantian,

477
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,820
and Cao Village.

478
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,460
Done.

479
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:55,940
What can you see?

480
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,220
Five dots.

481
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,540
Get a picture of Tiankui Seven-Star

482
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,620
and compare them.

483
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,420
What is it with Tiankui Seven-Star?

484
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,940
Tiankui...

485
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:11,700
Wait a minute.

486
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,220
[Mr. Kun]
The shape...

487
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:24,740
Indeed.

488
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,260
The positions of the stars

489
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,220
look like the locations

490
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,740
where we found

491
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,100
the relics of ill omen

492
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,020
in real life.

493
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,380
The same, actually.

494
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:37,740
So,

495
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,420
based on Tiankui Seven-Star,

496
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,820
we may figure out

497
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,420
the location of the last two relics
of ill omen.

498
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,940
Check the map again.

499
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:46,740
Find Jiang Province.

500
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,180
Southeast.

501
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,460
Highlight it.

502
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,820
On this scale,

503
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,900
the sixth star

504
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:56,820
is there.

505
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,940
Over a year ago,

506
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,420
it was lit.

507
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,940
Suddenly, it went dark.

508
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,380
The other day, it was lit again.

509
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,540
Really weird.

510
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,820
The seventh star...

511
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,860
Figure it out the same way.

512
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,220
You need no more instruction, huh?

513
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,060
Leopard's minions

514
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,460
came to our country over a year ago.

515
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,220
They went to a place

516
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,540
[Xiacheng Town]
named Xiacheng Town.

517
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:25,940
Xiacheng Town?

518
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,260
What's special about it?

519
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,740
Aoki just called me.

520
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,700
He said one of Leopard's minions

521
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,100
went there a year and a half ago

522
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,500
and stayed for a long time.

523
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,820
A year and a half ago,

524
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,820
six stars were lit.

525
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,900
Suddenly, one went dark.

526
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,620
When I took revenge on Leopard,

527
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,860
she was badly shot.

528
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,380
And she lost one of her eyes.

529
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,340
We believed she was dead.

530
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:49,980
But now, she's in our country.

531
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,500
And as soon as she arrived,

532
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:54,420
the sixth star appeared.

533
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,020
That is to say,

534
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,740
the sixth relic of ill omen

535
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,580
was taken to Heisha over a year ago.

536
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,220
Now, Leopard has brought it back.

537
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,500
Beautiful fog, indeed.

538
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:16,580
My sect is in such a wonderful place.

539
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:17,980
The fog...

540
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,580
It feels like it's hiding something.

541
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,340
Luo,

542
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,100
sometimes,

543
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,580
you're just too pessimistic.

544
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,700
Look at me.

545
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,940
I used to be nothing.

546
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,940
But things would work out.

547
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,740
My master took me in.

548
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,300
Then I worried

549
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,340
if I would be accepted in my sect.

550
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,020
Then smoothly,

551
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,980
I passed all the tests.

552
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:44,780
Oh,

553
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,860
I'll make the bed for my master.

554
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,420
Make the bed?

555
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,180
Senior Master asked me to.

556
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,580
Disciples used to make the bed.

557
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,260
Well, we don't need to care

558
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,740
for such unnecessary formalities.

559
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,940
But I still think...

560
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,460
Um...

561
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,860
I should

562
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,900
make the bed all night.

563
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,020
Think about it.

564
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,700
I'm quite shy.

565
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:08,100
When I get into my master's bedroom,

566
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,660
I'll be quite nervous.

567
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,580
Can it be

568
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,740
another test?

569
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,100
Make the bed?

570
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,740
All night?

571
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,620
Come, Mu Dai, my disciple.

572
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:40,740
Actually,

573
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,420
I've been wondering

574
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,940
if I should leave this duty to you.

575
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,940
After all, it's selfish of me

576
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,220
to make you keep an unrelated secret.

577
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,220
But I promised my master

578
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,020
that I would pass it down.

579
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,620
Now,

580
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,220
I'm dying.

581
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,420
So, I have to count on you.

582
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,260
Master.

583
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,820
Master, don't say that.

584
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,940
You taught me how to fight and live.

585
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,900
I'll do anything for you.

586
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,500
Please don't say you're selfish

587
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,740
or you have to count on me.

588
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,460
I don't deserve that.

589
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,940
Actually, a small sect

590
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,580
doesn't have too much heritage.

591
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,660
But anyway,

592
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,300
even if there's only one member,

593
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,780
we should follow our rules

594
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,380
and take responsibility.

595
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,380
From now on,

596
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,460
you have to be cautious.

597
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,500
You must keep this secret

598
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:33,380
even from the closest people.

599
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,220
Even if life is hopeless,

600
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:38,660
you'll have to live on for this duty.

601
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,420
Can you do this?

602
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,180
Yes.

603
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:47,580
We're the Plum Blossom Sect.

604
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:51,500
The founder was Meihua Yizhao.

605
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,140
Meihua Yizhao?

606
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,220
You're Meihua Jiuniang.

607
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:00,740
Master,

608
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,860
are we supposed to be named

609
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,580
after our sect?

610
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:07,060
Should I be Meihua Shimu?

611
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,180
If you want that,

612
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,420
I won't interfere.

613
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,300
Back to business.

614
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:14,860
Later,

615
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,220
our founder abandoned this name

616
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,820
and renamed our sect

617
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,060
"Guansi Memorial Archway".

618
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,700
Guansi Memorial Archway?

619
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,620
What a weird name.

620
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,060
Open the secret compartment in my bed.

621
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,460
Open it and see.

622
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:53,740
Bat?

623
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,540
Look carefully.

624
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:59,140
What is on this bat?

625
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,300
A wooden kite.

626
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,340
Yes.

627
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,100
Have you heard

628
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,860
of the grandmaster of carpenters?

629
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,860
There are many legends about him.

630
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,180
Even Bo Yangzi, the Great Virtuous One,

631
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,860
was his good friend.

632
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,300
He was really ingenious,

633
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,300
and once made a wooden kite

634
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:23,340
that flew three days and nights
without landing.

635
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,180
There's a wooden kite on this bat.

636
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:27,860
Is it...?

637
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:28,740
Yes.

638
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,340
It's the logo of him.

639
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,420
In today's words,

640
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,980
it's his signature.

641
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,260
So, it's an antique.

642
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,580
Can it really...?

643
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,060
Fly up to the sky?

644
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:41,980
Yes.

645
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:45,420
Don't underestimate
the wisdom of the ancients.

646
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,260
This is

647
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,980
the Silver-Eyed Bat.

648
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:54,380
It's also half a map and half a key.

649
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:57,580
Someone else keeps the other halves.

650
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:59,100
Only when they become one

651
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:01,780
can we open the gate
of Guansi Memorial Archway.

652
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,740
According to my master,

653
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,100
a wild goose will fly south.

654
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,980
One day, a message will come

655
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,060
with the other half of the map and key

656
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,340
from the north.

657
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,380
By then,

658
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,300
the Silver-Eyed Bat will take me

659
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,860
to see the real Guansi Memorial Archway.

660
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,420
Mu Dai,

661
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,780
the messenger hasn't come
in my lifetime.

662
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,180
In your lifetime,

663
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,220
you may not see him either.

664
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,220
But I beg you.

665
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,300
Guard this house

666
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,340
and wait for the message from the north.

667
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,340
Mu Dai.

668
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,620
Take the food on the table

669
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:44,820
and go with me.

670
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:46,940
Are we going far?

671
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,220
Mu Dai.

672
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:14,140
Lift the left wing three times

673
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,100
and press the right one four times.

674
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:46,660
Master,

675
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,020
now I understand

676
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,860
why you call it a living map.

677
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,700
This is unbelievable.

678
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,540
When I walked

679
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,140
along this way with my master,

680
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:57,940
I said the same thing.

681
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,540
This mountain behind Youwu Town

682
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,140
is foggy all year round.

683
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,540
The magnetic field is weird.

684
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,540
Phones and drones

685
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,660
won't work in here at night.

686
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,460
Even in daylight,

687
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,900
they can't work very well.

688
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:14,820
Maybe

689
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,300
this is why

690
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,780
the Silver-Eyed Bat was made.

691
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,620
It won't fail.

692
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,900
It only follows the fixed path.

693
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,020
Master,

694
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,500
are you tired?

695
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,380
The distance is nothing.

696
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,420
I'm full of energy.

697
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,660
I can even fight now.

698
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,300
No one has challenged me
in thirty years.

699
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,740
Boring, indeed.

700
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,940
A martial artist

701
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,460
can't have a cool fight

702
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,980
before dying.

703
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,780
What a shame!

704
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,740
How about I tell Mingshan

705
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,540
and Luo Ren to come?

706
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,820
We can fight you.

707
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,020
Not interested.

708
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,940
You guys are no match for me.

709
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,300
Master,

710
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,380
someone's here.

711
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,460
I know.

712
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,020
You go alone now.

713
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,060
The Silver-Eyed Bat never waits.

714
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,340
But Master...

715
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:22,460
Go.

716
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,300
Did you make the bed?

717
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:41,900
Yes.

718
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,660
It looks perfect

719
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,940
even without a ruffle.

720
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,460
You're hardworking, Chubby.

721
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,620
I'm hardworking?

722
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,220
Then you're romantic, Luo Ren.

723
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,460
What?

724
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,700
If my master ends up with you,

725
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,500
she'll be really happy.

726
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,300
What were you thinking?

727
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,580
Why did you put it on her pillow?

728
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,380
Pillow?

729
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:09,860
What's on it?

730
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,260
Come on.

731
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,340
Nothing.

732
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,980
You didn't put it. I did, okay?

733
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:15,940
I put it there.

734
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,940
What is on Mu Dai's pillow?

735
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,620
Didn't you put a flower there?

736
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,140
What flower?

737
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:40,860
A rose.

738
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,300
You didn't put that?

739
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:48,660
Senior Master?

740
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:58,500
What's going on here?

741
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:04,780
Didn't you put it here?

742
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,180
Why are you going in there?

743
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:11,620
You should have knocked.

744
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,300
I think it's all right.

745
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,660
They haven't seen each other
for a long time.

746
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,780
So, he gave her a rose.

747
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,420
What are you doing in my master's room?

748
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,980
Do you know where Mu Dai has gone?

749
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,100
Do I have to tell you?

750
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,860
She's safe with Master.

751
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,140
And my master doesn't want strangers

752
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,740
to break into her room.

753
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:49,580
Go out!

754
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,260
Mingshan,

755
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:53,900
I have an enemy.

756
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,460
She's trying to take revenge.

757
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,260
This rose is her mark.

758
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,580
It was found on Mu Dai's pillow.

759
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,580
Luo Ren, who do you think you are?

760
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,140
What makes you think

761
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,380
you can break in here?

762
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,100
Out!

763
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:11,780
Mingshan,

764
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,340
Mu Dai and her master aren't here.

765
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,580
Something must be wrong.

766
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,660
What could be wrong?

767
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,020
Nothing would be wrong.

768
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:18,820
Master is there.

769
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:19,900
You have no idea.

770
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,100
My enemy is fierce.

771
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,140
Where's the back of the mountain?

772
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,540
Tell me.

773
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,940
Tonight,

774
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,220
Master will give authority to Dai.

775
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,700
It can't be done in front of strangers.

776
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:34,540
So,

777
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,460
you just wait here.

778
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,580
And look. It's dark out there.

779
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:39,620
It's foggy too.

780
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,180
The mountain roads are tough.

781
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,500
With this little equipment,

782
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:43,740
you can't go too far.

783
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,060
Just stay here.

784
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:46,740
Fine.

785
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,300
I'll go myself.

786
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:49,540
You...

787
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:53,940
Let him go.

788
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,580
I'll try to persuade him.

789
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,700
How conceited.

790
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,020
You'll return within half an hour.

791
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,020
Luo.

792
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,500
Hey, Luo.

793
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,700
Listen to me.

794
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,580
You have to trust Senior Master.

795
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,860
It's late and foggy out there.

796
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,580
A stranger like you will get lost.

797
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:24,740
And you can see

798
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,220
my grandmaster isn't an ordinary lady.

799
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,380
Have confidence in her.

800
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,860
Leopard isn't ordinary either.

801
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,340
She may have a relic of ill omen.

802
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,420
