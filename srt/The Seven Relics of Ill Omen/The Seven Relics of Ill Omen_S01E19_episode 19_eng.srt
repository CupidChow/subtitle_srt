1
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,040
   

2
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:24,100



3
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,290
   

4
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:06,020
   

5
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:09,500
   

6
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,900
 When I chased out of the rice fields with Thirteen-Thousand and the others, 

7
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,860
 we found this house nearby. 

8
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,160
 This must be where she lives. 

9
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,720
Luo Ren and the rest are waiting outside.

10
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,760
They said to call them anytime if we need backup.

11
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,240
What do you want?

12
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,940
What are you trying to do?

13
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,040
What do you want?

14
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,740
All right, come in.

15
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,860
The relic of ill omen was just removed.

16
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,480
Without its support, she's very weak right now.

17
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,560
She'll recover in a couple of days.

18
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,800
Do you remember having a daughter?

19
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,660
Then, you abandoned her.

20
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,780
You left her at the orphanage gate. Do you remember?

21
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,680
Remember?

22
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,720
You don't remember?

23
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,380
How could you forget something so important?

24
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,800
Maybe it's better that you don't.

25
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:24,380
I came here to tell you that she suffered terribly in the orphanage.

26
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,080
She died of an illness.

27
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,020
Quite pitiful.

28
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,900
Mu Dai.

29
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,380
Luo Ren said Xiang Si Lan needs time to recover.

30
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,080
So, we'll take turns watching over her during this period

31
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,240
to avoid any complications.

32
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,880
How fortunate she is to have people take shifts to care for her.

33
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,720
What's your next move?

34
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,380
What do you mean?

35
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,060
Well, how do you plan to handle things with your mother?

36
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:38,000
Are you staying here to live with her, or taking her back to Lixi?

37
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,720
I came to settle things with her.

38
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,200
But she's your mother.

39
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,000
So?

40
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,640
Does that make her my responsibility?

41
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,440
When she abandoned me, why didn't she consider me hers?

42
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,220
Mu Dai, that's not what I meant.

43
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,440
Mu Dai.

44
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,360
Mu Dai.

45
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:18,200
Hong Sha is worried. She thinks she offended you.

46
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:23,560
When you asked Xiang Si Lan whether she had abandoned a daughter

47
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,320
if she had shown even a hint of regret,

48
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,620
would you have felt a bit better?

49
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,860
I never had any expectations of her.

50
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,240
I'm pathetic, right?

51
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,480
The person I was so desperate to find never cared about me.

52
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,960
What was the point of finding her?

53
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,560
Mu Dai, don't jump to conclusions.

54
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,900
The relic of ill omen has only just left her body.

55
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,120
Her memories might still be fragmented.

56
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,860
There's something I haven't told you.

57
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,100
After I arrived in Nantian,

58
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,720
Huo Zi Hong kept calling to ask about you.

59
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,200
And Uncle Zhang too.

60
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,680
They've always cared deeply for you.

61
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,600
Mu Dai...

62
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,460
some people may not share your blood,

63
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,160
but for 20 years,

64
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,980
she has done everything

65
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,920
to learn how to care for you like a mother.

66
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,920
The love you lost matters.

67
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,080
But you can't keep dwelling on it.

68
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,440
You have to believe the heavens love you.

69
00:06:54,061 --> 00:06:56,041
The flowers they withhold,

70
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,840
they make up for with stars.

71
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,200
 Mu Dai, I know the lost relationship is a pity. 

72
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,100
 But you can't keep dwelling on it. 

73
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,600
 Some people may not share your blood, 

74
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,360
 but for 20 years, 

75
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,220
 she has done everything to learn how to be a mother. 

76
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,840
 Hey, Hong Sha. 

77
00:08:28,726 --> 00:08:31,840
 Hello? Hong Sha, say something. 

78
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,640
Auntie Hong.

79
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,080
 Oh, Mu Dai. 

80
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,200
It's me.

81
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,000
 Mu Dai, where are you? 

82
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,600
 How have you been? 

83
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,400
 Are you all right? 

84
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,720
 Are you hurt? Is that why you called? 

85
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,340
 Why did it take you so long to reach out? 

86
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,140
 Say something, Mu Dai. Hello? 

87
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:57,020
Auntie Hong, are you all right?

88
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,660
I'm fine.

89
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,340
Don't worry about me.

90
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,720
I am doing great. Everything's great.

91
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,560
 The bar's business is thriving. 

92
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,860
 I'm just worried about you. 

93
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,260
 How are you? 

94
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,420
 Are you staying healthy? 

95
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,840
 Does the food there suit you? 

96
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,260
 Do you have enough money? 

97
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,720
 If not, just tell me. 

98
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,920
I'm doing well, too.

99
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,260
Don't worry too much about me.

100
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:30,420
 I'm really reassured you're well. 

101
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,980
 - All right.  
 - All right.

102
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:57,020
That girl who questioned me last time is not here today?

103
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,040
Is she your girlfriend?

104
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,480
Yes.

105
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,000
Last time, she asked if I had

106
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,520
abandoned my daughter at an orphanage.

107
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,780
She said my daughter died long ago.

108
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,880
Actually,

109
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,944
she's my daughter, right?

110
00:10:31,134 --> 00:10:33,214
Yes.

111
00:10:34,429 --> 00:10:36,640
It's her.

112
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,540
Let's talk about you first.

113
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:42,400
Do you know what's been inside you all these years?

114
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,740
Of course, it's something good.

115
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,160
Something good?

116
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,620
It treated me well.

117
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:56,880
It helped me do things I never could before.

118
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,160
Like spreading rumors? Lying?

119
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,172
What do you mean, lying?

120
00:11:03,172 --> 00:11:05,879
People love to spout nonsense.

121
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:10,920
Like, "You spat in the soup pot."

122
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,620
"You dripped blood into the stew."

123
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,740
They all lied.

124
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:18,360
Why not blame them for the harm?

125
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,860
Yet, you're putting all the blame on it.

126
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,620
Let me ask you something else.

127
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:30,620
Did you target us because the relic of ill omen didn't work on us?

128
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,760
Not entirely.

129
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,620
A man told me to do it.

130
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,120
A man?

131
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,520
He was...

132
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,760
I remembered him just now.

133
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,072
He told me...

134
00:11:53,072 --> 00:11:55,060
What did he say?

135
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,460
He said...

136
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:04,620
This game wasn't for me alone.

137
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,960
Others were waiting their turn.

138
00:12:13,662 --> 00:12:15,072
 What?  
    

139
00:12:15,072 --> 00:12:16,593
 A game? 

140
00:12:16,593 --> 00:12:18,308
 And others? 

141
00:12:18,308 --> 00:12:20,208
 Tell me in detail. 

142
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,865
 Don't take it seriously. 

143
00:12:24,865 --> 00:12:30,120
Xiang Si Lan might've made it up to mess with us after we caught her.

144
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,480
No. That night, she said,

145
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,860
"With him gone, the game just got more interesting."

146
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,300
 This is getting stranger. 

147
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,180
Anyway, we need to stay sharp.

148
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,300
One more thing.

149
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:53,240
Mu Dai, Xiang Si Lan knows you're her daughter now.

150
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,860
She wants to see you alone.

151
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:54,060
I heard a wealthy woman adopted you.

152
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,820
A businesswoman.

153
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,800
Look at how I live.

154
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,120
I'm frail now.

155
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,900
Don't know if I can have some comfort

156
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,740
in my final days?

157
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,420
You abandoned me, and now you expect filial piety?

158
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:21,020
But think about your boyfriend,

159
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,420
and your rich adoptive mother.

160
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,640
If I hadn't abandoned you,

161
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,720
you'd never have had such opportunities.

162
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,740
Then, I thank you for your selflessness.

163
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:42,540
Abandoned children owe their birth parents nothing.

164
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,600
You'll get not a cent from me.

165
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,940
You have to give me money.

166
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,960
Why?

167
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,040
Because you're not my real child.

168
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,380
What?

169
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:13,460
I might as well tell you the truth.

170
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:17,520
Actually, you were a child I found.

171
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,980
Remember that old bridge?

172
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,620
One night on my way home,

173
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,820
I heard a child crying beneath it.

174
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,660
I went down and found you there.

175
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,440
Just a towel wrapped around you.

176
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,660
If I hadn't taken you in,

177
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,460
you'd have frozen to death under that bridge.

178
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,940
Had you really been that kind?

179
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:47,000
I don't do charity.

180
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,160
A single woman struggles to get by.

181
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:56,760
I figured a child might earn me some sympathy.

182
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,140
You were small then.

183
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:03,980
Easy to feed with scraps.

184
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,780
Really?

185
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,960
Then, why abandon me when I grew older?

186
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,920
I could work and I was obedient.

187
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,420
Wouldn't I have been more useful to you?

188
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,200
Why throw me away?

189
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,540
Well...

190
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,180
you started eating more.

191
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,340
Like a bottomless pit.

192
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,620
Impossible to fill.

193
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:28,771
Anyway, I took you in, raised you,

194
00:16:28,771 --> 00:16:33,720
then gave you to a better family.

195
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:38,680
Isn't some compensation...

196
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,600
Fair?

197
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,520
Sounds like she does owe you.

198
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,181
Mu Dai, go wait in the car. I'll handle this.

199
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:58,641
We have unfinished business.

200
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,300
Take the money and stay out of her life.

201
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,500
Let's go.

202
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,240
We won't need to return.

203
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,600
Didn't she want money?

204
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,280
It's settled.

205
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,360
You paid her?

206
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,300
Don't worry. It's resolved.

207
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,560
She's satisfied.

208
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,500
And I didn't lose out.

209
00:18:51,577 --> 00:18:56,000
She told me I'm not her real child.

210
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,680
She found me under a bridge.

211
00:19:01,413 --> 00:19:03,213
How do you feel?

212
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,194
Are you... disappointed?

213
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,320
Well, does anything ever shock you?

214
00:19:19,584 --> 00:19:21,160
How does one "be shocked"?

215
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,100
Show me.

216
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,640
I can't.

217
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,480
Strangely,

218
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,860
hearing that actually made me happy.

219
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:42,560
Like a weight lifted.

220
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,800
As it should.

221
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:52,160
You should save your love for those who deserve it.

222
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,600
Right?

223
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,600
Here, take this back.

224
00:20:07,284 --> 00:20:09,072
Zha Ma's mom gave it to you.

225
00:20:09,072 --> 00:20:12,958
It carries her blessings.

226
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:16,598
Whether to keep it is your choice.

227
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:28,620
♫  A faint light brushes away the dark clouds  ♫

228
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,740
♫  Feeling your heartbeat, a gentle echo shared in this moment  ♫

229
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:42,680
♫  The wind by my ear caresses the dreamscape  ♫

230
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,560
♫  Step by step, we'll awaken a clear sky  ♫

231
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,600
♫  Listen to the cicadas sing afar  ♫

232
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,249
♫  Like echoes guiding me to you  ♫

233
00:20:56,249 --> 00:20:57,980
♫  After the rain washed away the past  ♫

234
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:03,327
♫  The blossoms' whispers linger at last  ♫

235
00:21:03,327 --> 00:21:10,160
♫  In our future, I believe, I believe, I believe love's horizon awaits  ♫

236
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:16,646
♫  I just want to slowly love you with all my hope, oh ~  ♫

237
00:21:16,646 --> 00:21:18,147
You know what, Sister Mu Mu?

238
00:21:18,147 --> 00:21:19,368
Ma Chao woke up.

239
00:21:19,368 --> 00:21:21,100
He admitted he had pushed Zhang Tong.

240
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,060
- Everything's okay now. 
 - Luo Ren told me.

241
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,560
Thank you for caring so much.

242
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,620
Luo Ren? You two made up?

243
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,580
Hard to say.

244
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,580
We'll see. Take this.

245
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,360
♫  I just want to slowly, slowly hold you tight  ♫

246
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,880
Destiny Bar? Lixi?

247
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,500
Come visit when you're free. I'll leave.

248
00:21:41,889 --> 00:21:43,609
Sister Mu Mu.

249
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,310
You seem different from when you first arrived.

250
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,910
Really?

251
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:52,742
How?

252
00:21:52,742 --> 00:21:54,303
Can't pinpoint it.

253
00:21:54,303 --> 00:21:58,103
But I like it either way.

254
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,580
Fiery, have you seen my charger?

255
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:09,115
No. You should've kept track of your stuff.

256
00:22:10,043 --> 00:22:12,383
Where's my hat?

257
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,300
Packed yet?

258
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,522
Almost.

259
00:22:20,522 --> 00:22:22,763
Auntie Hong's throwing Mu Dai a welcome-back tomorrow, right?

260
00:22:22,763 --> 00:22:24,780
- So, we... 
 - Shush.

261
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:28,020
Auntie Hong's planning a surprise. Don't spoil it.

262
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:40,220
There are regrets and pains, yet love persists,

263
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,780
both received and given.

264
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,860
It's actually not bad.

265
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,240
Maybe, you won't need me anymore.

266
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,840
Good.

267
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,121
I've long wanted to distance myself from your friends.

268
00:22:57,121 --> 00:22:59,982
The more time I spent with them, the more I became you. I stopped being myself.

269
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,140
 Get out! 

270
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,380
 You wretch, get lost! 

271
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,820
 Get out! 

272
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,900
 Out! Out! 

273
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,620
 How dare you hit back? 

274
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,780
 Hit back? Keep going, huh. 

275
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:34,152
 - Don't hit my mom! 
 - If you hit back... 

276
00:24:34,152 --> 00:24:37,880
 Stop hitting my mom! 

277
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,540
 What are you staring at? 

278
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,500
 - Mom! 
 - How dare you hit back? 

279
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,920
 Stop hitting my mom! 

280
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,745
 Honey, I love you. 

281
00:24:52,745 --> 00:24:54,781
 Really. 

282
00:24:54,781 --> 00:24:57,180
 Come here. 

283
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,885
 - Come on. Give me a kiss. 
 - I won't! 

284
00:24:59,885 --> 00:25:01,260
 I'll give you money. 

285
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,720
 - Let me go! 
 - We made up already. 

286
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,840
 Let go of me! I won't! 

287
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,600
 You ungrateful little brat! 

288
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,460
 Embarrassing me like this! 

289
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,140
 No, she's just a child. 

290
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,645
 I'll kiss you instead. 

291
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:14,800
 - All right? 
 - Okay. 

292
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,280
 All right. 

293
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,660
 After eating, come with me somewhere. 

294
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,380
 Where are we going? 

295
00:26:06,198 --> 00:26:11,560
 Someplace with no bad guys. 

296
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,160
 Okay. 

297
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,220
 You know what this money is for? 

298
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:24,738
 It's to ensure you never bother her again. 

299
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:33,390
This is best for everyone, isn't it?

300
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,660
   

301
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,140
- That's good! 
 - Make it sturdy.

302
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,540
- Thanks for the hard work. 
 - Got it.

303
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,920
- Master. 
 - Take a look at this.

304
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:57,040
Is Xiao Luo being overly paranoid?

305
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,660
He turned this into a secret chamber.

306
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,680
He has his reasons.

307
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,540
We should try to understand.

308
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,160
That fatty...

309
00:27:05,942 --> 00:27:09,642
Considering our current situation...

310
00:27:09,642 --> 00:27:14,120
Right? Upgrading security against thieves makes sense.

311
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,880
Fair point.

312
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,750
I thought Mu Dai would come.

313
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,790
Didn't expect you two.

314
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,620
So, you still believe Bright Mu Dai and Dark Mu Dai are the same person.

315
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,180
Do you?

316
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,920
Yes.

317
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,340
People just have two sides.

318
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,680
Maybe you're right.

319
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,680
Mu Dai hasn't changed.

320
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,880
That's just her unique way of engaging with the world.

321
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,580
Actually, Dark Mu Dai is kind of cute.

322
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:55,260
Fiery, and reckless.

323
00:27:55,260 --> 00:28:00,260
She's that starved child in Nantian's shabby house,

324
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,340
denied a mother's love.

325
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:07,560
All rage and fists, trusting no one.

326
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,760
Like a stubborn little mushroom. Right?

327
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,880
Uncle Kun is calling.

328
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,485
Hello.

329
00:28:26,485 --> 00:28:29,240
 Uncle Kun, where are you? 

330
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,520
 At Xiagu Pass. 

331
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,000
This place I'm heading to is crucial.

332
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,100
Rumor says the Great Virtuous One left a Stargazing Platform here.

333
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:40,260
I have a hunch that it's a major clue.

334
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:44,800
My dear friends, I must...

335
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:50,980
 I must share this exciting moment with you. 

336
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:56,400
 By the way, what you told me last time 

337
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:00,620
 sparked a bold new theory. 

338
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,620
You mean the case of Xiang Si Lan?

339
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,660
 Yes. 

340
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:09,100
Look, the fact that he could order Xiang Si Lan proves

341
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:13,980
 he and the relic of ill omen are of the same kind. 

342
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,520
 This led me to a deeper realization. 

343
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:21,620
 Do you think there's a hierarchy among the relics of ill omen? 

344
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:27,620
 After consideration, I believe he ranks higher. 

345
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,700
 And he's smart. 

346
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,060
 So, it's very likely that he could organize a rescue. 

347
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,320
 Do you understand what I'm... 

348
00:29:43,765 --> 00:29:45,792
Truly spectacular.

349
00:29:45,792 --> 00:29:50,100
The desolate beauty overwhelms me.

350
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,460
Anyway, stay sharp.

351
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,820
I've got research to do.

352
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,160
Luo Ren got drunk? How?

353
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,000
All that high-proof liquor.

354
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,240
He insisted on downing it in one go. Of course, he's wasted.

355
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,300
Does he have to be this happy after returning from Huacheng?

356
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,900
Luo Ren.

357
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,500
Luo Ren.

358
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,240
What's wrong? Did you cut your hand or get burned?

359
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,480
I got burned.

360
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,100
Chubby said you were drunk.

361
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,620
I was making you sobering tea.

362
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,000
It's all right.

363
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:22,340
Mu Dai. I haven't seen you for ages.

364
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,820
Ages? You were only in Huacheng for a few days.

365
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,680
♫  Whenever memories whisper silently  ♫

366
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,720
It felt like... Ages.

367
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:33,570
♫  Our eyes meet, fighting back tears  ♫

368
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,160
Is Ping Ting settled?

369
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,380
What did Dr. He say?

370
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,120
♫  Together we brave the storms of adversity, oh ~  ♫

371
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,720
He said he was disappointed not to see you.

372
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,220
♫  Reconciliation is the key to understanding ourselves  ♫

373
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,660
I'm not sick. Why should I see him?

374
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,120
Exactly. You're perfectly fine.

375
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,320
You don't need to see him.

376
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,870
♫  (Fate) Is like a cliff of thorns  ♫

377
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:56,680
♫  But we'll press onward through the pain  ♫

378
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,380
♫  Dreams arrive where perseverance holds fast   ♫

379
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:03,840
I never knew she existed before.

380
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,120
But this time, it's so strange.

381
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,240
I can clearly sense that she was here.

382
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:13,040
And it was warm.

383
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,220
So warm it made me want to cry.

384
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,760
I wanted to hold her.

385
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,330
Just like how we are now.

386
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:25,980
♫  And countless memories  ♫

387
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:32,930
♫  I just want to slowly, slowly hold you tight  ♫

388
00:32:34,221 --> 00:32:38,460
   

389
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,180
Crouch down more.

390
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:45,460
I made you this bamboo staff.

391
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,300
Fire-tempered, water-soaked, and oil-cured.

392
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,160
Tailor-made just for you. Do you like it?

393
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,800
You had your eye on it since it was just a shoot, didn't you?

394
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,820
Higher.

395
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:58,940
Today, I'll teach you the wall-vault.

396
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,520
Watch closely.

397
00:33:03,173 --> 00:33:06,470
Great! Amazing!

398
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,520
Incredible.

399
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,360
Did you see that?

400
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,760
Your turn.

401
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,200
No way. This isn't something you learn in one try.

402
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,600
Why not?

403
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,956
Believe in yourself.

404
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,020
Go.

405
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,705
I believe I won't die from the fall.

406
00:33:22,705 --> 00:33:25,180
Need a push?

407
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:27,500
No, no, I...

408
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,840
Two.

409
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,700
One.

410
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,100
It is higher, huh.

411
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,680
Keep going.

412
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:48,000
Ten, nine...

413
00:33:48,928 --> 00:33:50,728
What's this?

414
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,400
"I'm unable to return home."

415
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,818
"Enclosed is 600 yuan. Wishing you a happy wedding."

416
00:33:58,818 --> 00:34:00,880
What's going on?

417
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,220
Well, I fear the relic of ill omen and the solitude,

418
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,560
which makes it hard for me to return home.

419
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,180
Yet when someone wanted to buy the Yan estate,

420
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,860
Hong Sha went alone to handle the property transfer.

421
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:13,140
She wasn't afraid at all.

422
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:15,121
I've failed in life.

423
00:34:15,121 --> 00:34:17,081
It's hard for me to return home.

424
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,960
Will Uncle Zhang make me pay for damages?

425
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,160
He definitely will.

426
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,160
Then, I can't send all 600 yuan back.

427
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:49,020
Brother Cao, no offense, but you're attending a wedding, not a firing squad.

428
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,020
Why so torn up about it?

429
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:53,680
Out with it. Is there some soap-opera twist?

430
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:57,140
Like, your cousin's fiancée is the one you have feelings for?

431
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,600
Don't be absurd.

432
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,840
I'm worried this might be a trap.

433
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:06,580
I'm afraid it's a trick my family is pulling to lure me back.

434
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,285
A trap?

435
00:35:09,285 --> 00:35:11,785
To lure you back?

436
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:19,280
Brother Cao, no wonder you never mention your family.

437
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,340
An invitation by letter?

438
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:26,680
So, you're a runaway?

439
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:33,560
Brother Cao, I never thought you'd have such a story to tell.

440
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,280
Come on.

441
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,437
Spill it.

442
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:42,460
But first, let's be clear. Don't involve anything like murder or stuff like that.

443
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:45,860
Relax. I'd never dare to do something like that.

444
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,781
I ran from an arranged marriage.

445
00:35:47,781 --> 00:35:49,222
Ran from an arranged marriage?

446
00:35:49,222 --> 00:35:50,940
   

447
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:56,020
So, the girl betrothed to Chubby was named Cao Jin Hua.

448
00:35:56,020 --> 00:36:00,632
For as long as he could remember, she'd been taller and stronger than him.

449
00:36:00,632 --> 00:36:05,560
Every childhood scuffle ended with him pinned,

450
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,620
howling.

451
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:12,480
Yet Cao's father just adored her.

452
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,200
He thought she was a strong laborer.

453
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,623
He arranged the marriage at the moment they reached marriageable age.

454
00:36:18,623 --> 00:36:21,124
On a bleak, drizzly day,

455
00:36:21,124 --> 00:36:25,569
Chubby climbed onto his roof and summoned the village.

456
00:36:25,569 --> 00:36:29,034
After a fit of wailing and howling, everyone gathered around.

457
00:36:29,034 --> 00:36:32,733
He told them that he intended to unilaterally nullify the engagement,

458
00:36:32,733 --> 00:36:35,980
in order to denounce how arranged marriages

459
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,560
 - would ruin himself, others, his family, and even the whole village. 
 - Get down! 

460
00:36:39,576 --> 00:36:41,700
 Everyone! 

461
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:47,800
 I've gathered you today to make an announcement! 

462
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:53,365
 The engagement between Cao Jin Hua and me is off! 

463
00:36:53,365 --> 00:36:55,460
 Get him down! 

464
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:59,120
 Arranged marriages destroy family, village, and society! 

465
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,880
 Mr. Cao, what's this about? 

466
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,220
 I reject feudal marital tyranny! 

467
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,780
 Easy there, buddy. I'll get him down now. 

468
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,240
 Stop calling me that! 

469
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,100
 Calm down. 

470
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,660
 Pudgy! 

471
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,760
Well done. My disciple indeed.

472
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,280
After my earnest counsel, Brother Cao finally let go of his inner burdens

473
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,180
and decided to return home.

474
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:29,600
 How will Mr. Cao react to his portly prodigal son? 

475
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:34,000
 Will Cao rekindle things with Cao Jin Hua after all these years? 

476
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,840
 Tune in next time. 

477
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,240
Mr. Ma visits the Stargazing Platform every day.

478
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,480
Ask him if you need anything.

479
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,900
Mr. Yin.

480
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,860
Mr. Yin?

481
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,140
Mr. Yin?

482
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,840
Mr. Yin?

483
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,580
Mr. Yin!

484
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,580
Who are you looking for?

485
00:38:32,411 --> 00:38:35,320
Mr. Yin, allow me to introduce myself properly.

486
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,920
I'm Shen Mu Kun.

487
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,760
You can call me Mighty Kun.

488
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:44,160
Yin Village is indispensable for studying Xiagu Pass culture.

489
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:48,780
When the Great Virtuous One went west beyond Yumen Pass...

490
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,200
Wait, why did I say Yumen Pass?

491
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,020
Bo Yang Zi, the Great Virtuous One,

492
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,880
went west beyond Xiagu Pass to live in seclusion.

493
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,900
He passed by Yin Village and left behind a stone.

494
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,720
Have a seat.

495
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,480
Thank you.

496
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,240
Yes.

497
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,240
That stone is the Stargazing Platform.

498
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,940
Ordinary people mistake it for just a rock.

499
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,280
They don't grasp its mysteries.

500
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,620
Tragic, really.

501
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:42,080
So... you know its secrets.

502
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,640
A little about it.

503
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:51,825
Senior Yin, is the Stargazing Platform connected to the relic of ill omen?

504
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,980
Thank you.

505
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,720
So, Mr. Shen,

506
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,280
you know about the seven relics of ill omen.

507
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:26,379
There are seven?

508
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:39,060



509
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:51,120
 'Palm Print' - An Qi 

510
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:55,675
♫  The sky splits the dawn's horizon  ♫

511
00:40:55,675 --> 00:41:00,055
♫  It's telling me the end  ♫

512
00:41:00,055 --> 00:41:04,296
♫  (The end) Is about to gently appear  ♫

513
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:10,840
♫  Like a whisper in my mind, a fleeting touch across my face  ♫

514
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:16,380
♫  Yet I find myself in the dark  ♫

515
00:41:17,285 --> 00:41:22,740
♫  Every hand has two sides  ♫

516
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:25,700
♫  One offers blessings  ♫

517
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:28,900
♫  One waits in silence  ♫

518
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:34,120
♫  There's no end to this game  ♫

519
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:40,560
♫  Following the traces left behind  ♫

520
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,140
♫  If you were me  ♫

521
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:50,460
♫  You'd understand every tear of mine  ♫

522
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,420
♫  (The reason they fall)  ♫

523
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,900
♫  If I were you  ♫

524
00:41:54,900 --> 00:42:01,940
♫  I'd feel each breath you take  ♫

525
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,400
♫  Then we'd move forward  ♫

526
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,799
♫  The sky splits the dawn's horizon  ♫

527
00:42:08,799 --> 00:42:13,140
♫  It's telling me the end  ♫

528
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:17,540
♫  (The end) Is about to gently appear  ♫

529
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:24,400
♫  Like a whisper in my mind, a fleeting touch across my face  ♫

530
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,460
♫  Yet I find myself in the dark  ♫

531
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:32,080
♫  The sky splits the dawn's horizon  ♫

532
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:36,360
♫  It's telling me the end  ♫

♫  The sky splits the dawn's horizon  ♫
