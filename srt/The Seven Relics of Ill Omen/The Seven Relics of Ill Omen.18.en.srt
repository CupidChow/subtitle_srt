[Episode 18]

5
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,060
Let's get out of here.

6
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,460
I feel uneasy here.

7
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,780
What happened to your hand?

8
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:20,580
It's nothing.

9
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,780
Oh, this was a complete waste of time.

10
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:26,580
You people

11
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,100
just lie through your teeth, huh?

12
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,460
You think you can walk away
without even an apology?

13
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,340
This happened so suddenly.

14
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,140
Shouldn't we be forgiven

15
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,740
for making a mistake?

16
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:37,460
A mistake?

17
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,380
You claim it was a mistake
when there's surveillance footage.

18
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,940
But what did you say
when there was none?

19
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,540
You called him a murderer.

20
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,660
What gives you the right, huh?

21
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,780
Let's just drop it
now that it's cleared up.

22
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,900
Why are you

23
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,100
being so relentless, girl?

24
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:51,940
Drop it?

25
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,460
Why should I?

26
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,660
My friend was framed for no reason.

27
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,700
He's traumatized!

28
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,940
Can you take responsibility for that?

29
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,740
Every single one of you

30
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,260
just spews lies

31
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,300
without a second thought!

32
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,660
I'm suing you!

33
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,460
Just you wait!

34
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,300
Listen to you,
running your mouth like that.

35
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,860
The person involved
isn't even saying anything.

36
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,780
Why do you have so much to say?

37
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,700
What, you want a fight?

38
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,460
Bring it on!

39
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,380
What's going on?

40
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,020
You want to throw hands?

41
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,260
I'm sorry.

42
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,060
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,500
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,340
Stop right there!

45
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,780
Did I say you could leave?

46
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,020
Come back anytime.

47
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,220
Why are you stopping me?

48
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,380
- Make yourselves at home.
- Enough.

49
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,340
So infuriating.

50
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,420
Let's go.

51
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,540
We need to talk.

52
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,900
Does it have to be here?

53
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:49,940
That cop

54
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,460
just reminded me of something important.

55
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,380
Why was I chasing him?

56
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,460
Come on, he threw a hot pot at me!

57
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,900
So why did he throw a hot pot at you?

58
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,540
He told me he had a dream last night.

59
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,700
He dreamed about...

60
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,420
About that Zhang Tong guy.

61
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,060
Then I made one extra comment.

62
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,660
I shouldn't have run my mouth.

63
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:10,900
I said,

64
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,580
"Well, it was just you

65
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,220
and that woman on the bridge."

66
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,540
"You didn't kill her, did you?"

67
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,700
The moment he heard that,

68
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,300
his face went pale.

69
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,100
Then suddenly,

70
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,380
he flung the hot pot at me.

71
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,500
Shouldn't I chase him?

72
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,100
Then how did he get those injuries
on his face?

73
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,220
He...

74
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,220
This is it.

75
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,540
I chased Ma Chao all the way,

76
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,420
tripped,

77
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,260
and my hands were covered in blood.

78
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,700
Then I pinned him down.

79
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,140
He was writhing in pain.

80
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,820
His face had these blisters,

81
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,860
like burns.

82
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,140
In this shape.

83
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,220
What is that?

84
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,940
The character "ri" missing a stroke?
[*"Ri" means "sun" in Chinese]

85
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,300
Looks like a tongue to me.

86
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,260
A tongue?

87
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,540
Think about it.

88
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,940
The situation with Thirteen-Thousand

89
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,460
and Mu Dai is kind of similar.

90
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,060
They said they were the murderers.

91
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,420
So everyone believed they were.

92
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,700
A few careless words.

93
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,060
Killing with speech.

94
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,540
This is the ancient character
for "mouth".

95
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,860
Ancient script?

96
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,100
The relic of ill omen?

97
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,860
Is the relic of ill omen inside Ma Chao?

98
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,180
Then it all makes sense.

99
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,700
The relic of ill omen fears our blood.

100
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,860
That's why his skin

101
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,260
had such a severe reaction on contact.

102
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,380
But if the relic of ill omen
is inside Ma Chao,

103
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,660
what about Song Tie and Wu Yuping?

104
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:40,820
And

105
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,420
there's no way everyone
who accused Thirteen-Thousand

106
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,580
has the relic of ill omen
inside them, right?

107
00:04:59,100 --> 00:04:59,740
Three o'clock.

108
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,900
Still doing rounds this afternoon?

109
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,620
You go at three.

110
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,100
Alright.

111
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,780
If someone's possessed
by the relic of ill omen,

112
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,500
their regenerative abilities
far exceed normal humans.

113
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,540
There's no way he'd remain unconscious.

114
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:05,900
Where's my access card?

115
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:11,980
Are you okay?

116
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:12,860
- I'm fine.
- Do you need help?

117
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:13,820
You didn't get burned, did you?

118
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,260
Thanks.

119
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,300
What are you doing here?

120
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,180
Don't trust me to handle it?

121
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,500
Having backup

122
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,700
is always reassuring.

123
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,140
Is the relic of ill omen inside Ma Chao?

124
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,580
Strange.

125
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,620
It's not inside him.

126
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,660
But there's no trace
of it leaving either.

127
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,180
Yet he was clearly

128
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,820
terrified of Thirteen-Thousand's blood.

129
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,060
I'm confused.

130
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,380
We'll figure it out.

131
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,220
That optimistic?

132
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,340
Or else?

133
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,060
It's always like this.

134
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,380
From complete obscurity
to unraveling the threads.

135
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,940
The truth always comes to light.

136
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,940
Here, An.

137
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:10,980
Have some more.

138
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,300
Look how thin you are.

139
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,900
You need to eat more

140
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,060
to grow tall.

141
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,660
Open your mouth.

142
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,060
One more bite.

143
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,260
One more.

144
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,340
Mom, I'm hungry.

145
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,300
Are you a bottomless pit?

146
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,940
You just ate lunch!

147
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,500
But I'm still hungry.

148
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,780
Look over there.

149
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,900
Go stand over there.

150
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,020
Stand over there.

151
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,100
Go!

152
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,100
What a deadweight.

153
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:35,780
Unbelievable.

154
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,900
Some kids are precious ones.

155
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,620
Some

156
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,220
are just deadweights.

157
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:45,940
Why?

158
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:48,980
Maybe

159
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:51,940
love comes in measures.

160
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,660
There's just a fine line
between trouble and love.

161
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,900
If someone loves you deeply,

162
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,900
no matter how much trouble you cause,

163
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,420
you're still their treasure.

164
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,380
If they don't love you enough,

165
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,540
no matter how well-behaved you are,

166
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,780
you're just a nuisance.

167
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,620
Get lost!

168
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,180
Get out!

169
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,740
Out!

170
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,500
Mom!

171
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,620
Here, your favorite fries.

172
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,260
Yeah.

173
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:38,380
Come on.

174
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,220
Have you found

175
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,820
your mom?

176
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,540
People told me

177
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,740
she's dead.

178
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,300
They said she jumped off a bridge.

179
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,460
After everything that's happened lately,

180
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,260
I've come to dread
the phrase "they say".

181
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:09,740
Yeah.

182
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,580
Mu Dai,

183
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,460
do you need help?

184
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,740
Having someone else around is nicer.

185
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,020
Don't forget.

186
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,820
We still have our wild card,

187
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,820
Wan Fenghuo.

188
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,620
I don't remember her name.

189
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,020
She loved wearing red high heels.

190
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,180
Lived in one of those round buildings
in the old district.

191
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,860
But that place
has been abandoned for years.

192
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,220
Later, she got sick.

193
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,180
Terminally ill.

194
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,020
She blamed the doctor for not curing her

195
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,780
and stabbed the doctor.

196
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,700
This makes things easier.

197
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,220
Nantian isn't big.

198
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,780
We'll start from the hospital.

199
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:54,860
It shouldn't be hard.

200
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,660
But Mu Dai,

201
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,540
have you thought

202
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,620
about why you're looking for her?

203
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,980
Does there need to be a reason?

204
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:05,940
I mean,

205
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,500
are you trying to reclaim
lost family ties?

206
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,180
Hoping to reunite?

207
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:13,860
No.

208
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,300
I just

209
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,460
want to return to where I began

210
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,620
and see the place I came from.

211
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,700
And maybe ask her why she hated
how much I ate,

212
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,780
how I dirtied my clothes,

213
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,020
and how I splashed water out of the tub.

214
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,980
I tried so hard, eating less,

215
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,180
keeping myself spotless,

216
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,420
and wiping the floor dry
after every bath.

217
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,460
But she still threw me away.

218
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,100
Love comes in measures.

219
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,260
I know that.

220
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,260
But those words

221
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,340
still cut deep.

222
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,020
Heaven gives every child a mother.

223
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,500
Why couldn't they

224
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,900
come with equal love?

225
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,820
I don't understand.

226
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,500
I won't chop your hands off.

227
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,100
Alright, let's go home.

228
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,220
Okay.

229
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,340
Did you have fun today?

230
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,460
Yeah.

231
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,780
Want to watch cartoons
when we get back?

232
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,460
Yeah.

233
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,220
Let's go home.

234
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,260
Mu Dai.

235
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:32,820
It'll get better.

236
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,820
The relic of ill omen
isn't inside Ma Chao.

237
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,140
That actually makes sense.

238
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,980
If Ma Chao were a host,

239
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,140
he'd be pathetically weak compared

240
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,740
to the others we've seen.

241
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,940
Look at you, so sharp.

242
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,780
With those skinny arms of yours,

243
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,340
no way you could take down someone
possessed by the relic of ill omen.

244
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,540
I'm lean, not weak.

245
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,900
Could it be
a fragment of the relic of ill omen?

246
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,100
A fragment?

247
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,500
Ever heard of Journey to the West?

248
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,460
Sun Wukong

249
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,820
can pluck a hair

250
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,220
and create clones of himself.

251
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,700
But they're nowhere near
as strong as the original.

252
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,620
So maybe Ma Chao had something

253
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,300
like a fragment
of the relic of ill omen on him,

254
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,180
which dissipated on contact

255
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,620
with your blood?

256
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,740
Hongsha's theory is interesting.

257
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,180
Then when was this "fragment"
placed on him?

258
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,500
That's the key.

259
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,980
Mu Dai's case

260
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,140
seemed premeditated, planned.

261
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,900
But Thirteen-Thousand's

262
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:52,980
was sudden.

263
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,180
No way it was arranged in advance.

264
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,500
So it had to be done

265
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,580
on the spot?

266
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,420
Let's go back
and check the surveillance footage.

267
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,260
Might find some clues.

268
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,140
If Hongsha's theory is correct,

269
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,340
should we test those

270
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,700
who accused Thirteen-Thousand

271
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,340
and Mu Dai with our blood?

272
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,020
Give me that.

273
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:15,540
Thanks.

274
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,660
I've already told you everything I know.

275
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,660
I just have some new questions.

276
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,900
Don't worry. You'll be paid.

277
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:41,740
Alright.

278
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,780
Who did this?

279
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,100
Have you seen them before?

280
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,900
I've never met any of these three girls.

281
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,220
Think harder.

282
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,700
I really don't remember.

283
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,220
Last time, you said you had.

284
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,380
Last time?

285
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,900
Do you remember
when you went to the bridge?

286
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,940
How many girls were there?

287
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,820
Do you remember their faces?

288
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,100
I've never met any of these three girls.

289
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,020
Think harder.

290
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,980
I really don't remember.

291
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,820
Just as we thought.

292
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,660
After contact with our blood,

293
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,340
they all retracted
their earlier statements.

294
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,660
Thank you for turning yourself in,

295
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,860
cooperating with our investigation,

296
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,660
[Nantian Public Security Bureau]
and providing such crucial leads.

297
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,700
We're aware of the recent situation.

298
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,220
Just sign here and you're free to go.

299
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,500
We appreciate your cooperation.

300
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,660
We may contact you again

301
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,820
if we have further questions.

302
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,700
Perfect.

303
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:17,780
Ma Chao

304
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,380
is now under police supervision.

305
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,540
Just need to wait for him to wake up.

306
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,340
But, well,

307
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,900
Dai's name has been cleared anyway.

308
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,220
Congratulations.

309
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,140
Whether Ma Chao wakes up or not
doesn't even matter.

310
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,420
Now we just wait for Thirteen-Thousand.

311
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,860
Hope it's good news.

312
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,700
What good news?

313
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,700
How did it go?

314
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,900
What do you think?

315
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,820
The Traffic Management Office refused,

316
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,060
saying that regulations
forbid showing the footage.

317
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,700
But!

318
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,100
Remember who I am?

319
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,380
I switched tactics

320
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,540
and went door-to-door checking

321
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,700
security cameras along the street.

322
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,660
And sure enough.

323
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,780
Persistence pays off.

324
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,580
Hand it over.

325
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,380
Pause.

326
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,260
See that?

327
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,580
Everyone's watching the show.

328
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,540
Except her.

329
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:34,740
She looks like she doesn't care.

330
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,860
Doesn't care?

331
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,420
If she really didn't care,

332
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,060
she wouldn't have gone near it.

333
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,500
She clearly approached,
then walked away.

334
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,420
Any other angles?

335
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,180
Here. Isn't that her?

336
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,260
Dressed head to toe in red.

337
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,060
Creepy.

338
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,740
Yeah. Her fashion sense

339
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,260
is something else.

340
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,260
It's indeed

341
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,780
a bit weird.

342
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,980
Do you think the fragment
of the relic of ill omen

343
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,100
came from the woman in red?

344
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,980
That should be my mother.

345
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:30,700
Mu Dai,

346
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,900
you haven't seen your mother
in over twenty years.

347
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,220
And the footage

348
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,900
is too blurry to make out her face.

349
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,580
Are you sure?

350
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,300
Just a feeling.

351
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,620
In my memories,

352
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,380
she always wore red high heels.

353
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,260
Every single pair was red.

354
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,420
And

355
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,140
even though I can't
see her face clearly,

356
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,220
the moment I saw her,

357
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,460
I felt something.

358
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,740
Is there anything else I need to do?

359
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,420
You've already done a great job.

360
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,380
So, no.

361
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,900
Stopping so soon?

362
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,900
But

363
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,180
I haven't had enough fun yet.

364
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,020
The game shouldn't always
be yours to play alone.

365
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,860
Others are waiting for their turn.

366
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,660
Others?

367
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,260
People like me?

368
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,900
Will I get to meet them?

369
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,020
Yes.

370
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,260
Because you're not alone.

371
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,180
One day,

372
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,420
we'll never be apart again.

373
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,780
Ding Guohua,

374
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,540
a doctor with a PhD
from Changqing Medical University

375
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:40,260
and the academic leader in dermatology
at the county hospital,

376
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,540
quit his job to open a bookstore.

377
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:46,660
A bookstore?

378
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:51,100
A promising doctor like him
just opened a bookstore?

379
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,060
There's more.

380
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,860
Keep reading.

381
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,340
He was stabbed by your mother.

382
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,140
Shortly after, he resigned.

383
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,580
But he never pressed charges
against her.

384
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,500
Also,

385
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,140
your mother's surname is Xiang.

386
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,700
Xiang Silan.

387
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,660
Xiang Silan?

388
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,100
Would he know where my mother is?

389
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,860
There must be some connection

390
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,860
between him and your mother.

391
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:38,580
Don't worry.

What do you want?

We'd like to consult you

401

on some medical matters.

402
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,300
Medical consultation?

403
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,020
This way.

404
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,100
Come on.

405
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,220
Here.

406
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,700
Have a seat.

407
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,180
Who needs medical consultation?

408
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,900
I'm here for my mother.

409
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:17,940
Who?

410
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,980
I'm here for my mother.

411
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:22,980
How long has she been ill?

412
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:23,740
A long time.

413
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:26,140
Then have her come in now.

414
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,380
You treated her before.

415
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,860
Diagnosed her
with squamous cell carcinoma.

416
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,660
Said it was terminal. Incurable.

417
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,260
What...

418
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,460
What was her name?

419
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,020
Xiang Silan.

420
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,740
You treated her before, didn't you?

421
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,580
Do you know where she is?

422
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:43,540
There!

423
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,900
Xiang Silan.

424
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,780
Squamous cell carcinoma.

425
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,980
From diagnosis to prescription.

426
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,260
Nothing wrong.

427
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,860
I cured her!

428
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,420
I cured her!

429
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,900
Why are you saying I didn't?

430
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:02,780
You're slandering me!

431
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,180
What do you want?

432
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,620
What are you doing?

433
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,820
Calm down.

434
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,540
I can't say.

435
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,500
If I do, I'll make a mistake.

436
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:13,940
I can't say.

437
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:30,900
Dad?

438
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,100
Dad!

439
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,420
I'm his daughter.

440
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,620
Dad, it's me.

441
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,380
Actually,

442
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,580
he's always been ill.

443
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,820
But I'm busy with work,

444
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,220
so I keep him with me

445
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,460
to look after him.

446
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,780
He rarely has episodes now.

447
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,300
Just gets disoriented occasionally.

448
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:04,220
When he's like that,
he insists on treating patients.

449
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,700
People just humor him.

450
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,540
So when did his condition start?

451
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,660
About

452
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,060
twenty years ago.

453
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,700
Back then,

454
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,540
he began misdiagnosing every patient.

455
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,740
He said

456
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,380
whenever he saw medical records,

457
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,380
he felt an uncontrollable urge

458
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,980
to lie.

459
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,780
And at the time,

460
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,620
he was a renowned doctor.

461
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,620
So he misdiagnosed many people.

462
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,900
Including your mother,

463
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,140
Xiang Silan.

464
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,580
Well,

465
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,260
your condition will only deteriorate.

466
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,540
I've done all I can.

467
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,060
So you're saying

468
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:06,860
it can't be cured?

469
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,580
Currently, there aren't

470
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,780
any better options

471
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,660
for your illness in the medical field.

472
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:34,940
It's fine.

473
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,540
It's alright.

474
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,100
It can't be cured.

475
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:56,860
What happened after that?

476
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:00,100
After you found out, did you just
let it continue?

477
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,660
One night,

478
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,420
my father suddenly realized
what was happening.

479
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,660
He was horrified.

480
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,140
He said he'd take
all the misdiagnosed records

481
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,180
to the hospital director.

482
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,820
But the next day,

483
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,380
he was like a different person.

484
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:21,300
Cunning and shady.

485
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,220
He even tried to keep lying.

486
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,300
I was too young back then.

487
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,540
I couldn't do anything.

488
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,980
Every day, I just watched him

489
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,700
swing back and forth
between those two states.

490
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,260
Your mother was the worst case.

491
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,540
Her treatment was delayed

492
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,380
until it was too late.

493
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,660
Then one day,

494
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,700
my father...

495
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,380
Did you see it?

496
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,740
See that? Who is that?

497
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,860
Look at her face!

498
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:54,580
Careful.

499
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,460
Disgusting.

500
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,340
How dare you show your face here?

501
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,500
She actually has the nerve to come back.

502
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,180
Covered up like that.

503
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,420
Too ashamed to show your face?

504
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,020
You're not leaving
until you explain yourself!

505
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,900
Tell us the truth!

506
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,420
Explain yourself!

507
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,380
- Don't go!
- Don't go!

508
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,500
- Stop her!
- Don't let her go!

509
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,460
Behave!

510
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,740
You want to see it?

511
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,420
Then take a good look.

512
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,180
Listen here, you shameless wretch!

513
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,540
What did you put

514
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,780
in people's food?

515
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,060
Your blood is disgusting.

516
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:29,900
Exactly!

517
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:32,020
You being dirty is one thing.

518
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,420
But dragging
everyone else down with you?

519
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,540
That's just evil!

520
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,980
You're despicable!

521
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,260
You're lying!

522
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,580
You're all lying!

523
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:40,620
Did you see it?

524
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,140
I saw it!

525
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:41,900
Did any of you see it?

526
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,780
You lifted every lid on those pots.

527
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,300
What else could you do?

528
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,140
Spat in it or dripped your blood, right?

529
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,660
- That's right!
- Absolutely!

530
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,940
Then sue me!

531
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,300
Have the police arrest me!

532
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,660
- We're calling the police!
- We're calling them!

533
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,180
You claim I spat

534
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,460
and dripped my blood.

535
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,820
Now I'll...

536
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,500
You're vile.

537
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,940
Ms. Xiang, put the knife down.

538
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:06,580
No, no.

539
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:07,860
Stay calm. Come on.

540
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,300
Your condition is treatable.

541
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:10,860
No, it's not.

542
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,180
Not after all this time.

543
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,900
Even if it were treatable,
it's too late now.

544
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,620
It is treatable. It is.

545
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:15,860
I'll find you another doctor.

546
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,980
I'll make sure you're cured.

547
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,140
Put the knife down.

548
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,980
This isn't contagious. Stop this!

549
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,380
Just go home.

550
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,620
It's incurable. Incurable.

551
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,340
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

552
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:36,540
Don't move!

553
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:41,340
Let me go!

554
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:42,980
Let go of me!

555
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,660
It was urgent.

556
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,580
I rushed him to get his wounds treated.

557
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,460
The doctor told me

558
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,820
a large patch of skin on his back
was missing.

559
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,420
But he'd only been slashed once.

560
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,660
So you never saw her again after that?

561
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,020
A long time later,

562
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,140
I thought I spotted someone
who looked like Xiang Silan

563
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,540
near the Flying Horse Statue.

564
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,260
But it couldn't have been her.

565
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,900
Her skin was flawless.

566
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,700
The Flying Horse Statue.

567
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,740
The Flying Horse Statue.

568
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,500
We're using a thermal imager
to detect life signs.

569
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:45,780
What's wrong?

570
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,260
Head!

571
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:46,980
What?

572
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,140
Head! The head!

573
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:48,620
Head?

574
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,380
Yeah. The wind

575
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,620
just flattened the grass.

576
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,500
And I saw a huge head

577
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,460
flash by.

578
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,260
Are you hallucinating?

579
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,420
- Cao.
- No way.

580
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,300
- See it?
- A mass.

581
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,340
A head flashed by?

582
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,300
That's ridiculous.

583
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:01,700
No way.

584
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,540
You think we're filming a TV drama?

585
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,220
Even if we were,

586
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,620
you'd be in charge of comedy.

587
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:09,180
Horror isn't your department.

588
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,980
Was I just imagining things?

589
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,780
Look.

590
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,100
It's Wu Yuping.

591
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,460
Never thought

592
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:23,500
she had a rebellious youth.

593
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,980
[Wu Yuping]
Such an honest person

594
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:27,140
actually checked in
at the Flying Horse Statue.

595
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,620
Look for the check-in records
of Song Tie, Ma Chao,

596
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,260
and the people
who accused Thirteen-Thousand.

597
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:33,620
Right.

598
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,940
Ma Chao's here!

599
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,220
Song Tie!

600
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,020
This one.

601
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,220
Liu Yile.

602
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,000
[Liu Yile]
I remember clearly

603
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,620
because it sounds like
"Happy Children's Day."

604
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,340
He was one of my accusers.

605
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,700
I get it now.

606
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,060
Everyone who came
to the Flying Horse Statue

607
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,420
was touched by the wind.

608
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,340
That wind is the key.

609
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,220
Wind?

610
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,700
The illusion
caused by the relic of ill omen

611
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,420
also started with a strange gust.

612
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,940
This wind must be some kind of marker.

613
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,900
People thought they were

614
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,940
checking in at the Flying Horse Statue

615
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,620
Instead, they got checked

616
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,420
and tagged with the fragment
of the relic of ill omen.

617
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,820
Fragment of the relic of ill omen?

618
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:15,700
I've got a plan

619
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,420
to lure it out.

620
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,660
Well,

621
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,780
from where I'm standing,
the Flying Horse Statue

622
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,140
looks just like a grand altar.

623
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,060
Chubby's kneeling there

624
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,220
like he's paying homage.

625
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,980
Quite ceremonial.

626
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:43,980
What kind of plan is this?

627
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,580
Just throwing me to the wolves, huh?

628
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,060
Here it comes.

629
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:04,980
The head looks bizarre.

630
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,580
It's orange.

631
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,340
The rest is pitch black.

632
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,260
The chest is like a swirling vortex.

633
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,260
Utter darkness.

634
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,140
Cao Yanhua, get down!

635
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:20,940
After it!

636
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,740
Are you okay?

637
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:25,620
Master.

638
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,420
I'm not okay. Don't leave!

639
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,500
Mu Dai! Stop chasing.

640
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,540
It's gone.

641
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,420
The imager has a limited range.

642
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,380
Don't worry.

643
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,820
She might come back.

644
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,460
Let's go.

645
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:02,340
Oh no.

646
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:02,820
Cao.

647
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:03,420
Oh my gosh.

648
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,220
What's wrong?

649
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,580
- I was hit by the wind.
- A stroke?

650
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,980
That was

651
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,700
no ordinary wind.

652
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,340
My skull is ice-cold,

653
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,260
and my spine's gone numb.

654
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,940
Hongsha, you're on watch.

655
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,220
Got it.

656
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,220
Master,

657
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,220
I feel awful.

658
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,620
If I'm right,

659
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,340
the fragment of the relic of ill omen
is a misnomer.

660
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,380
Xiang Silan influences people

661
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,180
through that cold wind.

662
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,220
To put it simply,

663
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,020
it's like infecting someone
with a virus.

664
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,540
A virus?

665
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,780
Normally, there's no sign.

666
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,780
But once activated,
it takes effect immediately.

667
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,620
Virus of the relic of ill omen?

668
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,500
Virus of the relic of ill omen?

669
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,140
Then we're fine.

670
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,420
We're immune.

671
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,260
Exactly. We've got an edge.

672
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,500
Right. So why are you suffering?

673
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,660
Do you still feel that chill
in your skull

674
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,700
and numbness in your limbs?

675
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,740
I'm feeling much better.

676
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,060
Go on.

677
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,100
What virus did you just mention?

678
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,500
What's its effect?

679
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,540
An enhanced version of rumor-spreading.

680
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,100
It makes the rumor-mongers

681
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,700
truly believe their own lies

682
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,700
as if they'd personally witnessed

683
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,860
or experienced it.

684
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,860
I need to sort this out.

685
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,780
Take my case as an example.

686
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,780
When the car crash happened,

687
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,140
there were many people at the scene.

688
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,140
Chances are one or two of them

689
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:16,020
had been to the Flying Horse Statue

690
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,420
and were already affected.

691
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:18,900
Xiang Silan was also there.

692
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,420
She immediately activated those people.

693
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,180
Even though they didn't know each other

694
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,580
and couldn't have colluded,

695
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,620
they still gave identical testimonies.

696
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,740
Mu Dai's case is similar.

697
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,100
It was even more advanced.

698
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,380
At least you were at the crash site.

699
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,260
But Mu Dai wasn't even on the bridge.

700
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,700
Yet Xiang Silan
still used Mu Dai's image

701
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,540
to influence them.

702
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:42,620
So when Luo said

703
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:43,820
my master

704
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,820
seemed to just appear out of nowhere,

705
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:47,900
it was image implantation.

706
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,740
Even the fiercest won't harm its own.

707
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,340
You're her daughter.

708
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,820
And she used such tactics on you.

709
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:57,820
You're wrong.

710
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,380
Mu Dai's been away for years.

711
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:02,140
Xiang Silan had no idea
of her true identity.

712
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,060
She targeted her simply because

713
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,420
she was exposed.

714
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,220
When was I exposed?

715
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,860
Both you and Zhang Tong came here.

716
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,260
Zhang Tong got infected.

717
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,420
But you remained unaffected.

718
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,700
Xiang Silan must've seen you
as a threat.

719
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,140
And you,

720
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,700
your blood got on Ma Chao's face.

721
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,540
That exposed you too.

722
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,060
I was exposed?

723
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,940
So that's why she pulled out
all the stops against us?

724
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,380
Earlier, you said it felt like an altar.

725
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:33,860
I agree.

726
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,700
Those lured by curiosity

727
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,980
are seen as worshipping
the relic of ill omen

728
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,060
and marked in the process.

729
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:41,420
All these years,

730
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:42,860
and all these names.

731
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,660
Xiang Silan must've frequently
wandered around the town,

732
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:46,820
appearing harmless.

733
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,580
But no one knows

734
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:50,260
what kind of words she sowed

735
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,380
or what horrors

736
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,940
festered from them?

737
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,060
It's here.

738
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,220
Where? Where?

739
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,060
What's the direction?

740
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,620
One o'clock.

741
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,460
Stay with me.

742
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,540
Let's pretend to write like this.

743
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,580
A hundred meters away from us.

744
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,700
Fifty.

745
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:27,980
Forty.

746
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,260
Thirty.

747
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,260
Twenty.

748
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:34,940
Ten.

749
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,380
Mu Dai.

750
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,500
Never thought

751
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,740
it'd be more fun

752
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,220
after he left.

753
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:40,060
Mom!

754
