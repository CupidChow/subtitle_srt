5
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,300
It smells terrible.

6
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,300
Step back.

7
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,020
This place hasn't been ventilated
in ages.

8
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,340
Let's wait here for a while.

9
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,420
Here's the auspicious moment

10
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:47,700
Thank you.

11
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,180
Why are you looking over there
instead of at the wedding altar?

12
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,220
Thank you all for joining us

13
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,540
to celebrate the union
of Qingshan and Yafeng.

14
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,260
Let the ceremony commence!

15
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,100
Great!

16
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,820
May all guests please rise!

17
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,580
Bow to the memorial tablet.

18
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,940
Why are we bowing to this?

19
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,780
Madam, do in Rome as the Romans do.

20
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,340
This tablet bears
the ancient character for "earth".

21
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,060
Rise.

22
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,540
Bow to heaven and earth!

23
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,260
Wonderful!

24
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,020
Cao village once thrived on pottery.

25
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,820
This tablet

26
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,740
honors the clay that sustained us
through pottery.

27
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,580
We pay tribute to the land's bounty.

28
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,420
It's a tradition passed down
through generations.

29
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,260
Bow to the elders!

30
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,580
Wonderful!

31
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,820
Exchange the tokens.

32
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,220
Perfect!

33
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,380
Great!

34
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,140
Good.

35
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,460
Wonderful!

36
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,220
Lovely.

37
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,620
Wasn't she trafficked here?

38
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,220
Why does she look so happy?

39
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,500
Why use matches? They're so archaic.

40
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,100
Lighters are much more convenient.

41
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,940
Fire-starting tools
in a tactical backpack

42
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,500
typically include matches and flint.

43
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,180
Lighters may be handy,

44
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,500
but they're useless
in extreme conditions.

45
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,820
Look at this.

46
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,100
The wax on match heads

47
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,220
protects against water

48
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,100
and prevents self-ignition
from friction.

49
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:23,820
Understand?

50
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,140
Ren,

51
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,940
you seem to enjoy teaching me things.

52
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,740
I'm more experienced.

53
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,580
That's why

54
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,700
I want to share
all my knowledge and skills

55
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,780
with you.

56
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,940
So even if I'm not around one day,

57
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,140
you'll be able to protect

58
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,740
and take care of yourself.

59
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,100
You initially refused to join us
in Cao Village.

60
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,940
Something happened, didn't it?

61
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,940
Remember when I told you

62
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,060
I once stayed on Old Heisha Island?

63
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,420
I left

64
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,100
because I crossed

65
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,340
a powerful figure there.

66
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,580
So

67
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,540
I had no choice but to leave.

68
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,340
Later,

69
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,540
I thought the matter was over.

70
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,220
But recently, I learned

71
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,220
she's planning to retaliate against me.

72
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,980
Her usual tactic

73
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,540
is to target people
close to her enemies.

74
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:43,740
So...

75
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,220
No wonder you've been on edge.

76
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,260
Still,

77
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,580
if even you're wary of her,

78
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,980
she must be formidable.

79
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,100
That's so low.

80
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,340
Targeting one's friends and family?

81
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,220
My master always said

82
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,460
only petty cowards

83
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,260
would go after innocent women
and children.

84
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,540
But don't worry.

85
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,540
I'm tough too.

86
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,740
I can help protect
the people around you.

87
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,340
That impressive?

88
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,500
And if things get really bad,
I've got my master

89
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,580
and my senior.

90
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,020
We'll all pitch in.

91
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,340
Don't worry.

92
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,380
Let me play you a tune.

93
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:19,900
What's wrong?

94
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,220
Nothing.

95
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:28,820
Let me see.

96
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,420
How do you do that

97
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,380
Why can I only make
a basic whistle sound?

98
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:35,900
Not telling you.

99
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,820
It's my signature trick.

100
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,580
Not even me?

101
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,020
Rules are rules.

102
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,660
It's passed down to sons, not daughters.

103
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,500
Sons only, no daughters-in-law.

104
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,020
What's wrong with daughters?

105
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,660
Sons can learn it

106
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,100
to impress girls.

107
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,100
Daughters don't need to.

108
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,780
They just wait to be wooed.

109
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:07,740
Alright.

110
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,180
Almost done.

111
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:11,980
Come take a look.

112
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,100
The air's clear now.

113
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,380
It's not a dirt path.

114
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,460
It's rocks

115
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,100
Thought if it was mud,

116
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,020
it'd be easier to dig.

117
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,780
The mud sealing the entrance

118
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,980
must've been brought in from outside.

119
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,980
Should we go down?

120
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,420
I'll go first.

121
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,420
Alright.

122
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,420
If Yafeng falls short in any way,

123
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,260
I ask for your patience.

124
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,740
Just let me know if anything's wrong.

125
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,140
A toast to you all.

126
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:06,900
Come on.

127
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,100
Wishing you a happy marriage.

128
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,900
Thank you.

129
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:10,900
Thanks.

130
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,580
Enjoy the feast.

131
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,020
Alright.

132
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:17,980
Come on, keep drinking.

133
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:18,860
Refill, refill.

134
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,100
Pour it.

135
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,300
Here, here.

136
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:21,620
Pour it.

137
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,500
Come on.

138
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,540
Here.

139
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,260
Come on.

140
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:25,820
Here.

141
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,660
Bottoms up.

142
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,220
Down it.

143
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,140
- Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up.

144
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:32,980
Alright.

145
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,820
Alright, thank you.

146
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,020
Thanks.

147
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:36,780
This way.

148
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,740
Take it slow.

149
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,860
We're here to toast.

150
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,540
Glasses full, everyone.

151
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:44,940
Here.

152
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,700
- A toast to all.
- Enjoy the food and drinks.

153
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,460
Come on.

154
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,260
What's wrong?

155
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,300
- Are you alright?
- Here.

156
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,460
Easy with the drink.

157
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,100
Yafeng.

158
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,180
- What's wrong?
- I'm fine.

159
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,700
Just had a bit too much.

160
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:57,740
No worries.

161
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,580
It's alright.

162
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,980
Then we'll raise a toast to everyone.

163
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,860
Enjoy the feast.

164
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,300
Come on, let's drink.

165
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,420
Drink up.

166
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,300
Cheers.

167
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:07,740
Enjoy the food and drinks.

168
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:09,940
This way.

169
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,500
Here.

170
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,140
Enjoy the food and drinks.

171
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,540
She's reacting to my blood?

172
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,780
Is the relic of ill omen inside Yafeng?

173
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,420
We're here to toast.

174
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,140
Here.

175
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:20,900
Where's Cao Jinhua?

176
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,660
The drinks.

177
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,660
The drinks.

178
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,220
Here.

179
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:25,700
Come on.

180
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:26,500
Thank you.

181
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,300
Cheers.

182
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,740
Let's raise our glasses.

183
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,940
Here, thank you.

184
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,020
So it really is you.

185
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,700
Pudgy?

186
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,500
Cao Jinhua!

187
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,180
What's gotten into Qingshan?

188
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:10,660
Jinhua,

189
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,060
no time to catch up now.

190
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,660
Untie me, now.

191
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,660
Qingshan...

192
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,180
He seems possessed.

193
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:18,700
You didn't do anything

194
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,540
to wrong him, did you?

195
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:20,940
I swear on my life.

196
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,700
In this whole village,
you're the only one I've wronged.

197
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,340
I'll make it up to you later, alright?

198
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,180
Just untie me now.

199
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,220
This is a matter of life and death.

200
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,660
Listen well, Cao,

201
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,020
I'll untie you.

202
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,260
But don't get any ideas.

203
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,060
This doesn't mean I forgive you.

204
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,780
I'm... I'm heartless.

205
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,500
Hurry!

206
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,260
Hongsha.

207
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,180
Hold it back.

208
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,260
Thirteen-Thousand
was buried alive for ages,

209
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,060
and he didn't cry.

210
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,140
Look at you, all weepy.

211
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:50,860
Buried alive?

212
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,700
Let me make this quick.

213
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,180
After entering the village,

214
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,740
the first person I met was
Thirteen-Thousand,

215
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,580
and the second was you.

216
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,540
There's still no word
from Luo Ren or Mu Dai.

217
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,900
Have you seen them?

218
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,620
So where are they?

219
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,460
Halfway up the mountain.

220
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06,940
I did see them.

221
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,380
But they fell into a trap.

222
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,820
You don't know how deep that pit is.

223
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,380
I'm afraid they might have...

224
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,100
Don't jinx it.

225
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,540
No way.

226
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,180
With their skills,

227
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,460
they'll be fine.

228
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,140
Oh my goodness.

229
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,700
We can't leave her here.

230
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,820
If she wakes up and starts screaming,
we'll be in trouble.

231
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,940
And I've already tested them.

232
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,940
They're not as simple as they seem.

233
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,780
- Yafeng...
- There's something off about her.

234
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,060
Here's the plan.

235
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,380
Take her to the mill
at the foot of the mountain.

236
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,340
I'll meet you there

237
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:40,940
Stay safe.

238
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,060
Be careful.

239
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,420
Wow, you've changed a lot.

240
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,580
Yanhua.

241
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,620
Oh no.

242
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,220
No one's here.

243
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,420
Is my bag still there?

244
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,300
Right here.

245
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,460
Wait a second.

246
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,380
If this were her as a kid,
I'd never be able to move her.

247
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,260
How much farther is the cave?

248
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,780
Doesn't look far,

249
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,660
but it's still halfway up. Let's hurry.

250
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,300
Let's go.

251
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,620
Why aren't you carrying her?

252
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:58,580
Why bring her?

253
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,260
Just leave her there.

254
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,940
No, what if she wakes up

255
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,260
and tells everyone in the village

256
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,740
she saw Pudgy

257
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,820
and that Qingshan kidnapped him?

258
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,980
What would we do then?

259
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,260
Just like my father warned me.

260
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,620
I never should've left Jinhua.

261
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,260
Here.

262
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,540
Something's up ahead.

263
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:41,980
Wait.

264
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:04,740
This is...

265
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,580
Mu Dai, there are bones here.

266
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,580
Is this a burial chamber?

267
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:07,980
That's right.

268
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,820
Molten bronze and iron?

269
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:21,980
In ancient times,

270
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,300
these people were buried alive.

271
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,300
I've studied ancient scripts before.

272
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,500
This says
"Seven-Star Return to Their Positions".

273
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,700
Seven-Star Return to Their Positions?

274
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,420
Mu Dai,

275
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,780
this cave might be connected
to the relics of ill omen.

276
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,300
Mighty Kun once said

277
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,700
each relic of ill omen
represents a star.

278
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,140
So, seven relics of ill omen
mean seven stars.

279
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,500
He suspects they all originate
from Tiankui Seven-Star.

280
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,700
Then what does "Seven-Star Return
to Their Positions" mean?

281
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,660
Have all seven relics of ill omen
emerged?

282
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,460
Not sure.

283
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,620
But it also says "all efforts wasted".

284
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,860
Does that mean the return failed?

285
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,380
Lured into the trap,

286
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,540
molten bronze poured overhead,

287
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,980
no escape left,

288
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,340
the Star Lord perished.

289
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,620
The servants follow in death.

290
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,420
Star Lord?

291
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:51,020
Could the Star Lord be someone
possessed by the relic of ill omen?

292
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,660
Likely.

293
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,820
And they call that a Star Lord?

294
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:58,940
Remember,

295
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,700
those possessed by the relic of ill omen
gain supernatural abilities.

296
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,580
This "servant" is the literal meaning,

297
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,380
likely referring
to the followers of the Star Lord.

298
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,180
Look,

299
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,540
there's a star on each
of these pottery figurine masks.

300
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,300
This was an organization.

301
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:24,020
If these people were buried here,

302
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,420
where did the sacrificial offerings
and figurines come from?

303
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,020
I guess

304
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,900
some of those who were buried alive

305
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,140
might have escaped.

306
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:34,980
They dug a tunnel

307
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,060
and escaped.

308
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,700
Back then, there were no trapdoors.

309
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,380
Just a natural exit.

310
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,900
Later, he came back.

311
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,340
That's why

312
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,500
there's a coffin platform
and kneeling figurines.

313
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,300
Finally, they sealed the cave

314
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,980
and set up a trapdoor.

315
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,460
Why bother with the trap

316
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,420
if they came back?

317
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,100
Probably to worship

318
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,900
while keeping intruders out.

319
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,220
So he set up the trap.

320
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,780
Then those two skeletons

321
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,580
were those of the unlucky trespassers?

322
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,100
Poor things.

323
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,740
Do you think
there might be clues over there?

324
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,060
Let me check. Hold this.

325
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,300
It's too heavy to move, Luo Ren.

326
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,660
Be careful.

327
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,340
Careful.

328
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,260
Can't move it.

329
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,060
Too heavy.

330
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,260
We need more professional tools.

331
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:34,940
Is anyone chasing us?

332
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,060
No. Hurry.

333
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:38,460
Almost there.

334
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,620
Well?

335
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:41,900
Move.

336
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:43,860
Listen,

337
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,180
Thirteen-Thousand got it wrong.

338
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,180
The relic of ill omen
isn't with Qingshan.

339
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,540
Yafeng is the host.

340
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:51,060
And this relic of ill omen
should've gone into acting.

341
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,860
The way it played the weeping victim.

342
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,300
I actually believed
she'd been trafficked.

343
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,260
I got carried away

344
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,620
and brought her out.

345
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:58,940
I'm exhausted.

346
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,420
I can't run anymore.

347
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,460
I need to rest.

348
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,580
Relax.

349
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,500
They won't catch up anytime soon.

350
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,420
Aren't you tired?

351
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,220
Hey, fatso.

352
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,340
You're alone here?

353
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,860
Yeah, just me.

354
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:21,820
Well,

355
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,780
if you went missing,

356
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,740
would your friends

357
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,500
come to rescue you?

358
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,140
Does this relic of ill omen

359
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,820
seem weaker than the others?

360
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,300
Weaker?

361
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,700
She knocked me out cold with two hits.

362
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,740
And she's vicious.

363
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,060
I was tied up in that cave,

364
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:08,700
gagged.

365
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,900
I couldn't do anything.

366
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,340
I could only watch

367
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,980
as she lured my master and Luo

368
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,700
into that trap.

369
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,420
No idea if they're even alive.

370
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,700
Let's go now.

371
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,340
Look.

372
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,300
See it?

373
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,580
We're here.

374
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,060
Wait for me.

375
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,460
Bats.

376
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,940
I'm used to them by now.

377
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,860
Where's the trap?

378
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,100
Wait, wait.

379
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,700
Right here in the middle.

380
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,860
It's deep. Don't fall in.

381
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,340
Where's the trigger mechanism?

382
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,180
I was tied to that rock over there.

383
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,180
They were fighting around here,

384
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,980
and then they just fell in with a thud.

385
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,900
Qingshan always stood there,

386
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,380
I think.

387
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,500
Be careful.

388
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,660
If you fall, we're done for.

389
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,140
Found it?

390
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,580
It's the same color as the rocks.

391
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,420
Hard to spot.

392
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,820
Is that rope secure?

393
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,020
You don't want to fall down.

394
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,940
Yan family's secret knot. Won't loosen.

395
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:48,980
Most can't untie it.

396
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,100
Give me a piggyback ride.

397
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,780
I'll carry you.

398
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:00,980
Come on.

399
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,580
It seems Jinhua has woken up.

400
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,380
Knock her out again.

401
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,020
No, no, no, don't.

402
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,220
She'll get brain damage.

403
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,540
And she has a really bad temper.

404
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,660
Always beat me up when we were kids.

405
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,940
Risks are indeed everywhere.

406
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,580
Good thing I bought insurance.

407
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,020
It covers 80% of the payout.

408
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,980
If I'm hospitalized,

409
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,740
there's also a daily subsidy

410
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,620
of 120 yuan.

411
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,180
Madam Maria?

412
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,140
Jenny.

413
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:47,460
Hongsha,

414
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,900
keep looking.

415
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,540
I'll handle her while she's still dazed.

416
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,340
Jinhua,

417
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:57,780
look,

418
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,260
we're... We're not good people.

419
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,180
No, I mean

420
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,500
we don't do good things.

421
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,300
Look at me, I'm so clumsy with words.

422
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,540
I couldn't possibly be a bad guy.

423
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,340
Think about it,

424
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,900
if I were,

425
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,900
just now when you fainted,

426
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,140
I would've taken advantage of...

427
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,660
I couldn't do that, you know.

428
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,780
I'll take responsibility.

429
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:18,460
Jinhua,

430
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,460
I'm really sorry to drag you into this.

431
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,140
I'll cover all your medical expenses.

432
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,940
If you end up with any after-effects,

433
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:25,860
I'll take care of you.

434
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,900
What's Madam Maria

435
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,300
looking for?

436
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:35,860
The trigger mechanism.

437
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,260
Checked everywhere.

438
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,140
Still couldn't find it.

439
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,900
What about the ground?

440
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,260
The ground?

441
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,140
It must be this.

442
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,380
That's just evil.

443
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:27,620
Mu Dai.

444
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,780
Giving up already?

445
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:42,860
It's alright.

446
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,260
I believe we'll get out of here.

447
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,340
You have to believe

448
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,860
that our friends

449
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,540
will come to rescue us.

450
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,940
They say sweets make people happy.

451
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,100
It's not mealtime yet,

452
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:15,900
but

453
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:16,700
have some anyway.

454
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,100
You eat first.

455
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,460
You haven't had a single piece.

456
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,180
I did.

457
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,500
No, you didn't!

458
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,740
I'm ready. Let's do it.

459
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,900
Be careful.

460
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,860
One, two, three!

461
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:00,540
Did you press it?

462
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,780
I'm still pressing it.

463
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,340
Press it again.

464
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,500
My lamp does this.

465
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,140
Poor contact.

466
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,380
Keep pressing. Don't let go.

467
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,380
Step on it.

468
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,420
Will this work?

469
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,540
Hongsha!

470
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:19,980
Madam Maria!

471
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,460
Hongsha, I...

472
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,020
Mu Dai, it's Hongsha.

473
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:39,900
Well,

474
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,660
Sorry. I didn't
hold onto the bag tightly.

475
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,740
Didn't it hit you guys, did it?

476
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:43,660
There are wedding candies inside.

477
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,980
Have some if you're hungry.

478
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,380
Hongsha, are you okay?

479
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,140
I'm fine! And they're both safe.

480
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:49,900
All good.

481
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,020
See, I told you.

482
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,060
We're all okay.

483
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,740
Chubby is up there.

484
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:58,940
Wait,

485
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:02,260
there's a trap here?

486
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,740
There's someone else down there?

487
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,220
Did they fall in?

488
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:05,940
Yeah.

489
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,820
I... I'm just as puzzled.

490
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,420
Did you two

491
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,660
ever imagine that an angel like me

492
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,620
would come swooping in

493
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,180
to rescue you from this mess?

494
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,860
If you're both okay,

495
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:18,820
come on up now.

496
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,780
Once Qingshan and Yafeng catch up,

497
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,060
we won't be able to hold them off.

498
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,860
Aren't they
in the middle of their wedding?

499
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,620
How could they possibly come?

500
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,940
I'll explain everything later, alright?

501
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,220
Jinhua.

502
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,740
Do me a favor.

503
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:47,820
Use your feet

504
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,460
to brace the door like I'm doing.

505
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:52,660
It's so heavy.

506
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,740
Make sure the door doesn't close.

507
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:55,540
Got it.

508
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,460
Grab the rope tight
so you can push with your feet.

509
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,540
Just you?

510
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:05,620
I...

511
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:21,620
Qingshan!

512
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,220
- Qingshan!
- Don't blame me for this.

513
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,100
Stop! Stop right now!

514
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,460
I didn't mean to. Don't blame me.

515
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,300
Hongsha!

516
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,220
What's going on?

517
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,020
Chubby?

518
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:35,780
I...

519
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,860
Cao Jinhua, don't let him untie!

520
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:57,740
Mu Dai,

521
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,260
they can't hold on much longer up there.

522
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,460
Can you do a gecko-on-the-wall climb?

523
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,500
Not really. I can't climb fast enough.

524
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:03,540
Use the rope then.

525
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,180
Give me the rope!

526
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,020
Don't blame me for this.

527
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,140
Is the backpack fully packed?

528
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,420
Yes.

529
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,500
Turn your back to me!

530
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:44,620
Yafeng.

531
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,540
I... I'm fine.

532
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,900
You don't need to check on me.

533
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,500
Yafeng, I know you're a good girl.

534
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:50,620
You...

535
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,100
Stop pulling!

536
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,380
There are people down there, Yafeng.

537
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,060
God, someone save me!

538
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,340
Chubby!

Take her down.

00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,220
Hey,

568
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,900
are you guys done fighting?

569
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,300
Hello?

570
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,700
Did you forget about me?

571
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,580
How about pulling up

572
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,460
your savior here?

573
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:42,660
Behave.

574
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,060
You're not that old,

575
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,100
but you're quite scheming.

576
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,700
You won't get anything from me.

577
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:33,860
Are you alright?

578
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:34,940
I swear I'll...

579
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:35,740
I...

580
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,380
You're done for. Just you wait.

581
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:41,980
Where's Qingshan?

582
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,140
He ran away in the chaos.

583
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:43,900
Ran away?

584
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,420
It's fine.

585
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,020
Didn't you say she was the real host?

586
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:48,940
That Qingshan guy

587
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,220
is just a small fry. Doesn't matter.

588
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,060
Let's extract the relic of ill omen.

589
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,500
Where's Thirteen-Thousand?

590
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,580
In your car.

591
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,620
He was buried alive by Qingshan.

592
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,900
He was badly hurt,

593
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,300
so I didn't let him come.

594
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,420
Sorry, everyone.

595
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,260
My cousin...

596
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,660
I'll beat him senseless when I see him.

597
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,820
Buried... Buried alive?

598
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,780
How did that even happen?

599
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,900
Ms. Cao, thank you for your help.

600
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,860
You should go home first later.

601
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:22,820
Oh,

602
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,780
and please keep this to yourself.

603
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:25,940
We don't need complications.

604
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,100
You... You should go home and rest.

605
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:34,860
Let's go.

606
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:39,740
Jenny,

607
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:42,060
we'll contact you
when we need insurance.

608
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:42,780
Really?

609
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,140
- Let's get out of here first.
- That's great.

610
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,260
Please contact me.

611
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,140
Ask me anything if you don't understand.

612
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:47,620
Alright.

613
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:17,780
Why is he here?

614
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:23,540
Could it be...?

615
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,260
Fiery?

616
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,300
Help!

617
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,780
Somebody help me!

618
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,180
Help!

619
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,140
What do you want?

620
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,260
I'm begging you, let me go.

621
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,060
Look. See?

622
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,780
Now you're playing the victim?

623
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,780
Look how you've ruined Cao Village.

624
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,060
You almost got us all killed.

625
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,140
And now you're shedding tears?

626
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,340
Can't stop acting, can you?

627
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,460
I... I don't understand
what you're saying.

628
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,060
It's my wedding day.

629
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,380
Please,

630
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,540
just let me go.

631
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,540
I'm begging you.

632
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,220
Please.

633
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,060
Wait, no.

634
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,300
