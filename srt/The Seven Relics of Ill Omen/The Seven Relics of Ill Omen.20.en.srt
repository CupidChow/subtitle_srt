Seven?

Seven?

9
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:48,430
Three to go.

10
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,160
Glad we have the number now.

11
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,630
The wedding in Cao Village

12
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,230
is really glorious.

13
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:22,860
The feast will last three days.

14
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,460
Yesterday, on the market,

15
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:25,630
the pork was sold out.

16
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,360
The Cao family had bought all of it.

17
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:28,500
That's right.

18
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,460
I heard those who worked outside

19
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,760
were on their way back.

20
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,430
Why is Qingshan so popular?

21
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:37,960
You don't know, huh?

22
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:39,900
Villagers there had a kiln for a living.

23
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,700
Over twenty years ago,
the kiln exploded.

24
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,960
Qingshan's parents lost their lives

25
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,830
to save others.

26
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,600
The villagers were grateful

27
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,460
and took care of him,
one way or another.

28
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,200
This time, the whole village

29
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,460
contributes to his wedding.

30
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,560
Well, Qingshan is quite lucky.

31
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,300
A lot of guys work in town.

32
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,800
Only he brought back a wife from there.

33
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,500
I've heard that's a pretty girl.

34
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,530
Taste it.

35
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:06,500
Can I use it?

36
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,360
Yes.

37
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:16,160
Hello?

00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,860

39
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,930
Cao? How's everything going?

40
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,960
Here's the thing.

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,830
These days,

42
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:23,960
it's been raining heavily.

43
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,460
There are even mudslides

44
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,560
and the roads are blocked.

45
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,900
The worst is that the base station
is broken too.

46
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,130
So now, I have to go

47
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,600

48

There's a phone
outside the village, right?

Yes, I'm using it now.

00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:56,800
I want to take a good look at you

134
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,000
and give you some lucky money.

135
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,160
Wow.

136
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,500
Aren't you a handsome guy now?

137

Second, I'll meet your wife.

138
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,560
Then I'll leave.

139
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,400
Fine then.

140
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,900
Come on in. Take a rest

141
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,600
and grab something to eat.

142
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,700
I'll lock the door.

143
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:19,930
You came back here

144
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:20,860
without telling me.

145
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,060
You must've got caught in the rain.

146
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23,230
Let's go.

147
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,060
It's a sudden rain, indeed.

148
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,560
Yanhua,

149
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,300
the steps are slippery.

150
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,460
Be very careful.

151
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,900
When you were little,
you flushed when you met a girl.

152
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,160
Now, you're getting married before me.

153
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,230
I heard you met that girl

154
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,030
when you were working in town.

155
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,100
What's her name?

156
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,130
Yafeng.

157
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,830
She's pretty.

158
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,030
I don't know why,

159
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,100
but she's in love with me.

160
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,700
Don't show off.

161
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,400
Why are both the front
and the back doors locked?

162
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,830
They used to be open.

163
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:01,900
They were open

164
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,560
because we had nothing valuable.

165
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,200
But now, things have changed.

166
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,130
It makes sense.

167
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,130
All right. Let's get in.

168
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,400
When I'm done with the trifles,

169
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,930
I'll take you to see Yafeng.

170
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,960
She's very shy of people.

171
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,300
Can I see her?

172
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,630
We have a rule, after all.

173
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,100
The bride can't see strangers
before the wedding.

174
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,560
I know.

175
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,960
But that's a rule
from the old generations.

176
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,660
Just don't let them find out.

177
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,360
Besides,

178
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,560
you aren't a stranger.

179
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,730
You're my cousin.

180
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:43,460
Don't worry.

181
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,030
Well,

182
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,030
take your time with the food.

183
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,400
I need to entertain
some guests out there.

184
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,400
I should go.

185
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,730
Off you go.

186
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,800
I'll close the door, then.

187
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,060
If your parents

188
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,630
forced Qingshan to write this letter,

189
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,700
he would have left

190
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,000
some codes.

191
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:11,700
Look.

192
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,930
Nothing looks weird to me.

193
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,530
I'll be relieved, then.

194
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,030
What's wrong?

195
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:26,860
There are traces of some words.

196
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,500
[Save me. I'm abducted.]

197
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:21,630
Yafeng.

198
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:52,760
Yafeng.

199
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:11,230
Ya...

200
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,800
Yafeng.

201
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:18,900
Yafeng.

202
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:22,960
It's me.

203
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,930
I'm Cao Qingshan's cousin.

204
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,860
Are you abducted?

205
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:44,200
Help me.

206
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,300
Get me out.

207
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,700
It's something so serious.

208
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,730
Why did you keep the secret for him?

209
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,000
I didn't mean to.

210
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,630
Chubby said there was only one line.

211
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,160
If it was just a prank,

212
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,430
telling you wouldn't help.

213
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,760
If it was true,

214
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:43,100
his family would be doing a crime.

215
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,130
And he'd feel ashamed, so...

216
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,200
So, he didn't tell you.

217
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,930
How long has he been out of contact?

218
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,560
For 48 hours, I think.

219
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,460
The base station there doesn't work.

220
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:55,360
No signal.

221
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,560
And the wedding thing.

222
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,600
So...

223
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,660
I can't reach him.

224
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,160
It's a complicated case.

225
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,830
If Chubby mishandles it

226
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,300
and the traffickers catch him...

227
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,130
How about this?

228
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,430
I'll ask Wan Fenghuo

229
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,700
to inquire about the Cao Village.

230
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,030
If something's fishy,

231
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,400
we'll go there.

232
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,130
Okay.

233
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:37,960
Who painted this?

234
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,160
What's wrong?

235
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,360
Are you okay?

236
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,030
Umm...

237
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,530
I don't know.

238
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,360
A drunk customer, I guess.

239
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,800
You know how they are like.

240
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:48,860
They break up, get divorced,
or lose their jobs.

241
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,430
Everything.

242
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,930
Maybe someone got drunk
and wanted to paint.

243
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,960
Right? Look at the numbers.

244
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,530
No normal guys would write like that.

245
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:57,230
7786, it's...

246
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,300
Are you okay?

247
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,960
I'll replace the board later.

248
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:06,560
I'm fine.

249
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:09,460
All right.

250
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,130
Go back and pack your things.

251
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:12,760
If we need to go,

252
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,460
we must be prepared.

253
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,360
Why did he take a photo?

254
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,430
I could do better.

255
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,600
I'll replace it tomorrow.

256
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,260
Luo.

257
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:13,700
Aoki?

258
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,160
So, did you paint the leopard?

259
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,830
You left a number
in such a complicated way.

260
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,330
That's not your style.

261
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:24,660
I tried to find you recently.

262
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:25,800
But you weren't in.

263
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:27,630
I have an emergency.

264
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:28,960
Tomorrow night,

265
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:30,300
at the old street.

266
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,860
I won't be available then.

267
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,630
You get to decide

268
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,560
whether to come or not.

269
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,800
Did Wan Fenghuo confirm
no one was abducted?

270
00:15:58,830 --> 00:15:59,960
He isn't sure about that.

271
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,900
But he's sure about two things.

272
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,500
First, there will be a big wedding.

273
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,760
A lot of people will attend.

274
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,760
Second,

275
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,160
the bride's name is Yafeng,

276
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,260
a girl born and raised in town.

277
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,230
She was a waitress in a food plaza.

278
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,930
Many of her friends will come too.

279
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,960
It doesn't sound like an abduction.

280
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,460
Lady Dai.

281
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,360
Did they

282
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,960
lure Chubby back for the marriage thing?

283
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,300
What if we arrive

284
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,830
and find that he's getting married?

285
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,700
Shall we offer a gift

286
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,830
or save the groom?

287
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,800
Ready to go.

288
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,530
30 kilometer in total.

289
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,700
It will take 35 minutes.

290
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,760
Turn right in 40 meters.

291
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,030
Is that village nearby?

292
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,430
No. I'm driving you to the airport.

293
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,230
We'll fly there?

294
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,130
I have an emergency.

295
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,560
I can't go with you.

296
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,330
So,

297
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:03,960
I bought you flight tickets.

298
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,360
Okay.

299
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,100
Then...

300
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,300
Join us when you're done.

301
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,160
Wrong lane. I'll drive back.

302
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,260
No need.

303
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,600
We'll get off here.

304
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,000
Let's go, Thirteen-Thousand.

305
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:37,960
I'll take the luggage for you.

306
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,460
He didn't tell you that, did he?

307
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,660
You should have asked.

308
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,560
Why bother? He didn't want to tell.

309
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:50,960
Don't say that.

310
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:51,960
He's your boyfriend.

311
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,360
You're in a relationship.

312
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,000
Mu Dai,

313
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,630
when you get there,

314
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,330
we should make contact
at least once a day.

315
00:17:58,330 --> 00:17:59,830
I know the base station is broken.

316
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,130
But there's a phone outside the village.

317
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:04,000
You just have to go a long way.

318
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,260
When I practiced Qinggong,

319
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,030
before bedtime,

320
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,760
I usually have to run for a dozen miles.

321
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,060
That village road won't scare me.

322
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,730
I'll just take it for daily exercise.

323
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12,460
I'll give you a call every day

324
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,230
at...

325
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,230
let's say... at 10 PM.

326
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,300
What's the look? Let's go.

327
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:19,600
Let me walk you there.

328
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,430
No need.

329
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,960
You seem to be very busy.

330
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:22,800
Do what you have to do.

331
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,000
Lady Dai,

332
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,930
you did a good job.

333
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:30,430
You should play hard to get.

334
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,160
You must show him

335
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,930
you're angry at his changed plan

336
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:34,030
and you do have a temper.

337
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,000
Now,

338
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,200
blow the horn.

339
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,000
Take it.

340
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,630
What's wrong?

341
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,260
I forgot to tell you something.

342
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,460
I know.

343
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,700
You must have something crucial at hand,

344
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,060
so you can't go with me.

345
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,160
It's okay if you
don't want to tell me now.

346
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,830
I respect your decision.

347
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:01,760
But listen,

348
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,830
if you keep it from me

349
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,560
because you want to protect me

350
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,660
or keep me safe

351
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,760
that's not necessary.

352
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:10,500
If...

353
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:14,160
If we expect a long relationship,

354
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:17,100
we'll have to go through a lot.

355
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,300
You can't always shield me
under your wings

356
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,360
every time when we're in trouble.

357
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,130
It won't make me safer this way.

358
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,730
Instead, it'll take away

359
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,160
my ability to solve any problems.

360
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:33,630
I want you

361
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,100
to have confidence in me,
your girlfriend.

362
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,060
I can fly with you

363
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,230
instead of flying under your protection.

364
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:42,600
Maybe I have stronger wings than yours

365
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:44,530
and can fly ahead to protect you.

366
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:53,930
All right.

367
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,830
Good luck with our trips.

368
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,630
All right.

369
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,130
I should go.

370
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,100
Keep up with me.

371
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,000
How could you...?

372
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,630
Just then,

373
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,300
Bo Yangzi, the Great Virtuous One...

374
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,430
He took up his wooden slips

375
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,800
and fought those devils.

376
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,730
It was such a fierce

377
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:44,660
and cruel fight.

378
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,160
Then whoosh...

379
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,160
He conquered
all those relics of ill omen.

380
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:51,360
Wait.

381
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,100
It's not right.

382
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,000
Why?

383
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,430
What's in your hand?

384
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,560
It's a pancake.

385
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,300
Indeed.

386
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,130
My grandpa said

387
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,030
the Great Virtuous One was holding

388
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,960
the imperishable wood.

389
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,530
Imperishable wood?

390
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,360
What is that?

391
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:20,660
A kind of wood

392
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,260
that won't decay in water

393
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,930
or deform in fire.

394
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:28,900
Where does it come from?

395
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:31,700
Where?

396
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:35,000
The imperishable wood.

397
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,200
Feng and Huang live on it.

398
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,160
Feng and Huang live on it.

399
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,760
Its name is Feng...

400
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,560
Feng... and?

401
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:48,060
Feng...

402
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:49,200
What?

403
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,800
Starts with Feng and ends with Hill.

404
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,330
I can't remember the name.

405
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,730
Feng... Hill.

406
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,000
The Great Virtuous One

407
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,860
conquered the relics of ill omen

408
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:07,360
and carved on them.

409
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:11,900
One character on each piece

410
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,860
to convict them.

411
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,930
Are you saying

412
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:18,230
the Great Virtuous One

413
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:19,960
conquered the relics

414
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,530
and carved the characters on them?

415
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,660
Then...

416
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,660
The...

417
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:26,460
The Feng, Huang...

418
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,160
The three divine birds,
Feng, Huang, and Luan,

419
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,530
descended from the sky.

420
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,030
That's right.

421
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,630
That is...

422
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,030
Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle.

423
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:45,560
With the lock,

424
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,100
the relics of ill omen
couldn't get away.

425
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,500
Then, they stayed low.

426
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,830
Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle.

427
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,830
The hill.

428
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,100
Can you think of its name?

429
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:00,100
Yin.

430
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:03,460
Yin.

431
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,030
Feng... Hill.

432
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:14,400
Thank you so much.

433
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:16,730
Thank you.

434
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,430
Mr. Qingshan.

435
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,760
They're from Yan City.

436
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,260
Thanks.

437
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,300
From Yan City?

438
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:21,760
Yes.

439
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:23,630
All right. Kids, go back.

440
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,630
You can find the candy, right?

441
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,200
Yes.

442
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:25,760
There you go.

443
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,500
Qingshan.

444
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,560
Long time no see.

445
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,730
You've grown taller.

446
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,100
And you are...?

447
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,430
Don't you remember?

448
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,030
Your cousin.

449
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,200
Your cousin Cao Yanhua.

450
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,560
We're his friends.

451
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,060
We traveled here from Yan City.

452
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,660
Oh, I see.

453
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:49,660
Now that my cousin

454
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,700
brings back some friends,

455
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,360
his...

456
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,900
his father won't be angry with him.

457
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,460
Well, you know it.

458
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:00,930
Where's my cousin, then?

459
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:08,200
The village isn't as comfy as the city.

460
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,900
Please make do with it.

461
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,060
Come on. Take a seat.

462
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,860
Have some hot tea

463
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:19,700
and rest for a while.

464
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,200
I'll tell my aunt

465
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,360
to get you two rooms.

466
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:24,260
Thanks.

467
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,400
I should go.

468
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,860
Villagers here don't seem

469
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,630
to be fatuous or ignorant of laws.

470
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:39,360
It's hard to tell.

471
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:42,160
We were led all the way here.

472
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,600
Have you found anything fishy?

473
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,330
Not yet.

474
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:50,500
Guys, be careful
with the slippery ground.

475
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:51,860
What are you looking at?

476
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,230
Thanks.

477
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:54,830
Right. Put it there.

478
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:55,500
Over there.

479
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:57,700
It's okay.

480
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,160
Did you see that old man?

481
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:01,560
The one with gray hair.

482
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,230
Who is he?

483
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:03,360
Don't touch that.

484
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,030
Chubby's father.

485
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,400
My wife wanted it to be there.

486
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:08,000
Qingshan's parents died at a young age.

487
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,800
His uncle Mr. Cao

488
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,200
was just like his father.

489
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,060
If...

490
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,200
If Yafeng is abducted,

491
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:17,000
Mr. Cao must be involved.

492
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:19,430
Maybe, Chubby is being detained

493
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,330
because of Yafeng,

494
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:22,000
but he's the son, after all.

495
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,600
He'll just be kept somewhere.

496
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:24,530
Nothing serious will happen to him.

497
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,000
That makes the two of us.

498
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:27,400
But I'm afraid

499
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:29,800
Chubby didn't make it back home.

500
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,260
Qingshan looks really honest.

501
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,030
He told me Chubby didn't come back.

502
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:36,200
I trust him, anyway.

503
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,200
But Chubby called me once

504
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:40,400
in the grocer.

505
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:42,760
So, I guess something
may have happened to him

506
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,960
on his way back to the village.

507
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,360
Oh, the young man.

508
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,930
I remember now.

509
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:51,100
He arrived

510
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:52,900
just before Tubby.

511
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,600
Tubby?

512
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,360
Yes. Cao Jinhua.

513
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,360
But she has changed her name
to Jenny Cao.

514
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,760
Do you mean

515
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:02,660
Cao Jinhua did something?

516
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,300
I don't think so.

517
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,960
They haven't met about eight years.

518
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:09,160
You know too little about human nature.

519
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,430
Chubby broke off their engagement.

520
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:14,560
It was a big scandal
and everybody knew that.

521
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,900
She must have hated him.

522
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,200
As time went by, she was obsessed.

523
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,260
On Chubby's way back to the village,

524
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,230
he met Cao Jinhua.

525
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:26,260
She then wanted to take revenge.

526
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,600
So, she...

527
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,600
She...

528
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,660
I'm not sure, though.

529
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:37,130
Maybe the fifth relic of ill omen

530
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:38,560
is in Cao Jinhua.

531
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:41,660
Lady Dai, don't you believe me?

532
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,460
Three relics of ill omen
are still out there.

533
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,330
We can't let our guard down.

534
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:46,460
We'd better suspect everyone

535
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:48,560
than neglect any details.

536
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,700
I heard some guests came from Yan City.

537
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,260
They're sort of my homies.

538
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,430
It must be the two of you.

539
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,930
You're so exquisitely dressed.

540
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,530
City folks, obviously.

541
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,000
Be seated, please.

542
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:01,000
Come on.

543
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,700
I'm a local villager.

544
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,660
I've worked in Yan City
for five years or so.

545
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,330
I heard some guests came from there.

546
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:07,430
I felt so warm.

547
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,930
So, I came to say hello.

548
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:10,760
Oh, I'm Jenny Cao.

549
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,900
Just call me Jenny.

550
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,360
I live in Heding District of Yan City.

551
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,860
And you? Where do you live?

552
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:18,860
We...

553
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,700
We live in...

554
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:23,900
Luori District.

555
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,430
Luori District?

556
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,930
The central district.

557
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,130
You must be rich.

558
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,630
Oh,

559
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,960
how did you know Qingshan?

560
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:35,160
He barely left the village.

561
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,760
When we...

562
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:37,860
When we traveled.

563
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:38,730
Right.

564
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,860
We love to travel.

565
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:40,760
That's great.

566
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,660
What does it mean?

567
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,760
It means you have
a lot of time and money.

568
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,930
People like me who work in the city

569
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,530
are just too busy

570
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,500
to go traveling.

571
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,730
Do you live near the subway?

572
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,100
Well, I'm sure you have a car.

573
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,360
That's good.

574
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,560
Regardless of the bad traffic,

575
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:56,200
you can at least have a seat.

576
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:57,530
- Yes.
- That's right.

577
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,030
Well...

578
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,900
Honestly,

579
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:02,360
whether you travel

580
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,660
or drive a car,

581
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,530
you're under some kind of a risk.

582
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,630
It's normal that some people

583
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,630
leave home in the morning

584
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,260
but fail to come back.

585
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,130
Some people walk on the street

586
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:14,560
and lose their lives out of a blue.

587
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,200
What do you think?

588
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,360
Am I right?

589
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,330
What do you mean?

590
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,930
I mean...

591
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:23,200
Accidents happen

592
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,400
and we can never predict.

593
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,930
A wise person should be prepared.

594
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:30,760
This is my card.

595
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:31,860
You know what?

596
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,430
Risks are everywhere

597
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,360
just like the storms in nature

598
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,630
that will bring us down.

599
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:37,560
Insurance.

600
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,530
What is insurance?

601
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:40,160
It's the umbrella that shields you

602
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,730
from the impending danger.

603
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,500
It can keep you out of the rain

604
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,760
- and the...
- I have no money.

605
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,160
Sun...

606
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,760
No money?

607
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,460
In this case,

608
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,830
you need insurance more.

609
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,630
Think about illnesses and disasters.

610
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,300
Rich people can handle the problems.

611
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,530
What about poor guys?

612
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:01,530
Only insurance can help them.

613
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:04,330
I'm still young. Maybe later.

614
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,260
Where are you going, handsome?

615
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:08,930
I...

616
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:10,660
I dropped some peanuts.

617
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,430
Peanuts?

618
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,660
We have a lot of them.

619
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,600
Eat as many as you want.

620
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,230
Here. Have some peanuts, pretty.

621
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,000
You know what, pretty?

622
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:20,800
Young age is your advantage
when buying insurance.

623
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:21,730
It gives you a lower rate.

624
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:23,430
People in their forties
have to pay twice

625
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,930
the cost of people in their twenties.

626
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:27,330
- Buy it when you're young.
- Jenny.

627
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:28,360
The earlier, the better.

628
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:29,500
- Eat some.
- Jenny.

629
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:30,300
Jenny.

630
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,760
I think you have a point.

631
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,260
I do, huh?

632
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,530
I do need some insurance.

633
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:34,330
Do you have a pen?

634
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:37,830
A pen.

635
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:42,900
Yes. Yes, I do.

636
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,230
Here.

637
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:46,260
Look. Everything's ready.

638
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:46,930
Thanks.

639
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,800
Come on.

640
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:48,630
There you go.

641
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:49,460
Umm...

642
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:50,800
My family is strict with me.

643
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,830
So, my brother keeps all of my salary.

644
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:55,360
I'm giving you his phone number.

645
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,630
If you need anything,

646
00:29:59,030 --> 00:29:59,760
just call him.

647
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,660
So, he'll pay for your insurance, right?

648
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,360
Exactly.

649
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,330
What's his name, then?

650
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,360
His name is Luo...

651
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,060
I'll put it down.

652
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,230
Henry Luo.

653
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,330
Henry?

654
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:14,060
That's right.

655
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,160
My brother is Henry.

656
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,000
Handsome,

657
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:18,560
what about you?

658
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,360
Me?

659
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,600
I...

660
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,300
That's my brother, too.

661
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,860
She and I share a brother.

662
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,360
The same brother.

663
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,530
He'll pay.

664
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,560
He'll also pay for your insurance?

665
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,100
Yes.

666
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:31,030
You two have the same brother, huh?

667
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:31,700
Yes.

668
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,230
That's great.

669
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:35,960
Three pieces of insurance.

670
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:37,960
Three birds with one stone.

671
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:44,830
I'm taking you to the rooms
on the second floor.

672
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:49,300
Qingshan.

673
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:51,660
Give me a hand.

674
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,200
Be right there.

675
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,300
A minute, please.

676
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,160
Do you still suspect Cao Jinhua?

677
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:01,760
Is there a relic of ill omen in her?

678
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,300
No, unless the fifth one

679
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,330
loves to sell insurance.

680
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,230
All right. It's a dead end.

681
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,360
Qingshan looks clean to me.

682
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,130
So does Jenny Cao.

683
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,100
Even the whole village is all right.

684
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,460
Then where is Chubby?

685
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,830
I think we should see Yafeng.

686
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,030
She's the key.

687
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,230
Qingshan,

688
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,460
when can we see the bride?

689
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,300
Yeah. We want to see her.

690
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,900
In three days, I guess.

691
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:35,360
The wedding is three days away.

692
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,030
Three days?

693
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:39,100
Well,

694
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,630
we have a rule here.

695
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:43,600
Before the wedding,
the bride can't see anyone

696
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:45,400
including her husband.

697
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:46,200
I know.

698
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,900
City folks like you find it unnecessary.

699
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:49,000
I quite agree.

700
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:49,930
But anyway,

701
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:51,900
the older generations insist.

702
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,560
Oh, what a pity.

703
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:55,060
We...

704
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:57,760
We can't see the bride, then.

705
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:58,900
Yeah.

706
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:00,360
What a pity.

707
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,060
Why?

708
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,460
Because our work needs us back home.

709
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:05,860
We spared some time to come here

710
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:07,260
on behalf of your cousin.

711
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,660
Tomorrow, we're leaving.

712
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:11,230
If we can't see the bride,

713
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,400
we'll be disappointed.

714
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,260
That's right.

715
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:14,960
What a shame.

716
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:18,260
How about this?

717
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,630
I'll take you to your rooms.

718
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:20,460
Later,

719
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:22,830
I'll talk to my aunt.

720
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,360
Okay. Thanks.

721
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:43,930
Come in.

722
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,800
Yesterday, Qingshan told me

723
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,560
you came all the way here

724
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,760
just to congratulate the bride

725
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,060
and give her some lucky money.

726
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:54,760
We do have this rule,

727
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,530
but we can play it by ear.

728
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:00,530
But that young man is male.

729
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:02,160
He can't come.

730
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,600
Okay. I'll do it on his behalf.

731
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:11,760
Is the bride staying alone at the back?

732
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:13,200
What about her family?

733
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,730
Yafeng is a poor girl.

734
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,600
She doesn't have a family.

735
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:21,260
I heard some friends of hers
would come tomorrow.

736
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:23,260
Let's go.

737
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,130
How did she meet Qingshan?

738
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,960
Some time ago,
Qingshan had no work at home.

739
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:30,160
So, he went to town

740
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:31,660
and had a job for three months.

741
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:34,760
Yafeng and he met over a meal.

742
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,530
Gradually, they fell in love.

743
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,760
Soon, they said they would get married.

744
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,930
We also thought it was too quick.

745
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,430
But anyway,

746
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:45,500
Qingshan is at wedding age.

747
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,030
It's good to write
this big life chapter.

748
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:49,960
To think about it,

749
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,630
Qingshan is getting married.

750
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,600
But my son...

751
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,130
Yafeng,

752
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,060
I'm here to see you

753
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,660
with Qingshan's friend from town.

754
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:04,060
Come on.

755
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:07,760
Yafeng.

756
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:11,130
Yafeng.

757
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,460
Yafeng.

758
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,600
Look at her.

759
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,930
Why is she so shy of people?

760
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:19,930
Yafeng,

761
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:22,430
she's Qingshan's friend from town.

762
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:24,800
She wasn't like this before.

763
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,830
Maybe the coming wedding

764
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:27,630
makes her nervous.

765
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:31,900
Here.

766
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,630
It's for you.

767
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:35,400
Wish you a happy marriage with Qingshan.

768
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:38,600
Take it.

769
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:41,660
Come on.

770
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,260
Yafeng, just take it.

771
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,800
Well, I saw her

772
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:00,930
and gave her the money.

773
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,430
I'll leave her alone, then.

774
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:05,100
Okay.

775
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:21,100
It's just a dozen minutes' walk.

776
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,130
Why bother to ride a camel?

777
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,130
Because I need to walk them.

778
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:29,500
Alright, alright.

779
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:49,600
Here we are.

780
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,330
Wait.

781
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:22,830
It's not right.

782
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,630
It's a cloudy day.

783
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,660
Why can we still see?

784
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,260
That's the magic
of the Stargazing Platform.

785
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,960
Be it a rainy day or a cloudy day,

786
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,230
we can see.

787
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,130
Is it really a stone?

788
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:35,900
It is.

789
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,100
It's a stone.

790
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,930
But not an ordinary stone.

791
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,900
My grandpa said

792
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:42,060
it fell from the sky.

793
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,160
Meteorite?

794
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:46,900
Oh gosh.

795
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,930
Such a big meteorite.

796
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,660
So big.

797
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:54,100
How rare and precious!

798
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:55,760
Rare and precious!

799
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:56,930
No.

800
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,230
Only the middle part is.

801
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,260
The stones around

802
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,800
gradually attach to it

803
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:01,930
as time went by.

804
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:03,560
I have a question here.

805
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:04,730
You said

806
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:07,100
Bo Yangzi, the Great Virtuous One,

807
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:08,360
left a stone
when he passed by this place.

808
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:09,960
Turns out he didn't leave it,

809
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:11,260
but discovered it.

810
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:12,730
Also...

811
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,160
Didn't you say

812
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,560
there were

813
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,030
seven reflection points in it?

814
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:19,660
Why can I see

815
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:21,700
five only?

816
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:24,160
Watch carefully.

817
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,500
It's like
when you're looking into the sky,

818
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:30,500
you only focus on the brightest stars.

819
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,900
The dimmer ones around them

820
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:35,360
are usually neglected.

821
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:43,560
Here is one.

822
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:48,160
And another one here.

823
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:49,800
Seven.

824
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,830
Seven, indeed.

825
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,430
This shape...

826
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,430
What pattern is it?

827
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,760
It looks like "seven".

828
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,500
This is

829
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:24,530
Tiankui Seven-Star.

830
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,960
What is that?

831
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:27,760
Yin,

832
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:28,830
look.

833
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,230
Forget it.

834
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,100
You can't see now.

835
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:34,130
When the sky was studded with stars,

836
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:35,800
ancient people

837
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:38,400
gave a name to the combination

838
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,930
of the stars.

839
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:41,860
In the West, these names are star signs.

840
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,260
In our country,

841
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,730
they're constellations.

842
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:47,900
Tiankui Seven-Star
is one of the 36 constellations.

843
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:50,630
It looks like

844
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:51,830
the ancient character "seven".

845
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,400
It consists of seven stars.

846
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:56,000
Tiankui Seven-Star,
seven relics of ill omen.

847
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:58,100
One star for one relic of ill omen.

848
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:01,430
We conquered four.

849
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,630
Three are on the loose.

850
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:07,800
