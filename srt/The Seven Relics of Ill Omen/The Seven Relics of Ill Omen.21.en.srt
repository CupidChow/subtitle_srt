Aoki,

14
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,450
it's been ages.

15
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:26,820
Have you been home...

16
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,610
these past two years?

17
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,340
My friends

18
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,220
will never make it back.

19
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,290
I don't deserve to go home.

20
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,340
Luo,

21
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,730
I went to Lixi looking for you.

22
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,690
You opened a restaurant,

23
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,500
became a boss,

24
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,570
and made new friends.

25
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,340
I heard

26
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,610
you've got yourself
a beautiful girlfriend

27
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,380

28
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,610
Congratulations.

29
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,170
And congratulations

30
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:06,850
on having forgotten us

31
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,410
and your adorable little girl.

32
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,100
You left us behind

33
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:12,890
to live your perfect life.

34
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,730
No, I didn't!

35
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,700
I could never forget! Ever!

36
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:19,660
Tasha.

37
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,140
Daddy!

38
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,220
What are you doing?

39
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,370
Does it look good?

40
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,780
Leopard killed Tasha
to force you to comply.

41
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,050
Sorry.

42
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,290
That day,

43
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,930
you were shot, delirious.

44
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,050
I thought you were dying.

45
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,780
You said so much to me.

46
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,220
You said you had to come back
to your hometown!

47
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,250
That's why

48
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,340
you just dumped me here?

49
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,100
What's wrong with this place?

50
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,490
It's right next to the old street,
lively as can be!

51
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,250
Luo, you should be grateful.

52
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,660
At least, you were still breathing then.

53
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,410
What about them?

54
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,540
They could only wait for me
to collect their bodies!

55
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,580
Do you think I want to live?

56
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,370
I wish it had been me who died!

57
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:44,700
Luo,

58
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,100
I can't bring myself to remember.

59
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,780
It was too brutal.

60
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,410
I went back to the Leopard's hideout.

61
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,050
It was like the fight had just ended.

62
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,700
Like a haunted house.

63
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,340
The locals

64
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,170
won't go near it.

65
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,170
I remember she took multiple bullets.

66
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,580
You even threw a blade into her eye.

67
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,410
But I never found her body.

68
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,660
She had so many followers.

69
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,050
They...

70
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,340
might've taken it away.

71
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,810
That's what I thought too.

72
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,290
But what if she was still breathing?

73
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,660
What if her people saved her?

74
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,370
You know

75
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,780
I can't move on

76
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,980
without confirming her death.

77
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,250
So

78
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,930
I burned the hideout to the ground.

79
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,050
I buried their ashes

80
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,170
near the cabin
where we used to vacation.

81
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,410
There were no provocations
or threats from Leopard.

82
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,490
After that,

83
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,980
I continued to search
for any trace of Leopard.

84
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,370
But I got nothing.

85
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,050
It was like she had died too.

86
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,540
Her men

87
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,610
joined other factions.

88
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:04,980
I know.

89
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,140
I checked them all as well.

90
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,250
I thought

91
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,660
it was over.

92
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,250
Maybe

93
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,900
it was time to go home.

94
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,580
I'm exhausted.

95
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,410
I just want to be with Noriko again.

96
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,290
So, Aoki,

97
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,610
why did you suddenly call me?

98
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,850
What on earth happened?

99
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,650
I think Leopard is still alive.

100
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,100
What?

101
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,940
Something strange happened recently.

102
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,650
Yuris' grave was dug up.

103
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,610
His ashes...

104
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,770
were scattered everywhere.

105
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,650
Are you sure?

106
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,100
She was badly wounded.

107
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,890
How could she have survived?

108
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,770
You know how she operates.

109
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,420
No one else

110
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,980
would pull something this despicable.

111
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,940
No wonder you came to me.

112
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,580
If she's alive,

113
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,100
she'll try every way to find me

114
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,490
and kill me.

115
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,530
Luo,

116
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,580
whatever you think,

117
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,980
I've already made up my mind
to seek revenge.

118
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,730
I'll leave from Wubang,
take a boat to Laima,

119
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,730
and then transfer to Bahu.

120
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,940
A speedboat will pick me up.

121
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,490
I'm going to Old Heisha Island.

122
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,620
When?

123
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,620
Ten days from now.

124
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,940
Are you coming with me?

125
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,500
Yes.

126
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,380
But on one condition.

127
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,220
This time,

128
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,380
we both come back alive.

129
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,460
Remember,

130
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:44,820
ten days from now.

131
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,220
Luo,

132
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,980
neither of us will have peace

133
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,060
until Leopard is dead.

134
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,860
And it's not just you.

135
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,740
Everyone you love and all your friends

136
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,980
will become her targets.

137
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,420
They'll end up like Tasha.

138
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,420
Oh, one more thing.

139
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,300
Noriko and I broke up.

140
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,780
Qingshan seems honest.

141
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,420
Yafeng looks trafficked.

142
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,300
And Cao Jinhua
looks like an insurance agent.

143
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,900
One of them

144
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,740
is definitely putting on an act.

145
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,940
But I can't figure out who.

146
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,140
Lady Dai, are you really going out?

147
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,460
I promised Luo Ren I'd check in by ten.

148
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,580
Sure you won't come with me?

149
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,700
No.

150
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,460
That's a ten-kilometer round trip.

151
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,740
Are you kidding me?

152
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,940
You know martial arts
so you can take it as exercise.

153
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:15,700
But what about me?

154
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,540
How am I supposed to keep up?

155
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,020
But I'm a girl.

156
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,220
Walking alone
into the mountains in the dark?

157
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,420
I'm scared.

158
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,700
Scared? How rare!

159
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,860
And me? I don't know martial arts.

160
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,020
I'm a slow runner

161
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,140
and I'm a coward.

162
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,940
Sure, I'm a guy,

163
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,140
but I'm scared of the dark too.

164
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,420
Well, good luck then.

165
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,980
You're here alone.

166
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,660
I'm not afraid to be left alone.

167
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,780
I'm a skilled fighter after all.

168
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,820
But you?

169
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,620
Don't let me find you gone

170
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:44,900
and the bed empty

171
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,460
when I come back.

172
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:47,900
Bye.

173
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,820
You witch.

174
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,100
Not coming?

175
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:53,820
No.

176
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,300
Really?

177
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:54,940
Yes.

178
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,180
Last chance.

179
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:56,940
No.

180
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:57,940
Don't regret it later.

181
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,140
Bye.

182
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,700
Help!

183
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,860
Help.

184
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,860
Help.

185
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,140
Help.

186
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,740
Help.

187
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,540
No way a scream
could carry that far outside.

188
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,780
Is someone playing tricks?

189
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,660
Help!

190
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,260
Chubby?

191
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,340
Chubby?

192
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,460

200
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,460
the Stargazing Platform can track

201
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,820
the movements
of the seven relics of ill omen.

Hello?

206
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,420
You mentioned the Stargazing Platform
and the relics of ill omen just now.

207
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,860
What's the connection between them?

208
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,340
I suspect

209
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,940
the seven relics of ill omen

210
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,220
are linked to Tiankui Seven-Star.

211
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,940
Tiankui Seven-Star?

212
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,580
From an alien world?

213
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,020
That's a bit over the top.

214
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:49,500
My theory is that each star
on the Stargazing Platform

215
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,300
corresponds to one relic of ill omen.

216
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,060
Their brightness indicates
whether a relic of ill omen has emerged.

217
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,700
By that logic,

218
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:00,460
four stars should be shining
on the Stargazing Platform.

219
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:04,460
But the truth is, there are five.

220
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,340
Five.

221
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,340
Do you remember

222
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,140
that Xiang Silan mentioned a man?

223
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:14,860
A man told me to do it.

224
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,380

225
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,860
this game

226
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,660

232
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,100
It actively reaches out to others

233
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,700
and changes their thoughts.

00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:24,820
even my uncle

381
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,180
wouldn't dare punish him.

382
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,500
Did my two friends

383
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,300
talk with anyone

384
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,100
during their stay?

385
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,700
They did.

386
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,140
With Jinhua.

387
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,340
Jinhua?

388
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,020
Cao Jinhua.

389
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,900
They spoke for quite a while.

390
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:44,740
Well,

391
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,980
anyone else?

392
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,500
Also...

393
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:54,060
The girl met Yafeng.

394
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,620
My aunt told me

395
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:00,020
she gave Yafeng a red envelope and left.

396
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,060
Sorry.

397
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,380
Yafeng

398
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,380
is my fiancée.

399
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,180
Excuse me,

400
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,700
is Cao Jinhua home?

401
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,020
Looking for you?

402
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,140
Is Cao Jinhua here?

403
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,540
You're Cao Jinhua?

404
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,660
Could we speak in private?

405
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,620
Just give me a moment.

406
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,540
I'll be right there.

407
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,780
Hold on. Just a second.

408
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,180
I'll be right back!

409
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,020
Come in.

410
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,100
Come on in.

411
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,220
This is my place.

412
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,300
Make yourself comfortable.

413
00:33:59,300 --> 00:33:59,980
Have a seat.

414
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,500
So,

415
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,460
what

416
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:08,660
brought you here?

417
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:09,380
Here's the thing.

418
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,500
Two days ago, you spoke with two people

419
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,100
at Qingshan's place.

420
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:13,900
A man and a woman.

421
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,300
That's right.

422
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,300
And you are?

423
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,100
Oh, I get it.

424
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,860
You must be Henry, right?

425
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:21,740
Henry?

426
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,340
Yeah, their brother.

427
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,460
Henry Luo.

428
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,940
We share the same brother.

429
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,460
Her brother is my brother.

430
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,740
My brother will pay.

431
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,700
I heard you guys talk for a long time.

432
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,380
About what?

433
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,580
Insurance.

434
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:34,380
Insurance?

435
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,180
Yeah, insurance.

436
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,860
The risks lurking everywhere

437
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,740
are like storms

438
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:40,900
battering our lives.

439
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,060
And what is insurance?

440
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,540
It's the umbrella over your head

441
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,260
when disaster strikes.

442
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,220
It shelters you from wind and rain,
from the scorching sun...

443
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,540
Risks are everywhere.

444
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:51,700
Did you buy insurance for yourself?

445
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,740
I...

446
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,260
Well, I did.

447
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,180
How can clients trust me

448
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,100
if I don't even buy it myself?

449
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,180
I really did.

450
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:04,980
Here.

451
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,580
I'll show you

452
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,380
my business promotion materials.

453
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,060
Take a look.

454
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,420
Well,

455
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,700
you're handsome,

456
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,420
but way too impulsive.

457
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,700
So you only talked about insurance?

458
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,900
Yes, really.

459
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,540
Ask me anything, and I'll tell you.

460
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,460
Oh, right,

461
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,660
this phone has a number.

462
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,140
It was left by the girl.

463
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,300
[Killing Three Birds With One Stone]
She said Henry kept all her money

464
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,140
and I shall talk to Henry
about buying insurance.

465
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,700
See for yourself.

466
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,260
Sorry.

467
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,300
I may have misunderstood something.

468
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,340
No, no misunderstanding.

469
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:48,940
Wait...

470
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,340
Where did they go afterward?

471
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:52,820
Mrs. Cao said

472
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,620
she took the girl to meet the bride.

473
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:55,980
I wanted to talk to them

474
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,260
about their needs,

475
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,060
but Qingshan said they left early.

476
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,660
Yafeng, I'm heading out.

477
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,740
Are you Yafeng?

478
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:35,740
Who are you?

479
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,820
I'm looking for some people.

480
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,180
First, a chubby guy

481
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:40,980
named Cao Yanhua.

482
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,300
He's Qingshan's cousin.

483
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,580
Then a young lady.

484
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,540
She gave you a red envelope.

485
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,460
Remember?

486
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,380
Just go.

487
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,620
Stop looking for them.

488
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,780
Or it'll be too late.

489
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,340
You know where they are, don't you?

490
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,580
Yafeng, tell me.

491
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,260
Please leave.

492
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,460
Yafeng, you have to tell me!

493
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,900
If they find out I tell you this,

494
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,300
they'll kill me.

495
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,060
Trust me.

496
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,180
They won't know.

497
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,980
That mountain is quite tall,

498
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:07,700
with a flat peak,
as if it was sliced off.

499
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,660
Easy to spot.

500
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,540
The cave's halfway up the mountain.

501
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,700
Remember, I was never here.

502
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,740
And you never saw me.

503
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,460
