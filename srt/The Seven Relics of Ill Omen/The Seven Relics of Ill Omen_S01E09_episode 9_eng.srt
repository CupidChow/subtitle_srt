1
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,040
   

2
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:24,060



3
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,400
   

4
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,080
   

5
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,080
   

6
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,140
I said...

7
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,440
I...

8
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,240
What's happening?

9
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,500
What is that?

10
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,980
Help me!

11
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,560
Hold on!

12
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,820
Faster! They're gaining on us!

13
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,760
I'm driving a car, princess, not a jet.

14
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,340
Steady, nice and steady.

15
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,980
Wait. Where's the clam?

16
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,045
It's gone.

17
00:03:28,045 --> 00:03:29,800
Vanished.

18
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,500
Get in the car!

19
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,660
Luo Ren!

20
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,560
- Drive! 
 - Yes!

21
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,540
This is so weird.

22
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,100
That clam's completely mutated.

23
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,660
So aggressive. With those tentacles.

24
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,060
And its shell's all jagged now.

25
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,580
That was sinister.

26
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:23,180
- Seems this clam is no ordinary thing. 
 - It hurts?

27
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,620
Thought you were immune to pain.

28
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,740
Analyze this.

29
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,820
Could the relic of ill omen be inside that clam?

30
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:32,700
From your description, it has undergone significant physiological changes.

31
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,860
Similar to how humans transform when possessed by the relic of ill omen.

32
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:39,320
High probability the relic of ill omen is within that clam.

33
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,740
Investigate further.

34
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,500
Understood.

35
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:46,020
I'll handle something now.

36
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,280
Done.

37
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,100
Mu Dai, have you noticed something?

38
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,260
What?

39
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:02,100
When I'm sitting, I'm about as tall as you standing.

40
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,960
Master, Brother Luo.

41
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,860
Why are you dressed like that?

42
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,440
My clothes have been washed.

43
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,300
I had to wrap myself in this blanket, and Thirteen-Thousand keeps yanking it off.

44
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,500
So annoying.

45
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,020
What's wrong?

46
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,640
I'm hungry.

47
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,860
Lucky, this is solid ground.

48
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,280
- That clam can't get here. 
 - Right.

49
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,820
- Are these ready? 
 - Yes.

50
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,200
Brother Cao, all you ever think about is food.

51
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,200
Look at you, coiled up like a razor clam and still drooling for a meal.

52
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,500
Obviously! That clam's been tormenting me all day.

53
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,680
I'm eating its neighbors to vent.

54
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,884
- Good? So good. 
 - Try some.

55
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,260
- Luo Ren... 
 - Why is there shell?

56
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,740
- Extra calcium. 
 - Both of you, knock it off.

57
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,620
Luo Ren, you really think the relic of ill omen

58
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,300
- is inside that... 
 - By the way, what is the relic of ill omen?

59
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,300
That's too deep a question. Answer mine first.

60
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,860
Master, what have you been through these days?

61
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,580
How about this? You explain what we've been dealing with.

62
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,760
And you explain what the relic of ill omen is.

63
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,000
You two, take your skewers and catch up over there.

64
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,200
- Got it. 
 - Wait.

65
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,600
- Enough for you both? 
 - Plenty.

66
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,320
Freak.

67
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,280
So, what's your plan?

68
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,860
You're not thinking of taking that clam down, are you?

69
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,500
Luo Ren, that's a clam, not Ping Ting!

70
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,900
We could die.

71
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:42,480
Just so we're clear. I'm not getting involved in this.

72
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,740
I need to get back to the bar anyway.

73
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,860
I haven't figured it out yet.

74
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,460
Safety first, no matter what.

75
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,100
Tomorrow...

76
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,320
let's go check out those waters again.

77
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,100
We might find Hong Sha's uncle.

78
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,640
Or...

79
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,720
Be careful. That guy's back.

80
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,000
- Thirteen- Thousand, Thirteen- Thousand... 
 - Let him go.

81
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,312
But after what happened yesterday...

82
00:07:11,312 --> 00:07:13,360
He'll manage.

83
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,140
Fine.

84
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,280
Here. Your shrimp.

85
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,900
Gosh, it's burnt to a crisp.

86
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,940
Can we even eat it?

87
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,380
Thank you.

88
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,880
Delicious.

89
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,100
You're pretty skilled.

90
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,460
This counts as skilled?

91
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,900
It's a pity you haven't tried my barbecue in Heisha.

92
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,820
Better?

93
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,720
You know how we grilled seafood back then?

94
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,720
We invented our own method, Heisha stone-grilling.

95
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,040
 Those seafoods were grilled on a large rock. 

96
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:03,060
 My colleagues and I would sing and drink. 

97
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,340
 Those times were really carefree. 

98
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,360
Your colleagues?

99
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,116
 I had two good friends. 

100
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:14,116
 One was Yuris. 

101
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,898
 He always enjoyed singing those cheesy love songs. 

102
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,890
 Then, there was Qing Mu. 

103
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,880
 Yuris, we can't hear you! Louder! 

104
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,740
 Back home, he had a fiancÃ©e. 

105
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:32,272
 Every night, he'd face the sea thinking about her. 

106
00:08:32,272 --> 00:08:35,740
 That scene is actually pretty sweet. 

107
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,400
Where are they now?

108
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,320
Still in touch?

109
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,640
We haven't been in much contact...

110
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,660
after returning home.

111
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,740
Mu Dai, we're heading to the Eye of the Lake tomorrow.

112
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,980
Are you nervous?

113
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,840
Yes. Even with the gear and the car,

114
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:16,260
just thinking about that clam makes my blood run cold.

115
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:22,020
Let's play a game to take your mind off it.

116
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,060
Rules are simple. Heads or tails.

117
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,060
Heads, you ask me a question.

118
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,380
Tails, I ask you one.

119
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,520
One question each. Okay?

120
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,000
 If he's not into it, then let it go. 

121
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,740
 Just ask him straight out. 

122
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,260
 Better than sitting here stewing over it. 

123
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,160
 Don't torment yourself! 

124
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,360
Here we go.

125
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,460
You're cheating.

126
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,540
All right. Ask me.

127
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,340
Do you like me?

128
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,960
- Mu Dai, we... 
 - All right, I see.

129
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,660
Let's keep going.

130
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,840
Mu Dai.

131
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,840
If...

132
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,860
I mean, if...

133
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,240
The guy you like...

134
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,620
is in a huge...

135
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,140
huge mess.

136
00:10:59,857 --> 00:11:01,800
Would you still like him?

137
00:11:04,142 --> 00:11:06,180
What are you trying to say?

138
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,100
I'm in a lot of trouble.

139
00:11:10,097 --> 00:11:12,217
Life-threatening trouble.

140
00:11:15,611 --> 00:11:20,160
So, you mean to avoid these troubles,

141
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,280
I should stay away from you?

142
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,040
Or I should keep my distance from you for now

143
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,840
and just wait until you've sorted out

144
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,700
all these life-threatening stuff before we can be together?

145
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,280
You're dreaming.

146
00:11:39,451 --> 00:11:41,640
I've never been in love before.

147
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,160
But I know the best time for two people to be together

148
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,325
is when they like each other.

149
00:11:48,325 --> 00:11:51,186
All those excuses like "Wait till I'm rich"

150
00:11:51,186 --> 00:11:54,787
or "Wait till I've sorted out this" just fade away as time goes by.

151
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,040
I won't wait.

152
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:03,332
If two people don't seize each other's hands when they meet,

153
00:12:03,332 --> 00:12:06,980
they might just go their separate ways and hold someone else's hand.

154
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,900
I'll only wait for the kind...

155
00:12:11,006 --> 00:12:12,806
The kind...

156
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,831
Where we've already developed deep feelings for each other

157
00:12:16,831 --> 00:12:19,511
and are willing to wait.

158
00:12:21,189 --> 00:12:23,489
But we're...

159
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,980
Not there yet.

160
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,300
- Mu Dai... 
 - Enough.

161
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,880
I'm bringing Hong Sha some food.

162
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,700
Just consider that my question was never asked.

163
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,820
We're still good friends.

164
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,900
Don't move!

165
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,620
You'd dive for clams now? The God of Water will punish you!

166
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,000
Are you crazy?

167
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,060
But how can a crazy person grow vegetables?

168
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,680
Or are you just crazy now and then?

169
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,240
Come here.

170
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,540
Look at this.

171
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,637
Here. See clearly now.

172
00:13:21,637 --> 00:13:23,331
They're all there.

173
00:13:23,331 --> 00:13:26,960
 So many fighting over territory, brawling. 

174
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,620
Open your eyes and take a good look!

175
00:13:50,237 --> 00:13:51,860
Come on.

176
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,540
There.

177
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,820
There's a man over there. See him?

178
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,892
 - That's Jiang Zhao's father. 
 - Help... Help...  

179
00:14:00,892 --> 00:14:02,700
 He's drowning. 

180
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,140
 He's watching you and waiting for you to save him. 

181
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,380
 He's waiting for you to save him. 

182
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,060
But you didn't. What held you back?

183
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,760
No conscience left?

184
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,280
Do you think I don't know?

185
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,600
Over a decade!

186
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,680
Heaven judges me.

187
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,200
My own conscience condemns me!

188
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:36,060
I know I failed your father.

189
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,580
Mr. Jiang, I'm sorry.

190
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:53,420
This is all my fault. This is my retribution.

191
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:57,800
It has nothing to do with Jiang Zhao.

192
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,440
It's all my retribution!

193
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,420
Back then, my hesitation cost you your life.

194
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:14,100
I've lost my conscience and made the God of Water mad.

195
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,560
Even our ancestors turned their backs.

196
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:23,820
Now we can't harvest a single clam.

197
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,700
This is my reckoning!

198
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,380
Can't sleep either?

199
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,900
One minute I'm thinking about my uncle,

200
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,440
the next, that relic of ill omen pops into my mind.

201
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,140
I asked him.

202
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,580
Asked what?

203
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,260
I was being straightforward.

204
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,020
And?

205
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,700
And...

206
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,420
I've got a whole bunch of options again.

207
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,160
He's blind.

208
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,320
He should get his eyes checked.

209
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,600
Infuriating.

210
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,160
Whatever.

211
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,540
I've got connections.

212
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,920
I know every type out there.

213
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,180
Give me your criteria. I'll arrange introductions.

214
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,220
Let's piss him off.

215
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,560
Then find me someone hotter.

216
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,280
No problem.

217
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,780
And tougher too.

218
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,680
Line up eight or ten meetings that standard for me to choose from.

219
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,780
Oh my, eight or ten?

220
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,160
- You can handle that many? 
 - Absolutely.

221
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,300
Fine. Then I'll start looking.

222
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,160
Eight to ten. You said it.

223
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,560
That's very kind of you.

224
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,900
Tell me about it.

225
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,300
This isn't coming out of my pay, is it?

226
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,400
Now there's an idea.

227
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:16,440
For safety, we'll use the water scope

228
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:20,180
to remotely check the underwater situation and see if we can find any clues.

229
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,200
Mu Dai, my uncle will be okay, right?

230
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,860
No news is good news.

231
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,840
Why are there no fish?

232
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,640
This feels like dead water.

233
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,680
When I was a kid, this lake had tons of fish and shrimp.

234
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,680
Even with the lake shrinking, this isn't normal.

235
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:04,160
Luo Ren, pan the detector horizontally and see if there are any fish nearby.

236
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,960
Could the clam have disrupted the ecosystem?

237
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,520
I bet it's also the reason for the pearl disappearance in Wuzhu Village.

238
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,000
Indeed.

239
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,280
Such a huge clam.

240
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,960
Even people avoid it like the plague. Let alone the fish and shrimp.

241
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,620
So, the pearl disappearance has nothing to do with retribution.

242
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,640
It's simply due to an ecological disaster.

243
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,840
- Oh, my God! 
 - Are you okay?

244
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,960
I'm fine.

245
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,760
Just algae.

246
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,680
Scared me to death.

247
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,060
Are those bones?

248
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,060
Doesn't look like human bones.

249
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,060
I'll have the detector move underwater to take photos

250
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,120
and then stitch them together.

251
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:09,040
Oh, my God. The underwater scene is really eerie.

252
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,620
What, does your village run a slaughterhouse?

253
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:15,340
We used to make sacrificial offerings to the God of Water.

254
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,860
During festivals, three kinds of sacrificial animals would be offered.

255
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,820
On grand occasions, whole pigs and sheep would be sacrificed.

256
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,620
And there are concave areas in this slope.

257
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:25,400
Water currents likely accumulated sacrificial animal bones here,

258
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,960
forming a large area of bones.

259
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,920
What a waste.

260
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,480
Luo Ren.

261
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,680
Can you rotate for a frontal view?

262
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:24,520
â«  In the deepest night, longing takes shape  â«

263
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:31,360
â«  With warm memories, I slowly hold you close  â«

264
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:38,220
â«  The path of growth is inevitably lonely  â«

265
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:44,180
â«  But someone will light your way like the stars  â«

266
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:51,820
â«  Perhaps fate is too muddy, through the storm  â«

267
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,360
What if my grandpa finds out?

268
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,460
â«  Stubbornness and courage keep you strong  â«

269
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,000
My parents died early.

270
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,820
Uncle is his only son left.

271
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:05,560
â«  In the gaps of time within memories  â«

272
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:11,060
â«  There will be light, gently warming you  â«

273
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,240
He seemed tangled in water weeds.

274
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,780
I doubt it was that simple.

275
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,520
We've all gotten entangled when swimming.

276
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,840
You could tear free with some effort.

277
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,880
Unless the clam dragged him down.

278
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,600
Anyway, let's get your uncle out of the water.

279
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,380
Perimeter is clear.

280
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,480
Can the manipulator handle it?

281
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,780
A maximum weight of 120 kilograms.

282
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,660
It should be fine.

283
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,820
Careful! The clam!

284
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,820
Thirteen-Thousand, protect the detector!

285
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,300
Got it.

286
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,220
The clam is watching from below.

287
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,180
It's going to be difficult.

288
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,040
Luo Ren, did you set up the video playback?

289
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,140
Everything's preserved till signal loss.

290
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:40,800
   

291
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,740
 Don't worry. 

292
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,980
 I've got the amulet. 

293
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,060
It's my father.

294
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,660
Mr. Jiang, did you receive my offerings?

295
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:01,680
At this point, retrieving the body means dealing with that clam.

296
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,980
But confronting it is dangerous.

297
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,897
- You don't have to join. 
 - Count me in.

298
00:24:07,897 --> 00:24:09,937
I'm definitely in.

299
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:18,470
You all know I came for Ping Ting.

300
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:21,760
Turning back now means leaving empty-handed.

301
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,740
I'm seeing this through.

302
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:29,516
Though it's dangerous, as the old saying goes, desperation breeds miracles.

303
00:24:29,516 --> 00:24:33,560
Maybe pushing forward will bring new insights and a turning point.

304
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,700
I asked Thirteen-Thousand.

305
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:44,960
His father's remains are down there.

306
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,940
His mother's might be too.

307
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,520
He's coming with us.

308
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,380
Then, so am I.

309
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:01,160
That clam took my life savings and nearly my life.

310
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,280
I would've died without you.

311
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:08,340
Besides, I have to help Thirteen-Thousand.

312
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,600
We shared bunk beds.

313
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,560
â«  Trapped in darkness, longing for daylight  â«

314
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,680
â«  I'm pursuing light behind the fog  â«

315
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,380
Why are you looking at me?

316
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,120
This is my employee, this is my employer and bestie,

317
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,860
and this is my disciple.

318
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,120
And you're my...

319
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,140
â«  I know you will finally hold on to me  â«

320
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,900
My friend. Of course I'm going.

321
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:31,060
â«  Good and evil may rise from a single thought  â«

322
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:33,800
â«  No need for a reason for us to stand together  â«

323
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,676
All right.

324
00:25:35,676 --> 00:25:37,045
Let's do this.

325
00:25:37,045 --> 00:25:38,900
â«  Our hands joined even without heaven's blessing  â«

326
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,700
 Since we're doing this, we need a plan. 

327
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,100
 Try to lure the clam from the Eye of the Lake to the surface. 

328
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,800
 Once it's out, I'll fire the capture net. 

329
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,700
 The moment it's in the net, I'll hook it to the winch. 

330
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,900
 Reverse! 

331
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,100
 That clam is too strong. 

332
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,200
 So, we need to activate the winch immediately. 

333
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,140
 At the same time, Thirteen-Thousand drives the car. 

334
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:03,040
 We'll use multiple approaches at once to firmly hold onto the clam. 

335
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,700
 As long as the car moves fast enough, it won't have time to react. 

336
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,300
 Then, we'll just tow it all the way to the shore. 

337
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,580
 After it's dragged out, the next step is to extract the flesh. 

338
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,900
 The relic of ill omen likely nests within. 

339
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:17,000
 Remove the relic of ill omen, the clam will calm down. 

340
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,440
That's our plan.

341
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:26,320
Wait, how do we bait it out?

342
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,640
I'll do it.

343
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,600
 I'll make noise from the boat to draw it up. 

344
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,780
 I'm skilled in martial arts. 

345
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,880
 I'll run away once it's out. 

346
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,920
It's been so long. Why hasn't it appeared?

347
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,220
Didn't you see it?

348
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,120
- Move to this side. 
 - If you can't see, let me see.

349
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,280
- Move to this side. 
 - I'm looking.

350
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,920
So annoying.

351
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,620
- Quit nagging. 
 - Fine, fine.

352
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,960
Spotted.

353
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,920
It's here. Here it comes.

354
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,681
Zoom in.

355
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,080
That clam can fly!

356
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,280
Mu Dai!

357
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:51,780
Mu Dai! Watch the ground!

358
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,420
Mu Dai!

359
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,520
Reverse!

360
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,220
This makes no sense.

361
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,680
Winch can't budge it!

362
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,760
Mu Dai!

363
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,180
Mu Dai!

364
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,660
Go!

365
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,320
Now!

366
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,660
Faster!

367
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,600
Drag it! Harder!

368
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,800
Drag it onto solid ground.

369
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,300
Let's see how this clam fares then.

370
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,700
Workable.

371
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,560
Strand it on the shore.

372
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,800
Almost there.

373
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,760
Victory's close.

374
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,540
Are you okay?

375
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,580
- Where is it? 
 - Let's move!

376
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,140
Go.

377
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:44,680
The car is stuck.

378
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,700
We ran it over, and it's stuck under the car.

379
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,880
Stuck under the car?

380
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,740
Now what?

381
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,900
What do we do?

382
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,240
This way. Grind it to pulp!

383
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,880
Everyone, get out of the car!

384
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,020
- Get off now! 
 - Get out!

385
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:00,400
- I'll go this way. 
 - No, come this way!

386
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,900
This is your end.

387
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,220
Brother Cao, grab weapons.

388
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,780
Take this.

389
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,040
Lift.

390
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,880
Brother Cao.

391
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:30,720
One, two, three.

392
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,720
Lift!

393
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,680
Water.

394
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,320
Relic of ill omen of water.

395
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,040
What is this?

396
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,760
Let go of me!

397
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,920
It fears blood!

398
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,080
Blood? Where am I supposed to get blood?

399
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,980
Right, I do have blood.

400
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:43,280
Smear blood on it.

401
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,480
Don't let it get back into its shell.

402
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,260
Go get water!

403
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,300
Now! Here.

404
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,840
Move aside!

405
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,740
Harder!

406
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,860
I've researched this.

407
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:35,160
The lake's disappearance isn't connected to burning clams.

408
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:39,020
It's geological.

409
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:46,040
I also inquired about the old chief.

410
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:50,460
After leaving Wuzhu Village, his mind deteriorated.

411
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:53,360
One moment he'd be negotiating with the God of Water,

412
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,200
and the next he'd say he was cursed with retribution.

413
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,160
Later, he insisted on returning to the village,

414
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,940
and his condition improved.

415
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,600
It's just that he can't hear about clams.

416
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:06,640
The moment he hears that word, he goes crazy.

417
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,900
But he'll be fine in a couple of days.

418
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:16,220
Be fine in a couple of days?

419
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,480
What kind of retribution is that?

420
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,780
You stay here with her.

421
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,800
I'm going home to check.

422
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,160
I'll take care of it.

423
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,920
By the way, Mu Dai.

424
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,500
There's something I've been wanting to ask you.

425
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,580
Back when we fought the clam, I kept calling for you.

426
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,240
Why didn't you respond?

427
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,720
Did you?

428
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,320
I did.

429
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,980
You seemed like a completely different person.

430
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:37,280
No... I wasn't.

431
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,520
It was when the clam clamped down on you.

432
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,060
Mu Dai.

433
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:56,180
How did it end up with you?

434
00:40:00,118 --> 00:40:01,538
Here.

435
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,160
Master.

436
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:12,140
Thirteen and the Hong Sha had it rough.

437
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:15,000
Should we go comfort them?

438
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,300
Don't.

439
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,820
- Let them process it on their own. 
 - Let them process it on their own.

440
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,785
Dad.

441
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,385
Mom.

442
00:40:56,252 --> 00:40:59,092
It's been a while since you've been home.

443
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,120
I brought you back.

444
00:41:06,408 --> 00:41:08,888
From now on, you'll stay with me.

445
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,713
We're not coming back.

446
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:22,401
All right. Understood, Uncle Kun.

447
00:41:26,209 --> 00:41:30,620
Uncle Kun mentioned he's setting up some kind of test.

448
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:33,420
All five of us need to return. To Lixi.

449
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,440
Not a single one can be missing.

450
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:45,200
It's fine. Then I'll go back with you first before heading to Huacheng.

451
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:49,140
Where's Thirteen?

452
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,280
He's here.

453
00:41:53,925 --> 00:41:56,065
And he's got someone.

454
00:41:59,117 --> 00:42:02,458
Jiang Zhao. Jiang Zhao!

455
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:09,287
Jiang Zhao. I know I failed you.

456
00:42:09,287 --> 00:42:11,701
I failed your family.

457
00:42:11,701 --> 00:42:15,222
All these years, I've worried about you,

458
00:42:15,222 --> 00:42:19,240
wondering if a child like you could survive out there on your own.

459
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,880
I know I'm guilty.

460
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:26,000
The village's destruction is my retribution.

461
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,620
I beg for your forgiveness.

462
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,700
Forgiveness?

463
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,885
If I forgive you, will that ease your conscience?

464
00:42:45,885 --> 00:42:48,770
No. No.

465
00:42:49,414 --> 00:42:52,821
You don't have to forgive me.

466
00:42:52,821 --> 00:42:56,080
The one who died was my father.

467
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,800
He's been lying in the water for over 20 years.

468
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,960
You should be asking for his forgiveness, not mine.

469
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,360
He's the one who lost everything.

470
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,540
What right do I have to forgive you in his place?

471
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:10,760
No. I don't deserve your forgiveness.

472
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:16,880
I'm guilty. I'm guilty.

473
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:37,140
I heard that...

474
00:43:38,202 --> 00:43:40,875
Due to geological shifts,

475
00:43:40,875 --> 00:43:44,160
a vanished lake has reappeared.

476
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:48,720
The pearl disappearance is due to ecological destruction.

477
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:53,000
Now that the problem's resolved, once the water returns,

478
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,680
the fish, shrimp, and clams will come back too.

479
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,520
And then...

480
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,860
Wuzhu Village will return as well.

481
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:28,718
But Jiang Zhao's family will never be in Wuzhu Village again.

482
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:39,070



483
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:51,240
 'Palm Print' - An Qi 

484
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:55,680
â«  The sky splits the dawn's horizon  â«

485
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:00,140
â«  It's telling me the end  â«

486
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:04,390
â«  (The end) Is about to gently appear  â«

487
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:10,910
â«  Like a whisper in my mind, a fleeting touch across my face  â«

488
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:16,500
â«  Yet I find myself in the dark  â«

489
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:22,840
â«  Every hand has two sides  â«

490
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:25,780
â«  One offers blessings  â«

491
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:29,060
â«  One waits in silence  â«

492
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:34,160
â«  There's no end to this game  â«

493
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:40,620
â«  Following the traces left behind  â«

494
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:43,220
â«  If you were me  â«

495
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:50,660
â«  You'd understand every tear of mine  â«

496
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,560
