1
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,940
 

2
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:24,040



3
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:06,020
 

4
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:09,071
 

5
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,540
Look at her.

6
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,620
She managed to hold on at first, but not anymore.

7
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:35,140
She's developed a physiological aversion to Luo Ren's voice and image.

8
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,580
Next, I'll keep showing her
edited composite footage

9
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,860
while reinforcing the perceived reality

10
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,360
with electric shocks
and other physical pain stimuli.

11
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,300
Could she be faking it?

12
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,820
All her vital signs are being monitored.

13
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:53,860
Body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure are all included.

14
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,700
She can't fake it.

15
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,880
- You're all here now. 
 - Yes.

16
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,200
- Could the Buckle be here? 
- Let's search for it.

17
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,440
My treasure.

18
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,468
The treasure of Plum Blossom Sect.

19
00:02:16,468 --> 00:02:19,140
These are all antiquities. Don't you...  Be more careful.

20
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,480
You just spat on it? Hey, don't damage anything.

21
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,120
Handle with care.

22
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,000
Be gentle with them.

23
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,742
Don't knock them over.

24
00:02:33,742 --> 00:02:35,540
I'm not talking about you.
I mean, don't touch the things roughly.

25
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,700
Don't damage them.

26
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,660
Got it.

27
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,360
Be careful. Easy does it. Gently now.

28
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,120
Gently. Gently.

29
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,960
It says the Great Virtuous One
subdued the relics of ill omen

30
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,580
at Fengzi Ridge.

31
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,960
So it was at Fengzi Ridge.

32
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,060
- Fengzi Ridge.
- Fengzi Ridge?

33
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,200
Then he hid them
beneath an ancient tree at Fengzi Ridge,

34
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,660
arranging disciples for security and astrological observations,

35
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,380
to prevent the relics of ill omen
from causing chaos again.

36
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,940
Quite a systematic arrangement.

37
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,700
After the battle with the relics of ill omen,

38
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,420
five disciples fell unconscious for days,

39
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,340
their lives in grave danger.

40
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,440
It seemed they might not survive.

41
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,240
Yet seven days later, they were all fine.

42
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,880
They were supposed to be dead,
but recovered after seven days.

43
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,400
What does this mean?

44
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,200
Were they injured during the subduing process?

45
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,240
No.

46
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,800
The Great Virtuous One
stated here they were unharmed.

47
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,260
It seems even the Great Virtuous One himself wasn't quite sure what happened.

48
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,500
Fengzi Ridge?

49
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,220
I think I've found the solution here.

50
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,340
Come take a look.

51
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,800
Look. The Great Virtuous One struck and dispersed it.

52
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,860
"Struck and dispersed it" means to break it apart?

53
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:24,152
- Alright.
- Then, he pricked between its eyebrows, and anointed it with blood.

54
00:04:24,152 --> 00:04:28,520
Hold wood to resist and draw it into the wood.

55
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:33,660
So we just use bloodstained Imperishable Wood to prick between its eyebrows?

56
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,780
Is it really that simple?

57
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,140
I've got something here too. From over 800 years ago.

58
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:40,780
I can't quite get it. But it seems to say submerge the Imperishable Wood

59
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,880
in the water containing the relic of ill omen, then drip blood.

60
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,320
It fears blood, so it flees
into the Imperishable Wood.

61
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,720
Well, that's how I understand it.

62
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,900
You're absolutely right.

63
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,280
That's exactly what it means.

64
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,040
Different methods, same principle.

65
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,100
If we consider the Imperishable Wood as a vessel,

66
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,380
both methods involve trapping
the relic of ill omen inside

67
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,040
and then sealing it
with the Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle.

68
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,980
And there's this one.

69
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,700
It mentions something about "grow".

70
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,960
This was written by Meihua Yi Zhao to Lin Feng Er.

71
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,580
Take a look.

72
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:14,080
"Recently, the subjugation of the
relic of ill omen has been unstable."

73
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,480
"Every time it emerges, it grows,
expanding more than before."

74
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,820
But the relic of ill omen we saw in the murals

75
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,460
was about the same size as it is now.

76
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:34,463
"Every time it emerges, it grows,
expanding further."

77
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,300
The informant reported that
except for Aoki staying behind at the bar,

78
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,300
the rest of them, including Zheng Ming Shan, went to Youwu Town.

79
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,740
Luo Ren's team entered the mountains yesterday, but Zheng Ming Shan didn't.

80
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:51,660
He stayed at the pass as a lookout. So our people couldn't get in.

81
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:56,020
Even if we had entered, our people couldn't have kept up with them.

82
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,978
The mountain paths are hard to navigate.

83
00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:00,998
But it's okay.

84
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,780
They'll come out eventually. Keep watching.

85
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,860
Fengzi Ridge is where the relics of ill omen
were last sealed.

86
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,760
It should also be the last location
where the Imperishable Wood

87
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,500
and the Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle appeared.

88
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,580
Ming Shan, Mr. Shen wants to stay a few more days

89
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,965
to study the materials in the memorial archway.

90
00:06:20,965 --> 00:06:22,780
Please take extra care of him.

91
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,420
We're going to Fengzi Ridge.

92
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,220
We'll split up.

93
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,160
Fengzi Ridge is such a vast area.

94
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,620
Meihua Yi Zhao and others
went in and never returned.

95
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,700
They left no clues about the hiding spot.

96
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,780
How are we supposed to find it?

97
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,480
It wouldn't help even if they had left a clue.

98
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,900
Just think about it. The relics of ill omen have already been released.

99
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,420
That means the hiding spot
has already been disturbed.

100
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,340
Though we came to find
the Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle,

101
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:49,140
our real goal is to make Leopard believe
we've found it.

102
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:52,860
So, we have to put on a show?

103
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,140
I see now.

104
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,460
Hey, guys!

105
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:00,780
Hey, wait a minute.

106
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,820
Guys!

107
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,920
You might want a guide. A guide.

108
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,660
My surname is Ding. You can call me Ding Lao Jiu.

109
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:14,160
I've been a guide here for over 30 years.

110
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,480
Does this place even need a guide?

111
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,500
Miss, you just don't know.

112
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,180
This destination offers
a wealth of unique experiences.

113
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:25,360
It's just not developed yet. The county has plans for it.

114
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,020
It's going to be launched soon.

115
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,240
People from the tourism administration even consulted me specifically.

116
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,000
My family has lived here for generations.

117
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,480
There's no legend or story I'm not well-versed in.

118
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,240
Pick me, and you won't regret it.

119
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,060
20 yuan per person. I'll stick with you the whole way.

120
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,320
Not a bad deal, huh?

121
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,860
Let's go.

122
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,180
Okay. Here, dear.

123
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,800
- Water.
- Got it.

124
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,860
Follow me.

125
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,820
Isn't he just causing trouble?

126
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,400
Says the one who's always causing trouble.

127
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,220
One million?

128
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,740
Luo Ren is offering one million for the Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle

129
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,560
through antique dealers in Xiagu Pass.

130
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,540
The news has already spread.

131
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,900
This is the design he released.

132
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,280
To prevent forgeries, only the outer buckle's design was provided.

133
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,800
The inner engraving remains unknown.

134
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,820
So is this the Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle,

135
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,140
the nightmare of generations of Star Lords?

136
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,620
After leaving Youwu Mountain,

137
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,420
they went to a place called Fengzi Ridge in Xiagu Pass.

138
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:27,420
We've learned that decades ago, a torrential flood
broke out in that area,

139
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,820
and a large number of antiques were unearthed.

140
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,580
Many antique dealers have bought goods there.

141
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,500
 
Is this the Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle?

142
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,200
I don't know.

143
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,740
I've never seen it before.

144
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,380
You were also in Youwu Mountain.

145
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,480
Where did you go?

146
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,600
A cave.

147
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,700
I couldn't get in without the key.

148
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:02,637
Master told me to wait for the messenger.

149
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,560
Tell our people to keep a close eye on him!

150
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,220
Luo Ren is utterly deceitful.

151
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,940
Don't let him scheme behind our backs.

152
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,440
Grow.

153
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,580
I understand what "grow" means now.

154
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:09,040
I understand what "grow" means.

155
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,460
I understand what it means.

156
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,700
I understand what "grow" means now.

157
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:22,380
Hey, Radishie, I finally figured out what "grow" really means.

158
00:10:26,188 --> 00:10:29,940
"Grow" refers to expansion in scope?

159
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,120
There are three records

160
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,220
of subduing the relics of ill omen
in the Guansi Memorial Archway.

161
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:37,560
During Bo Yang Zi's era, over 800 years ago, and in Meihua Yi Zhao's time.

162
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,260
The specific locations discovered by Mighty Kun

163
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,960
form an ancient "seven" shape when connected.

164
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,740
And the geographical scope they span
is getting larger.

165
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,340
So the Seven-Star Unity
always form a certain shape.

166
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:51,340
So the act of adjusting their relative positions to form a fixed shape

167
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,480
is called "Seven-Star Return to Their Positions"?

168
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,340
I looked it up online.

169
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:01,900
Tiankui Seven-Star is known abroad as the Ilta Constellation.

170
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:07,720
Every 280 years, we enter a phase of close exposure to Ilta's radiation.

171
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,140
We're currently in the exposure cycle.

172
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:13,060
And approaching peak radiation intensity.

173
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,600
280 years?

174
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,280
The era of Meihua Yi Zhao was roughly two to three centuries ago.

175
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,040
Maybe exactly 280 years.

176
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,780
So were they also in the exposure cycle?

177
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:31,100
More than that. All three conquests occurred during exposure cycles.

178
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,420
Then what happens under close-range radiation?

179
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,940
I guess the high-energy radiation charges the relics of ill omen.

180
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:41,040
Are you saying the relics of ill omen
can receive energy from their home star?

181
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,860
It's highly possible.

182
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:46,020
Maybe that's what's called "grow".

183
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:49,380
It'll be terrifying if they keep "growing".

184
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,940
Anyway, finding the Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle is of utmost importance.

185
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:56,260
It's the ultimate weapon to end everything.

186
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:06,220
Take a look. Antique pieces.

187
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,080
Sir, where's the item we agreed upon?

188
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,660
I've never seen this before.

189
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,100
Don't leave yet. Take another look.

190
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,720
This is premium quality.

191
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,920
Sir, please deliver it to Lixi.

192
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,040
Money isn't an issue.

193
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,660
Why is the door closed?

194
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,080
Got the Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle?

195
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,380
Congratulations.

196
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:31,020
See? You can do it.

197
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:35,240
When you arrive, I'll treat you to a proper meal.

198
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,320
Feed up this chicken.

199
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,620
I'm gonna give it as a gift for a friend.

200
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,720
- Okay?
- Okay.

201
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,120
Ming Shan has already arrived in Heisha.

202
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,920
Aoki is heading there today. I need to leave now.

203
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,220
Drive my car back to Lixi.

204
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,440
Well, book flights for all three of us.

205
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,140
By loyalty, since I've joined the sect,

206
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,380
I can't abandon my master in crisis.

207
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:27,480
By history, Thirteen-Thousand has known Mu Dai
longer than you have.

208
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,560
Hong Sha, say something he can't refute.

209
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,320
Mu Dai and I even shared the same bed.

210
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,520
That counts for something.

211
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,180
I definitely have to go.

212
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,580
But it's very dangerous in Heisha.

213
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:40,900
Can it be more dangerous than being chased by the clam or buried alive?

214
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,160
We'll make it quick.

215
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,780
Exactly. We know it's dangerous.

216
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,880
But for Mu Dai, we have to go.

217
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,600
No.

218
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:54,340
The thing is entering Heisha requires an international permit.

219
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,660
You won't obtain them in time.

220
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,400
This is complicated.

221
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,960
Wait...

222
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,720
Please stop! I've told you everything!

223
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,860
Really.

224
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,440
Miss, he's confessed.

225
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,920
His grandfather did acquire three Feng-Huang-Luan Buckles

226
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,940
near Fengzi Ridge over 40 years ago.

227
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,800
Luo Ren got excited upon hearing this and paid an extra 20,000 yuan.

228
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,240
He demanded the dealer stage a fake falling-out between them here.

229
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,860
Get to the point. Where's the box?

230
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,080
Luo Ren never handled it directly.

231
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,640
He had the antique dealer send it to Aoki in Lixi

232
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,640
under the guise of a fresh produce delivery.

233
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,140
There's a note inside.

234
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,660
 

235
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,600
This item is critical.

236
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,540
Ensure it arrives securely.

237
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,460
Understood. Please rest assured.

238
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:29,260
 Miss, Aoki has arrived in Heisha. 

239
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:33,400
 He's staying at a small hotel on the outskirts, carrying a large bag. 

240
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,940
Nice.

241
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,800
Okay.

242
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,260
Good.

243
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:44,480
Kill him on the way and bring the item back.

244
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,020
 Aoki just left the hotel. 

245
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,040
 He's about to get into a cab. 

246
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,560
- That was reckless driving! 
 - What's going on?

247
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,960
Look, they're all armed.

248
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,040
I've watched enough documentaries
about this place.

249
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,880
It's chaotic here. Stay sharp.

250
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,840
Get down!

251
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,640
It's just a balloon.

252
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,340
A balloon?

253
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,700
Get inside.

254
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,980
Let's go.

255
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,380
What are you all standing around for?

256
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,980
We've got this whole place to ourselves.

257
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,060
Food and drinks are ready. Make it quick.

258
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,620
I've checked everything.

259
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,720
There are no recording devices.

260
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,140
You went this far?

261
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,360
Didn't I tell you to just put on a show?

262
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,400
Just a scratch.

263
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:20,120
If the show isn't convincing, how will the audience believe it?

264
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,220
Have something to eat.

265
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,410
Did Leopard get the item?

266
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,100
Fake.

267
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,800
Fake?

268
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,560
So this was a decoy?

269
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,140
Luo Ren keeps the real one on him?

270
00:19:55,160 --> 00:20:00,080
He knows if we intercept it before the deal,

271
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,960
he'll have no leverage.

272
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,980
Alright, you can go now.

273
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,900
Guys, come on.

274
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,580
Interesting.

275
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:21,680
Even with death looming,
he's still playing tricks.

276
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,400
It still doesn't feel quite right.

277
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,520
Forget it.

278
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,760
Injuries require recovery time.

279
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,360
Waste too much time
and combat effectiveness plummets.

280
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,560
Don't you agree?

281
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,460
It wouldn't be any fun that way.

282
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,160
 

283
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,245
Welcome to the Heisha Islands!

284
00:21:11,245 --> 00:21:12,773
You're well-informed.

285
00:21:12,773 --> 00:21:16,700
I just arrived and already got your greeting.

286
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,600
 I can't wait any longer. 

287
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,480
Come alone at 3:30 AM.

288
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,800
See you then.

289
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,540
Leopard set a deal with me
at 10 AM sharp tomorrow.

290
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,120
Fine.

291
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,800
That settles it.

292
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,240
Just like when we used to fight as kids.

293
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,040
Eat up, drink up.

294
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,400
Build your strength.

295
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,380
A warrior's meal.

296
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,980
No need to hold back. Dig in.

297
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:53,980
Right. After we eat, we'll take them down!

298
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,860
We'll just go all out against her.

299
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:21,292
Guys, just thinking about tomorrow

300
00:22:21,292 --> 00:22:24,052
gets me fired up!

301
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,280
Luo,

302
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,740
this liquor

303
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,980
is pretty strong.

304
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,060
I'm not that...

305
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,500
You're right.

306
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:57,200
A little liquor like this couldn't possibly knock you out.

307
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,250
Food fuels the body.

308
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,870
An empty stomach won't get you far.

309
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:28,020
You've got to eat more when you're injured.

310
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,120
Look how thin you've gotten.

311
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:46,400
You should cut back on these high-potency neural stimulants.

312
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,320
They're bad for your health.

313
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,240
This is the last time.

314
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,600
Later,

315
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,880
we'll coordinate inside and outside.

316
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,780
I'll find a chance to create chaos,

317
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:02,372
and you take the opportunity to rescue Mu Dai.

318
00:24:02,372 --> 00:24:04,132
Don't worry about me.

319
00:24:08,237 --> 00:24:10,698
You're an interesting one.

320
00:24:10,698 --> 00:24:15,263
Drugged your mate
to team up with an outsider like me.

321
00:24:15,263 --> 00:24:16,964
Do you really trust me?

322
00:24:16,964 --> 00:24:19,024
You saw it.

323
00:24:19,684 --> 00:24:21,884
He's ready to throw his life away.

324
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,380
I can't let him take that risk.

325
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:31,080
Besides, you're not an outsider.

326
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:35,740
They're your junior and master.

327
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,020
I can't cut you out of this.

328
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,320
Now that you're leaving,

329
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,360
what about them?

330
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,880
I've been through life and death
with them time and again.

331
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,300
They're all remarkable.

332
00:25:01,517 --> 00:25:03,477
They are

333
00:25:04,149 --> 00:25:06,289
heaven-sent friends.

334
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,180
But this time is different.

335
00:25:13,104 --> 00:25:15,204
Leopard's a desperado.

336
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:18,541
And they've never even seen a gun.

337
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,000
You know that.

338
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,600
I'm leaving.

339
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,880
Who's there?

340
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,680
Everyone up. Now.

341
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,300
Get out.

342
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,800
What's wrong?

343
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,980
What happened?

344
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,200
Senior Master.

345
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,920
We've got a situation.

346
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,380
Speak your minds.

347
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:58,180
Minds?

348
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,660
Luo Ren has a deep-seated grudge against Leopard.

349
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:05,280
But this involves my master, my grandmaster, and Free Cao.

350
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,360
His cutting me out makes no sense.

351
00:26:10,982 --> 00:26:15,100
Ming Shan, we appreciate Luo Ren's intentions.

352
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,400
We also know it's dangerous.

353
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:22,160
But we can't just sit here and wait for him.

354
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,465
Don't judge me, but even if we just stand there

355
00:26:25,465 --> 00:26:30,765
throwing cheap shots, we'd still help.

356
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,500
You two took all the good lines.

357
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,360
Let me just say one thing.

358
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:45,000
I may be scared, but I didn't come all this way just for a vacation.

359
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:58,720
Let's pack up and head out.

360
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,140
Let's go.

361
00:27:24,965 --> 00:27:27,125
- Help him up.
- Careful!

362
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:29,325
I've got him.

363
00:27:30,165 --> 00:27:32,760
What now? Should we take him with us?

364
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:36,440
Our sect believes that every encounter, regardless of when

365
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,220
or where it takes place, is a matter of fate.

366
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,560
Such a large dose didn't even knock him out.

367
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,360
Let's take him with us.

368
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,780
Keep him safe. Let's go.

369
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,480
Is he in a fit mental state for this?

370
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,580
Stay with us, Aoki.

371
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,080
Where's Mu Dai?

372
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:44,060
We've never really had a proper showdown, have we?

373
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,620
Eager to fight me to the death?

374
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,480
But I can't imagine how you'd manage that.

375
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,560
Your girlfriend's in my hands.

376
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,160
There are 20 armed guards here.

377
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,020
And you're all alone.

378
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:07,160
You know I have the relic of ill omen.

379
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,720
I'm looking forward to seeing
your performance tonight.

380
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,134
Where's Mu Dai?

381
00:29:23,134 --> 00:29:24,934
Where's the item?

382
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,760
You'd better behave.

383
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,060
Or, I'll kill you and still get it.

384
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,820
The one Aoki has is fake.

385
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:36,500
This one you've got is also fake.

386
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,960
All your efforts have been just a show for me.

387
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:46,060
You wanted me to think you actually had leverage.

388
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,860
This is real.

389
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,860
Still being stubborn, huh.

390
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:57,280
What makes you think it's fake?

391
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,780
Have you ever seen the real one?

392
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:04,140
The Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle has a strong suppressive effect on the relic of ill omen.

393
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:09,280
If it were real, I'd feel extremely uncomfortable just standing near it.

394
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,140
I see.

395
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,920
This is real.

396
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,080
It's already working on you.

397
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:27,220
But it's a slow, subtle process.

398
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,680
In less than a year,

399
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,080
it'll kill you.

400
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,760
How dare you trick me?

401
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,820
This is the real Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle.

402
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:52,497
I've brought it as you requested.

403
00:31:52,497 --> 00:31:54,337
Now where's Mu Dai?

404
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:59,860
Killing them would be easy for me.

405
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,400
It's not difficult to kill you either.

406
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,540
Try me.

407
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,340
Take a look.

408
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:39,960
A little surprise to liven things up.

409
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,980
I'll give you a chance.

410
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:46,800
Our score needs to be settled.

411
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,480
Defeat me, and no one here will stop you.

412
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,580
You'll live,

413
00:32:54,622 --> 00:32:57,042
and I'll return your girl to you.

414
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,900
Bring it over.

415
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,480
Thirteen-Thousand, stay with the car and Aoki.

416
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,960
Be ready to support us when we come out.

417
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,960
You're not going in.

418
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,570
Although this is the back door,

419
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:41,120
their people might come in and out at any time.

420
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,200
So stay sharp.

421
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,560
I'm leaving.

422
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,220
Kill him.

423
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,000
Leopard.

The door's locked.

436
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:30,160
It seems the only way in
is through that vent up above.

437
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,665
I took a look. It's pretty enclosed.

438
00:36:35,665 --> 00:36:37,834
You two wait for me at the entrance.

439
00:36:37,834 --> 00:36:40,126
Stay sharp.

440
00:36:40,126 --> 00:36:41,606
Take this.

441
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,400
What are you staring at?

442
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,120
Your qinggong must be better
than my master's, right?

443
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,080

Well?

456
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,080
From up here, I can see the general layout.

457
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,920
Most of the force is concentrated
around the iron cages.

458
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,560
- Can you pick locks?
- Yes.

459
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,840
Your task now is to pick the locks.

460
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,800
- Are you afraid of dying?
- Yes.

461
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,840
I mean, no.

462
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,160
It's okay.

463
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,220
I've tied a rope up here.

464
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:54,360
Later, you'll climb up the rope.

465
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,760
Swing in using the rope
and start shooting at them.

466
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,140
And your main job is to draw their attention.

467
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,440
That way, Cao and I
will have a chance to storm in.

468
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,060
Hurry up.

469
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,440
Mu Dai?

470
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,340
Kill him.

471
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,860
Mu Dai, wake up.

Mu Dai!

476
00:40:37,326 --> 00:40:39,226
Hurry up.

491
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,820
 ♫ The reason they fall ♫ 

492
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:27,362
 ♫ If I were you ♫ 

493
00:42:27,362 --> 00:42:34,400
 ♫ I'd feel each breath you take ♫ 

494
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:36,700
 ♫ Then we'd move forward ♫ 

495
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:41,214
 ♫ The sky splits the dawn's horizon ♫ 

496
00:42:41,214 --> 00:42:45,480
 ♫ Telling me the end ♫ 

497
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:49,900
 ♫ Is about to gently appear ♫ 

498
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:56,700
♫  Like a whisper in my mind,  ♫ ♫  a fleeting touch across my face  ♫

499
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,820
 ♫ And I remain in darkness ♫ 

500
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:04,440
 ♫ The sky splits the dawn's horizon ♫ 

501
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:08,711
 ♫ Telling me the end ♫ 

502
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:13,152
 ♫ Is about to gently appear ♫ 

503
00:43:13,152 --> 00:43:20,193
♫  Like a whisper in my mind,  ♫ ♫  a fleeting touch across my face  ♫

504
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:26,260
 ♫ And I remain in darkness ♫ 

505
00:43:35,024 --> 00:43:39,560
 ♫ The sky splits the dawn's horizon ♫ 

506
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:43,820
 ♫ Telling me the end ♫ 

507
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:48,260
 ♫ Is about to gently appear ♫ 

508
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:55,350
♫  Like a whisper in my mind,  ♫ ♫  a fleeting touch across my face  ♫

509
00:43:56,040 --> 00:44:00,220
 ♫ And I remain in darkness ♫
