[Episode 16]

5
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,260
Too many people have spoiled you.

6
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,380
That's why you're so weak.

7
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,820
Stop struggling.

8
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:16,820
It won't help.

9
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,100
I've taken over your life

10
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,460
from right here.

11
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,980
Do you know how you came into being?

12
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,020
Do you know how to live properly?

13
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,380
Let me out. Come on.

14
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,100
Now!

15
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:39,700
Luo Ren left, huh?

16
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,500
Didn't you have a good conversation?

17
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,500
Not bad.

18
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,180
We've talked things out.

19
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,500
What's gone is gone.

20
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,500
Mu Dai.

21
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,780
This is the first time
I've adopted a child.

22
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,500
Now as I think about it,

23
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,420
before I even took good care of myself,

24
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,540
I had adopted you.

25
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,980
I wasn't a good example.

26
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,940
Nor did I give you proper guidance.

27
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,900
I'm largely to blame

28
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,940
for what you are now.

29
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,540
What I am now...

30
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,020
What's wrong with me?

31
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,180
I think I'm good.

32
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,220
Madam Hong,

33
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,420
you adopted me and took care of me,

34
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,500
so I didn't die anyway.

35
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,860
When I was in such big trouble,

36
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,500
you didn't abandon me either.

37
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,020
You're better than a lot of mothers.

38
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,580
You don't need to feel guilty.

39
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,700
You don't owe me anything.

40
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,180
Madam Hong.

41
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,820
Do you think I'm sick?

42
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,060
I don't think so.

43
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,580
But if you all think I am,

44
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,260
I'm okay with it.

45
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,740
It doesn't matter.

46
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,660
You don't even know
what each other can't get over.

47
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,180
You're both dishonest.

48
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,700
How can you

49
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,700
call it "love"?

50
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,860
Zhama's mom said

51
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,420
my future would be brighter.

52
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,300
But,

53
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,900
without you in it...

54
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,500
Nothing could ever be bright enough.

55
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,660
What if

56
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,140
I've already moved on?

57
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,100
What would you do?

58
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,340
Then I'll pursue you.

59
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,660
With everything I've got.

60
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,140
Luo Ren.

61
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,260
Luo Ren.

62
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,540
What happened?

63
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,060
Luo Ren.

64
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,300
Mu Dai ran away.

65
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,180
Ran away?

66
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,180
She didn't even take her phone.

67
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,500
She just left a note.

68
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,220
[Don't look for me. You won't find me.]

69
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,820
Fresh fruit.

70
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,540
The last sale before the lights go out.

71
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,220
Buy some if necessary.

72
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,420
Peanuts, sunflower seeds,

73
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,980
beer, beverages, and fresh fruit.

74
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:49,620
Excuse me.

75
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:50,780
Hi, Miss.

76
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,540
What would you like?

77
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:52,780
How much is this?

78
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,140
Thirty per box.

79
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,660
Okay. Thanks.

80
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,340
Peanuts, sunflower seeds.

81
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,020
Help!

82
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,820
Let me go!

83
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,500
Let me go!

84
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,340
Get your hands off me!

85
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,380
Let me go!

86
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,460
Stop struggling.

87
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:40,940
Don't make a sound.

88
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,060
What's going on here?

89
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,660
You disturbed others. You know?

90
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,780
Woman,

91
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,540
stay away.

92
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,820
Or I'll kill you.

93
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,060
Don't yell.

94
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,980
Stop struggling and be quiet.

95
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,220
Come and kill me, then.

96
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,300
Hey, you...

97
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,140
Who is he?

98
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,700
I don't know him.

99
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,900
He stared at me before I boarded.

100
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,620
After I boarded,

101
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,900
he moved next to me.

102
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,260
Then he behaved inappropriately
in the dark.

103
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,260
Miss,

104
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,540
don't trust her.

105
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,060
She's my girlfriend.

106
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,580
We were arguing.

107
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,740
You guys go back to sleep.

108
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,500
Stop recording.

109
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,340
Don't look around.

110
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,420
He's lying!

111
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,300
He's not my boyfriend!

112
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:37,940
I don't even know him.

113
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,580
What's her name?

114
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,300
It's...

115
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,380
Her name...

116
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,100
You don't even know her name.

117
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,300
Are you really a couple?

118
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,380
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

119
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,580
- Photograph him. Hurry.
- Photograph him. Hurry.

120
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,260
Woman,

121
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,180
after we get off, you'll be in trouble.

122
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,700
Let me go!

123
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,620
Do you know her?

124
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,500
I'm asking you!

125
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,900
I don't know her. I don't.

126
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,700
This guy deserves this.

127
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,660
He's shameless.

128
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,700
The train cop is here.

129
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,660
The police told me

130
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,700
that man was a repeat offender.

131
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,100
Now, he's detained.

132
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,740
You helped me heroically.

133
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,860
So, you'd be all right.

134
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,180
Just now,

135
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,660
I saw your name Mu Dai on the form.

136
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,300
Can I call you Mu?

137
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,540
Okay.

138
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,500
Mu,

139
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,300
I don't mean harm.

140
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,060
I really want to thank you
for helping me out.

141
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,380
Sadly, you ended up here.

142
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,460
Where will you be living tonight?

143
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,580
My auntie and I will get you there.

144
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,300
I don't know where I'll live.

145
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,740
I'm here to look for someone.

146
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,540
You don't know?

147
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,580
Will you stay at a hotel?

148
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,420
I can't afford it.

149
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,380
Mu,

150
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,740
how about this?

151
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,100
You go with me.

152
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,340
In the old town,
my auntie has a hotpot restaurant.

153
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,780
She offers food, accommodation,

154
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,660
and salary.

155
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,820
And she's well-connected.

156
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,300
Maybe she can help you find that guy.

157
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,340
Zheng Li.

158
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,380
Auntie.

159
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,140
Are you okay?

160
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:22,860
Auntie.

161
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,260
I was so scared.

162
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,140
I'm fine, Auntie.

163
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,300
She saved me.

164
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,380
She's Mu Dai.

165
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,900
Thank you.

166
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,860
Auntie,

167
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,820
you need a kitchen porter, don't you?

168
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,420
I made her a promise.

169
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,820
Just help me with this.

170
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,420
That's not just a job.

171
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,060
That's a tough job.

172
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:43,380
Move.

173
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,500
She's a pretty girl.

174
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:44,940
Behave.

175
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:45,780
Will she do this job?

176
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,260
How many times?

177
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,140
Come on, Auntie.

178
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,540
She is good at martial arts.

179
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,740
She'll do a good job.

180
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,260
You're just like your father.

181
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,460
You create problems for me.

182
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,780
So, you're saying "yes".

183
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:57,900
Let's go.

184
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,180
In recent years, there have been fights

185
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,460
near the bridge in the development zone.

186
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,180
You girls don't go there.

[Evilness in the Wind]
[People only count on themselves]

188

189
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:05,660
All right.

190
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:06,860
Here we are.

191
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,180
- Here.

00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,740
News in Lingui?

382
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,140
That's right.

383
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,340
In this digital age,

384
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,780
we should look for Mu Dai
in a more flexible way.

385
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:30,860
Understand?

386
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,940
Simply by watching local videos?

387
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,300
This is targeted advertising.

388
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,820
Luo Ren asked Wan Fenghuo for help.

389
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,900
What can we do?

390
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,500
We have to do something else.

391
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,780
We picked some famous local vloggers

392
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,140
and paid them to post for Mu Dai.

393
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,420
Know what this is?

394
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:50,220
Powerful networking and Matthew effect.

395
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,020
The point is...

396
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:53,620
Effective.

397
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,180
Will it help?

398
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,420
He worked really hard on it.

399
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:00,980
He did?

400
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,100
He gave gifts
to quite a few local anchors.

401
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,300
He's the top-tipping audience.

402
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,420
They'll keep him informed.

403
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,980
I spent money on ads.

404
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,540
Right. The money of the bar.

405
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,580
Mr. Zhang doesn't know yet.

406
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:12,900
Go away.

407
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:13,780
I'll get you some water.

408
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,660
Mu Dai and Luo Ren
have been through enough.

409
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,100
How did this happen?

410
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,460
I'm so worried.

411
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,500
Glad you're here.

412
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,620
Many hands make light work.

413
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,540
I'm thirsty.

414
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,180
Where's the water?

415
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,540
What's wrong?

416
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:34,980
Come on.

417
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:35,860
She's thirsty.

418
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,500
I think I saw the vision too.

419
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,660
Where is it?

420
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,300
Where?

421
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,500
There.

422
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,780
Eight fives.

423
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,700
Let me help you.

424
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,340
Are you okay, bro?

425
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,260
Hey, bro.

426
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,060
I'm sorry.

427
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:40,980
Sorry.

428
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,660
Let's go on.

429
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,380
Come on.

430
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:44,660
Zhang Tong.

431
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,500
Do it if you're a man.

432
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,660
Stop hesitating.

433
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,180
Chao.

434
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,380
Zhang Tong.

435
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,820
How could you be such a coward?

436
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,460
It's not going to kill you.

437
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:00,580
Chao,

438
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,140
I heard...

439
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,660
That's a scary place.

440
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,500
Nonsense!

441
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:06,980
There's nothing scary.

442
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,700
I've been there.

443
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,300
People say...

444
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,980
In that place,

445
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,420
at midnight,

446
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,660
if you put your ear to the platform,

447
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,420
you'll hear the heartbeats.

448
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,540
Thump, thump.

449
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,100
Oh, Zhang Tong.

450
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:21,660
Hey, girl.

451
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,220
Come on.

452
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,020
It's you again.

453
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,020
You said you would drink with me.

454
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:25,860
Drink it up.

455
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,020
- Come on.
- Drink it.

456
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,300
- Go ahead.
- Go ahead.

457
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,460
Make her drink.

458
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:32,980
Stop it.

459
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,180
Chao,

460
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,500
she said she couldn't drink.

461
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,300
Well, I'll drink for her again.

462
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,220
Zhang Tong.

463
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:39,700
Okay?

464
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,340
Hey, you...

465
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,540
Drink this up.

466
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,820
Do you enjoy it?

467
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,900
Come on. Drink it up.

468
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:50,940
Be quick.

469
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,380
It's okay.

470
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,500
It's okay, Li.

471
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,500
Auntie,

472
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,300
they did the same thing last time.

473
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,340
What do we do?

474
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,020
I can't help it.

475
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,300
What can I do?

476
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,340
Whose food is this?

477
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,420
Theirs, of course.

478
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,380
I'm not going.

479
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,860
Neither am I.

480
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:17,660
Shall I go?

481
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,300
They'll make fun of me too.

482
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,940
I'm still cooking.

483
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,340
I'll go.

484
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,660
Miss Mu Dai.

485
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,380
What's going on?

486
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,540
Now, a dishwasher serves the dish?

487
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,540
The water went
into the dish from your gloves.

488
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,540
How dirty!

489
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,580
What's going on here?

490
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,780
How can humans eat this?

491
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,580
Where's your boss?

492
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,740
- Madam.
- Get her out.

493
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:58,700
Come on.

494
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,780
You're a dishwasher.

495
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,020
What makes you so proud?

496
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:02,820
Buddies.

497
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,660
Why did you do this?

498
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,620
Come on.

499
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,780
Stab me if you dare.

500
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,860
You're noisy. You know?

501
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,020
It's just a mistake.

502
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,460
It must be.

503
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,380
She's new here.

504
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,460
She has a quick temper.

505
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,660
Mistake, indeed.

506
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:41,860
She doesn't know the rules. Go.

507
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:42,900
You go on playing.

508
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,060
Go on.

509
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,260
Another crate of beer for them!

510
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,260
Mu,

511
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,540
you're amazing.

512
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,260
All right, Chao.

513
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,340
Mu,

514
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,100
did you work as a guard?

515
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,180
You handled it so smoothly.

516
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,300
No. I've never done this before.

517
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,060
Mu Dai, you'll just stay here.

518
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,340
Don't wash dishes tomorrow.

519
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,820
I'll get a new dishwasher.

520
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,820
I can be a dishwasher and bodyguard.

521
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:04,660
Okay.

522
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,420
I'll give you a pay rise!

00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,260
Luo.

525
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,620
What do you think?

526
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,940
The vision appeared again.

527
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,580
It's the fourth one.

528
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,780
It's coming. Tell us what to do.

529
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,020
Say no more.

530
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,740
Mr. Kun asked us

531
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,820
not to stay alone.

532
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,500
But now, Mu Dai is missing

533
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,500
and she's alone.

534
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,700
The fourth relic of ill omen

535
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,660
is stirring.

536
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,260

539
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,060
The legend of the Statue is horrible.

540
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:20,940
I don't dare to go.

541
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,500
I wonder if I'm okay with the vibe.

542
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,660
I want to take photos there.

00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,620
I'm also from Nantian.

544
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,260
A lot of people know this place.

00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,100
My neck feels cold now.

546
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,380
I heard one would be cursed there

547
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,460
As if somebody were blowing.

548
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:30,620
Oh gosh.

549
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,500
How I wish to see
the Flying Horse Statue!

550
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,100
It's really quirky there at night.

551
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,460
This legend seems influential.

552

554
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,580
But I don't want to see anything scary.

Mu.

556
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,700
You scared me.

557
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,540
Am I that scary?

558
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,260

from this forum.

562
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:05,500
Especially the Flying Horse Statue.

563
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,420
It's the scariest.

564
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,100
It was 20 years ago.

565
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,100
Back then,

566
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,020
a new district
was being developed in Nantian.

567
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:16,300
The statue of a flying horse was built.

568
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,340
But shortly after it was finished,

569
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,220
there was a change of plan.

570
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,340
So, this place became a suburb.

571
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,580
Fewer and fewer people came.

572
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:28,420
Gradually, a weird tale was told.

573
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,620
A young couple dated

574
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,380
at the Flying Horse Statue.

575
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,700
The man

576
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:38,140
wanted to write some vows on it.

577
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,860
But just when he finished his name,

578
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,500
he heard...

579
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:43,380
Thump.

580
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,340
The pounding of heartbeats.

581
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,380
There are really heartbeats.

582
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,100
Let me hear it.

583
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,220
Just then,

584
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,500
they suddenly felt some air

585
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,380
on their necks

586
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,220
as if someone was blowing behind them.

587
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,660
They didn't dare to look up.

588
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,180
They glanced down,

589
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,420
only to see

590
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,420
a pair of pale woman's legs

591
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,260
behind them

592
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:13,260
in red high heels.

593
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,260
Mu,

594
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,380
don't you think it's scary?

595
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,580
It is, indeed.

596
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,820
Come on.

597
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,780
Don't be a buzzkill.

598
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,700
This is the most terrifying place

599
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,980
in Nantian.

600
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,380
Many people go there
to test how brave they are.

601
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,260
If you dare to go there at night,

602
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,820
you'll be really bold.

603
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,820
Your shoes look the same, huh?

604
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:52,900
Hey, Mu.

605
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,580
Do you have a boyfriend?

606
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,540
Sort of.

607
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,500
What does that mean?

608
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,260
Is he handsome?

609
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,140
That doesn't matter.

610
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,420
Mu, tell me about him.

611
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,260
Wrap it up for me.

612
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:36,820
Okay.

613
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:37,940
This one.

614
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,140
- I'll take this.
- Enjoy the food.

615
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:45,820
I'll take this too.

616
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,140
It's for you.

617
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:47,820
Okay.

618
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:48,940
Come next time.

619
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,260
Cash, huh?

620
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:52,940
Yes. Here it is.

621
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:53,460
Okay.

622
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,140
Mom.

623
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,460
Mom, wait for me!

624
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,980
Don't leave me!

625
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,220
Look.

626
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,100
Look how she's twisting.

627
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,260
Look how she's dressed.

628
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:16,780
How shameless.

629
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:18,940
Mom!

630
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,780
Mom!

631
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,300
Run!

632
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,380
Keep running!

633
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,620
Fought back, huh?

634
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,780
How daring!

635
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,060
Don't hit my mother!

636
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:46,140
Mom. Don't hit her.

637
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,340
May I ask about someone?

638
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:02,580
Not until you buy some pancakes.

639
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,420
Two radish pancakes, then.

640
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,180
Just two. Keep the change.

641
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,940
What do you want to know?

642
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,780
Was there a round building like a patio

643
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,820
right over there?

644
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,740
I used to live there.

645
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,780
Does anybody live there now?

646
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,660
No. It was deserted years ago.

647
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,020
Do you remember the residents?

648
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,740
Who specifically?

649
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,340
A woman in her twenties.

650
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,940
She wore red high heels,

651
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,980
dressed herself, and wore makeup.

652
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,420
She loved to sing too.

653
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,220
Oh, her.

654
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,300
You know her?

655
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,700
Yes.

656
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,660
She rented a room there

657
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,100
and lived with a little girl.

658
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,540
She seduced a lot of men.

659
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,540
Their wives came to quarrel with her.

660
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,020
Her head was even broken.

661
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,260
In that building,

662
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,820
she had the most active romantic life.

663
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,300
I knew

664
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,060
she would be in trouble someday.

665
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,860
This woman was really vicious.

666
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,740
Later, she fell sick.

667
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,300
Her body was rotten.

668
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,340
She deliberately wore a scarf

669
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,420
to cover her face.

670
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,140
She moved along as if she were healthy,

671
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,820
trying to infect us.

672
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,780
What was wrong with her?

673
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,260
Nobody knew.

674
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,700
They said she dated freely
and later fell gravely ill.

675
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,300
The doctor didn't cure her

676
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,500
and she made a scene.

677
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:25,220
She stabbed him with a blade.

678
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,060
She looked horrible.

679
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,420
Terrifying, indeed.

680
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,340
What happened later?

681
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,500
She died.

682
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,860
She jumped off a bridge
near the Flying Horse Statue.

683
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,820
She actually died.

684
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,380
But bad luck stuck in that building.

685
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,220
The residents fought,
divorced, and stole.

686
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,340
In the end,

687
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,420
nobody dared to mention her name.

688
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,540
Or bad things would happen.

689
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,740
But I'm not scared.

690
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,620
I'm old enough, after all.

691
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,300
Poor little thing.

692
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,820
I don't know how her daughter ended up.

693
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,060
She had such a bad mother.

694
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,700
Tragedy, indeed.

695
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:41,700
Going upstairs, huh?

696
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,700
I'll return it later.

697
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:45,340
Okay.

698
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:46,380
Get the laundry back.

699
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,020
Won't you cook?

700
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,100
No. We'll eat out.

701
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,700
Don't use so much oil.

702
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,940
What a waste!

703
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,460
It's not about the money.

704
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,140
Cooking, huh?

705
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,300
I'm off duty.

706
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,060
Have a taste.

707
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:58,900
You cook very well.

708
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:59,540
Of course.

709
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,740
There's news.

710
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,460
Hongsha, there's finally news.

711
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,220
What's wrong?

712
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,820
That famous vlogger sent me this,

713
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,300
asking if we were looking for her.

714
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,260
Fast forward.

715
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,700
Honestly,

716
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,740
my master hit him really hard.

717
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,020
That scoundrel

718
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,100
would remember this forever.

719
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,060
But anyway, it's okay

720
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,540
to hit a rogue like that.

721
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,140
Where did the train go?

722
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:51,740
Nantian.

723
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,580
Nantian?

724
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,060
I'll go wash my hands.

725
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,100
You send this to Luo Ren.

726
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:55,740
Okay.

727
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,260
Why will you wash?

728
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,380
When I got the message,

729
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,580
I was peeing.

730
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,780
I got some on my hands.

731
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:08,220
Cao Yanhua, you make me speechless.

732
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:37,580
Who?

733
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:38,540
Who's that?

734
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,060
You...

735
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,220
You...

736
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,020
Aren't you the waitress?

737
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,300
Gosh. You walked so silently.

738
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,340
You scared me.

739
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,020
What are you doing?

740
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,180
People say

741
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,660
when there's no moon,

742
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,820
heartbeats can be heard here.

743
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:41,980
Chao,

744
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:45,100
I really left my name
on the Flying Horse Statue.

745
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:45,940
If you don't believe me,

746
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,700
go check it.

747
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,220
Fine, fine.

748
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:48,980
Go check it.

749
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,180
What's wrong? Why don't you move?

750
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:54,700
Chao,

751
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:57,340
I want to pee.

752
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,060
Want to pee, huh?

753
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:06,980
Come this way.

754
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:12,580
Chao,

755
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,020
this is way too high.

756
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,620
How about we leave?

757
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:18,780
The higher you stand,

758
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,860
the farther you'll pee.

759
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:22,420
Move.

760
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,020
Chao, I...

761
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:07,540
You...

762
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:09,700
Pocketty?

763
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,620
Why did you do that?

764
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:13,780
Why?

765
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,500
Mu?

766
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,700
Why did you wake up so early?

767
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:37,700
Did I go out last night?

768
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,620
Last night...

769
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,540
Last night,

770
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,300
you did go out.

771
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:44,740
You came back late. Don't you remember?

772
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:47,140
I mean, did I go out
after I fell asleep?

773
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:47,940
After...

774
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,060
After you fell asleep,

775
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,820
how could you go out?

776
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:55,340
If you mean sleepwalking, I don't know.

777
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:57,060
I was dead asleep.
