00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,290
Zhang Guanghua?

6
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,570
Who's that?

7
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,130
The person she's looking into

8
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,210
is probably dead.

9
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,690
Dead?

10
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,740
Zhang Guanghua was also from Luoma Lake.

11
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,130
Lived in the same building as Li Yaqing.

12
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,330
After the incident,

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,100
he vanished.

14
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,100
He was in Luoma Lake too?

15
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,620
An old acquaintance.

16
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,980
I just want to know where he is.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,930
Money isn't the issue.

18
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,260
It's this photo.

19
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,460
Once it's lost, it's gone forever.

20
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,050
Lost him?

21
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,820
Not my fault.

22
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:01,770
That kid's extremely surveillance-aware.

23
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,980
And let's be real.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,460
His Hummer's a beast.

25
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,570
Floor it,

26
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,660
and we common folks can't keep up.

27
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,410
Dai,

28
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,660
maybe that kid's into you,

29
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,610
and that's why he did something so wild.

30
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,170
Well, I gotta say,

31
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,100
he looks pretty sharp, doesn't he?

32
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,820
So Luo Ren's the one behind Ma Tuwen.

33
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,380
Maybe you two should...

34
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,290
Move, move! Keep up!

35
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,130
Isn't that his car?

36
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,730
He got away again.

37
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,290
He can run, but he can't hide.

38
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:35,570
What do you mean?

39
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,730
I know the driver.

40
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:38,690
Mozzie.

41
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,820
A pretty famous bar singer
on Bar Street.

42
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,450
Well, Mr. Cao from Qianjinbei.

43
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,010
You flatter me.

44
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,450
Can you find out where he lives?

45
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,260
Absolutely.

46
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,850
Fine. I'll trust you one more time.

47
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,410
Let's go.

48
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,410
GPS says we're here.

49
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,890
Which one's his place?

50
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,380
Let's take a look around.

51
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,690
Look,

52
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,570
isn't that his car?

53
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,690
Excuse me, is this Building No. 3?

54
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,410
Cen Chunjiao?

55
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,730
Isn't Ms. Cen here today?

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,980
She left early,

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,980
saying there was an emergency at home.

58
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,290
It's that kid.

59
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,340
He's cutting in here.

60
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,010
What's she doing here?

61
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,060
Let's go.

62
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,610
Take it.

63
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:11,410
But our inn's on the main street.

64
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,100
So there's a camera

65
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,660
that catches people coming and going.

66
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,170
I had the sense

67
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,660
to keep a backup.

68
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,700
But even the cops
couldn't find anything.

69
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,900
When can I get the footage?

70
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,340
I can go home and grab it now.

71
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:27,930
Just give me the money.

72
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:28,810
One more thing.

73
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,540
You're sure Liu Shuhai

74
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,220
never mentioned the Xiaoshang River?

75
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:37,780
No, he didn't.

76
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:43,460
Just Luoma Lake

77
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,020
and Dalunte'er.

78
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,580
What's up with the Xiaoshang River?

79
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,700
So Wuxia

80
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,660
is real.

81
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,410
Luo Ren?

82
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,340
You've been hanging outside the window.

83
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,250
Must be exhausted.

84
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,610
There are freshly washed strawberries
on the table.

85
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,610
Have some to refresh yourself.

86
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:31,730
Don't thank me.

87
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:33,730

89
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:56,580
Mr. Li?

90
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:59,490
Where are you going?

91
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,290
Miss Mu Dai.

92
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,250
The matter is over.

93
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,730
Night flights are cheaper.

94
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,850
So I'm leaving.

95
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,100
Makes sense.

96
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,810
Madam Hong's been urging me to go back.

97
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,610
Thought I'd get some clues this time.

98
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:15,980
But it's another wasted trip.

99
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,410
For over 20 years,

100
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,780
I've been
going on these fruitless trips.

101
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,930
It's always the same.

102
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,700
But thank you anyway.

103
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,050
If it weren't for you,

104
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,700
I would have even lost that photo.

105
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:29,660
I'm off now.

106
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,700
Mr. Li,

107
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,220
what time is your flight?

108
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,810
Something wrong?

109
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,410
Let me buy you a drink.

110
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,780
Mr. Li,

111
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,370
can you tell me

112
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,220
about that case from two years ago?

113
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,850
It happened

114
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,250
at the Xiaoshang River.

115
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,820
But to understand it fully,

116
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,340
we have to go back to Luoma Lake.

117
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,180
Every year on the anniversary
of that incident,

118
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,860
I visit the scene.

119
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,300
I don't do anything special.

120
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,220
Just stroll around inside

121
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,660
and remind myself

122
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,300
not to give up.

123
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,260
For over 20 years now,

124
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,220
it's become a habit.

125
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,100
That day

126
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,660
marked exactly 20 years
since the Luoma Lake case.

127
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,100
It was also Yaqing's birthday.

128
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,340
I was smoking in the hallway...

129
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,700
when I saw a strange man

130
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,100
enter Yaqing's place.

131
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,500
What was he doing there?

132
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,100
I didn't dare get too close.

133
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,380
But through the crack of the door,
I could vaguely see him

134
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,380
running his hand

135
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,140
over the nail holes

136
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,380
on the wall.

137
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,260
It was like...

138
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,220
It was like he was reliving
old memories.

139
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,540
And he seemed to be enjoying it.

140
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,500
You know

141
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,700
how some psychopathic murderers

142
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,220
return to crime scenes on anniversaries

143
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,620
to savor the moment?

144
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:44,940
Anyway,

145
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,620
he just showed up like that

146
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,540
on that day.

147
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,820
No way he wasn't connected.

148
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,940
Then why didn't you arrest him?

149
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,100
I was not a cop anymore.

150
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:57,740
And

151
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,300
gut feelings aren't evidence.

152
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,020
I decided to keep an eye on him instead.

153
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,060
So I followed him cautiously all the way

154
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,740
to the Xiaoshang River.

155
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,980
The Xiaoshang River?

156
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,980
You're sure Liu Shuhai

157
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,660
never mentioned the Xiaoshang River?

158
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,460
No, he didn't.

159
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,540
I tracked him to the Xiaoshang River

160
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,340
and searched for days.

161
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,140
Finally, I spotted him in a shop.

162
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,700
When I went inside,

163
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,860
I found the whole family was dead.

164
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,540
The murderer was tying up the bodies
with fishing line.

165
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,100
All I could think of was

166
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,940
not letting him escape again.

167
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,500
At least, I had to knock him out.

168
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,700
I hit him hard in the head,

169
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,780
but he was unharmed.

170
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,940
His strength was unnatural.

171
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,340
He beat me half to death.

172
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:15,140
Then suddenly, a fire broke out.

173
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,620
It distracted him just long enough
for me to pin him down.

174
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,100
Unexpectedly,
someone attacked me from behind.

175
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,100
And the next thing I knew,

176
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,300
I woke up in a hospital bed.

177
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,300
Who took you there?

178
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,540
No idea.

179
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,540
Neither the doctors nor nurses

180
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,340
got a clear look.

181
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,620
After I was discharged,

182
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,340
I heard

183
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,260
the shop was a mutton shop.

184
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,780
Flames leaped out of the stove

185
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,300
when the late-night soup boiling
went wrong.

186
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,380
Half of the alley was burned down.

187
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,820
By the time the fire was put out,

188
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:02,860
almost nothing was left

189
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,980
of that family.

190
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,460
So did this matter
just end up unresolved?

191
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,780
Didn't you call the police?

192
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,980
My head injury

193
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,460
left my memories scrambled
for quite a while.

194
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,820
It took me nearly half a year

195
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:16,860
to piece together

196
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,300
that night.

197
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,020
I thought about reporting it.

198
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,820
But firstly,

199
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,820
the case had already been closed.

200
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,260
Secondly,

201
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,660
I had no solid evidence.

202
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,500
I couldn't even recall
what the murderer looked like.

203
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,980
If you'd been knocked out at the scene,

204
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,500
the police should have taken you away

205
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,740
for questioning.

206
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,740
But they didn't,

207
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,620
which suggests that you were already

208
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,980
removed from the scene

209
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,940
and might have been taken
to the hospital.

210
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,340
But he's a serial killer.

211
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,900
Why would he have let you off?

212
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,100
Exactly.

213
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,220
If he was the murderer,

214
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,500
I should've died in that fire.

215
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,020
Maybe that young man

216
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,260
wasn't in cahoots with the murderer?

217
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,740
Whether they were accomplices or not,

218
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,020
he's a key figure.

219
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,020
Mr. Li,

220
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,060
you saw his face

221
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,580
before you were knocked out.

222
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,700
Sketch it.

223
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,180
Even a rough likeness would help.

224
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,140
You think I haven't tried?

225
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,740
But I just can't recall that face.

226
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,620
Sometimes when I push too hard,

227
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,780
my head feels like it's splitting open.

228
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,300
Have you tried hypnosis?

229
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,820
How can we believe

230
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,940
in such unorthodox stuff?

231
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:29,820
Mr. Li,

232
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,420
hypnosis is legitimate science.

233
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,060
It can help bring your subconscious
back to the scene

234
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,740
and aid in scene reconstruction.

235
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,780
It's very useful.

236
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,820
I've had hypnotherapy before.

237
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,540
I even studied it out of interest.

238

Miss Mu Dai,

239
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,060
since you've learned about it,

240
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,500
maybe you could try it on me?

241
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,220
I trust you.

242

Did Professor Li only have one daughter?

250
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,020
Yaqing had a twin sister.

251
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,740
She was kidnapped at the age of two.

252
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,140

265
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,420
valuable information from Mr. Li.

Well,

267
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,380
Mr. Li said the murderer wasn't dead.

When he committed the crime
two years ago,

269
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,100
he even fought with Mr. Li.

270
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,620
Not dead?

271
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,780
Really?

272
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,580
Of course.

Is the upper bunk available?

571

I'll handle it, Madam.

572
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,780
This is Destiny Bar

573
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,260
where meetings are fated.

574
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:14,860
Well said.

575

Sorry, I didn't hear you clearly.

576
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,780
Your name is Cao...?

577
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,740
Cao Yanhua.

578
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,260
So, Cao here.

579
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,540
Sounds like swearing.

580
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,700
Well, hello, Thirteen.

581
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:25,900
Exactly.

582
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:30,580
Cao,

584
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,940
with gold at the entrance,

585
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,700
what would that signify?

586
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,580
What?

587
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,140
As in "earn a fortune daily."

588
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,580
An auspicious saying.

589
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,580
You two are really something.

590
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,540
Cao Yanhua, get back here.

591

Mr. Cao is our guest.

593

Mind your manners.

594

Look how fierce you're being.

Go take his order.

597

Show me the ropes.

598

I'll give it a try.

599

Hello, sir.

Any recommendations?

602
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,820
If you like cocktails,

603
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,740
the B-52 is quite good.

604
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,740
Manhattan is also nice.

605
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,820
The taste...

606
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,380
How would you describe the taste

607
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:27,860

Let's talk somewhere else.

609

Sorry,

610
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:33,940

not to chat with you.

612

Don't even think
about hurting Madam Hong.

613

You're Huo Zihong, right?

617

Remember me?

618
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,660
I'm Luo Ren.

619
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,540
We used to be neighbors.

620
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,060
Neighbors?

621
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,620
Forgotten already?

622
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,620
I lived at No. 11 Chenqian Alley,
Luoma Lake.

623
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,260
One year during heavy rains,

624
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,660
your roof leaked.

625
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:14,260
My dad even helped fix your awning.

626
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,580
Now I remember.

627
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,540
Look how you've grown.

628
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,940
I barely recognized you.

629
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,100
So, how is your father?

630
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,100
My father?

631
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,980
Yeah, your father.

632
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,180
He's doing well.

633
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,380
Good to know.

634
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,420
Let me treat you to a drink.

635
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:45,580
Thanks.

636
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,700
Madam Hong.

637
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,220
Relax.

638
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,220
It's fine.

639
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,420
We'll be just over there.

640
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:52,820
Let's go.

641
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,060
Were they really neighbors?

642
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,700
Why did you come alone?

643
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,180
Should I have come with a group?

644
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,460
What about your companion?

645
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:21,540
Companion?

646
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:32,340
The Xiaoshang River, midnight,
mutton soup.

647
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,540
You knocked out Li Tan

648
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,740
for your companion.

649
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,460
Don't you remember?

650
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,900
Why isn't he here?

651
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:54,620
You seem to be expecting to see him.

652
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,340
Isn't he dead yet?

653
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:02,980
Alive and kicking.

654
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,500
Tough guy, isn't he?

655
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,980
You know who the culprit is
in the Luoma Lake case,

656

don't you?

657
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,100
And you're not the real Huo Zihong.

658

Someone!

Someone help me!

She comes from a poor family.

693

Her parents were vegetable vendors,

694

How badly could she have hurt you?
