102
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,340
a few questions.

103
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,420
First,

104
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,020
in this day and age,

105
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,860
you have no money
and don't want to get exposed.

106
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:53,980
How far can you go?

107
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,340
You may hide now,

108
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,460
but can you hide forever?

109
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,300
Are you helping

110
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,380
or ruining yourself?

111
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,020
Second,

112
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,860
did you kill anyone?

113
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,700
I don't know.

114
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:05,900
I'm not sure.

115
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,540
I heard two witnesses
testify against me.

116
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,260
You want to run away
before knowing anything.

117
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,340
If you end up in another place

118
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,540
where you're also accused,

119
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,460
will you run away again?

120
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,300
Is this the way you solve a problem?

121
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:19,980
What's your point?

122
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,260
Mu Dai,

123
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,260
Dr. He said you were more rational

124
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,580
and powerful.

125
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,940
But I don't think so.

126
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,700
Pocketty is much braver than you.

127
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:35,780
What did you say?

128
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,820
Am I wrong?

129
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,220
When you were accused,

130
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,580
you ran away in the first place.

131
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,500
Did you really kill him?

132
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,980
What if you were framed?

133
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,100
I just think it's troublesome

134
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,260
to explain anything.

135
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,660
Running away causes more trouble.

136
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,260
I'm here to help you.

137
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,340
You must tell me

138
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,940
what happened that night.

139
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,580
I was in a bad mood.

140
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,740
Then, I took a walk around the bridge.

141
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,700
In my memory, I didn't kill anyone.

142
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,100
In your memory?

143
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,300
I didn't kill anyone.

144
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,300

145
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,340

146
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,020
She?

147
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,180

148
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,140

149
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,580

150
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,500
Of course.

151

154
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,860

155
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,540
Let's...

156
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,300
Play a game.

157
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,260
No preconceptions.

158
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,260
Don't suspect yourself.

159
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,940
Try your best to defend yourself.

160
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,420
This is a game of defense.

161
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,020
You're framed.

162
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,580
You must offer convincing reasons

163
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,860
to defend yourself.

164
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,500
Five seconds for one reason.

165
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,420
If you fail, you'll drink.

166
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,060
If you succeed, I'll drink.

167
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,420
You have five chances.

168
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,220
If you end up with no reason,

169
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,460
you'll be the murderer.

170
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:27,820
Do you dare?

171
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,460
Bring it on.

172
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,180
The first.

173

175
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,220
Again.

176
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,260
Time's up.

177
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,500
Go on.

178
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,380
Five.

179
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,540
Four.

180

Three.

Two.

182

184

whined in the court.

187

But a flogging would make them confess.

188

192

00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,620
Why would I kill him?

194
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,940
I have no motive.

195
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,820
Okay. It counts.

196
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,820
You have no motive.

197
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:32,980
Go on.

198
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,820
Even if we had a problem,

199
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,340
I just happened to meet him.

200
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,380
He's just an ordinary man.

201
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,380
I couldn't have easily knocked him down.

202
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,460
Why would I kill him?

203
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,700
Okay. It counts too.

204
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,660
And...

205
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,980
I knew everything I wanted to know

206
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,060
and planned to leave here.

207
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,820
Why would I go to that bridge?

208
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,260
I got to know

209
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,260
there were two witnesses.

210
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,660
One is Ma Chao

211
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,780
and the other is Song Tie.

212
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,100
They don't know each other.

213
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,700
But outsiders may not know

214
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,700
a secret relationship.

215
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,020
So, they could be colluding

216
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,620
or accusing you deliberately.

217
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,820
Why did they frame me?

218
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,380
Zhang Tong was murdered.

219
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,580
The murderer wants a scapegoat.

220
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,100
Indeed.

221
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,340
Something's fishy in this case.

222
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,700
Anyway, I'd like to see

223
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,060
who's trying to frame me.

224
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,140
Take a good rest tonight.

225
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,860
I'll get a room next door.

226
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,700
Tomorrow, we'll check out the clues.

227
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,540
Mu Dai.

228
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,060
Luo Ren.

229
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,740
Is Mu Dai all right?

230
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,100
Don't be so indirect.

231
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:28,780
Luo Ren,

232
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,380
does she have a split personality?

233
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,340
She's a bit different indeed.

234
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,620
You must get used to that.

235
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,340
If she sounds harsh,

236
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,620
please try

237
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,180
to bear with it.

238
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,380
What are they doing here?

239
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,180
They worry about you.

240
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,460
And...

241
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:16,940
Many hands make light work.

242
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,620
What can they do?

243
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,100
Hongsha has
some family-inherited skills.

244
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,260
The other two guys

245
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:24,900
are the fillers, huh?

246
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:36,740
Mu Dai,

247
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,060
you poor little thing.

248
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,140
Look at you.

249
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,940
You're skinny.

250
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,980
Don't worry. We'll handle this.

251
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:44,580
Right.

252
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,900
Master, don't worry.

253
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,580
Later, we'll go talk to Ma Chao

254
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,220
and the other man.

255
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,180
We'll take care of this for you.

256
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,380
You're untalented or qualified.

257
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,260
I wonder what's wrong with her.

258
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,900
She has a casual boyfriend

259
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,700
and a weak disciple.

260
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,180
Complain about Chubby.
Don't get me involved.

261
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,020
Well,

262
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,500
shall we go back and unpack our luggage?

263
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,620
We have a mission later.

264
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:14,620
Let's go, guys.

265
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,500
Womanizer.

266
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,340
Right.

267
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,220
Come on. Let's go.

268
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,180
You kept talking

269
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,740
about the split personality.

270
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,660
But when I saw her, I didn't think

271
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,860
she was different.

272
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,380
I even think

273
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,660
she's so cool.

274
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:37,780
Indeed.

275
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,300
She just sounds harsher.

276
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,980
She's just like before.

277
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,860
The same old temper.

278
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,460
Hey.

279
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,620
Am I the only one who thinks

280
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,820
she's like a different person?

281
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,300
She was really nice to me.

282
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,420
Whether she praises or punishes you,

283
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,540
she has been caring.

284
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,100
She used to be a loving mother.

285
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,740
Now, she's like a strict father.

286
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,220
But I can see.

287
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,180
She cares for you

288
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,740
as much as before.

289
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,380
You just bear with it.

290
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,020
We're reunited, anyway.

291
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,620
We'll be happy.

292
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,300
Everybody is here.

293
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:13,860
Let's have a discussion.

294
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,460
Two witnesses,

295
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,740
Ma Chao and Song Tie.

296
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:19,660
Thirteen-Thousand.

297
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:20,820
Chubby.

298
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,620
You'll talk to Ma Chao

299
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,100
and I'll talk to Song Tie.

300
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:25,980
Hongsha,

301
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,180
you take care of Mu Dai.

302
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,420
She's only nice to you now.

303
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:32,660
Of course.

304
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,940
You don't understand our friendship.

305
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,060
You guys just don't.

306
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,100
Mu Dai!

307
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,860
Are you boneless?

308
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,980
Don't lean on somebody.

309
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,500
You're not just "somebody".

310
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,060
You're my bestie.

311
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,540
What do you think?

312
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,060
Teamwork is cool, huh?

313
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,580
It's warm to have friends, isn't it?

314
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,180
I don't need friends.

315
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,660
Why hasn't Chubby come out yet?

316
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,300
What?

317
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:00,860
What's wrong?

318
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,020
It's my original look.

319
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:09,820
Does it scare you?

320
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,260
Oh, Cao.

321
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,580
I didn't know

322
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,140
you had tattoos.

323
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,220
I used to conceal them

324
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,620
in case you were scared.

325
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,700
But Cao,

326
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,500
we're just going to see Ma Chao.

327
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,020
Do you have to look so cool?

328
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:40,860
You have no idea.

329
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,260
To deal with a wicked guy,

330
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:46,620
we have to be more wicked.

331
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:47,980
We should be...

332
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,060
Ruthless.

333
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,620
Cool.

334
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,260
♪The sky splits the dawn's horizon♪

335
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,340

♪And I remain in darkness♪

342
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,300
How dare you come out here

343
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,540
without knowing the boss?

344
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,580
Why don't you tell me?

345
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:52,860
Who's the boss

346
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,820
in this region?

347
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,660
Sit down and eat.

348
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,940
Don't make trouble over a meal.

349
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,020
I...

350
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,140
Get lost.

351
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,500
Dude,

352
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,300
you're interesting.

353
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:11,980
Let's be friends.

354
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:24,820
Thirteen,

355
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,300
why is the bottle made of sugar?

356
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,100
I bought it in a magic shop next door.

357
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,180
It's fun.

358
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,900
That was really dangerous.

359
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,660
Why were there so many minions?

360
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,380
You're right.

361
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,540
Hey, Cao...

362
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,300
Still eating?

363
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,140
Look. Look at this.

364
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,140
What's this?

365
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,540
Were you really a great guy
in Qianjinbei?

366
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,500
A horse stumbles that has four legs.

367
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,780
Besides,

368
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,260
who would know that guy

369
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,620
had noodles with his minions?

370
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,060
And they ate separately.

371
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,340
Quite unexpected.

372
00:22:59,020 --> 00:22:59,900
Anyway,

373
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,020
how was your communication with him?

374
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,420
The communication

375
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,460
went rather smoothly.

376
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,340
But the result

377
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,060
was quite depressing.

378
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:14,980
Ma Chao said

379
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,220
they had a meal and drank that night.

380
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,500
On the bridge, Zhang Tong wanted to pee.

381
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,740
He then urged him
to climb over the railing and pee.

382
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,380
Chao,

383
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,340
this is way too high.

384
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,500
How about we leave?

385
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,420
The higher you stand,

386
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,900
the farther you'll pee.

387
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,380
Move.

388
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,660
He said he saw what happened.

389
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,780
His legs were so weak

390
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,580
that he ran away.

391
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,340
On his way,

392
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,940
he was nearly hit by an electric bike.

393
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,420
There's another witness
named Song Tie, huh?

394
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,660
Did he ride the bike?

395
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:03,700
No.

396
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,220
I talked to Song Tie.

397
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,340
Well,

398
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,380
I didn't really see too much.

399
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,260
That day, my friend invited me
to play mahjong.

400
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,780
On my way back home,
when I passed the east of the bridge,

401
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,540
I heard someone screaming.

402
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,100
Then, I heard a "thump".

403
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,620
So, you didn't see the crime scene.

404
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,460
No.

405
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,420
But I wanted to know what was happening.

406
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,060
Just then,

407
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,940
a man ran over from the bridge

408
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,820
as if he were crazy.

409
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,060
You know what?

410
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,460
He looked as if he were haunted.

411
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,540
Was someone else around?

412
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,500
Yes.

413
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,100
Just after the man ran away,

414
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,100
another guy appeared.

415
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,140
It was a girl.

416
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,980
A very pretty girl.

417
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,900
Later, the police asked me
to identify her.

418
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:42,860
It's her.

419
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,500
How can he be so sure

420
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,700
it's Mu Dai?

421
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,620
Song Tie said a pretty girl

422
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,740
appearing there at midnight

423
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,540
was conspicuous.

424
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,500
So,

425
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,580
he took a few more glances.

426
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,580
So, I really went to the bridge.

427
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,740
Let's not jump there yet.

428
00:24:58,980 --> 00:24:59,780
Don't forget.

429
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:00,980
There's a third witness.

430
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,580
The bike rider?

431
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,500
I guess

432
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,700
it's a woman who had a night shift.

433
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,060
After work,

434
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,780
she rode from east to west.

435
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,700
She had to pass the bridge.

436
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,900
Song Tie didn't see her

437
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,580
because this woman was in the middle

438
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,140
when he passed the east of the bridge.

439
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,860
When Ma Chao ran away,

440
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,540
he nearly bumped into her.

441
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:21,660
So,

442
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,780
she's the only one
who rode across the entire bridge

443
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,580
and may have approached the murderer.

444
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,140
Maybe the police have interrogated her.

445
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,900
Let's talk to her tomorrow.

446
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,580
You promised me a ride.

447
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,220
But you're watching the stars here.

448
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,780
Gas is costly, after all.

449
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:45,860
And...

450
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,580
It's a nice day today.

451
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,820
Sadly, the stars here

452
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,820
are worse than those in Xiaoshang River.

453
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,860
Are the stars worse,

454
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,380
or are you in a worse mood?

455
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,380
Last time, it was her
who watched the stars with you.

456
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,460
Mu Dai,

457
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:02,940
everyone has two sides.

458
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,620
Why do you keep saying

459
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,180
you're split?

460
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,180
I've been thinking

461
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,260
about what you said
in the psychological clinic.

462
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,020
I think you have a point.

463
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,460
A long time ago, I realized

464
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,420
you behaved weirdly.

465
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,180
But I didn't ask

466
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,660
or do anything.

467
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,420
When it came to it,

468
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,660
I began to care for you.

469
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,740
Ridiculous, indeed.

470
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,180
I'm thinking...

471
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,500
Pocketty

472
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,580
must also have wondered about it.

473
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,380
So?

474
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:48,540
So, I think

475
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,460
you differ in no essential respect.

476
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:56,740
And...

477
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,420
You said Mu Dai was so weak

478
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,660
that she lived a messy life.

479
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,500
I totally don't agree.

480
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,660
Why?

481
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,660
Mu Dai has families,

482
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:06,740
friends,

483
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:07,860
and love.

484
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,780
She's brave and authentic.

485
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,220
I think

486
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,060
you should set aside your prejudice

487
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,260
and try melting into her.

488
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,660
Then, you'll know

489
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,060
she's beyond your imagination.

490
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,420
She's more stupid
than I imagined, indeed.

491
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,500
She tried really hard to overrule me.

492
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,180
She wouldn't do that.

493
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,140
Why?

494
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,460
Every reason you used to defend yourself

495
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,340
also works for her.

496
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,020
Because you're the same person.

497
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,300
She thinks about you and protects you.

498
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,260
So do you, right?

499
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,860
You won't appear
unless she's in the greatest danger

500
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,500
or she's being her weakest.

501
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,100
Right?

502
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,860
How much do you know about my past?

503
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,500
Don't talk as if you know me well.

504
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,980
I don't know too much.

505
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,940
But what you've done tells me something.

506
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:02,780
All these years,

507
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,100
you've protected her
from many terrible things.

508
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,740
Because you think

509
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,140
you're more experienced

510
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,860
in handling

511
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:14,860
such things.

512
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,860
People change
under different circumstances.

513
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,980
Mu Dai met Huo Zihong.

514
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,740
She met your master too.

515
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,100
And she has many friends.

516
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,340
So,

517
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,820
she softened

518
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,140
and smiled a lot.

519
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,300
Don't be so harsh to yourself.

520
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,380
It's unfair to you.

521
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,380
It's unfair to her, either.

522
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:41,940
People grow up.

523
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,660
They need tough experiences

524
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,420
as well as sweet ones.

525
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:48,940
They need everything.

526
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,500
Walking with one leg

527
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,020
will exhaust you.

528
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,900
Stop nagging.

529
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,380
Are you sure you'll see Wu Yuping?

530
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,740
I'm wearing a cap and a mask.

531
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,820
She won't recognize me, huh?

532
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,580
Hello. I'm Luo Ren.

533
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:24,900
Hi.

534
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,020
We're Zhang Tong's friends.

535
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,380
We really care about this case.

536
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,700
Please tell us

537
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,380
what happened that night.

538
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,860
That night, I was passing the bridge

539
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:33,820
on my way back home.

540
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,380
From afar, I saw two men standing there.

541
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,620
They seemed to be peeing.

542
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,260
The farther you'll pee.

543
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,220
How uncouth.

544
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,340
I'm really scared.

545
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,780
I heard you fell after that.

546
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,260
Because I was scared.

547
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,180
I suddenly heard a scream.

548
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,660
Then, I looked back.

549
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,660
But as I turned around,

550
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,620
I fell by accident.

551
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,980
Then did you see a girl?

552
00:29:59,060 --> 00:29:59,860
Yes.

553
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:02,660
When I rose to pick up my bike,

554
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,620
I saw a girl standing in the distance

555
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,380
and staring at me.

556
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,140
Well, she was weird.

557
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,420
I fell so badly,

558
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,220
but she didn't come to help me.

559
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,740
She didn't sympathize at all.

560
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,500
Could you take a look

561
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,420
and pick out the girl?

562
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:22,740
It's her.

563
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,540
Are you sure?

564
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,500
Yes. It's her.

565
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,460
Okay. Thanks.

566
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:50,500
I still think something's pretty weird.

567
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,580
Mu Dai has a split personality.

568
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,020
But since she was born,

569
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,220
she's never done anything evil

570
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,260
or hurt anyone.

571
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,260
Why did she become a murderer

572
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,860
in this place?

573
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,700
Don't you find it fishy?

574
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:04,700
And three guys testified against her.

575
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,780
It was so dark that night.

576
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,500
Did they really see clearly?

577
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,100
How can they be so sure

578
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,100
that they saw Mu Dai?

579
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,300
Hongsha, what did you say?

580
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,500
It was so dark.

581
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,060
That's right.

582
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,540
There are no street lamps there.

583
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,340
Hey, Luo Ren. Where are we going?

584
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,020
To the bridge.

585
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,380
I went there.

586
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,940
No street lamps on or around it.

587
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,220
Zhang Tong fell off
the middle of the bridge.

588
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,820
Only Ma Chao met Mu Dai before.

589
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:39,940
Song Tie and Wu Yuping

590
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,340
saw Mu Dai for the first time.

591
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:42,940
From a distance, actually.

592
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,300
It was a night

593
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:45,700
with no light.

594
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:47,940
It must have been really dark.

595
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,340
Right.

596
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,740
With a mere glimpse,

597
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:51,860
when they testified,

598
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,740
they should have been
unsure or hesitant.

599
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,220
But they identified Mu Dai straightaway.

600
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,260
Isn't it weird?

601
00:31:59,260 --> 00:31:59,980
You're right.

602
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,580
There's always a reason.

603
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,740
Something must be wrong.

604
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,700
The three guys spoke as one on this.

605
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,100
It really scared us.

606
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,820
No wonder people say

607
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,460
"Three men make a rumor."

608
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,540
Who? Who makes a rumor?

609
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,380
Three men make a rumor.

610
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,420
It means

611
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,460
three men will make people believe.

612
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,940
Why don't we assume this?

613
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,500
What if the three of them

614
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,900
are lying?

615
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,540
You mean...

616
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,380
They don't know each other.

617
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,900
How could they collude?

618
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,940
And think of Wu Yuping.

619
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,700
She looks rather honest.

620
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:42,700
Are they mentally controlled?

621
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,020
The relic of ill omen.

622
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,420
Is it behind all this?

623
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:52,060
How come we forgot that?

624
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:52,980
And the vision.

625
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,420
Cao and I saw the vision

626
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,020
on the relic of ill omen.

627
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,660
The wind out of nowhere.

628
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,180
Wind out of nowhere?

629
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:02,980
Have you heard

630
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,980
of an urban legend in Nantian?

631
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:28,860
What's wrong?

632
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:32,140
Didn't you feel some eerie wind?

633
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,260
Eerie wind?

634
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,500
I feel something's blowing into me.

635
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:36,980
Chubby,

636
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,380
it's a windy night.

637
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,260
But you're wrapped up tightly.

638
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,700
What can actually blow into you?

639
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,420
Here we are. This is it.

640
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,380
These guys had too much free time.

641
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,660
They came for more courage.

642
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,060
What's the point of that?

643
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,300
A lot of guys came.

644
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,460
What kind of guy, actually?

645
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,380
Totally useless.

646
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:59,660
What is that?

647
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:03,780
What's this?

648
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:06,540
Joss paper?

649
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,820
Zhang Tong's name is on it.

650
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,620
Someone burned it here.

651
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,060
Ma Chao.

652
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,380
Ma Chao.

653
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,060
What's wrong, Chao?

654
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,340
What's troubling you?

655
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:40,500
Don't mention it.

656
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:41,980
It's Zhang Tong's fault.

657
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,660
It's okay he died.

658
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,420
But he caused me trouble.

659
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,300
I kept dreaming about him.

660
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:48,460
He said,

661
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:49,540
"Chao,

662
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,020
I really left my name there.

663
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,140
Check it if you don't believe me."

664
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:53,860
I was so scared.

665
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:56,260
Come on.

666
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,740
Some advice for you.

667
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,380
Don't go out in the next few days.

668
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,100
Why?

669
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,380
Don't you know?

670
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,700
The woman you testified against...

671
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,380
She ran away.

672
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:06,900
I know.

673
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,700
I heard she could scale the walls.

674
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,060
Very swiftly,

675
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,420
she escaped.

676
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:13,780
I also heard

677
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,260
she had great martial arts skills.

678
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,140
Then how dare you come out here?

679
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,300
You accused her of killing.

680
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,860
She has martial arts skills
and she's on the run.

681
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,700
It's so easy for her

682
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,820
to kill you.

683
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:26,940
She won't.

684
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,220
I also heard through the grapevine

685
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:31,940
that she claimed

686
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,860
she didn't kill Zhang Tong,

687
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,060
but you did.

688
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,660
That's impossible.

689
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,100
I saw it with my eyes.

690
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,620
Calm down, Chao.

691
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:48,300
Come on.

692
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,140
You were really drunk that night.

693
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,860
Are you sure about that?

694
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,700
I also heard

695
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,940
when the man died,

696
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,220
you ran away.

697
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,300
The police came to you the next day.

698
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,060
Why didn't you call the police then?

699
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:13,860
Nobody move!

700
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:14,780
We're the police.

701
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:16,900
Who's Ma Chao?

702
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,020
Who is Ma Chao?

703
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,260
Ma Chao, tell me.

704
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,900
Where were you last night?

705
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,060
Last night?

706
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,820
I was drinking with my friend.

707
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,220
Do you know your friend died?

708
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:29,900
Something happened.

709
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,100
Someone killed my friend.

710
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:33,260
Why didn't you
call the police last night?

711
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,060
I was drunk.

712
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:39,940
I was frozen with fear too.

713
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,740
Frozen with fear?

714
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,980
Come on, Chao.

715
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,460
You have a lot of minions.

716
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,940
When one of them was pushed
off the bridge and killed,

717
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,900
how could you forget to call the police?

718
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:53,740
Chao,

719
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,460
I don't want to pee now.

720
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:56,620
Just do it.

721
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:57,940
I don't dare.

722
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,460
But you said you wanted to pee.

723
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:00,900
Chao.

724
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:01,860
Why do you stop now?

725
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,660
Chao, I'm begging you. Stop it.

726
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:04,260
Down you go!

727
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:04,900
Chao.

728
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,180
Will I throw you down?

729
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,820
Will I really do that?

730
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:10,420
Ma Chao,

731
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,820
how was your neck injured?

732
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:13,740
I don't dare.

733
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,340
Pee. Down you go!

734
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:16,460
Chao!

735
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:48,900
Who's that?

736
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,660
Sorry.

737
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,500
I...

738
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,340
I can't remember.

739
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:07,940
Chao,

740
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:09,980
how did I die?

741
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,060
I died a miserable death.

742
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:13,940
Why?

743
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,260
I really left my name there.

744
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,180
Ma Chao!

745
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,740
It's you who killed him

746
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,380
on the bridge, right?

747
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,420
It's not me!

748
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,580
She killed him!

749
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,460
Oh...

750
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,060
What's going on?

751
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:30,940
Why are they fighting?

752
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:34,980
He...

753
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:37,700
Get out of my way!

754
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:38,620
Don't you see?

755
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:46,900
Is it the thief thing?

756
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,620
What's going on here?

757
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,180
Let's call the police.

758
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:06,740
Ma Chao, watch out!

759
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,340
A car accident.

760
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:13,740
He was hit so hard.

761
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,260
- Call the ambulance.
- Hurry.

762
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:15,860
Okay. Come on.

763
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:16,260
What happened?

764
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,260
Did you film it?

765
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,340
No.

766
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,380
Let's call the ambulance.

767
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,460
Call the ambulance.

768
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,100
I'm calling it.

769
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,500
It freaked me out.

770
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:27,700
I called the police.

771
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,300
Did anyone call the police?

772
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,260
Hope he won't die.

773
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,300
The car overturned. See?

774
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,060
He can't leave.

775
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:32,940
That's right.

776
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:34,460
This guy may die.

777
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,220
Ma Chao.

778
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:35,900
What do we do?

779
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:36,940
Ma...

780
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,180
This man may die.

781
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,180
It's a fight, huh?

782
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:39,980
Is it him?

783
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,380
He hit this guy.

784
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,260
Don't let him get away.

785
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,940
He pushed this guy.

786
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:44,780
I didn't.

787
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:45,740
He did push this guy.

788
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,540
I said, it's not me.

789
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:49,540
It's him.

790
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:50,900
Don't let him get away.

791
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,060
He killed a man.

792
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,100
- It's him.
- It's him.

793
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,300
- It's him.
- It's him.

794
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:56,740
It's not me. No.

795
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:57,980
He hit that guy.

796
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:00,860
I said, it's not me.

797
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:01,780
- It's him.
- It's him.

798
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,180
He did that.

799
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:04,860
- Don't let him get away.
- Don't let him get away.

800
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,540
- It's all your fault.
- It's all your fault.

801
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,420
- He killed him.
- He killed him.

802
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,300
- It's you. You can't get away.
- It's you. You can't get away.

803
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:09,940
It's not me!

804
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:10,980
- You are
- You are

805
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:11,580
- the murderer.
- the murderer.

806
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,020
I'm not!
