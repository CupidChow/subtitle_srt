70
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,810

he suddenly disappeared.

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,540
Pingting filed a report.

74
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,660
And I came back to help look for him.

75
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,410
But not long after,

76
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,410
he just came back on his own.

77
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,540
Uncle.

78
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,170

00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,540
I'm fine.

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,810
He told us he had been

82
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,850
to Luoma Lake.

83
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,290
He often traveled for academic visits,

84
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,370
so I didn't think much of it.

85
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,410
But that night,

86
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,050
something strange happened.

87
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,100
Uncle,

88
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,540
why are you still up?

89
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,370
It's late.

90
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:44,780
Uncle?

91
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:48,930
Luo Ren,

92
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,290
you have to stop me from killing.

93
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,020
Lock me up.

94
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,290
What did he mean?

95
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,100
No idea.

96
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,220
I pressed him,

97
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,780
but he acted

98
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,540
like he had never said it.

99
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:12,980
Like it was

100
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,100
some sick joke.

101
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,980
Guess that moment stuck with me.

102
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,980
I stayed on guard after that.

103
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,930
I started locking the gate at night.

104
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:25,850
Uncle, I'm coming in.

105
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,250
During the day when he went out,

106
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,220
I tried to follow him.

107
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,490
Uncle.

108
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,100
What are you doing?

109
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,730
He seemed calm

110
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,220
over the next few days,

111
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,930
so I let my guard down.

112
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,170
But then...

113
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,170
Ren, wake up!

114
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:37,850
My dad...

115
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,980
He's gone.

116
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,220
You locked the gate, didn't you?

117
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:47,850
He climbed over the wall.

118
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,250
Can you believe it?

119
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,780
My uncle was in his fifties,

120
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,810
not physically strong,

121
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,660
and couldn't even ride a bike.

122
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,730
Yet he climbed over a four-meter wall.

123
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,810
I thought that gray-haired man

124
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,050
would be easy to handle.

125
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,580
But I didn't expect him

126
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,020
to be

127
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,020
incredibly strong.

128
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,780
I chased him right away

129
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,250
and passed through an alley.

130
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,250
And there was a house on fire.

131
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,410
People were fighting inside.

132
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,220
You went in?

133
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,250
The scene inside was horrible.

134
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,220
Was Li Tan there too?

135
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,610
At first, I thought Li Tan
was the murderer.

136
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,370
Because when I entered,

137
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,650
I saw him choking my uncle.

138
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:38,940
You know how it is.

139
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,340
One snapshot,

140
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,220
and you jump to conclusions

141
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,700
even though it's not the truth.

142
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,530
I get it.

143
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,180
So

144
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,770
I knocked Li Tan out.

145
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,300
That's when my uncle ran.

146
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,980
I saw his eyes.

147
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:56,940
That

148
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,530
bloodlust.

149
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,130
I instantly realized I was wrong.

150
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,340
Turned out my uncle was the murderer.

151
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,530
When I chased him,

152
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,850
I saw his speed and strength.

153
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,700
That couldn't be my uncle.

154
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,250
But

155
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:15,980
it was indeed him.

156
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,850
What happened next?

157
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,530
Ren,

158
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,420
what's wrong with my dad?

159
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,180
Uncle.

160
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,700
Did you kill someone?

161
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,820
I told you

162
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,060
not to

163
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,010
let me out.

164
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,220
Pingting,

165
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,420
get the rope.

166
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:14,890
Now!

167
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,130
I tied up my uncle.

168
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,100
Then I went to find Li Tan.

169
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,980
He was the only witness.

170
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:26,730
I had to find out what happened.

171
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,770
What just happened?

172
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,460
Who's the murderer?

173
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,420
Got him.

174
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,220
Finally got him.

175
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:38,980
Finally.

176
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,700
What did you say?

177
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,460
Yaqing,

178
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:44,980
I finally got him.

179
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,940
Speak clearly!

180
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,730
The birthday present I gave you.

181
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,890
I needed to rush Li Tan to the hospital,

182
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,770
so I locked my uncle in the study,

183
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,610
and told Pingting

184
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,820
to wait for me.

185
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,370
Li Tan has seriously misunderstood.

186
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,220
I'll explain it to him when I get back.

187
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,420
I thought the rope

188
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,940
and the lock

189
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:19,850
were enough,

190
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,700
and nothing would go wrong
in the short term.

191
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,100
I rushed back as fast as I could.

192
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:29,820
But...

193
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,370
My uncle was dead.

194
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:40,650
Pingting!

195
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,010
And Pingting lost her mind.

196
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,370
I had no idea what happened.

197
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:46,460
Maybe

198
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,490
she heard that I was going
to call the police,

199
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,180
so she let my uncle out.

200
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:51,850
But the coroner

201
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,730
ruled it suicide.

202
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,300
Then why did Pingting go mad?

203
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,700
Even if she witnessed
her father's suicide,

204
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,850
would that drive her insane?

205
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,100
It wasn't until I met Cen Chunjiao

206
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,370
and learned about what happened
to Liu Shuhai

207
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,060
that I realized

208
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,820
Pingting might've faced the same horror.

209
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,580
This is just eerie.

210
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,250
I began tracing back from this case,

211
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,940
starting with Li Tan,

212
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,980
and learned about the Luoma Lake case.

213
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,220
But the culprit behind it

214
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,420
wasn't my uncle.

215
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,700
He was studying abroad back then.

216
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:31,010
Later, I found out about Huo Zihong.

217
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,340
Then I pieced together

218
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,130
all the clues I could find.

219
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,730
If this is some grand play,

220
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,770
Huo Zihong is now

221
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,220
its central figure.

222
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:46,490
Mu Dai.

223
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,420
I need your help.

224
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,250
Well...

225
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:53,700
Madam Hong...

226
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,820
Madam Hong can't be the murderer.

227
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,130
Maybe not.

228
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,530
But she knows who the murderer is.

229
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,730
What evidence do you have?

230
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,130
Remember she and I

231
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,890
had a chat last night?

232
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,300
The first thing she asked was,

233
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,700
"Didn't he come with you?"

234
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,220
She meant my uncle.

235
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,300
But he was already dead.

236
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,420
How could a dead man

237
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,250
come with me?

238
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,980
Isn't he dead yet?

239
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:23,730
Alive and kicking.

240
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,490
Tough guy, isn't he?

241
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,010
Then I realized

242
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,250
we were talking at cross purposes.

243
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,730
We were talking about the same case,

244
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,370
but not the same person.

245
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,530
She wasn't talking about my uncle,

246
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,890
but the real murderer.

247
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,650
Her tone made me think

248
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,700
she had dealt with the murderer.

249
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,850
So I tested her.

250
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,770
You know who the culprit is
in the Luoma Lake case.

251
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,180
And you're not the real Huo Zihong.

252
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,180
And you saw

253
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,820
how she reacted.

254
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,300
Remember something?

255
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:23,820
Zhang...

256
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,100
Zhang Guanghua.

257
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,420
Who's that?

258
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,730
He's the second case Madam Hong

259
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,820
reported to Wan Fenghuo.

260
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,220
He's also from Luoma Lake.

261
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,100
And

262
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,530
he used to live in the same building
as Li Yaqing.

263
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:49,700
Not long after the Luoma Lake case,

264
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,370
he disappeared.

265
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,180
Later, his personal belongings

266
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:57,250
were found on a riverbank in Datong.

267
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,300
Presumed dead.

268
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,370
Datong.

269
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,300
Datong?

270
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,650
This name sounds so familiar.

271
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,820
I think I've seen it somewhere before.

272
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,420
Liu ShuHai's car went
into the water there.

273
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,300
Yes.

274
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,180
It was in Datong.

275
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,130
Right.

276
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,980
Where did Madam Hong
put Zhang Guanghua's file?

277
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,010
I don't know.

278
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,730
I haven't seen Mu Dai all afternoon.

279
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,250
Alright, keep looking.

280
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,770
Well, what are you up to now?

281
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,180
Madam Hong,

282
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,340
you're here.

283
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,100
I...

284
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,250
So much has happened recently.

285
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,730
Just praying

286
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,130
for the bar's safety.

287
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:28,770
Madam Hong,

288
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,820
since you're here, you do it.

289
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:41,300
Done.

290
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,810
Any luck?

291
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:07,420
Couldn't find it.

292
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,050
No idea where she

293
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,050
stashed Zhang Guanghua's file.

294
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,570
Doesn't matter.

295
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,250
Wan Fenghuo should have a copy.

296
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,660
So what's next?

297
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,290
I've grasped the basics

298
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,730
of the three cases.

299
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,770
I need to find out
the connections between them.

300
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,250
I can feel

301
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,980
there's a hidden thread.

302
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,980
Wait...

303
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:31,380
Three cases? Not two?

304
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,250
Right.

305
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,490
You don't know
about the Dalunte'er incident yet.

306
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:36,810
How about we go to my place,

307
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:37,700
you help me sort things out,

308
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,050
and I'll fill you in on more details?

309
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,460
To your place?

310
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,570
No, it's too late.

311
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:47,490
Fine.

312
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,220
See yourself out.

313
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,380
We'll talk later.

314
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:50,940
Sure.

315
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,050
Wait.

316
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,290
You live here?

317
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:00,980
Then I...

318
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,010
Come in.

319
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,530
This is your home?

320
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,460
It's a ready-to-move-in rental.

321
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:28,700
Come on.

322
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,180
Where to?

323
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,290
My room.

324
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,490
The files are in there.

325
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,420
Where are the files?

326
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,980
You can see the bar from here.

327
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,730
And my room.

328
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,460
No wonder I've been feeling

329
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,770
that I'm being watched.

330
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,490
Watching implies ill intent.

331
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,250
What I'm doing

332
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,770
is reconnaissance or observation.

333
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,530
Let's get to the files.

334
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,730
Liu Shuhai mentioned two cases
before he died.

335
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,980
One was the Luoma Lake case

336
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,420
and for the other one,

337
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,330
Cen Chunjiao didn't disclose it.

338
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,220
So you bribed her for the information?

339
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,690
This one happened five years ago

340
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,360
in Dalunte'er,

341
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,010
in a pastoral area, during winter.

342
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,410
Same method: kill first,

343
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:59,600
then use fishing line.

344
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,450
But no one knows about this case.

345
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:03,930
No one knows?

346
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,250
The victim was snowed in,

347
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,450
and there were wolves around.

348
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,410
So this incident

349
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,010
was attributed to the natural disaster.

350
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,040
[Dalunte'er]
By the way,

351
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,170
[Jiquan]
is there any pattern

352
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,650
to these cases

353
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,410
[Liu Shuhai, 22 years ago, Luoma Lake]
geographically?

354
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,360
They are all far from each other.

355
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,210
No obvious connections.

356
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:26,520
What about the timeline?

357
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,800
[Dalunte'er, Xiaoshang River]
Three years between the second

358
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,730
and the third cases.

359
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,600
[Luoma Lake, Datong]
But 17 years

360
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,120
between the first and the second cases.

361
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:38,890
Then

362
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,210
the murderer in each case.

363
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,450
I still don't believe

364
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:45,040
[Liu Shuhai]
Liu Shuhai committed the first case.

365
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:46,280
First,

366
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:49,170
the two cases are too far apart in time.

367
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:50,250
Second,

368
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,040
when the case happened,

369
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,800
Liu Shuhai had just come of age.

370
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,930
How could he suddenly go to Luoma Lake

371
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,800
and kill Li Yaqing and her family,

372
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,040
who were complete strangers to him?

373
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:03,840
Right.

374
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:07,970
I was stuck

375
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:12,280
until you mentioned Zhang Guanghua.

376
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:14,800
Funny, isn't it?

377
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:17,930
[Zhang Guanghua]
He's from Luoma Lake too.

378
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,360
And even funnier,

379
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:23,690
his belongings were found in Datong.

380
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,250
Where Liu Shuhai's car
went into the water.

381
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:32,730
Their paths crossed there.

382
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,820
[Datong]

383
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,490
Datong.

384
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,120
Liu Shuhai and my uncle
crossed paths too.

385
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,730
Liu Shuhai died in Jiquan.

386
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,250
Remember when I said

387
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:47,970
I came back to search

388
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,120
for my uncle?

389
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,250
I asked Pingting

390
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,730
if he had acted strangely

391
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,010
before he left home.

392
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,690
She told me

393
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,840
he had gone to Jiquan
on a business trip

394
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,280
and came back very ill.

395
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,970
He hadn't been the same since.

396
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,410
Five years ago...

397
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,600
I'm really sorry.

398
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,520
my uncle bought the wrong ticket...

399
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,520
I've got the wrong place.

400
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,560
and ended up...

401
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,170
Alright.

402
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,080
at Cen Chunjiao's inn.

403
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:13,760
Alright.

404
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,040
Okay, that's it.

405
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,010
Go upstairs, turn right,
and keep walking straight.

406
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:19,840
Room 202.

407
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,080
Cen Chunjiao said Liu Shuhai
stayed in Room 203.

408
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,690
What a coincidence.

409
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:25,800
Tell me about it.

410
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:26,760
Odd and even room numbers.

411
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,760
Is... Is he dead?

412
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,970
My uncle was also there

413
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,080
when Liu Shuhai died.

414
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,170
The manager has called the police.

415
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:32,800
He called the police.

416
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,760
Do you remember

417
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,930
that when Liu Shuhai died,

418
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,320
a piece of skin
was missing from his back?

419
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,250
Cen Chunjiao said

420
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,760
the piece of skin was peculiarly neat.

421
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,490
The same went for my uncle.

422
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:53,040
Liu Shuhai started acting strangely

423
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:53,890
after he fell into the water in Datong.

424
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:56,730
And your uncle began to behave oddly
after returning from Jiquan.

425
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:57,970
I think something's wrong.

426
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,450
It's like a killing relay.

427
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:04,010
One dies,

428
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,690
the next takes the baton

429
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:06,890
and commits another crime.

430
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,490
Then the next one,

431
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:09,760
and the next.

432
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,210
Maybe someone is behind all of this,

433
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,250
controlling everything

434
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,600
and taking the skin of the participants

435
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,560
as a trophy.

436
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,650
Have you thought of anything?

437
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,320
Thought of what?

438
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,930
Is the relay race over?

439
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:26,360
What do you mean?

440
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,840
Liu Shuhai died

441
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,080
with my uncle nearby.

442
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,690
And he took the baton.

443
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,760
And when my uncle died,

444
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,930
someone else was there.

445
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,560
Pingting?

446
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:07,840
Excuse me.

447
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:10,840
Enjoy.

448
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,730
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

449
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,320
Dai, you're back.

450
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,450
Where did you go?

451
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:25,760
Got something done.

452
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:29,280
A big shot like you
handles things yourself?

453
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:30,360
Wait.

454
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,410
Think about Tang Monk.

455
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:32,930
He doesn't have to fight demons,

456
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:34,080
beg for alms,

457
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,490
or even carry luggage.

458
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,210
Because he has three loyal disciples.

459
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,320
You don't need three.

460
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,360
Having just one

461
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,360
devoted disciple

462
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,320
would save you a lot of trouble.

463
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,800
So, you want to be my disciple, huh?

464
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:45,760
Could I?

465
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:48,320
No way.

466
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,170
I have my master.

467
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,490
You need her approval
to become my disciple.

468
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,210
Well,

469
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,360
Dai,

470
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,170
just introduce her to me,

471
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:01,800
right?

472
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,210
I'll bring some pastries.

473
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:05,760
That would count as my sincerity.

474
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,520
Fair point.

475
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,520
But my master

476
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,690
despises thieves.

477
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,890
You know about my senior?

478
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:14,690
Senior?

479
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:17,280
He made a mistake once.

480
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,490
He stole something, I guess.

481
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,730
My master punished him

482
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:23,410
severely for that.

483
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:24,360
He's still recovering.

484
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,210
His arms and legs are broken.

485
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,210
With your record?

486
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:30,450
Forget it.

487
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:31,970
Just do your job well.

488
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,560
That's hot-headed.

489
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,120
Cao,

490
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:58,250
smart men read the situation.

491
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:02,170
Martial arts are dying.

492
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:03,890
Even if you become an unrivaled master,

493
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:05,650
one bullet from me, and you're dead.

494
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:08,120
Who trains just to fight?

495
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,250
Look at that piece of paper on the bed.

496
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:11,520
Can you read?

497
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,480
Step Four...

498
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,400
[Dream Plan: 1. Find a master 2. Train
3. Enter showbiz 4. Become a superstar]

499
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,440
I will become a superstar!

500
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,690
Superstar?

501
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,450
You tripped at step one.

502
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:19,760
With your record?

503
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,280
Even if you make it,
you'll just be a disgraced celebrity.

504
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:21,800
You...

505
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,280
Help me up.

506
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:23,930
Help me up.

507
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,930
What is this training?

508
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:37,410
Don't judge a man's dream.

509
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,730
Oh, you've got a dream?

510
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:41,280
Fine.

511
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:43,010
I've got one too.

512
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,360
Ask me what it is.

513
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,730
My dream

514
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:58,170
is for a gorgeous,

515
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:00,040
kind, and wealthy woman

516
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:02,560
to come to me.

517
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,600
How's that saying go?

518
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:08,490
"Grant me a lifetime of comfort,

519
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,650
and spare me wandering."

520
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:12,840
So, living off women.

521
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:14,520
Hey, Cao.

522
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,080
Why does it sound so cheesy

523
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,690
coming from you?

524
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,800
It's just a little bit about money.

525
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,520
That's why it's a dream.

526
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:26,890
Just dreaming and imagining.

527
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:28,250
Anyway, Cao,

528
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:31,250
you've got a roof, and meals.

529
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,840
So just make do.

530
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,040
Come on, Thirteen,

531
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,450
why are you so bleak?

532
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:38,600
You're so young,

533
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,080
but your spirit is already dead.

534
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,600
I can't be like you.

535
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,490
The bar is pretty quiet during the day.

536
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:44,650
I'll

537
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,490
get a second job tomorrow.

538
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,360
Even if it's doing manual labor.

539
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:50,450
There's no shame
in earning my own keep.

540
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,760
I want Mu Dai to see me in a new light.

541
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,250
By the way, buddy,

542
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,650
if one day

543
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,490
step four ever comes true,

544
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,600
don't rat me out, okay?

545
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:45,650
Well,

546
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:47,490
to find out the truth,

547
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,450
I still have to start with Madam Hong.

548
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,490
He's still awake.

549
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:28,690
Maybe someone is behind all of this,

550
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,690
controlling everything

551
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,010
and taking the skin of the participants

552
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,890
as a trophy.

553
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:37,840
The skin collector

554
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,690
must be the mastermind.

555
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,560
Could it be

556
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,120
Zhang Guanghua?

557
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:46,120
Putting Luo Wenmiao's incident aside,

558
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,490
when Liu Shuhai died,

559
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:49,080
Cen Chunjiao was in the hallway.

560
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:50,760
In such a short time,

561
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,560
he managed to slip in,

562
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,210
cut the skin, and vanish

563
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,560
without a trace.

564
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:57,360
So terrifying.

565
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:59,800
That's not human.

566
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,120
What's wrong now?

567
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,970
Ugh, that Li Tan guy.

568
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,410
Infuriating.

569
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:23,360
Him?

570
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:24,930
What did he do?

571
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,800
Well, Li Yaqing

572
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,560
was just his girlfriend.

573
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,890
He's wasted half of his life on her.

574
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:34,280
He lost his job

575
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,520
and is running a grocery store.

576
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:37,890
Now he tells me

577
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:39,560
he wants to sell the store

578
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,080
to raise money and keep looking
for the murderer.

579
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,970
Isn't that insane?

580
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,450
He even swore

581
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:50,800
at her grave

582
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:52,890
he'd find out the truth.

583
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,800
Isn't that pathetic?

584
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,800
He is now the laughing stock.

585
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,040
- Everyone laughs at him.
- Mu Dai!

586
00:30:58,470 --> 00:30:59,450
You're going too far.

587
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:02,930
What did I teach you?

588
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,040
Empathy.

589
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,080
That is someone else's misfortune.

590
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,040
How can you talk about him like that
behind his back?

591
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,010
Sorry, Madam Hong.

592
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,250
I shouldn't have said that.

593
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,210
But I've got a question.

594
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:16,320
Madam Hong,

595
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,010
do you remember Luo Ren?

596
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,080
His uncle died,

597
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:21,410
and his cousin went mad.

598
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,170
He's a victim too.

599
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,410
You're saying

600
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,800
Luo Ren is also a victim?

601
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,080
And that his uncle's killer

602
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,170
is connected to the murderer
from 20 years ago?

603
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,890
So, finding the murderer
in the Luoma Lake case

604
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:36,210
is extremely important.

605
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,280
Madam Hong,

606
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,690
I can tell you know something.

607
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:41,930
Can you please share whatever you can

608
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:43,280
if it won't harm you?

609
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:43,970
Mu Dai!

610
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,170
You're imagining things!

611
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,650
I really don't know anything.

612
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:47,690
If I did,

613
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:48,320
why would I

614
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,210
have sent Wan Fenghuo to investigate?

615
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,690
Drop it.

616
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,040
Pingting's condition has worsened.

617
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:22,730
I can't wait any longer.

618
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,170
Mu Dai,

619
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,280
can you give me Li Tan's number?

620
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,360
[Luo Ren: Exit right, parking lot,
black SUV, license plate SH-98326]

621
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:14,760
Hello?

622
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:16,690
Heard Li Tan's in Lixi?

623
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,600
I'm going to see him now.

624
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:22,170
Why didn't you explain everything to him
over the phone?

625
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,170
Li Tan's impulsive.

626
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:25,410
It's better to discuss

627
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,840
something this complex in person.

628
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,840
So you know he's impulsive.

629
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:31,800
I'm afraid you two
won't even get to talk

630
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,120
before he kills you.

631
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,800
I'm that weak?

632
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:38,410
Just make sure to clear it up

633
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:39,360
to avoid any misunderstandings.

634
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:43,320
If I hadn't promised Madam Hong
to accompany her to the temple,

635
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,560
I would go with you.

636
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:45,730
Relax.

637
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,040
Just a chat.

638
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:49,320
Nothing will happen.

639
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,490
We'll talk later.

640
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,680
So ungrateful.

641
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,890
Doesn't even reply to messages.

642
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:22,600
Mu Dai.

643
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:24,850
Madam Hong,

644
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,560
you're finally done.

645
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:27,600
Sorry to keep you waiting.

646
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:32,990
[Li Tan]

647
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:33,850
- Mu Dai.
- Mr. Li.

648
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:34,680
Mu Dai.

649
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:36,330
Why are you sweating so much?

650
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,890
I found the murderer.

651
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,010
The old one is dead.

652
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:41,160
He got off easy.

653
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,080
But I got the young one.

654
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,080
I can

655
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,810
die happily now.

656
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:50,560
Luo Ren?

657
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:52,290
No, Mr. Li.

658
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:54,290
You've got it wrong!

659
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:57,080
Do you know where they are?

660
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:57,890
Luo Ren's place.

661
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:58,770
Let's go.

662
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,080
Hurry.

663
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:09,560
Stay back!

664
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,160
Mu Dai.

665
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:13,930
Get out.

666
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:15,120
Now!

667
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:16,640
Mr. Li.

668
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,680
Mr. Li, don't...

669
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,010
This has nothing to do with Luo Ren.

670
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,040
Nothing to do with him?

671
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:23,080
I saw his uncle kill with my own eyes.

672
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,490
He's an accomplice!

673
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,810
And he even lied to me,

674
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:27,290
saying his uncle was being controlled.

675
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:28,080
Nonsense!

676
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:29,520
Do I look like a three-year-old?

677
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,770
I saw it!

678
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:32,290
Mr. Li.

679
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:33,720
No excuses!

680
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,160
Put the lighter down.

681
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,680
Murder is a crime!

682
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,330
Crime?

683
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,080
I've already put my life on the line!

684
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:43,120
It's been 22 years.

685
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:45,640
Twenty-two years!

686
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:48,290
I can finally

687
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:51,200
give Yaqing an answer.

688
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:51,810
Mr. Li!

689
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:52,520
- Mr. Li!
- Li Tan!

690
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,160
Li Tan!

691
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:54,160
Li Tan!

692
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,010
It's... It's me.

693
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,200
Li Tan!

694
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:02,640
Yaqing.

695
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:12,200
Yaqing?

696
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,410
Yes, it's me.

697
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:23,850
No.

698
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:25,770
You're not her.

699
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,640
You're her twin sister.

700
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,680
You're all liars!

701
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,240
No, I am Yaqing.

702
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,410
I'm Li Yaqing.

703
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,200
I am!

704
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:36,970
You're not.

705
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:37,680
I am!

706
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:39,160
You're not Li Yaqing!

707
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,930
I am! I swear!

708
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:42,720
Don't you remember?

709
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,640
The first time we met

710
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,520
was at a Sichuan restaurant
near your workplace.

711
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,290
You ordered tomato and egg soup.

712
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:49,490
The egg was whole.

713
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:50,520
I said it shouldn't be like that.

714
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,680
It should be scrambled.

715
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,010
But you said
that was how Sichuan cuisine was.

716
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:54,810
Don't you remember?

717
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:57,010
You also said
you couldn't hold your liquor.

718
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,810
Remember?

719
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:03,930
I am really Li Yaqing!

720
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:20,720
Yaqing.

721
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:54,770
Li Tan.

722
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,810
I need to tell you something.

723
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,850
Li Tan really went overboard.

724
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,370
We agreed to just go
through the motions,

725
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,240
but he used so much force.

726
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,560
So it was all water?

727
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,440
Barely any gasoline.

728
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,930
Just enough for the smell.

729
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:45,280
Set the mood.

730
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,410
How could you

731
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,600
team up to trick me?

732
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:51,970
Not cool.

733
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,050
Mr. Zheng sent it to me this morning.

734
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:05,850
Sorry.

735
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,080
I couldn't wait any longer.

736
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:10,970
The song Pingting was singing

737
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:13,890
is the one my uncle sang
before he killed someone.

738
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,120
I wanted to discuss it with you.

739
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:18,560
But

740
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:19,720
Li Tan is impulsive,

741
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:21,810
and we thought

742
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:23,930
if we didn't tell you,

743
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:25,600
your reactions would be genuine,

744
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,640
and the effect would be better.

745
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:28,120
It's urgent,

746
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,120
so I had to do this.

747
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:34,680
I haven't been able to sleep.

748
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,850
So I've been thinking

749
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,330
about these cases.

750
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:41,370
Suddenly, an idea occurred to me.

751
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:42,530
Go on.

752
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:45,120
What if the mastermind

753
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,560
is a supernatural force?

754
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:49,850
Is that weird?

755
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:50,450
Sorry.

756
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:53,120
After Liu Shuhai fell into the water,
he changed drastically

757
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,080
because he was controlled.

758
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:55,930
Later, he died in the inn,

759
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:57,080
and then your uncle was controlled.

760
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:00,560
So you think

761
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:02,530
Pingting went mad

762
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,410
because she was controlled
by this force?

763
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:04,970
Yeah.

764
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,720
So we need

765
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,810
an exorcist now?

766
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:15,600
I'm just saying.

767
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:16,930
Can't I even say it?

768
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,410
You'll drink my water now?

769
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:23,680
It's actually poisoned this time.

770
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:33,450
There's so much
I should've told you sooner.

771
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:35,810
But I never had the chance.

772
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:38,640
Li Tan,

773
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:44,530
you know about me and Zhang Guanghua.

774
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:46,490
My dad's been feeling shamed,

775
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:47,200
so...

776
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,240
I just want to say

777
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:56,280
I'm sorry.

778
00:40:58,430 --> 00:40:59,490
It's my fault.

779
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:36,720
Mr. Li,

780
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:38,490
how did the conversation...?

781
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:43,410
Mr. Li?

782
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,560
What's wrong?

783
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:52,720
Mr. Li, where are you going?

784
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:02,200
Mr. Li.

785
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:05,200
What happened?

786
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:09,330
