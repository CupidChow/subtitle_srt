[Episode 15]

5
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,220
Let's split up.

6
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:21,940
Come on.

7
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:23,420
Mu Dai.

8
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,220
You go that way.

9
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,420
I got her!

10
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,620
Luo!

11
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:51,940
Here!

12
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,420
I got her!

13
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:03,660
Lian Shu.

14
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,540
This must be the last piece of amber.

15
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,780
You send it back.

16
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,780
I'll take care of this.

17
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:29,940
Where's Mu Dai?

18
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,580
She went out with you.

19
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,820
Why is she missing?

20
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,580
Mu Dai?

21
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,540
I don't remember.

22
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,060
Then think hard.

23
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,660
I said I don't remember.

24
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,940
Let me go!

25
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,100
Or I'll call the police.

26
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,100
There aren't many people
I'm close to in my life.

27
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,460
So, I hate it when people hurt them.

28
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,140
I never want anyone to hurt my friends,

29
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,540
buddies, or beloved girl.

30
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,140
Think over what happened.

31
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,100
Think hard.

32
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,300
Otherwise,

33
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,180
I'll make you do it.

34
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,460
When I first met you,

35
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,660
I had a strange feeling.

36
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,620
I felt

37
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,300
scared

38
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,900
and excited.

39
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,220
Not only about you

40
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,020
but also your friends.

41
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,620
I wanted to avoid you guys.

42
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,060
But I also wanted to approach.

43
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,740
I didn't know why.

44
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,740
I tried to get close to your family.

45
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,580
The room on the second floor...

46
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,620
It gave me a feeling of closeness.

47
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,700
But it was locked

48
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,980
and I couldn't get in.

49
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,020
When you were back this time,

50
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,100
something changed.

51
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,420
I felt like a voice

52
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,060
was calling me over.

53
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,060
Missy.

54
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,620
The second floor.

55
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,260
No.

56
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,940
That day, I didn't know why,

57
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,980
but before I knew it,

58
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,580
I was at the door.

59
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,540
I was thinking...

60
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,700
About what?

61
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,540
Hanging Mu Dai.

62
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:45,860
And then?

63
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,340
I'd hang her.

64
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:50,900
What happened then?

65
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,140
Then...

66
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,860
Then I drugged her.

67
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,940
I brought her here.

68
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,820
But she was like a different person.

69
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,460
She hit me!

70
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,340
She hit me really hard!

71
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,340
She hit me!

72
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:43,780
And then?

73
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,540
She hit me.

74
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,460
What happened later?

75
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,380
Where is she?

76
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,300
Help me!

77
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,540
I can't remember.

78
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,460
She hit me.

79
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,780
I think she's telling the truth.

80
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,220
Lady Dai is skilled in martial arts.

81
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,260
I'm sure she's fine.

82
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,220
Maybe she's back home now.

83
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,860
I'll go get her.

84
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,860
Since Luo is in the middle of something,

85
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,300
I'll do the recording

86
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,460
for our further reference.

87
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:29,580
Attention.

88
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,260
The shadow of water is appearing.

89
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,940
Isn't Bajiao house burned?

90
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,660
How come it's restored?

91
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,380
The burned woman is all right too.

92
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,460
She's even living a happy life.

93
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,300
This is what we can see

94
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,140
from this shadow of water.

95
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,340
But it's a little strange.

96
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,020
A burned house can be rebuilt.

97
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,660
How could a burned woman recover?

98
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,660
This story...

99
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,380
Is it presented in reverse,

100
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,020
starting from the end?

101
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:30,820
Well...

102
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,260
In your childhood,

103
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,700
were you the young savage's friend?

104
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,380
She didn't deserve me.

105
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,140
I went to Yueliang Mountain.

106
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,460
She painted a lot in the cave.

107
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,900
About your mother
having fun with you two.

108
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,260
Yes.

109
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,220
In case she was lonely, my mother

110
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,140
took me up there to play with her.

111
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,740
Why would a beast be lonely?

112
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,060
Did you never play with her there?

113
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,420
I did.

114
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,900
I played with her happily

115
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,020
and taught her to paint.

116
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,340
You taught her to paint?

117
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,300
Or who else did?

118
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,620
If nobody had taught her,

119
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,620
how could a beast learn to paint?

120
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,140
Stop calling her beast.

121
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,260
Show some respect, will you?

122
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,140
It's too early to be angry.

123
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,580
When you know what happened later,

124
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,940
you'll go mad.

125
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,340
I played with her happily.

126
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,540
Otherwise,

127
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,820
my mother wouldn't have let me
take care of her alone.

128
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:43,500
And she wouldn't have obeyed me.

129
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,140
What did you do?

130
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,740
Nothing, actually.

131
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,020
I just chewed a mushroom

132
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,340
and rolled on the ground,
gripping my stomach.

133
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,300
I frothed at the mouth.

134
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,620
You pretended to be poisoned

135
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,260
and she took you to the village.

136
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,780
In the village, I was all right.

137
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,580
I shouted and shouted.

138
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,660
I had everybody come out to see her.

139
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,420
You should have seen

140
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,220
how they hit her with stones.

141
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,820
Shut up!

142
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,140
You know what?

143
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,940
She deserved it.

144
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,820
I used to have a happy family.

145
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,100
Because of her,

146
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:53,820
I lost everything.

147
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,500
My mother abandoned me.

148
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,020
My father got a new wife.

149
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,220
Do you know what a terrible life I had?

150
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,380
It was all because of that beast.

151
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,540
She deserved it.

152
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,180
Miss Lian,

153
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,380
you never understood their love.

154
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,220
You had a loving mother.

155
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,540
You also had an honest and kind

156
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,020
sister.

157
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,020
You lost both of them.

158
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,740
But it's not that they abandoned you,

159
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,420
but you didn't deserve them.

160
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,940
All the time,

161
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,380
you never deserved.

162
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,300
Well,

163
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,300
you called her beast.

164
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,620
But in my eyes,

165
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,460
she's more like a real human.

166
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,100
How tragic! That girl was knocked away.

167
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,060
Such a miserable car accident.

168
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,140
The police even came.

169
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,500
Look at the tiny pieces of glass.

170
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,460
And the blood.

171
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,220
Yeah.

172
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,940
How miserable! Can she survive?

173
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:53,980
I heard

174
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,540
she was a mass of blood.

175
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,340
That's horrible.

176
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:56,860
Exactly.

177
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,340
Her family must be heartbroken.

178
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:01,820
Look.

179
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,940
Even the car is...

180
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,380
Doctor, come on.

181
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,700
My son is injured. Hurry.

182
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:19,980
[Resuscitation Room]

183
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,740
Doctor.

184
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,940
I'm her family. How's she?

185
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,620
You are?

186
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,100
Yes.

187
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,100
She had head trauma.

188
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,140
But the CT doesn't show

189
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,180
any bleeding in her brain.

190
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,580
Her condition remains unclear.

191
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,820
She'll stay in ICU for observation.

192
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,700
Is she all right?

193
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,660

288
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,020
Wen was a top student in her class.

289

00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,100
Her parents insisted

291
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,900
Mu Dai nudged her into skipping class.

292
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,060
If you hadn't taken her out,

293
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,060

294
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,020
And some guys said

295
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,100
Wen could have run away.

296
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,700
She returned to save Mu Dai.

- Stop hassling her.
- Sinner.

301
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,580
After that,

302
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,820
instead of blaming those rogues,

303
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,660
they blamed Mu Dai.

- Don't.

307
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:25,780
Don't do this.

308
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,580

309
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,460

311
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,260
Mu Dai hit her head

312
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,780
and had little memory of that.

313
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,860
When Shen Wen's family questioned her,

314
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,580
she couldn't explain anything.

315
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,900

317

318
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,380
didn't you defend her?

319
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,700
Defend her? How?

320
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,260
Their child was killed.

322
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,820
I asked Mu Dai to bear with it.

323
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,020
Then it would be over.

324
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,420

328
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,220
It's okay.

329
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,700

330
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,260

331

338
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,380

344
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,460
did I realize

345
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,740
Mu Dai had a mental problem.

346
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,540
Silence grew in her,

347
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,820
and she barely talked to anyone.

348
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,140
She remained sleepless.

349
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,340
I couldn't let this continue.

350
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,100
So, we moved away.

351
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,500
Then, she began to see doctors.

352
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,780
It was then

353
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,940
that I met Dr. He.

354
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,340
It's been eight years.

355
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,020
He's been following up on her case.

356
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,300
Following up?

357
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,020
Does Mu Dai know that?

358
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,900
Her case is quite unusual.

359
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,420
It's ever rare in my experience

360
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,700
of many years.

361
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,580
Mr. Luo,

362
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,060
I heard you were her boyfriend.

363
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,660
I still am.

364
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,300
What you're going to see and hear

365
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,260
may upend what you know about her.

366
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,380
I advised Ms. Huo

367
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,100
to watch Mu Dai's daily behaviors

368
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,260
and even made some videos

369
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,420
when she wasn't paying attention.

370
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,420
Then, we could monitor her

371
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,780
in a more comprehensive way.

372
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,540
Leave me alone.

373
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,620
She...

374
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,380
You didn't kill her.

375
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,620
You almost died too.

376
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,020
You barely survived.

377
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,820
Don't lose your life.

378
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,740
Stop crying.

379
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,140
You don't understand.

380
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,700
You just don't.

381
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,380
I really feel bad.

382
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,300
Feel bad?

383
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,380
About what?

384
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,980
Did you kill her?

385
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,180
But I feel terrible.

386
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,740
I want to kill myself.

387
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,380
I really want to do that.

388
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,380
This is my body.

389
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,140
Mine.

390
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:04,780
Fine.

391

What do I do?

392
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,100
What do I do now?

393
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,700
Let it be.

394
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,380
And then?

395
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,260
Then she recovered.

396
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:01,900

397
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,140
Without.

398
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,580
Without treatment.

399
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,420
So, that was...

400
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:11,740
Split personality?

401
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,740
It doesn't fit

402

the definition of split personality.

403
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,460
In that case,

404
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,900
each personality is intact

405
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,220
and they don't share memories.

406
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,700
Mu Dai's case doesn't accord

407
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,180
with any of our known cases.

408
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,660
As far as I inferred,

409
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,580
in this accident,

410
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,860
Mu Dai couldn't bear

411
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,220
so much pain.

412
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,180
To save herself,

413
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,700
she split off a different personality.

414
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,540
Let's call this one

415
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:40,140
"Dark Mu Dai".

416
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,460
She's rational, calm,

417
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,340
and hostile to everyone and everything.

418
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,260
And this one

419
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,020
is the girl you're familiar with.

420
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:52,140
She's warm, soft, and adorable.

421
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,260
At the end of the video,

422
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:57,980
she said, "Let it be."

423
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,700
What does that mean?

424
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,500
Dark Mu Dai and Bright Mu Dai

425
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,500
fought for the control of the body.

426
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,420
I guess

427
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,740
Bright Mu Dai prevailed

428
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,340
in that fight.

429
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,220
But in the video,

430
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,940
Dark Mu Dai looked more aggressive.

431
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,940
What she said at last

432
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:19,220
is the result of a compromise.

433
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,020
Humans are social by nature.

434
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,660
Bright Mu Dai's character

435
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,820
is more acceptable in the society.

436
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,820
So, Dark Mu Dai chose

437
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,340
to relinquish control

438
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,340
and stay silent.

439
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,540
She wouldn't wake up

440
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,900
unless she needed to save this body

441
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,780
from extreme danger or pain.

442
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,700
And it seems Bright Mu Dai doesn't know

443
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,660
the existence of the dark one

444
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,460
because it hugely exceeds

445
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,020
what her body can tolerate.

446
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:50,980
But now...

447
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,340

Here's the thing.

461
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,620
Today, I had a really good lunch.

462

463
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,460
I wanted to do some digging
in the garden

467
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:32,500
What?

468
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,780
A hole.

469
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:39,940
If I shoveled,

470
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,220
I'd see a hole, too.

578
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,180
Neither you nor Pocketty

579
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,380
can stop feeling guilty about Shen Wen.

580
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,020
I didn't kill her.

581
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,420
Why would I feel guilty?

582
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,220
Right.

583
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,740
You don't need to feel guilty

584
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,140
because you did nothing wrong.

585
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,500
You aren't to blame

586
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:19,900

587
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:21,980
It's not you who wanted to see the movie

588
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,420
or advised taking a shortcut.

589
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,580
Right?

590
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,300
I asked Madam Hong

591
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,540
about what happened that day.

592
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,340
Come on, Mu Dai.

593
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,620
Or we'll be late for the movie.

594
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,380

595
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,580
Wen.

596
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,620
How about we go back to class?

597
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:41,860
Too late.

598
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,740
We can't take the main road.

599
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,380
Let's take a shortcut.

600
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:46,820
Okay.

601
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:47,300
Come on.

602
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:52,780
Slow down.

603
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,140
Because you were guilty,

604
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,660
you didn't explain anything.

605
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,100
Because it's Shen Wen

606
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,020
who actually died.

607
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:14,540
It's also because...

608
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,380
She could have run away.

609
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,020
Stop running!

610
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:22,660
Stop.

611
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:25,860
Try running again.

612
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:27,980
Such a bad temper.

613

You hit me hard.

614
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,300
Trying to kill me, huh?

615
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,220
Come on, let's have fun.

Come over here.

617

To outsiders,

623
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,260
it may not be a wise choice.

624
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:54,780
I don't know what Shen Wen was thinking.

625
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,700
But I'm sure about one thing.

626
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,500
She cherished you.

627
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:07,740
What a bad temper.

628
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:08,580
Indeed.

Give me a kiss.

What do you say?

633
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,220
I'll be gentle.

634

Hit her.

635
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,300
Darn it.

636
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,060
Go ahead.

637

- How dare you?

639

Screw you.

640
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,460
Shen Wen's parents lost their daughter.

641
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,500
But anyway, you shouldn't take the blame

642
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,780
for the real murderers.

643
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:52,740
Do you think

644
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,380
this is the whole story?

645
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,260
They have a reason to hate me.

646
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,380
If it weren't for me,

647
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,460
she wouldn't have died.

648
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,100
What do you mean?

649
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,420
It was me

00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,540
who provoked those guys

651
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,140
and made them kill.

652
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:13,900
But according to Huo Zihong,

653
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,620
you hit your head

654
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,100
and didn't remember anything.

655
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,500
She didn't.

656
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,020
But I'm not her.

657
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,020

it was you who they dragged up there.

Clever boy.

660
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:31,900
She was so weak

that she lived in a total mess.

662
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,220
She couldn't bear all that.

I just had to.

So, Dark Mu Dai

00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,260
