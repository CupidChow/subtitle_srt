16

And that's when Qingshan escaped.

20

she took advantage of the chaos

to transfer the relic of ill omen

22

23
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,860

Mr. Li asked me to hypnotize him
for a portrait before,

185
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,540
and I thought it was too difficult.

00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:25,900
But...

187
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,140
Hypnosis might not work,

188
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,500
but getting clues out of her
should be possible.

189
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,300
Forget it. Don't get your hopes up.

190
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,660
Of course I'll get my hopes up.

191
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,300
You're the top hypnotist

192
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,780
around this area.

193
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,700
Well then,

194
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,060
I'll give it a shot.

195
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,540
The relic of ill omen
has already been removed.

196
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:09,940
Should we

197
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,620
let Yafeng and Qingshan go?

198
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,740
Yeah.

199
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,780
Keeping them locked up isn't right.

200
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,300
It's false imprisonment.

201
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,260
Actually, they're victims.

202
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,540
Although Yafeng talks tough,

203
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,660
she's just a young girl.

204
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,540
A good scare is enough.

205
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:28,540
Are you sleepy?

206
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,500
Yeah.

207
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,220
But so many things have happened today.

208
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,900
I can't fall asleep.

209
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,260
Well, how about

210
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,540
counting sheep?

211
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,700
I'll count the stairs instead.

212
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,340
One step, two steps,

213
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,380
three steps, four steps,

214
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,740
five steps, six steps,

215
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,180
seven steps...

216
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,220
You're here.

217
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:24,900
Let's talk.

218
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,500
How did the relic of ill omen
come to you?

219
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,620
No idea.

220
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,020
It just came.

221
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,420
I felt so good

222
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,980
after it came to me,

223
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,460
like I was brimming

224
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,460
with power.

225
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,700
Then do you know why it chose you?

226
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,300
Of course I do.

227
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,220
It likes me

228
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,260
because I'm wicked.

229
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,860
But he doesn't understand.

230
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,340
I'm more suitable

231
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,780
for the relic than all the others.

232
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:11,740
Who is he?

233
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,500
Your companion?

234
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:14,940
Companion?

235
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,780
Do you mean Qingshan?

236
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,500
If it weren't for that fool,
I wouldn't have been caught.

237
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,940
How did you know about the trapdoor?

238
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,260
I just knew.

239
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,500
I've been here

240
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,940
a long time ago.

241
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,060
It was them!

242
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,820
They brought officials
and buried me alive!

243
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,700
Right in that pit.

244
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,780
What is the "cycle of seven sevens"?

245
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,660
Don't let them hear it.

246
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,940
Nothing can trap us
except the Imperishable Wood

247
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,060
and the Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle.

248
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,580
No matter what tricks they pull,

249
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,460
they can't avoid
the cycle of seven sevens.

250
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,980
Does "seven sevens" mean forty-nine?

251
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:06,900
Yes.

252
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,300
Forty-nine days.

253
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,900
Those fools think

254
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,460
they can take away
my relic of ill omen with blood.

255
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,700
What use is blood?

256
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,260
It can trap us for 49 days at most.

257
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,220
That doesn't seem right.

258
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,260
They trapped the first relic of ill omen

259
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,500
a long time ago.

260
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,220
It's been way more than forty-nine days.

261
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:26,980
That's because later

262
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,900
they trapped the second
and the third ones.

263
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,980
As long as a new relic of ill omen

264
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,460
is trapped within 49 days,

265
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,060
the count resets.

266
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:37,820
So

267
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,940
it's useless.

268
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,900
As long as they can't find a new one,

269
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,580
all their efforts will be in vain.

270
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,460
In the end,

271
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,380
the relic of ill omen
will still be mine.

272
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,700
Mine!

273
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,900
Everything will be ruined.

274
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,340
They'll all be finished!

275
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,260
What did you do to me?

276
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,900
You won't get anything from me!

277
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,020
You'll all be doomed!

278
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,180
I'll sue you.

279
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,340
Kidnapping, false imprisonment,

280
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,380
and even physical assault!

281
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,500
You peeled off a piece of skin
from my back.

282
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,820
Qingshan is a victim, too!

283
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,780
What did we even do wrong?

284
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,020
We're just a poor young couple.

285
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,980
You freaks.

286
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,020
Freaks!

287
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,500
This is a mess.

288
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,460
After all that, we're the freaks.

289
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,060
And they could easily sue us.

290
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,340
The bride and the groom vanished
at the wedding.

291
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,660
The whole village can testify to that.

292
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,660
And they've got missing skin
on their backs.

293
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,540
But if we want to sue them,

294
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,860
we don't even have evidence.

295
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,500
Let's release them tomorrow morning.

296
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,460
Keeping them any longer
is false imprisonment.

297
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,620
At least, we've secured
the relic of ill omen.

298
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:09,500
They

299
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,220
can't cause trouble anymore.

300
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,060
Yafeng!

301
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,500
Yafeng!

302
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,100
Yafeng, where are you going?

303
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,540
Let's talk when we get back
to the village, alright?

304
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,100
The village?

305
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,300
What do I have to do with your village?

306
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,060
We...

307
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,100
We held the wedding banquet.

308
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,100
So what?

309
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,980
You good-for-nothing.

310
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,220
If you hadn't messed up,

311
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,660
I'd have succeeded by now!

312
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,700
And you think I'd marry you?

313
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:52,980
Keep dreaming!

314
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,140
Yafeng.

315
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,540
Yafeng.

316
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,220
I even betrayed my cousin for you.

317
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,620
I'm begging you, alright?

318
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,780
Come back with me.

319
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,140
Are you deaf?

320
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,100
Stop following me.

321
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,460
You won't go home, really?

322
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,060
I'll just pack things up and leave.

323
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,660
Haven't made anything of myself anyway.

324
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,420
What's your standard of that?

325
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,820
You're my disciple,

326
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,300
upright and decent.

327
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,340
That's making something of yourself.

328
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,900
You're right here,
yet you're not seeing your parents.

329
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,900
That's shameful.

330
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,020
Got it?

331
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,540
Going back would only upset them.

332
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,660

Cao,

♪What's left to fear?♪

372
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:52,940
Let's take this chance

373
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,220
to go check on the cave

374
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,860
in the back of the mountain again.

375
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:58,860
I have a feeling

376
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:00,820
it can tell us more.

377
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,440
♪What's left to fear?♪

378
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,620
I really don't understand

379
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,140
kids these days.

380
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,860
Getting married on a whim,

381
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,180
and calling it off just as fast.

382
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,580
Whenever I ask him anything,

383
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,140
he just clams up.

384
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,820
Qingshan's stubbornness

385
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:18,060
is just like Pudgy's.

386
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,900
I wonder where Pudgy is now.

387
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,220
Where?

388
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,460
Probably died out there.

389
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,180
He'd better stay out

390
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,900
or I'll beat him to death
when I see him.

391
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,260

You...

395
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:50,940
You...

396
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,340
You've been gone for about eight years.

397
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,740
Where have you been?

398
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,380
I was working

399
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:05,900
in big cities.

400
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,380
It was rough at first.

401
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:10,660
I thought I'd come back
after I'd made something of myself.

402
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,620
You silly boy.

403
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:15,220
What are you talking about?

404
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,940
Even if you end up as a beggar,

405
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,060
to me,

406
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,060
you'd still be my son.

407
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,780
You know that?

408
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,420
Yanhua.

409
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,780
Mom.

410
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,260
Yanhua.

411
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,060
Get up.

412
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,820
It's good that you're back.

413
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,380
Make some food for him.

414
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,380
Yanhua,

415
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,420
get up.

416
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,380
Your dad has forgiven you.

417
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,500
Get up now.

418
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,380
Get up. No more tears.

419
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,900
Your dad has forgiven you.

420
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,260
Come on, pull.

421
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,340
So, according to you two,

422
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,140
this one lying here
is the Saturn Star Lord, the god of land?

423
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,220
Those possessed by the relic of ill omen

424
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,780
often gain supernatural abilities.

425
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,940
Back in the old times,
people were ignorant,

426
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,140
so they called him the Star Lord,

427
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,780
followed him, and worshiped him.

428
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,380
So these bodies with masks on

429
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,300
must be his followers.

430
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:38,620
But who are these five kneeling ones?

431
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,260
The scripts here say

432
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:41,940
that they are treacherous villains.

433
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,300
They were made to kneel for eternity.

434
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,220
When Yafeng was hypnotized,

435
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,700
she said they brought officials

436
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,500
to kill her in this cave.

437
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,700
I'm guessing

438
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:55,820
those five were the ones
who caused the Star Lord's death.

439
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,460
People who were against
the relics of ill omen?

440
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:03,900
Five of them?

441
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,140
There are five of us too.

442
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,820
And we're also against
the relics of ill omen.

443
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:14,580
Just thinking about it

444
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,500
gives me the creeps.

445
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,020
Don't jinx it.

446
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,780
What kind of nonsense is that?

447
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,940
Have you lost your mind
from the hit on your head?

448
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,620
Yeah, yeah, I've lost my mind.

449
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,740
I'm totally fried.

450
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,020
This is a eulogy for the Star Lord.

451
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,900
Signed by someone named Cao Sanbao.

452
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,860
He should be the one
who escaped from here.

453
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,980
He set up the trapdoor.

454
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,500
Perhaps,

455
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,780
even the Cao Village
exists because of him.

456
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,100
Yes, I remember now.

457
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,700
Cao Jinhua told me

458
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,260
the Cao Village
used to make pottery for a living.

459
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,340
And their memorial tablet

460
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,820
bears the ancient character

461
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,660
for "earth".

462
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,540
Earth?

463
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,900
Here, your favorite eggs.

464
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,580
You should have some too.

465
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:03,660
OK.

466
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,380
All these are your favorites.

467
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:06,820
Here you go.

468
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:07,500
I've got enough.

469
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,140
Mom, I can do it myself.

470
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,060
I'll serve myself.

471
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,900
One more thing.

472
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:14,980
You should go

473
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,220
and apologize to Jinhua.

474
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,660
I ran into her dad yesterday.

475
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,580
He's still mad.

476
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,500
He said you held her back.

477
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,380
She's still single because of you.

478
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,620
Come on, eat.

479
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,740
Dig in.

480
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:40,860
Come on.

481
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,140
Jinhua,

482
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,460
my father gave me an earful.

483
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,420
And I do feel like

484
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,220
I held you back on the marriage thing.

485
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,420
I sincerely apologize to you.

486
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:01,940
It's fine.

487
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,260
Honestly,

488
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,460
I should thank you.

489
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:09,700
Back then, I left in a huff
to find work.

490
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,100
Only then did I realize

491
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,820
how big the world is

492
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,420
and how many ways there are to live in.

493
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,660
Sure, my job's tiring

494
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,540
and demanding,

495
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,060
but it's fulfilling.

496
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,940
I wake up with hope every day.

497
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,460
Right.

498
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,100
As for the marriage thing,

499
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,820
I feel great

500
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,340
living the days by myself.

501
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,340
I just want to focus on my work,

502
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,660
so I can make money

503
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,300
and give myself
and my family a better life.

504
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:41,300
I want to improve myself
from the inside out.

505
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,060
You know what,

506
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,180
several guys in Yan City hit on me

507
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,820
but I turned them all down

508
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,020
because they don't even know
who Monet is.

509
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,700
How's that going to work, right?

510
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,180
Yeah.

511
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,620
If they don't even know Motay,

512
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,820
that's really...

513
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,740
Pudgy,

514
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,300
I am quite

515
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,420
worried about you.

516
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,380
I think

517
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:16,060
your work is too dangerous.

518
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:19,860
That's typical for a man, you know.

519
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,020
That's why

520
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,700
I think

521
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,220
you should get insurance.

522
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,780
I... Uh...

523
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:31,700
No, no.

524
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,580
Listen, the benefits are incredible.

525
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,220
That's true.

526
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:34,980
- I get it.
- I bought insurance myself.

527
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,460
Actually... You've got it all wrong.

528
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,060
I'm in the catering business

529
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:38,940
with those friends of mine.

530
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,300
It's very safe.

531
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,460
Perfectly safe.

532
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,900
Those friends of yours?

533
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,700
I saw them head up the mountain.

534
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,420
Head up the mountain?

535
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,420
Why didn't you go with them?

536
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,700
We both left home in a huff.

537
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,260
Jinhua is having a promising life.

538
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,260
She even lost weight.

539
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,500
While I'm on the way to become a loser

540
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,380
and I just packed on the pounds.

541
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,980
Luckily, I've found some true friends.

542
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:14,980
I'll just tease them a bit.

543
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:22,260
The Cao Village was built by Cao Sanbao.

544
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,780
All the villagers share the surname Cao.

545
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,460
They even worship the Saturn Star Lord.

546
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,620
In this case,

547
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:31,020
Chubby is a descendant
of the Star Lord's followers?

548
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,180
The Star Lord was possessed
by the relic of ill omen.

549
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,060
Well, is there something wrong
with the village?

550
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,380
After centuries,

551
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,180
the villagers
have long forgotten this past

552
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,540
and just regard it as a tradition.

553
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,380
Oh,

554
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,100
and don't tell Chubby about this.

555
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,980
My ancestors worshipped the Star Lord?

556
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,140
I'm a descendant of villains?

557
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,660
Why do they keep it from me?

558
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,060
Who's there?

559
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,140
It's you.

560
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,220
We had a deal.

561
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,500
You should do as I say.

562
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,860
What do you mean I can handle them

563
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,300
but can't kill them?

564
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,380
What if they try to kill me?

565
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,580
Relax.

566
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,260
They only want the relic of ill omen,

567
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,180
not your life.

568
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,180
Take away the relic of ill omen?

569
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,460
That is taking my life.

570
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,500
I think

571
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,860
all the sacrifices now

572
00:30:59,100 --> 00:30:59,940
are worth it

573
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:01,940
for the plan to succeed.

574
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,500
But they almost died.

575
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,300
You've gone too far.

576
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,780
How can they play their parts

577
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,540
when you push them to the corner?

578
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,060
Do you think I wanted this?

579
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,380
You didn't even tell me
Yan Hongsha was also coming.

580
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,900
There are five of them.

581
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,820
They're all ruthless.

582
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,900
I'm all alone and outnumbered.

583
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,340
And Qingshan is useless!

584
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,700
Well now, things have gone your way.

585
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,740
I've lost everything.

586
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,620
And you're blaming me?

587
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,500
No, no, I'm not.

588
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:58,860
Why would I?

589
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,020
Alright. It's fine.

590
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,500
Nothing went too far off track,

591
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:09,620
right?

592
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,740
Think,

593
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,020
if any deviation had happened,

594
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,220
would I have let you off?

595
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,580
I don't have the relic of ill omen.

596
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,340
But you still do.

597
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:52,940
Give it to me!

598
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:55,980
Give it to me!

599
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,820
It prefers me.

600
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,860
It'll be happier

601
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,700
with me.

602
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,740
Give it to me. Now!

603
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,140
Never.

604
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37,780
Give it to me.

605
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:40,980
Give it to me!

606
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:24,020
So you want to stay home longer

607
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,660
and you'll head back
after dropping us in town?

608
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,420
My parents want me around a bit more.

609
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:29,860
Fair enough.

610
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:30,980
Spend more time with them.

611
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,300
Cao,

612
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,660
aren't you going to

613
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:43,220
relight the sparks
with Cao Jinhua this time?

614
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,500
Relight?

615
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,980
We never lit anything before.

616
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,020
Then aren't you going to

617
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,900
turn that little spark between you two

618
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,380
into a roaring fire?

619
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,660
There's never been a spark.

620
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,940
Looks like I'm doomed to die alone.

621
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:58,140
To prevent such a tragedy,

622
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,180
I'm getting a pet.

623
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,740
What kind of pet?

624
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:04,980
I haven't decided yet.

625
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,980
Perhaps, fate will lead me

626
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,460
to the right pet

627
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,260
in the right place.

628
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,940
Fate, huh?

629
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:13,820
Alright, okay.

630
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,700
I'm cheesy
and you're the philosopher here.

631
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:17,740
Get in the car.

632
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,740
I told them my decision
to stay single for life.

633
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,300
And they don't care at all.

634
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,820
Obviously,

635
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,100
they detest me

636
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,660
because of where I come from.

637
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,380
My phone's broken.

638
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,540
I'll get it repaired up ahead.

639
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,820
You guys can go for a stroll

640
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,900
and grab some snacks

641
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:48,580
to eat on the way.

642
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,220
Sure.

643
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:50,940
Fiery, let's go.

644
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,180
Get me something.

645
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:53,300
Alright.

646
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,660
Chubby, you're on your own.

647
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,820
I'm going for a walk with Fiery.

648
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,140
Chubby, you're so lazy.

649
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,940
You heard me. Get out and move a little.

650
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:11,420
Let's go.

651
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,860
Fiery, what do you want to have?

652
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:15,820
My treat.

653
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,500
Let me see.

654
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,300
There's a nice bakery over there.

655
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,460
A cake shop?

656
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,940
What do you want to have?

657
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,900
I'll buy it for you.

658
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,340
Have you been waiting long?

659
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,020
No.

660
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:02,540
What are you looking at?

661
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,140
Chick,

662
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,780
are you as lonely

663
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,380
as I am?

664
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,700
I'm going to get my phone repaired.

665
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,140
I'll be right back. Wait for me.

666
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,380
What a coincidence.

667
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:48,940
I was just about to call you.

668
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,380
What does "Seven-Star Stay Bright" mean?

669
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,220
What great crisis?

670
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,620
The relics of ill omen will grow?

671
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,140
What does "grow" mean?
How will they grow?

672
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:01,740
I don't know either.

673
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,620
Yin Erma mentioned it last night.

674
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,220
I grilled him as soon as he woke up.

675
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,820
He swore to me

676
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,260
that he'd only heard

677
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,940
that the "Seven-Star Stay Bright"
and the relic of ill omen would grow.

678
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,900
But he didn't know

679
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,380
how they'd grow or to what size.

680
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:17,420
[One day ago]

681
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,300
We're just talking.

682
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,540
Relax.

683
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:23,780
Your account

684
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,220
will be part of my next book.

685
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,300
I

686
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,380
will be

687
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,740
in a book?

688
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:37,020
The Great Virtuous One
came out of Xiagu Pass

689
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:37,860
and passed by our village.

690
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:38,940
My ancestors were hospitable.

691
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,700
They treated him to alcohol, meat,

692
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,700
and pancakes.

693
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,140
Pleased,

694
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,940
he shared this tale.

695
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,420
Hospitality led to

696
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,340
a miraculous encounter.

697
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:54,340
Why do you visit the Stargazing Platform

698
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,300
every day, rain or shine?

699
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,060
Hobby.

700
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:57,900
Stargazing enthusiast?

701
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:01,340
How many stars
have you seen lit the most?

702
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,500
Six.

703
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,100
Well... When was that?

704
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,820
A year and a half ago.

705
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,700
But one day,

706
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,700
I saw five.

707
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:15,660
Well,

708
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,340
have you... have you ever seen

709
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:19,580
seven?

710
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,460
That's impossible.

711
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,340
No way, no way.

712
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,780
That would be disastrous.

713
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,860
Why is that?

714
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,660
They can grow.

715
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,460
Grow?

716
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,060
Ponder it yourself.

717
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,620
I'm really sleepy.

718
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,220
Wait...

719
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:44,100
Last night's conversation
got me thinking.

720
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,380
If

721
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:47,660
a relic of ill omen keeps growing,

722
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,780
eventually, no human could contain them.
