00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,210
Hello

2
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:08,250
Ms. Kuo.

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:10,980
I'm Shao's mother.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,320
I was wondering if Shao and Tung
are good for each other.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,650
Now I know she's your daughter.

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,120
I feel relieved.

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,220
Tung and Shao?

8
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:18,690
Okay.

9
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:19,760
Let's go help.

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,860
Mrs. Luo.

11
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,160
You're taking part in the competition too?

12
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:23,500
Yes.

13
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,260
My mom made it.

14
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,800
Would you like to try?

15
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,400
Vietnamese food?

16
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,040
Mrs. Luo

17
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:31,840
I notice that

18
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,870
You've decorated your stall

19
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:34,210
So beautifully.

20
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,070
So tastefully.

21
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,470
Can you show me around?

22
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,410
Sure.

23
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,910
Tung, come with us.

24
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:39,880
Shao says

25
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,480
Among all the girls he's gone out with,

26
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,310
He likes you the most.

27
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:43,650
I'd like to know more about you.

28
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,620
I'm not his girlfriend.

29
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,520
What?

30
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,090
She's my boyfriend.

31
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,160
What?

32
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:52,590
Ah, no.

33
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:53,320
Girlfriend.

34
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:54,460
What?

35
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:56,800
Shao.

36
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,000
Explain it.

37
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,600
Yes.

38
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,940
Right.

39
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,340
Tung isn't my girlfriend.

40
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,770
Young is.

41
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,140
Young!

42
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,780
You've got a boyfriend?

43
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,550
No, I don’t.

44
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:17,680
She does.

45
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,180
I don't.

46
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,850
Young, don't be angry.

47
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:21,950
Mrs. Chang.

48
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,420
Tung and I are just friends.

49
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,460
I'm Young's boyfriend.

50
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,420
We're just friends too.

51
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,830
We're all good friends.

52
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,330
Young, believe me.

53
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,260
There is really nothing between Tung and I.

54
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,830
There is really nothing between you and me.

55
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:34,500
You shut up!

56
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,070
(Ep.6 Romeo and Juliet)
It's not what I mean.

57
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,130
(Ep.6 Romeo and Juliet)
Please, don't be like this.

58
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,030
I'm sorry.

59
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:11,440
What?

60
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,200
Let me explain.

61
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,740
We're in big trouble. -Don't touch me.

62
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,240
I really didn't mean it.

63
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,240
Wow, you broke up so soon.

64
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,150
Don't think it meant anything just cause
you kissed me once.

65
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,410
Told you I'm not interested in you.

66
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:25,880
Kissed you?

67
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,120
Whoa.

68
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,890
Whoa, unbelievable.

69
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,560
When?

70
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,960
You and Chia-Ying.

71
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,560
Kissed?

72
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,240
Forget it.

73
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,710
I'll explain it to you later.

74
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,079
Go.

75
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,520
Time to take sides.

76
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,850
Love rat.

77
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,660
Hey, it's soiled.

78
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,230
I'm sorry.

79
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,300
Smart.

80
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,100
Quick, it means my mom won't lose.

81
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:20,810
Missed it.

82
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:22,810
Who was it?

83
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,579
Stop running.

84
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,210
What are you doing?

85
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,510
Young.

86
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,380
Young, what are…

87
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,450
Stop fighting.

88
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,820
No.

89
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:45,560
Baby.

90
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,030
You deserve it.

91
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,130
Laughing, eh?

92
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:47,930
Yes, you!

93
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,970
Give it to me.

94
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,340
Where are you running to?

95
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,970
Yes, you!

96
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:53,570
Stop running.

97
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:54,270
Run further away.

98
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:54,840
Damn.

99
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,610
Keep running?

100
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,440
Running, eh?

101
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,410
Keep running, eh?

102
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,450
Help me!

103
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,620
Help me! Help me!

104
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:10,960
Help me!

105
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,520
Hey.

106
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,100
So many why, why, why

107
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,200
No need to guess

108
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,670
Just seize this moment, uh wo

109
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,320
Hey, Tung.

110
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,590
You smell of something very special.

111
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,460
Isn’t it ugly?

112
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,790
Did you win or lose?

113
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,570
Luckily, my parents aren't here.

114
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,610
Or I'd be in big trouble.

115
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,480
Yen.

116
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,280
Oh.

117
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,880
Throw the food you played with

118
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,350
Into the kitchen trash can.

119
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,420
Yes, sir.

120
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,690
What the hell.

121
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,720
So naughty. You never listen.

122
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,130
Pack up the stall.

123
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,160
I took a day off for you.

124
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,430
And you played with food?

125
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,960
Pack the stuff up, quick.

126
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,900
I'd have cooked more if I had known.

127
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,740
As for fighting,

128
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,640
My daughter must win.

129
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,650
I spent the whole night cooking.

130
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,409
And you wasted it like this.

131
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:44,780
Your dad will know when you are back.

132
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,580
He said we were wasting.

133
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,610
Mom, I'll go wash the plates.

134
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,010
Oh, okay, thanks.

135
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:40,740
Hey.

136
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,540
Tung, why are you here?

137
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,730
If my dad was still alive,

138
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,870
I guess my mom would take part in the competition.

139
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,250
I…

140
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,660
I miss my dad so much.

141
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:36,560
I really…

142
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,770
…really miss him.

143
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,500
Hey.

144
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,670
What's up?

145
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:19,940
Didn't you go wash the plates?

146
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,070
Mom.

147
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,670
Hm?

148
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,380
Why is Dad never home?

149
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,010
Did he abandon us?

150
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,150
Sweetie, what are you talking about?

151
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:38,020
Your dad is really on business trips.

152
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:39,890
He wouldn't abandon you.

153
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,260
You're his darling daughter.

154
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,289
Silly girl.

155
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:51,240
I'm sorry.

156
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,470
For making your clothes dirty.

157
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,910
It's fine.

158
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,540
You haven't hugged me for ages.

159
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,440
Let's hug each other tight.

160
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,580
Get dirty together.

161
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,880
But he had no reason to lie to his mom.

162
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,020
So…

163
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,820
I hate a liar like that.

164
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,360
Seize the chance and break up with him.

165
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,730
Never forgive him.

166
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,230
You lied to me too.

167
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,930
You said you liked Shao.

168
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,500
It doesn't count.

169
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,170
I deliberately wanted to make you angry.

170
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:26,640
I mean it.

171
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,580
Like Shao lying to his mom.

172
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:34,610
He said he just wanted to make his mom angry

173
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:37,010
Because she said you looked like a bad girl.

174
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,880
It's not the same, okay?

175
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:42,090
Once a man has lied, you can't trust him.

176
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:44,290
Once he has lied, he'll lie again.

177
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,530
Or in fact, you did like each other.

178
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,330
Just because I declared my feelings first

179
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,860
He went out with me.

180
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:54,330
Grrr…I like someone else.

181
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,200
The Martian doesn't count.

182
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,870
No.

183
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,400
So, it's Shao?

184
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,370
No, it's not Shao.

185
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,240
I know, you and Yen.

186
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,580
No.

187
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,950
So still, you like Shao.

188
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,080
I like Sheng.

189
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,470
Darling.

190
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,540
Hm.

191
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,370
Shao lied to his mother that

192
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,870
he didn't go out with Young.

193
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,580
Was it because of me?

194
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,080
Because they knew you'd oppose it.

195
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,250
Possible.

196
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,580
Not that.

197
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,350
Because

198
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,790
I'm Vietnamese.

199
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,790
Well.

200
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,190
you're thinking too much.

201
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,430
They're just teenagers.

202
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,000
They aren't Romeo and Juliet.

203
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,970
Back then your parents opposed us too.

204
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,400
I love only you in my whole life.

205
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,170
If I hadn't insisted,

206
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,140
Now

207
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,780
I'd regret it for the rest of my life.

208
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,180
You're being so cheesy.

209
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:21,650
Who?

210
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:22,950
I'll get it.

211
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,730
Why did you come here?

212
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:34,830
Mr. Chang.

213
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,870
Please apologize to Young on my behalf.

214
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,370
Please apologize to Mrs. Chang on my behalf.

215
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,510
Hey…

216
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,480
Have you had dinner yet?

217
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,150
Let me take you to dinner.

218
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,080
Really?

219
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,850
Hm.

220
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:53,650
Thank you, Mr. Chang.

221
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:54,420
Hey.

222
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:55,550
Where are you going?

223
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,750
Outside.

224
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,540
I'm sorry.

225
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,510
I didn't realize I left my wallet at home.

226
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:16,770
You even paid for me.

227
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,780
You're welcome. Just instant noodles.

228
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,310
Next time I'll treat you to something better.

229
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,420
Shao.

230
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,850
Sit.

231
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,750
Oh, okay.

232
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:35,590
It sounds like

233
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,430
Even when you've tried your best to explain,

234
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,830
Your parents still oppose you seeing Young.

235
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:44,600
Anyway, you and Young are still in senior high.

236
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,240
Don't argue with your parents about something like this.

237
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,810
Sometimes, it's hard for parents to change their minds.

238
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,710
You have to be patient.

239
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,150
Or it'll be very hard for you.

240
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,180
And…

241
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,720
Your parents just care about you.

242
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:00,950
So, don't make it difficult for them.

243
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:02,950
Yes.

244
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,440
Then…

245
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:29,780
Mr. Chang.

246
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,210
Hm.

247
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,780
Can I continue seeing Young?

248
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,450
Hey.

249
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:38,490
I didn't hear what you said.

250
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,990
Anyway, whether you're seeing each other…

251
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,660
I've no idea.

252
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,030
I just know

253
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,330
Young's mom doesn't allow her to have a boyfriend.

254
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,570
As for me…

255
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,140
I have poor eyesight

256
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,140
And I'm hard of hearing.

257
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,580
You understand what I mean, don't you?

258
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:58,580
Yes, I do.

259
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,540
Laughing

260
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,550
Laughing, eh?

261
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,720
Listen.

262
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,790
I was a high school boy once.

263
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,390
I know what high school boys think about.

264
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,560
I warn you.

265
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,200
Don't ever have any dirty thoughts.

266
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,200
Or I'll…

267
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:23,470
…cut it off.

268
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,840
I won't.

269
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,140
I won't, I mean it

270
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,200
Your father is waiting for you in his study.

271
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,210
When you go in, don't say too much.

272
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,180
Something happened in the office. He's in a bad mood.

273
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:21,960
Come in.

274
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,730
Darling.

275
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,730
It's not that serious.

276
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,100
Teenagers just love having fun.

277
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,440
Shao, come in.

278
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,280
Close the door.

279
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,070
Chia-Ying.

280
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,480
I'm sorry.

281
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,450
I didn't mean to say it out loud on that day.

282
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,580
Are you alright?

283
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,350
I've got girlfriends.

284
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:21,820
What?

285
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:23,620
Two at the same time.

286
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,090
Oh.

287
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,590
Yesterday, I got 30 fans more on Instagram.

288
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,090
I'm rising to fame.

289
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,060
Thanks!

290
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,640
OK

291
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,020
I'm going over there.

292
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,960
Young.

293
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,290
If you want to go over there,

294
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,430
You don't need my permission.

295
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,730
I just worry you trust boys too much.

296
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,829
He's different.

297
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:24,450
Aren't you angry anymore?

298
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,980
I'm angry.

299
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,290
But I want to hear you explain yourself.

300
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,560
I didn't tell you my mom didn't allow me
to have a boyfriend.

301
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,960
And I lied to my mom too.

302
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,390
But the lie I told is nothing compared with

303
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,600
The lie you told.

304
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,000
I won't apologize

305
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,570
Because you were too much.

306
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,440
Before this, you and Tung…

307
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,410
What's up?

308
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,240
I'm fine.

309
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,280
Okay, I'm not angry anymore, I mean it.

310
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:58,420
And my dad told me everything.

311
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,520
Don't be upset.

312
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,190
Baby.

313
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,660
Don't worry.

314
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,820
I'm not worried.

315
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:08,960
Shao is a good person.

316
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,100
Who isn't?

317
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,570
There is only a thin line between a good and bad person.

318
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,670
Your girlfriend is really difficult.

319
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,610
True. So exhausting.

320
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,570
Hang in there. For at least a month.

321
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,480
A month.

322
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,150
It's too long.

323
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,650
You shut up.

324
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,750
Hey, can I have some?

325
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,720
Sure, I'm not Shao.

326
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,990
Thanks.

327
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:41,990
Need it to keep you awake?

328
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:44,730
No, I just love coffee milk.

329
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,070
Young.

330
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:57,770
Hm?

331
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:58,710
Tell me.

332
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,610
If one day,

333
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,150
I'm no longer a student athlete

334
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,420
And can't do anything else,

335
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:09,450
Will you still like me?

336
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,820
Are you an idiot?

337
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,260
Even if you become a tramp,

338
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,360
I'll still like you.

339
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,190
Really?

340
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:17,390
Yes.

341
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,170
I, Young, love Shao the most.

342
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:23,230
Totally and unconditionally.

343
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,680
Whoa!

344
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:44,190
Hero.

345
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,630
Dear Martian,

346
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:56,630
I wonder why some people aren't afraid of getting hurt.

347
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:59,670
Clearly, you'll be in pain when you get hurt.

348
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:03,270
How can I not be afraid of getting hurt?

349
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,610
I'm back.

350
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,650
Eh, you look happy now.

351
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,460
No.

352
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,560
I don't want to worry you.

353
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,030
So, I pretend to look happy.

354
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,730
Why would you do that?

355
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,130
You don't have to pretend

356
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,370
Before your parents.

357
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:35,840
Thank you, Dad.

358
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:46,280
I bet she's hiding something.

359
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,750
No way.

360
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,090
Don't talk nonsense.

361
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,560
So, you're sure the Martian isn't Yen.

362
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:05,140
Is he or is he not?

363
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,210
I'm sure he isn't.

364
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:11,380
Then the only suspect left is

365
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,910
Sheng.

366
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,850
Doesn't he already have a girlfriend?

367
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:20,550
Yeah, right.

368
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:22,350
Hey, wait.

369
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,420
You and Yen pretended to see each other.

370
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,690
Why did you lie even to me?

371
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,290
Whose idea was that?

372
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,900
Yen's.

373
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,030
Of course it was his.

374
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:37,270
Hm.

375
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:38,840
What?

376
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,070
I really wanted to have a girlfriend.

377
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:40,840
Fine.

378
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,740
I must get a girlfriend before graduating
from senior high.

379
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,310
Okay, okay, you're good.

380
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,780
Hey.

381
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,380
How on earth did you persuade Tung?

382
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,090
Beat me in darts and I'll tell you.

383
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,890
Your turn, loser.

384
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,940
Yes.

385
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,610
Shao abandons his buddies when he's got a girlfriend.

386
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,170
So does Young.

387
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,510
It sucks when you're in love.

388
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:21,180
They're together all the time and ignore their friends.

389
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:23,280
How about this?

390
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,820
Let's keep it secret from them.

391
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,920
Play a prank on them.

392
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:29,350
Yes.

393
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,390
Deal?

394
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,220
Deal.

395
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:36,290
My darling Tung.

396
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,230
Please, I beg you.

397
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,430
When you start seeing someone,

398
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:39,800
You must let me know first.

399
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:41,830
You'll get tricked so easily if you're like this.

400
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,000
I'm not that stupid.

401
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,370
I asked him to do something in return.

402
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:46,640
What?

403
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,910
If my mom did take part in
the International Food Festival,

404
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,110
He would eat up all the food

405
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,540
My mom cooked.

406
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,850
But he didn't.

407
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:55,880
That's right.

408
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,910
So, what now?

409
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:57,810
I've had enough.

410
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,080
Good.

411
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,290
I'm off.

412
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:02,990
Bye bye.

413
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,520
Hey, Sheng.

414
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,460
I'm off.

415
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,420
Bye bye.

416
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,300
The novel I threw into the trash can…

417
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,470
Did you pick it up?

418
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,980
You threw it into the trash can.

419
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,210
Why would I pick it up?

420
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,680
Thought you cared about the environment.

421
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,250
It was a book.

422
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,820
How could you just throw it away?

423
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,550
Right.

424
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,790
At least, it should be recycled.

425
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:42,260
Besides, it's a world classic.

426
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:42,930
Hm.

427
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,860
If you don't want it, you could donate it to a school.

428
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:45,700
That's right.

429
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,460
And it'd look good if you put it here.

430
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:50,130
Why did you throw it away?

431
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,880
Thanks.

432
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,420
Thanks, Hua.

433
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,360
Yen caught the bad buy.

434
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,630
A fight broke out between them.

435
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:21,800
Then Yen got my diary back.

436
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,570
Wow.

437
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:24,570
Seriously? Yen did?

438
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:26,240
Yes.

439
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,140
At that moment, I fell in love with him.

440
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,510
Here he is.

441
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,520
Tung.

442
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,450
I need to tell you something.

443
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:41,790
Can we go outside?

444
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,050
Tell me here.

445
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:44,860
Okay.

446
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,720
Tung.

447
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,890
I think it's better we just be friends.

448
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,870
You're breaking up with me?

449
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,230
Mm.

450
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,430
I feel we aren't suitable for each other.

451
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:02,810
Whoa.

452
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,080
Is it hurting a lot?

453
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:11,920
It's fine. I deserve it.

454
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,380
I'm the one who hurt her.

455
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:18,090
So cool.

456
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,600
Hey.

457
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,700
Deliver lunch?

458
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,830
That way, please.

459
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:30,500
Okay, thanks.

460
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,170
Thanks.

461
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,670
You want to have rice or noodles?

462
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,410
Rice.

463
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,210
Then I'll have noodles.

464
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:38,310
We order one each.

465
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:38,810
Sure.

466
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:39,510
You want ice too?

467
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,380
Yes.

468
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:44,350
Told you we broke up.

469
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,650
Stop harassing me.

470
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,080
Young.

471
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:51,790
Get off.

472
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:56,360
Mom, why did you come here?

473
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:58,130
Nothing.

474
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,630
What is this?

475
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,330
No-escape chicken.

476
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:04,570
I made it for you and Tung.

477
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:05,900
You're so nice.

478
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,240
I made it on a whim.

479
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,570
Let go eat with Tung.

480
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:10,110
Yes.

481
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,510
Let's go.

482
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,450
Hey.

483
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,120
So heartless of you to break up like this.

484
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,390
You wanted to break up with me first.

485
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:31,290
Right.

486
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,800
You bullied Tung.

487
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,660
You deserve it.

488
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,530
But you can't hit people.

489
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:36,900
It's just not a right thing to do.

490
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,540
Don't think it's okay for girls to hit boys.

491
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,770
For Christ's sake.

492
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,510
Yen asked Tung to slap him.

493
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,210
Hey, didn't we agree to keep it secret?

494
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,280
No.

495
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,380
Yen only asked Tung to push him hard, okay?

496
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,580
Thought we'd keep it secret?

497
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,010
Yen.

498
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,680
You told people about it too.

499
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,290
I told only Sheng.

500
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,850
I told only Young.

501
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:03,430
Mm, Young told me.

502
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:04,030
Hey.

503
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,460
Grrr.

504
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,330
Okay, okay.

505
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:08,930
So, in the end, everyone knows about it.

506
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:11,740
It's okay. Only we know about it.

507
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,070
Idiot.

508
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,100
Enough.

509
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,070
Let's practice the dance.

510
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,070
Wait.

511
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,310
Listen.

512
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,010
Don't tell others about it.

513
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:21,210
Fine.

514
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,710
Hey, you heard me?

515
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:24,910
I've choreographed it.

516
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,720
It's almost time for the break.

517
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,180
Let's do it next time.

518
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,280
No.

519
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:28,990
I've choreographed it.

520
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:30,850
I even think of practicing on the weekend.

521
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:32,460
I can't. I need to work.

522
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,620
It's not a big deal to take a day off.

523
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,560
You say that cause you don't need to make money.

524
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:39,530
Hey.

525
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,030
Where are you going?

526
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:42,400
I need a pee.

527
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:43,870
You chicken out?

528
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:51,710
Hey.

529
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,880
Does Sheng really need money?

530
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,710
Yeah.

531
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,880
His dad left some medical debts behind.

532
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,180
He and his mom are still paying.

533
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,950
Yes, Young, stop pestering him.

534
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,190
I didn't.

535
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:06,090
Hey, come practice the dance.

536
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,190
Don't waste time, hurry up.

537
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,190
Yes.

538
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:12,660
Yen, come practice the dance. -Okay.

539
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,330
Come on.

540
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:14,400
Back.

541
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,530
Over here.

542
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:16,870
You know how to dance, eh?

543
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,740
Dear Martian,

544
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:26,580
I decide to settle down on Earth.

545
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,050
Thank you for your company during this period.

546
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:31,850
It has made a Mercurian's life on Earth

547
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:34,080
Not too lonely.

548
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,390
This is the last correspondence between us.

549
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:39,760
Keep this diary as a memento.

550
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,930
Hope you've returned to your home planet, Mars.

551
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,390
Or like me,

552
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,800
You have found a planet suitable for settling down.

553
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,690
No matter what happens,

554
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:15,260
I wish you good health

555
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,830
And happiness.

556
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:25,100
Lastly, I pray for peace in the universe.

557
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:54,530
You sure?

558
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:55,500
Yes.

559
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:57,970
Tung.

560
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,870
Why is the art teacher here?

561
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:17,490
Mister.

562
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,690
You didn't tell me

563
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:21,120
If the cookies tasted good or not.

564
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:21,930
Nex door…

565
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:24,430
The art teacher is back?

566
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:25,600
Oh, yes.

567
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,200
When?

568
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,300
How long has he been back?

569
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,730
About two weeks.

570
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,670
Didn't you say he'd gone abroad?

571
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,270
It turns out he didn't.

572
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:37,340
No?

573
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,310
Never?

574
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,480
Actually, I'm not sure.

575
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,350
Oh my God! -You're so useless.

576
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,620
Oh my God!

577
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,420
I won't give you free cookies next time.

578
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,220
Oh my God!

579
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:59,500
Where are you going?

580
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,200
Come back.

581
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:01,730
Let's go.

582
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:02,900
Grrr.

583
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,030
What?

584
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:17,680
Tung.

585
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,000
Sheng.

586
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,870
Next time would you like to introduce us

587
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:43,010
To your girlfriend?

588
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:44,740
I don't have a girlfriend.

589
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,610
Yen.

590
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,050
Yes.

591
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:49,980
Yes, you do.

592
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,710
No.

593
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:52,650
Yes.

594
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:54,380
The one I saw at Hua's restaurant.

595
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,250
The…

596
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,290
The one who played the killer.

597
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:57,790
Which one?

598
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,290
Oh, no, no.

599
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:00,260
The one with blue eyes.

600
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:03,430
Oh, she's just a friend.

601
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:04,590
She's just a friend?

602
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,530
Yes.

603
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:07,300
That's good.

604
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:09,000
Nothing.

605
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,030
Good.

606
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:13,940
You really don't have a girlfriend?

607
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:16,140
I really don’t.

608
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,910
He really doesn't have a girlfriend.

609
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:55,210
Whether it's Romeo or Juliet,

610
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:57,750
They are both very brave.

611
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:58,750
I guess

612
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:01,150
It must be the reason

613
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:03,320
Why they are the protagonists in the story.

614
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:26,040
Is this yours?

615
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,350
Hey.

616
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,510
Is this yours?

617
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,480
Hey.

618
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:03,880
Is this yours?

619
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:06,080
No.

620
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:07,520
You sure?

621
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:08,850
Sure.

622
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,670
Mom, time to get up.

623
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:51,520
What's the test later?

624
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,090
Chinese, I guess.

625
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,390
Miss.

626
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:57,730
You're really too much.

627
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:59,800
You came to the wrong classroom several days in a row.

628
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,270
Because my soul

629
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:04,300
Wants to be with only you.

630
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:05,970
You've lost your mind?

631
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,110
What did I hear?

632
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,240
She said

633
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,710
Her soul wants to be with only me.

634
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,710
So cheesy.

635
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:22,050
You girls are unbearably cheesy.

636
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:24,720
Hey, Tung.

637
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:25,860
If you were a boy,

638
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,320
I bet you'd be so good at flirting with girls.

639
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,660
Seriously?

640
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,430
Yes.

641
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,160
Really?

642
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:32,500
You believe him?

643
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,930
Wow, you Folk Dance Club are so relaxed.

644
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:36,600
The presentation is coming soon.

645
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,940
Still saying cheesy stuff to each other?

646
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:41,440
We Pop Dance Club just finished practicing.

647
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,640
I'm exhausted.

648
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,540
After school, we…

649
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:47,940
What?

650
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:50,010
Good luck.

651
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:55,790
Hey.

652
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:57,990
It's you guys who need good luck.

653
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,420
You wait and see.

654
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,090
I bet you guys will come last.

655
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,430
Practice the dance.

656
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,880
You really want your mom to perform in these dresses?

657
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,410
Yes.

658
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:57,350
They're pretty.

659
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:58,180
She loves it, doesn't she?

660
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,480
Why go to the trouble to do that?

661
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,880
Just ask her to

662
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,320
Teach you guys the dance.

663
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,690
Why must she be on the stage?

664
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,220
No.

665
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:08,560
We Folk Dance Club needs a trump card.

666
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:11,090
You love competing against others, right?

667
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,360
It's not good.

668
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,130
We people…

669
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:17,170
Don't keep competing against others.

670
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,570
You don't want your wife to perform, do you?

671
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,700
No.

672
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:23,670
Because she often takes things too seriously.

673
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:28,710
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

674
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,280
Have you decided?

675
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,180
Yes, this one.

676
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,990
Remember to ask auntie to bring clothes
for me to choose.

677
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,320
Oh

678
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,790
Fine, fine.

679
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,030
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

680
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:44,990
What is she doing?

681
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,660
Losing weight.

682
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:49,700
We just change this bit.

683
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,700
Young, stop making changes.

684
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,770
It's getting more complicated.

685
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,700
No, it's not.

686
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,310
My mom does the first part.

687
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:57,410
We do the middle.

688
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:59,210
Then we all dance together in the past part.

689
00:38:59,210 --> 00:38:59,910
Okay?

690
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,240
It's easy, come on.

691
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:09,320
5, 6, 7, go.

692
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,420
Point, point.

693
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,530
Hey.

694
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,400
5, 6

695
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,380
You two, stop messing around, okay?

696
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,010
We're running out of time and
you're still messing around.

697
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:38,510
Sheng needs to work so we can't practice on the weekend.

698
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:41,050
And you guys keep wasting time.

699
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:44,620
My shoe is broken.

700
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:46,320
You carry on.

701
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,520
Don't let me drag you down.

702
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:49,690
Anyway, it won't be the first time I fail in math.

703
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,760
Hey

704
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,900
Okay.

705
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,600
I'll go apologize to him.

706
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,440
Okay, I'll go get him.

707
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,680
Hey, make sure you come back.

708
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,080
I think Yen is chickening out.

709
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,420
I'll go bring them back.

710
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,180
Hey.

711
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:20,820
Don't you worry.

712
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:21,820
I practiced.

713
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:28,360
Let me show you.

714
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,210
What do you think?

715
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:39,740
Very good.

716
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:44,210
Really?

717
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,480
Yes.

718
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,680
You dance really well.

719
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,390
Eh?

720
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:51,120
Why haven't those three come back yet?

721
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,120
I'll go get them.

722
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:22,380
Oh I

723
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:26,760
oh I

724
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:30,790
You’be mine

725
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:34,560
Don’t keep trying

726
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:39,400
to run away my love just stay just stay

727
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,940
don’t keep runnin away

728
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:43,840
Let me call you "baby"

729
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,940
Let me get drunk, let me

730
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:48,140
Let me fall, let me

731
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:52,010
Burst into tears, be taken aback,
I don't understand myself

732
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,250
Dear Mercurian,

733
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:01,890
Maybe we don't have to force ourselves to be brave.

734
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:03,590
In our own worlds,

735
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:05,560
We're the protagonists.

736
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,130
We don't need any audience.

737
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:08,900
We just relax

738
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,030
And be ourselves.
