1
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,510
Young.

2
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,550
No way.

3
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:23,860
No way.

4
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,470
Dear Martian,

5
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:33,840
from this day on,

6
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,010
Maybe because of you,

7
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:37,380
maybe because of him,

8
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,950
Maybe because it is arranged by the universe,

9
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,820
I, Tung,

10
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,120
will be brave too.

11
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:52,450
(Ep.2 The Martain and Three Jerks )

12
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,150
Hello From Mars.

13
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,229
What's up?

14
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,310
Tung, it must be him.

15
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,510
Okay.

16
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,140
Is it him?

17
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,650
Yes.

18
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,350
You wanted a blue butterfly tattoo.

19
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,350
Apart from me, who else knew about it?

20
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,250
No one.

21
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,820
And he signed as Martian.

22
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,590
It's clearly a response to you being an alien.

23
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,390
Did you say

24
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,360
you're an alien in it?

25
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,870
Tung, you wrote it in the first line.

26
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,000
You're going to date a real adult.

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,840
Why didn't he just hand the diary back to me?

28
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,070
Of course he couldn't.

29
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,940
You're a high school student.

30
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,440
You know before you're 18, you can only be in…

31
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,410
Ar…...Arab…

32
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,079
Platonic.

33
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:56,750
Yes, Platonic love.

34
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,220
Tung is going to fall in love.

35
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,590
Okay.

36
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,990
You found it in the end.

37
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,060
Yeah.

38
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,430
They even left a message, saying "hello" to me.

39
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,200
Tung.

40
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,900
You're going to fall in love?

41
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,070
I'm so moved.

42
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,300
Just a pen pal. Don't exaggerate it.

43
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,010
It is my daughter cooking again.

44
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,010
Hey, you're back.

45
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:25,610
I'm back.

46
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:26,579
Dad, have you eaten yet?

47
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:28,150
Not yet.

48
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,180
Is there anything for me?

49
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,350
Yes, as long as you want to eat.

50
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,620
Of course, I want to eat what my daughter cooks.

51
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,750
Are you sure you cooked it,

52
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,290
not your mom?

53
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,790
Hey, just focus on chatting, okay?

54
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,230
Remember to add…

55
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,090
Black pepper.

56
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,300
I know. You want black pepper in everything.

57
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,070
Would you like to get changed first?

58
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,200
She needs some time to get it ready.

59
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,370
Okay.

60
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,170
I'll go get changed.

61
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:54,370
Let me take a look.

62
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:55,710
No.

63
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,910
Just let me take a look.

64
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,540
No way. -So secretive.

65
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,010
Wait a moment.

66
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,010
Mr. driver.

67
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,280
Hey.

68
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,840
Why are you late again?

69
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,980
Even if your mother is a teacher,
you can't be like this.

70
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,080
You look untidy.

71
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,720
Your socks are mismatched.

72
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,430
Strange,

73
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,870
wasn't he running in the opposite direction?

74
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,730
How come he got in earlier than me?

75
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,510
Hey, is Tung wearing the wrong socks?

76
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,180
Child.

77
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,510
Childish.

78
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,420
Here comes your girlfriend!

79
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,680
Shao.

80
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,550
Though only ten of you sign up for now,

81
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,450
Don't you worry.

82
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,920
I'll do my best to teach you.

83
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,860
Miss, I promise I'll work very hard.

84
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,860
Good, very good.

85
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,330
Next, let's take a look at

86
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,300
the folk dances in different countries.

87
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,480
What is he doing here?

88
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,080
Sleeping.

89
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,620
Must be something to do with Shao.

90
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,930
What happened between him and Shao?

91
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,870
So boring.

92
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:26,580
Okay, in this semester,

93
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,450
We will do the Lithuanian dance.

94
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,380
Thank you all for your participation.

95
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,679
See you next week.

96
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,890
Miss, bye-bye.

97
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:08,820
Why aren't you leaving?

98
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:28,640
Hey, Sheng is still sleeping.

99
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,840
Should we wake him up?

100
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,180
No need, let him sleep till the end of the world.

101
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,580
What's our next class?

102
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,250
Chinese.

103
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:40,750
Chinese is my favorite.

104
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,880
Class dismissed.

105
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,190
I don't want to.

106
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,630
Please.

107
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,030
No.

108
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,360
This competition is really important to Shao.

109
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,430
Let's go cheer him on.

110
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,470
Give him as much support as he needs.

111
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,170
I don't know Shao well.

112
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,570
And I know nothing about taekwondo.

113
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,270
Back then…

114
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,810
I didn't even want a tattoo.

115
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:40,880
Why would I?

116
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,880
I can't bear any pain.

117
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,250
But because you're my best friend.

118
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,850
When my best friend wants to do something,

119
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,180
Even if I don't want to do it,

120
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,850
I'll still do it for her

121
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,160
Because that's what best friends do.

122
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,160
Fine.

123
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,830
I'll go with you, okay?

124
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:55,890
Okay.

125
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,190
But we'll get tattooed first.

126
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,030
Hey, you wanna avoid it again?

127
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,070
No.

128
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:01,730
Okay, let's do it.

129
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:02,200
You promise.

130
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,200
I swear.

131
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,800
This is my seat.

132
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,740
Can't I sit in it for a minute?

133
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,540
You can sit in my seat.

134
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,090
I'm going back to class.

135
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:30,490
Bye.

136
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,850
Sheng.

137
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,460
You want to carry on sleeping?

138
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,300
Are you sick or something?

139
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,360
No, I'm not.

140
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,070
Hey, let's get back to our seats.

141
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,600
Everyone, let's start the class.

142
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,870
Open your textbooks.

143
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,940
Why are you standing?

144
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,010
Sit down.

145
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,020
(On an unexpected trip abroad)

146
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,530
(Return date undecided. Sorry)

147
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,330
What a pity!

148
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,970
Finally, we're getting our tattoos done.

149
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,240
Who can run a business like this?

150
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,870
Went abroad with no notice.

151
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:48,210
The owner is too much.

152
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,940
Hey,

153
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,580
I'm sorry.

154
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,280
We'll have to come back another day.

155
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,180
Come on.

156
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,550
Let's go play badminton.

157
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,720
Stop running,

158
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,320
Young.

159
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,930
Dear Martian,

160
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:11,300
My good friend is looking more and more beautiful.

161
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,760
I guess it's because she is in love.

162
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,870
The sweet expression on her face

163
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,800
Is probably the taste of youth.

164
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,040
Stop running.

165
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,670
Come over here.

166
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,550
Everyone, stop whining.

167
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,790
Okay, last time I asked you to

168
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,050
divide into groups of four.

169
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,150
How did it go?

170
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,160
No more than four in a group.

171
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,590
Anyone who isn't in a group yet?

172
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,630
Raise your hand.

173
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,830
Anyone wants Tung to

174
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:48,170
join your group?

175
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,130
I can form a group of one.

176
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,200
Although I said four in each group,

177
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,570
four in each group,

178
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,710
there can be two or three in a group,

179
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,370
okay?

180
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,070
Anyone?

181
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,510
Anyone would like to help her? Raise your hand.

182
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,650
I don't need it.

183
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:06,720
Thank you, Sheng.

184
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,520
Mister, I really can be on my own.

185
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,420
No, you can't do it alone.

186
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,590
Okay, that's it.

187
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,590
Go prepare it after class.

188
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,930
You must hand it in next week.

189
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,400
Okay,

190
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,400
let's carry on.

191
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,200

192
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,730
So annoying.

193
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,660
Why am I not allowed to do it by myself?

194
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,700
I'm not a stray dog.

195
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,330
I don't need to be rescued.

196
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,970
He just tried to help you.

197
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:00,910
Help his ass.

198
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,740
He even took my pencil case.

199
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,040
It was robbery.

200
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,010
Why didn't you ask it back?

201
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,650
I didn't want to talk to him.

202
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,480
Regarding that history assignment,
I'll just wait and see.

203
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,550
Don't expect me to do it alone.

204
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,120
I heard he repeated a year.

205
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,060
Yen said he's a gangster.

206
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,960
Yes, he's a gangster.

207
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,430
But I'm not afraid of him.

208
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,730
Yen also said

209
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,670
he was in the same junior high as Shao.

210
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,700
Sheng was a year above Shao.

211
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,370
They were in the same school team.

212
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,700
Later, Sheng joined a gang.

213
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,870
He often skipped classes.

214
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,310
Shao was very worried about him.

215
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,010
Shao wanted to help Sheng leave the gang

216
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:40,180
But nearly got himself beaten up.

217
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,420
You know so much that you can write Shao's biography.

218
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,620
No way!

219
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,820
Yes, you can.

220
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,490
Isn't it a little bit ugly?

221
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,800
Just a little bit?

222
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,330
Is it very ugly?

223
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,130
I didn't say that.

224
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,440
Oh no, what should I do?

225
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:23,490
Dear God of Love and Marriage,

226
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:27,290
I, Young,

227
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,860
am sincerely praying for your blessing

228
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:32,060
that Shao and I will be together.

229
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,830
Please bless Shao to win the competition too.

230
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:41,040
Although I seem to be mocking this girl a lot,

231
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,770
I have never told her

232
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,910
I think she is very brave.

233
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,480
I wish I could be like her.

234
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,720
I wish I had a pair of wings.

235
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:58,360
So I could fly such a long distance

236
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,520
To reach the unknown planet.

237
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:02,990
There,

238
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,859
you will see me and

239
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:06,060
I can walk to you.

240
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:08,400
There,

241
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,740
love is like a firework display.

242
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,470
Bright enough to light up the lonely world.

243
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:18,040
Oh God, I'm begging you.

244
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,010
Please help me be brave.

245
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,510
Please give me a pair of beautiful wings.

246
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,020
Dear Mercurian,

247
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,190
Actually,

248
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:32,160
I think the taste of youth

249
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,960
is often a bit sour

250
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,990
and a bit bitter.

251
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:39,430
Whenever I feel life is too bitter,

252
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,430
I go to this store.

253
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,070
Blueberry chocolate ice cream is my favorite.

254
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:46,700
If you have a chance,

255
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,110
try it out.

256
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,240
Thank you.

257
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,340
Miss, what would you like?

258
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,150
Yes, two cups of almond.

259
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,510
Okey, two cups of almond.

260
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,550
Can you get me two cups of almond?

261
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,920
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

262
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,620
Thank you. Be careful.

263
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,560
Mister, what would you like?

264
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,260
One chocolate.

265
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,690
One chocolate, okay, no problem.

266
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,460
Pay with cash or mobile payment?

267
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,130
Mobile payment.

268
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,400
Okay, let me scan it.

269
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,160
Okay.

270
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,330
Please wait a moment.

271
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,200
Mister, you cut in line.

272
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,440
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

273
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,610
Thank you.

274
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,640
Excuse me, you cut in line.

275
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,910
Yeah, mister, please.

276
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:30,210
I want three big boxes of chocolate.

277
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,550
Boxes?

278
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,590
Don't you sell it in boxes?

279
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,060
Yes, we do. Please wait a moment.

280
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,630
Excuse me, you cut in line.

281
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,330
You cut in line,

282
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,370
cut in line.

283
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:49,800
I heard you.

284
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,970
What's making you so impatient?

285
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,140
Are you rushing home for the funeral?

286
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,840
Can't you see everyone is queuing?

287
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,210
Anyone objects to me?

288
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,270
Dammit.

289
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,280
What?

290
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:59,540
Excuse me.

291
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:00,880
Mister.

292
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,050
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

293
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:03,710
Damn you.

294
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,020
Kiddo.

295
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,850
Here is two thousand. Keep the change.

296
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:07,650
I appreciate it.

297
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,820
Thank you.

298
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,490
What are you whining about?

299
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:13,190
What?

300
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,360
What are you staring at?

301
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:16,760
What the fuck?

302
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,960
Let's talk outside.

303
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,170
Hey, that's mine.

304
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:24,740
Who the fuck are you?

305
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,340
Hi there, what would you like?

306
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,010
I want a blueberry chocolate.

307
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:35,980
Single scoop. -One cups of  blueberry chocolate.

308
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,920
Okay, please wait a moment.

309
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:46,960
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

310
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,260
Thank you.

311
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,160
Here is one hundred.

312
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,930
Excuse me, I'll have one pineapple chocolate too.

313
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:55,930
Single scoop.

314
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,700
Alright, one single scoop of pineapple chocolate.

315
00:19:58,570 --> 00:19:59,200
Okay, here is one hundred.

316
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,170
Thank you.

317
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,550
Thanks.

318
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:16,450
You're welcome.

319
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,620
It's okay.

320
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,150
You've been writing to each other for a month.

321
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:48,420
You're still in Ah…...Ah…...

322
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,150
You mean Platonic, right?

323
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:50,850
Yes.

324
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,060
How long will you keep waiting?

325
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,590
Don't you want to learn painting too?

326
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,730
No, not really.

327
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:57,330
It doesn't matter.

328
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,430
Just think about it.

329
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,560
Going out with a teacher!

330
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,130
How exciting!

331
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:01,900
You just want to laugh at me.

332
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,600
What a lovely misunderstanding!

333
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,180
When did it happen?

334
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:22,720
A few days ago.

335
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,490
What about the art teacher?

336
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:25,620
The one with long hair.

337
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,390
Oh, Qing.

338
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,260
He went abroad.

339
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,660
Went abroad?

340
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,830
When did he leave?

341
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,600
About two weeks ago.

342
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:42,970
Tung.

343
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,110
For the past two weeks,

344
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:46,210
Who have you been writing to as a pen pal?

345
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,380
It's been more than two weeks.

346
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:52,120
So the Martian isn't the art teacher.

347
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,250
Then who is the Martian?

348
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,590
Blueberry chocolate ice cream is my favorite.

349
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,390
Thank you.

350
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,860
Give it a try if you have a chance.

351
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,600
What?

352
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,000
Nothing.

353
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,730
Who the Martian is doesn't matter.

354
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,070
It does.

355
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,340
It doesn't.

356
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,200
It does.

357
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,240
It doesn't.

358
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,010
It does.

359
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:16,110
It doesn't.

360
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,310
It doesn't… It does.

361
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,810
Hey, you two should at least order a drink.

362
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,110
What do you take my café for?

363
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,250
I'm writing it down.

364
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,750
Didn't order any drinks again.

365
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,660
Let me take a look.

366
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,160
Wow, it's well written.

367
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,830
There are even illustrations.

368
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,860
I allowed you more time.

369
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:40,730
It's worth it.

370
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,100
Wait a minute.

371
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,600
There's still one group that hasn't submitted yet.

372
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:48,610
It's three weeks overdue.

373
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:50,110
Who's that?

374
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,280
Ah, Tung.

375
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,850
Tung.

376
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,510
Where is the report of your group?

377
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,280
Tung,

378
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,180
where is your report?

379
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,920
Why do you always ask me?

380
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,490
Sheng, where is your report?

381
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,430
You continue working on the report after school.

382
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:13,000
Don't leave until it's finished.

383
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,370
I'll be waiting for your report in the office.

384
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,900
Let's work together.

385
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,730
Okay,

386
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,940
let's carry on.

387
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,370
Hey, Young.

388
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:23,540
Do you girls love boys rescuing you?

389
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:27,010
Is the Martian one of you?

390
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,880
Young.

391
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:30,950
What?

392
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,380
I have a great idea and

393
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,420
you must help me.

394
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,820
Why should I be bothered?

395
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,650
Please, don't be like this.

396
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,430
Or shall we three have a secret meeting?

397
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:45,260
Which three?

398
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:48,060
With Shao.

399
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,770
It can't be done without him.

400
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,500
Come on,

401
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,610
Come on, get your phone.

402
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:56,610
Let's start a group chat.

403
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:07,620
Wow, your phone is so old.

404
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,590
Fine, join the group on mine.

405
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,750
Can't you help me carry these?

406
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,020
They're not too heavy for you.

407
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:57,960
I'm running late.

408
00:25:58,530 --> 00:25:59,230
I'll leave it to you.

409
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,070
Dear Martian,

410
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:47,380
I really don't understand that guy named Sheng.

411
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,180
He doesn't seem to be so annoying.

412
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,880
But sometimes he really annoys me.

413
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,020
What do you think?

414
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,390
Is he a friend or an enemy?

415
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,600
Why is there only a drawing?

416
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,370
How about the question I asked?

417
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:16,510
Why didn't he answer me?

418
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:18,740
What's up?

419
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,310
What did you ask?

420
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,920
Never mind, let's talk outside.

421
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,320
Hey, this is the last time, okay?

422
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,660
If you don't order anything next time,

423
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,330
I won't let you leave your stuff in here.

424
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:50,070
Ah, I knew my question was too vague.

425
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:52,340
That message and picture earlier…

426
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,140
It's nothing.

427
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:54,840
Young. Tung.

428
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,950
What a coincidence to run into you guys!

429
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,050
Yen.

430
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,150
We're on a date.

431
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:59,150
Leave us alone.

432
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,390
Yen, hurry up!

433
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:04,620
Help us catch him, quick!

434
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:05,620
Leave it to me, muah.

435
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,090
Yen, hurry up!

436
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,060
Help us get it back, quick!

437
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,300
That's my diary!

438
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:25,840
Didn't I tell you not to run so fast?

439
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,080
Sorry.

440
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,680
I got carried away.

441
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,910
How much longer till she catches up with us?

442
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,150
I'll go check.

443
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:36,620
Not yet.

444
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,560
Hey, let's rehearse.

445
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,420
Oh, sure.

446
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,260
I'll throw three punches.

447
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:42,830
One.

448
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:43,730
Two.

449
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,470
Never do something like this again.

450
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:55,310
Tung.

451
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,770
Here's your notebook.

452
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,580
Oh, thank you.

453
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,440
That's it.

454
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,110
Do you think she'll fall for me?

455
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:01,780
She definitely will.

456
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,510
Tung.

457
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,650
Here we are, Tung.

458
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,650
Yen, be careful.

459
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,950
Tung.

460
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:10,490
Hurry up.

461
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,160
Come here, Tung.

462
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:12,820
Over here.

463
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:16,160
Quick!

464
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:18,730
Hey, we're just pretending.

465
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,700
Just kidding.

466
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,040
You two are so ridiculous.

467
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,770
What are you playing at?

468
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:29,870
Rescue the damsel in distress.

469
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,180
He wants to pursue Tung.

470
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:46,660
Yen.

471
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:49,060
Who pursues a girl like that?

472
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,230
And you, Shao.

473
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,460
How could you collude with Yen?

474
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,600
Tung, let's go.

475
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:07,210
What has this got to do with me?

476
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:18,720
Are you okay?

477
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,090
I'm okay.

478
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,260
Really?

479
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,000
The taekwondo competition is coming up next week.

480
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,330
I'm really okay.

481
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,230
My face hurts more.

482
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,700
Sorry.

483
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,740
Taekwondo competition next week?

484
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:37,470
Yeah.

485
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:38,710
What?

486
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,340
You care about me?

487
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,110
Who cares about you?

488
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:46,880
Excuse me.

489
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:54,360
What are you smirking at?

490
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,230
Isn't it nice like this?

491
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,030
We're all friends.

492
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,060
Hey, but Sheng…

493
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,100
How come you're so strong?

494
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:02,930
He's not that strong.

495
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:04,330
No, I'm not.

496
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:05,240
It's just that he sucks.

497
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:05,970
Sir.

498
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:07,340
It's called "ambush", okay?

499
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,810
Don't call me "sir" anymore.

500
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,370
Hey, Sheng.

501
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:12,740
Why did you drop out when you were in 9th grade?

502
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,310
Both Shao and I are curious about it.

503
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,250
Don't drag me into it.

504
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,920
My dad got sick at that time.

505
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:23,820
He needed someone to take care of him.

506
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,020
Oh, is he alright now?

507
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:29,890
He's dead.

508
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,410
What?

509
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,270
The cap makes you look so ugly.

510
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,310
My hair is too soft.

511
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,280
Give it back to me.

512
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:51,110
Give it back.

513
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,920
He's so vain.

514
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:55,890
He has always been.

515
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:57,190
Shut up.

516
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,390
We end up like this

517
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,320
cos you wanna pursue a girl.

518
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,530
I'm sorry.

519
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,830
Wait for me.

520
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,390
Tung,

521
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,120
I'm sorry.

522
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,060
It had nothing to do with you.

523
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,160
I told you.

524
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,000
High school boys are all idiots.

525
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
They're all annoying.

526
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,170
It's driving me crazy.

527
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,270
It's all because of me.

528
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,840
It has nothing to do with you.

529
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:57,910
Shao, Sheng and Yen.

530
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:59,150
They three are all the same.

531
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,990
From on now, they're my enemies.

532
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:13,700
I know you like Shao.

533
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,370
I won't stop you seeing him

534
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:22,840
just because of this.

535
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,670
Really?

536
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,710
I hate those who force people to take sides.

537
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:33,050
I will never do something like that.

538
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,690
I'm very rational, you know.

539
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:40,720
Then what about next week?

540
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,460
Will you come with me to cheer him on?

541
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,730
Hey!

542
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:51,030
On the house.

543
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,300
Thank you.

544
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:13,659
Will you come with me?

545
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,400
Here, this spot.

546
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,400
You didn't twist it today.

547
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,770
It must have been a while?

548
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:34,239
I, Young, like Shao.

549
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:45,820
At that time, I didn't feel much pain.

550
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,760
I don't know why it's getting worse.

551
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,659
By the way, doctor, please don't tell my coach.

552
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:51,630
The competition is coming up.

553
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:53,429
You should be careful.

554
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,000
Painful, eh?

555
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:58,940
You deserve it.

556
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,180
The sun is shining outside the window

557
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,720
A new day is waiting

558
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,820
I'm facing the beauty of the unknown

559
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,720
Maybe I'm scared but it's alright

560
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,590
will be fine

561
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,620
Don't worry about being right or wrong

562
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,660
Follow your expectation

563
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,730
Even if you'll fall

564
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:25,860
Why?

565
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,000
So many why, why, why

566
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,070
So much confusion is left after summer

567
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:31,200
The world is too big, too many question marks taken down

568
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,700
How to solve them or leave them to time?

569
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,470
Don't reveal the answers in a hurry

570
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:41,640
How about breaking the structure,
folding before flipping it?

571
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,780
So many why, why, why

572
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,750
No need to guess

573
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:49,890

00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,320

Love with all your heart, don't wait

577
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,660
why why why

578
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,800
No need to guess

579
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,970
we gonn fly fly fly to the sky go high

580
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:08,910
who am I I I

581
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:11,110
No need to guess

582
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:13,040
Say hi, hi, hi

583
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,440
Love with all your heart

584
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:30,830
Hey, where are you going?

585
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:32,130
My phone is broken. I need to get it repaired.

586
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,300
What?

587
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:37,600
Just eat.

588
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,740
Hey, tell me.

589
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,010
Aren't you going to watch what's-his-name...

590
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:50,650
…Shao play and cheer him on?

591
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:54,120
What has his game got to do with me?

592
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,860
Be honest with me.

593
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:05,030
You don't want

594
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:08,230
Young to have a boyfriend, do you?

595
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,940
Tung, spider.

596
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,140
There, quick, quick!

597
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:18,410
On the wall.

598
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:20,140
It's just a spider.

599
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:20,880
Kill it,

600
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,280
it's disgusting.

601
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:25,680
It catches small bugs for you.

602
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,980
I don't care what bugs it catches.

603
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,020
Take it outside and throw it away.

604
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,420
It's so cruel to kill it.

605
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:30,850
Take it outside and throw it away.

606
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:31,320
Fine.

607
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,150
What's wrong?

608
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:33,620
Your mom? Again?

609
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:34,520
Yeah.

610
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,360
Luckily, it's not a cockroach.

611
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:37,860
Take it away.

612
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,260
Okay.

613
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:42,130
Dad,

614
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:44,030
how long will you stay this time?

615
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:45,470
Two…

616
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:48,900
One or two months.

617
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,940
Your company is too much.

618
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,940
Always sends you on business trips.

619
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:02,920
My lady.

620
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:05,960
So scared?

621
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,690
If you're so scared, go sleep with Tung.

622
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:11,160
Okay.

623
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,560
Ew, so disgusting.

624
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,310
How much did it cost to repair the phone?

625
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:29,710
That's not the point, okay?

626
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:32,480
The phone is so old that I should get a new one.

627
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,720
It'll take two days to repair it.

628
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,120
What am I supposed to do tomorrow?

629
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,290
I've been telling you I need a new phone.

630
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:38,290
But you never listen.

631
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:39,260
Oh well.

632
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:41,520
You'll be fine without a phone for a day.

633
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,430
No way.

634
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:44,190
Tomorrow is an important day to me

635
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,800
I have to go cheer…

636
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,530
…a friend on in the competition.

637
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:48,960
What will I do without a phone?

638
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:50,600
You can borrow mine.

639
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,470
Don't lend it to her.

640
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,640
If you keep whining, you won't be allowed out tomorrow.

641
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:02,450
It won't hurt to get the kid a new phone.

642
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:05,650
I've my own way of bringing up my kid.

643
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:07,780
You never support me

644
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,120
but undermine me all the time.

645
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,690
Why should a kid need a phone?

646
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:12,820
Okay, okay, I'll go wash the dishes.

647
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,760
You forgot this one!

648
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,070
Where are you going?

649
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,440
Shopping.

650
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,940
With whom?

651
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:37,180
With my girls.

652
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,580
You're just going shopping.

653
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,650
Why are you putting on makeup?

654
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,390
I want to look good.

655
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:46,690
You have tomorrow off. Why are you going today?

656
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,290
I'll be the only one working when it gets busy later.

657
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:52,500
You have a daughter.

658
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:54,660
You can ask her to help you.

659
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,770
You know very well

660
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:57,630
I've promised her that she can go out today.

661
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:59,740
Who told you to promise her?

662
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,440
So, you're trying to get back at me, huh?

663
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,210
Nonsense.

664
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:06,340
I just want to go out and look around.

665
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:09,380
Alright, alright, go ahead.

666
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,880
I can do everything by myself.

667
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,420
Honey.

668
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:20,690
Do I look beautiful?

669
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:26,800
Ah.

670
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,300
I'm going shopping.

671
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,100
So happy!

672
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,680
Hey you guys.

673
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,080
Did you get my message?

674
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:46,180
The schedule is changed in the last minute.

675
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,480
Shao is starting soon.

676
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,320
Hurry up, you all!

677
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,650
Hurry up!

678
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,400
Go! Go!

679
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,740
Why are you so late?

680
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:45,880
The competition has started.

681
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,940
I left work unexpectedly.

682
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,040
It took time to find someone to stand in.

683
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:48,980
How's it going?

684
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,050
Just started.

685
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:00,760
Can he still play?

686
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:02,120
Medics!

687
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:05,390
I knew his foot hasn't healed yet.

688
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:06,400
Are you okay?

689
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:15,000
I think he shouldn't force himself.

690
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,270
Just let his opponent win.

691
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:19,710
Okay?

692
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:20,810
Impossible.

693
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:22,080
He never surrenders himself.

694
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:52,070
Damn, he still wants to carry on?

695
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,780
He'll ruin his leg.

696
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:16,100
Come on.

697
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,350
Shao.

698
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,650
Shao.

699
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:35,150
Shao.

700
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:10,650
Win.

701
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,090
Young.

702
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:22,560
Young.

703
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,370
Is it over?

704
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:32,980
Okay.

705
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:34,180
You finished the game.

706
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,350
Relax.

707
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:38,180
Take a good rest.

708
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,270
Shao.

709
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,640
Are you okay?

710
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:07,640
Is your foot hurting badly?

711
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:12,350
I'm sorry.

712
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:15,880
I was going to come half an hour earlier.

713
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,320
But my phone got broken yesterday.

714
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,520
I didn't know your game was moved forward.

715
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:23,830
I'm sorry.

716
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,030
It's my fault that you lost the game.

717
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:28,200
I'm sorry.

718
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:33,600
Look, I had

719
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:35,940
Prepared this.

720
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:36,840
This.

721
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,610
And this.

722
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:39,510
As well as this.

723
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:40,580
And this.

724
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:43,180
But all has gone to waste.

725
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:44,710
I'm sorry.

726
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:47,380
Is your foot still hurting badly?

727
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:48,950
Are you okay?

728
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:50,350
Are you in a lot of pain?

729
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:51,920
I'm sorry.

730
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,290
Tung said

731
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:54,820
this is very ugly.

732
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,020
But

733
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:58,460
But I tried my best.

734
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:00,000
I'm sorry.

735
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:11,710
Are you okay?
