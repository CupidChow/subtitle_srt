1
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:11,980
Only my boyfriend

2
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,750
Is allowed to kiss me.

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:17,720
Okay.

4
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,780
So, I'm going out with her.

5
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:43,520
What?

6
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:44,920
But…

7
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,150
He hasn't kissed you yet.

8
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:47,690
Right.

9
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:48,950
So, it doesn't count as "going out", does it?

10
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,220
No.

11
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,220
So, shall I formally ask her to go out with me?

12
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,660
Damn, it sounds so old-fashioned.

13
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:54,190
No.

14
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:54,960
Tell you what.

15
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:56,490
Now all girls fancy

16
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,330
An earnest guy like that.

17
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:59,600
Really?

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,770
This is so funny.

19
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,400
Or how did you pursue girls before?

20
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,940
I'd just say "yes".

21
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:04,970
Then we start going out.

22
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,110
Now what should I do?

23
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:08,610
Don't think too much.

24
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,039
Wait for him to ask you out.

25
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,780
That's right.

26
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,450
Besides I've declared my feelings for him.

27
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:14,910
I definitely can't ask him to go out with me first.

28
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,350
Go out without going on a date first?

29
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,580
You're right.

30
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,390
I'll go out with him only after being on a date.

31
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,950
Even when he asks me to go on a date,

32
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,250
I won't say yes straightway.

33
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:23,890
Young.

34
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:24,920
Would you like to go to the movies tonight?

35
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,420
Yes.

36
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,960
Yes, let's all go together.

37
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,660
Don't play gooseberry.

38
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:30,730
It's okay.

39
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:31,430
Let's go together.

40
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:33,530
I'm busy. You guys go without me.

41
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,400
What should we see?

42
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,670
Dear Martian,

43
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,240
At first, I wanted to know who you were.

44
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,650
But now I don't care about it anymore.

45
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:51,020
As for the ice cream parlor you mentioned,

46
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,979
I went again and bought a different flavor.

47
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,050
Pineapple dark chocolate.

48
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:58,120
It tastes like Young and me.

49
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,520
She's pineapple.

50
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,060
I'm dark chocolate.

51
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,730
One is super sweet.

52
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,960
The other is too bitter.

53
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,200
The strange thing is

54
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,200
The combination

55
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,030
Tastes quite nice.

56
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,940
(Ep.3  Blueberry Chocolate Ice Cream)

57
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:47,910
Fifty?

58
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,410
Seriously?

59
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,780
I thought you were in your early forties.

60
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,579
No.

61
00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:54,810
I'm really fifty.

62
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,810
You look very young for your age.

63
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:57,180
No.

64
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,020
You go to the gym, don't you?

65
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,790
I've no time for that.

66
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,860
But when I was young, I loved playing sports.

67
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,960
Well, I've no time for exercising either.

68
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,690
And we women

69
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:09,830
Age a lot quicker.

70
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,130
No way.

71
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,700
You're very young.

72
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,900
Are you thirty-five yet?

73
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,670
I'm already forty.

74
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,270
Seriously?

75
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,170
Beauty.

76
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:21,310
A great beauty.

77
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,680
You're so sweet.

78
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,910
What's your zodiac sign?

79
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,110
Have water.

80
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,350
Thanks.

81
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,520
Virgo.

82
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,790
Enjoy the food.

83
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,800
Since when did we start

84
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,130
serving water?

85
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,270
From now on.

86
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,570
What are you doing here?

87
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,240
Go chat.

88
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,280
No.

89
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,040
Let me keep you company.

90
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,250
No need.

91
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,280
I need no one.

92
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:03,820
Yes, you do. -Check, please.

93
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:06,950
Darling.

94
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:09,450
Check?

95
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,290
It's 140.

96
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,120
Yes.

97
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,990
200 received.

98
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,330
Whoa!

99
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,400
Taro balls.

100
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:26,540
Hey.

101
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,409
So stingy.

102
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,880
Take it back.

103
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,950
It's got your spit on it.

104
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:35,650
Hooray.

105
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,490
I didn't put it in my mouth.

106
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,450
It got the spit from your chopsticks.

107
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,890
Then what would you do when you kiss?

108
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,130
That's different, okay?

109
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,570
Why did you get a taro ball?

110
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:55,970
Can I have it?

111
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:57,970
Sure.

112
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:58,740
Thanks.

113
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,940
Young.

114
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,040
Taro balls are Shao's favorite.

115
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,450
It's the last one.

116
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:08,780
And now you're having it.

117
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:11,920
I'm sorry.

118
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:15,890
It's okay. You have it.

119
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,620
It's okay. You have it.

120
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,460
It's fine.

121
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,560
You have it, I mean it.

122
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,190
One bite is enough for me.

123
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,860
I'm sorry.

124
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,400
Okay.

125
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,830
I'll have it.

126
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:29,930
Don't you want to join them?

127
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,400
No.

128
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,970
You're really a loner.

129
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:34,870
Mind your own business.

130
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,750
Don't you love taro balls?

131
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,350
Why don't you eat it?

132
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,690
Oh.

133
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:55,190
I love it so much that

134
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,090
I'm saving it till the last.

135
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,670
Hey, why

136
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,340
Didn't Tung come for lunch today?

137
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,740
Yeah.

138
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,140
That's right.

139
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,750
Poor you, poor you.

140
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:21,850
Since you've got a girlfriend,

141
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,860
You must have each other's spit.

142
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:25,490
It feels so disgusting.

143
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,190
If you keep talking,

144
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:28,730
I'll spit on you.

145
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,630
Don't be like this.

146
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,430
I wanna exchange spit with a girl too.

147
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,870
Stop talking about spit.

148
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,240
Hey, Shao.

149
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,440
You had better let your girlfriend
know about your quirk.

150
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,610
Why are you forcing yourself?

151
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,040
I'm not forcing myself.

152
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:43,670
Argh.

153
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,010
You can't have your buddy's spit

154
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,810
but your girlfriend's is fine?

155
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,110
If you keep talking…

156
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:48,909
Oi.

157
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,110
Stop splashing.

158
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,350
It's got wet.

159
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,090
Right, Sheng.

160
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:58,960
Have you had girlfriends?

161
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,790
Yes.

162
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,790
I told you.

163
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,300
How many?

164
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,700
Whoa, you need to think?

165
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,840
How many? Be honest.

166
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,700
I'm not sure if some of them counted.

167
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,670
Counted?

168
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,110
You're indeed a love rat.

169
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,780
How many?

170
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,440
Three, three.

171
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,410
Three

172
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,180
So cocky, eh?

173
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,720
Hey.

174
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,620
Cool.

175
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,050
Yep, I'm cocky, so what?

176
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,820
I don't think so.

177
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,490
They just hang out with each other.

178
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,020
Yes.

179
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,030
I bet it's like that.

180
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,100
Hey, Young.

181
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,900
What's going on between you and Shao?

182
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:41,870
Just like that.

183
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:43,670
Like how?

184
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,200
Like what?

185
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,240
Shao's relationship status on Facebook is single.

186
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:50,780
It's true.

187
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,510
It's true that he's single.

188
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,840
He's rarely on Facebook.

189
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,850
So, he hasn't updated it yet.

190
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,180
In fact, we've been together for a week.

191
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,620
A week.

192
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,980
Hey, Yen.

193
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,020
Are Young and Shao

194
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,220
really together?

195
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,720
Why don't you believe me?

196
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,220
Why would I make it up?

197
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,390
Am I so shameless?

198
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:08,690
So, Yen.

199
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,460
Young and Shao are really together?

200
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:12,860
I guess so.

201
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,330
What do you mean "guess so"?

202
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:15,170
Yes, we are.

203
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,440
Don't drag me into it.

204
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,900
Young.

205
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,670
So embarrassing that you keep emphasizing it.

206
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:21,910
I'm not emphasizing it.

207
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,270
Besides, it's not embarrassing at all.

208
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:24,180
It is, a bit.

209
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,380
Yen.

210
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,140
Okay.

211
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,450
Everyone.

212
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:28,910
Young and Shao

213
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:29,610
Are together.

214
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:31,650
Yes.

215
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:32,980
But it's not stated on Facebook.

216
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:04,550
You want some water?

217
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,290
What's wrong?

218
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,400
Do you think we're boyfriend and girlfriend?

219
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,030
Yes, or what else?

220
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,330
Then would you change your status?

221
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,870
What status?

222
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,570
Are you single?

223
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:28,210
Or not?

224
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,540
Oh, okay. Let me change it right now.

225
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,240
Wait a second.

226
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:38,680
It's done.

227
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,890
When do you think we started going out?

228
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:44,920
Any difference?

229
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,320
Yes.

230
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:49,830
Then today.

231
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,560
Give it to me.

232
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,980
You want to set the anniversary?

233
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:32,740
Yes.

234
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,500
I saw her.

235
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,040
So pretty.

236
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:40,510
And she's still single.

237
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,580
How old is she? And still not married?

238
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,020
I bet there is something wrong with her.

239
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,650
A woman like that

240
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:46,920
Is the most dangerous.

241
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:49,420
They always seduce the married men.

242
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,620
Yeah, right.

243
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,290
Hey, hey.

244
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,290
So strange.

245
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,030
Why aren't you talking in Vietnamese?

246
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:57,960
Why?

247
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,730
I'm home.

248
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,000
Dad.

249
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,700
Thank you for your hard work.

250
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,240
Mom.

251
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,840
Thank you too.

252
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,210
Aunties.

253
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,110
Thank you too.

254
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:11,710
I'm off to my room.

255
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,310
Bye bye.

256
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,250
It's really not easy for Young.

257
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,620
Her studies at senior high are very demanding.

258
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,950
But she's still so cheerful.

259
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,890
I bet she doesn't study at all.

260
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,190
Back to work.

261
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,230
She never likes studying.

262
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,900
Don't know who she takes after.

263
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,430
Right.

264
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,800
Don't know who she takes after.

265
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:41,040
Off you go.

266
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,110
Morning, everyone.

267
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,390
Shao is rarely on Facebook.

268
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,160
But he values our relationship so much

269
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,060
that he voluntarily changed his status.

270
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,160
You forced him to do so, didn't you?

271
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,230
No, I didn't.

272
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,030
He wanted to do it himself.

273
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,100
Good.

274
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,830
You gave up the Pop Dance Club for him.

275
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,440
I'd feel pity for you if he turned you down.

276
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,240
I feel pity for you.

277
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,370
I didn't give up the Pop Dance Club for him.

278
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,310
Yen begged me to join him.

279
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:18,910
Yen.

280
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,180
Yes, Chia-Ying.

281
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,380
Don't look down on the Folk Dance Club, okay?

282
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,850
We have a cultural mission.

283
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,220
Dance is

284
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,750
All about looking good.

285
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,660
We look good too.

286
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,090
Who has seen the folk dance performance?

287
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:37,930
No one.

288
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:38,760
Why not?

289
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,900
Because no one wants to see it.

290
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,870
It's easy for everyone to see us.

291
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:44,140
Let's all perform at the end-of-year
presentation if you dare.

292
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,670
We Folk Dance Club will do better than
you Pop Dance Club.

293
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,040
Good, let's wait and see.

294
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,310
Good, you wait and see.

295
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,610
I don't want to.

296
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,480
I don't want to.

297
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,020
I don't want to.

298
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,390
Tung.

299
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,790
I don't want to.

300
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,030
I don't want to.

301
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,430
Babe.

302
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,760
Hey, Sheng.

303
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,430
Young has got me into big trouble.

304
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,330
What happened?

305
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:14,870
Young.

306
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,170
Help me! It's so scary.

307
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,030
It's not just folk dance.

308
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,900
It's international folk dance.

309
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,000
Are you sure you can do it?

310
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,010
Yeah, right, Young.

311
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,610
Don't drag us into

312
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:24,610
Your fight against the Pop Dance Club.

313
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,410
Right, Tung?

314
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,810
It makes no difference to me.

315
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,710
Yes, it makes no difference to me either.

316
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,820
The presentation isn't a big deal.

317
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,350
For Tung,

318
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,190
I'm willing to do anything.

319
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,660
Don't call me Tung.

320
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,630
I'm willing to do anything for Tung.

321
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,030
Don't do it for me.

322
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:46,900
Okay.

323
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,300
I'll do it for everyone.

324
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,700
And you?

325
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,900
Me too.

326
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,640
Hooray!

327
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,610
Where is Sheng?

328
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:01,810
Hey.

329
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:06,350
He's run away, Young.

330
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,290
Forget it.

331
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:09,720
We'll be fine without him.

332
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,890
Why just us?

333
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,860
Where are the others?

334
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,530
Shao is in a relationship.

335
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:17,630
So, all his fans left the club.

336
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:20,500
That's why pop idols keep their relationships secret.

337
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,630
He's not a pop idol.

338
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:27,910
Everyone.

339
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:29,570
Miss Chiu had a car accident.

340
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,040
Is she alright?

341
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,710
Luckily, her life isn't in danger.

342
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:35,580
But she'll have to stay in the hospital for a while.

343
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,380
So, as for the Folk Dance Club,

344
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,080
She decides to

345
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,720
Ask me to stand in for her.

346
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,690
What does that mean?

347
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,490
And I heard it just now.

348
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,960
You volunteer to perform
at the end-of-year presentation.

349
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:47,760
Who is the president of the club?

350
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:51,530
Me.

351
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:52,430
Very good.

352
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:53,660
Chiu…

353
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,400
Miss Chiu will be very moved.

354
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,440
You all happen to be in my math class.

355
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,010
Whoever doesn't perform

356
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,740
At the presentation

357
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,410
Will fail in math.

358
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,380
I'll leave it to you.

359
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,020
Good luck!

360
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,090
Did he really say that?

361
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:21,430
He threatens us with our grades in math?

362
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,500
Mom, please.

363
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,500
No.

364
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,600
Can you stop messing around?

365
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:36,610
Dad.

366
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:37,570
Don't ask me.

367
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,110
Mom, please teach us the dance.

368
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,310
Dancing is my forte.

369
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:42,950
I could be beaten at anything

370
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:43,910
But dance.

371
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,080
For Christ's sake.

372
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,790
Don't assume I can do Vietnamese dance

373
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,050
Just because I'm Vietnamese.

374
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,990
I've promised my friends.

375
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,990
You won't bail me out?

376
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,730
Well, it was such a pity

377
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:56,790
You didn't get to see

378
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,030
How beautiful your mom looked

379
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:00,530
When she was in the traditional Vietnamese dress

380
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:01,970
At that time.

381
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,640
The battery is dying.

382
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,580
Dad.

383
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,340
You think you're the only one who wants a new phone?

384
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,380
My phone is very old too.

385
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,880
The battery goes dead after a game of mahjong.

386
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,290
Dad.

387
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:30,260
Does it mean Mom has agreed?

388
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,130
Ask her.

389
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,700
Mom.

390
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,170
Does this mean you've agreed to me?

391
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,510
Dad, look at Mom.

392
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,650
Mom.

393
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,620
Why are you ignoring me?

394
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:58,890
Since you're ignoring me, I take it as a yes.

395
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,069
Dad.

396
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,740
Darling.

397
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,869
Are you my wife?

398
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,170
Wow.

399
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,880
I didn't recognize you just now.

400
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:20,079
I'm so surprised.

401
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,150
You've become so beautiful.

402
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,079
Okay.

403
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,680
I'll help you with it.

404
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,550
Don't take it off.

405
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,820
Wear it when you go to bed tonight.

406
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,860
I haven't seen you looking so pretty for ages.

407
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,130
Gross.

408
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:37,860
I miss it.

409
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,230
I miss it so much.

410
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,330
Miss…

411
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,470
She looked younger back then.

412
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,410
Let me take the trash out.

413
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,450
Hello.

414
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,190
Really?

415
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,260
Oh my God.

416
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,000
No…no.

417
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,760
I got it.

418
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,430
Call me if anything happens.

419
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,200
What's up?

420
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,240
Auntie Yu-Tsui wants to get divorced.

421
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,710
Hey, where is your dad?

422
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,440
He took the trash out.

423
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:29,810
Weird…

424
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,950
He rarely took the trash out before.

425
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,420
He's been acting strange recently.

426
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,780
Hooray!

427
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,480
Bravo!

428
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,580
Then…

429
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:09,490
This…

430
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,020
No. 4.

431
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,460
No. 4 is bit difficult.

432
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:15,530
So out of the way.

433
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,230
Hit this point.

434
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,850
Yes!

435
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,620
Good. I'm going to the ladies.

436
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,290
Okay.

437
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:41,990
Thanks.

438
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:57,700
Anyone in it?

439
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,620
Excuse me.

440
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,890
You say the door is jammed?

441
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,090
Yes.

442
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:19,190
I thought no one was in it.

443
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,690
So, I knocked and pulled.

444
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:21,860
But I couldn't open it.

445
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,430
So, I think maybe the lock is broken.

446
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,600
Please fix it.

447
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,500
Oh, yes.

448
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,200
Please wait outside for a minute.

449
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,730
Yes. -I'll ask someone to fix it.

450
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:29,630
Oh, thanks. -No problem.

451
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:30,470
I'll be quick.

452
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:31,030
Sheng.

453
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,770
Come on.

454
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,270
The door is jammed.

455
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,310
It was fine yesterday, wasn't it?

456
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:41,980
Hey.

457
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,280
Sheng.

458
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,280
What are you doing?

459
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,020
Sheng.

460
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,290
I suddenly have a stomachache.

461
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:52,520
You suddenly have a stomachache?

462
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,290
It's urgent.

463
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,120
Urgent?

464
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:54,760
Mm.

465
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,890
Why didn't you tell me just now?

466
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,690
Not only you but the customer needs it urgently.

467
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:58,800
Break it.

468
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,900
Crazy.

469
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:02,270
I'm sorry.

470
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:05,070
What are you doing?

471
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,640
My mom is outside.

472
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:08,740
Oh.

473
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:10,840
What?

474
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,710
Go check what she is doing for me.

475
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:13,910
I don't know your mom.

476
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,710
That woman who came in just now.

477
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,320
Oh. -Quick.

478
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,620
You should have told me earlier.

479
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,720
Why are you avoiding your mom?

480
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,090
Mind your own business.

481
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:30,060
You're asking me for help.

482
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,560
I'm not asking you.

483
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:32,360
No?

484
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,300
No? Forget it then.

485
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:33,930
Hey.

486
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,030
Please.

487
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:37,830
Come on.

488
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:38,940
Please.

489
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,440
Say "Thank you".

490
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:41,770
Thank you.

491
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:43,770
Good girl.

492
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:44,810
Damn you.

493
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,750
They do very nice ice cream.

494
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:58,590
Here you are.

495
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:59,520
Thanks.

496
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,900
What flavor are you having?

497
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,540
Blueberry chocolate.

498
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,300
It sounds so weird.

499
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:13,970
No, it doesn't.

500
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:15,240
It's my favorite.

501
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,280
Swap.

502
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,510
What?

503
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:23,250
I don't like the sour taste.

504
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:24,980
Swap.

505
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,930
What do you think? Good?

506
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,160
What flavor did you say it was?

507
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,500
Blueberry chocolate.

508
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,400
It tastes so weird.

509
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,070
I don't like it.

510
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,270
I want it back.

511
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:54,850
It's me.

512
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,790
What?

513
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,220
Your dad looks so young.

514
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:08,590
What are they doing?

515
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,490
What did you see?

516
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:11,230
They're playing billiards.

517
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:12,660
That's it?

518
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:13,860
Yes.

519
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,410
I need to go back to work.

520
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:23,010
He's not my dad.

521
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,440
Don't think too much.

522
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,610
They're just playing billiards.

523
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,010
Hm.

524
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,380
Get out.

525
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:34,820
Go say hello to them.

526
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:37,420
Aren't you very sassy?

527
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:38,690
What are you afraid of?

528
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,120
I'm not afraid.

529
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:41,890
You get out first.

530
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:42,990
I'll follow you.

531
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,460
Okay.

532
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,440
Ah.

533
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,440
Almost.

534
00:23:59,110 --> 00:23:59,880
Damn.

535
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,480
What a pity.

536
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,150
How about hitting this one?

537
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,580
Ah.

538
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,080
Again, nearly got it.

539
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:08,820
I'm sorry.

540
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,820
We're closing.

541
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,490
Closing?

542
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:13,820
Thought you were open till midnight?

543
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,460
I'm sorry. We're closing early tonight.

544
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,560
I'm sorry.

545
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,040
Thank you.

546
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,540
Thank you for paying. -Thank you.

547
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,370
Next time give me a chance

548
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:29,370
I insist.

549
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:30,510
I know, I know.

550
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,010
Bye bye.

551
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:32,210
Bye.

552
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,920
Would you like to explain yourself?

553
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:41,490
There is another in the restroom.

554
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:46,590
It's me.

555
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:03,640
Finish it before you leave.

556
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,180
Sheng's treat.

557
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,210
Enjoy it.

558
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,380
I didn't ask you for a treat.

559
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,480
It's not my treat.

560
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,690
Stop it.

561
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:25,560
I'm going back to work.

562
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,180
(Princess Dance:Is the ice cream that Martians like... )

563
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,830
Your call will be switched to the voicemail.

564
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:38,440
Dad.

565
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,240
What's up?

566
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:41,870
Nothing.

567
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:44,870
Hello?

568
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:48,140
Just want to know when you're coming home.

569
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,910
I'm still in a meeting in the office.

570
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:50,980
Where is your mom?

571
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,480
Why did you suddenly call me?

572
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,220
Nothing.

573
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:59,090
Well, no…

574
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:00,120
Wait a second.

575
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,260
Go back to work then.

576
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,070
Shall I give you a ride home?

577
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:37,890
Are you alright?

578
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,500
This helmet is so ugly.

579
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:43,830
It's just a spare.

580
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,770
Sometimes my mom needs it.

581
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:48,470
Why are you explaining so much?

582
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,240
You soiled my diary last time.

583
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:52,940
Now we're even.

584
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,440
I won't blame you.

585
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:56,950
Bye bye.

586
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,620
You shouldn't blame me anyway.

587
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,500
You're home.

588
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,470
Didn't we agree you'd be home by midnight?

589
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:23,640
Why are you so late?

590
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,710
Because I'm your kid.

591
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,110
No one in the family wants to come home.

592
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,010
Nonsense.

593
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:30,180
What do you mean by that?

594
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:33,220
I fell asleep on the sofa while waiting up for you.

595
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:33,980
Argh.

596
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:34,580
Hey.

597
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,020
It's a school night.

598
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,420
Have a shower and go to bed.

599
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:42,630
If you can't get up tomorrow morning,

600
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:43,790
I won't help you.

601
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:45,660
Mom.

602
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,230
What's up?

603
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:51,740
Nothing.

604
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,010
What's wrong with you?

605
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:04,680
You tell me first.

606
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,820
You first.

607
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,220
Well…

608
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,290
Who on earth

609
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,260
Do you think is the Martian?

610
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:16,660
I've told you.

611
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:19,600
I no longer want to find out who the Martian is.

612
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,160
But didn't you say

613
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,630
Those three were the most suspicious?

614
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,330
You're worried it might be Shao?

615
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:26,170
No.

616
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:27,000
It's impossible.

617
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,740
I'm just thinking whether

618
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,340
It's Yen or Sheng.

619
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,780
Would you like to ask them directly?

620
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:34,610
No.

621
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,980
Suit yourself.

622
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:38,110
Right.

623
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,380
What did you want to say?

624
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:43,220
Er…

625
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,620
That tattoo artist is back.

626
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:46,660
Oh.

627
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,460
What?

628
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,690
You don't want to get a tattoo anymore?

629
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:52,060
Yes, of course I do.

630
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,200
Text me the time.

631
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,230
Is this what you wanted to say?

632
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,670
No, my mom… -Young.

633
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,170
Here you are.

634
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,780
Just now you… -I finished it.

635
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,820
Enjoy the meal.

636
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:12,780
Still so much left.

637
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,020
Tung, you waste a lot of food.

638
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:23,990
Did I disrupt you guys?

639
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,660
No, you didn't.

640
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,460
Then why did she look sullen?

641
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:29,800
She's always like that.

642
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,700
Don't call her Tung.

643
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,940
She doesn't like it.

644
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:37,610
Besides you don't know each other well.

645
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:39,110
Oh.

646
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,140
I thought we knew each other well enough.

647
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:43,450
Oh yeah?

648
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:00,330
Then he…

649
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:02,070
I remember once he's so funny that…

650
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:02,770
Babe.

651
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:26,160
Dear Martian,

652
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,890
How are you recently?

653
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,430
I feel I'm not very happy recently.

654
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:33,160
Earth seems to suit me less and less.

655
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:37,200
The world has changed without me knowing.

656
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,640
I fail to catch up with the speed it spins at.

657
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,610
So, slowly, I drift into the outer space.

658
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:46,180
But I still don't know where my home planet Mercury is.

659
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,850
Dear Mercurian,

660
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:52,080
Haven't you ever thought

661
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,850
How the different species

662
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:55,790
On different planets communicate with each other?

663
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,020
But…

664
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:00,690
If you've drifted into the outer space,

665
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:02,760
Your voice won't be heard.

666
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,370
Shall I send a spaceship to rescue you?

667
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:50,870
Hey,

668
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:51,770
last time

669
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:55,210
where is the ice cream parlor the Martian likes?

670
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,210
So terrible…

671
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:02,850
That one near the school.

672
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:10,390
Which flavor did he recommend?

673
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,160
Blueberry chocolate.

674
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:25,480
Well…

675
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,510
It's normal for men to cheat on their wives.

676
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:31,150
Since he has apologized to you…

677
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,520
Okay, okay.

678
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,850
Don't be so impulsive.

679
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,250
What's up?

680
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,160
Nothing.

681
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,490
I'll recommend it to my mom.

682
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,230
Don't be upset.

683
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,070
Bye bye.

684
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:53,170
I've got more than enough on my plate.

685
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,340
Whose husband is cheating on her?

686
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:58,980
Auntie Yu-Tsui's or who else?

687
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,250
Is it really normal for men to cheat on their wives?

688
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,920
Of course not.

689
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,790
But if I didn't say that, how could I comfort her?

690
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:21,530
The garbage van is gone.

691
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:22,530
Why isn't Dad back yet?

692
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:24,429
Yeah, right.

693
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:25,739
I'll go check.

694
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,980
Yu-Ming.

695
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:44,389
You're smoking in secret.

696
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:47,460
What are you doing here?

697
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,630
Your mom sent you to spy on me?

698
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:50,960
No.

699
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:53,100
She thought you came to meet your lover.

700
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:57,970
Recently, we met a new neighbor.

701
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,370
She's very pretty.

702
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:00,470
Your mom is jealous.

703
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,540
It's fine.

704
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,310
Let her be jealous.

705
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:05,170
Sometimes women should be treated like this.

706
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,210
So, we'll have fun in our lives.

707
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:09,210
Dad.

708
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:10,580
Do men always cheat on their wives?

709
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,420
Of course not.

710
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,020
Well, don't be like your mom, so suspicious.

711
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,720
Men will feel exhausted if you're like that.

712
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,890
When you have a boyfriend,

713
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:19,820
You'll argue with each other a lot.

714
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,290
So…

715
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,690
When you like someone,

716
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:25,090
You have to trust them.

717
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:25,630
Right?

718
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:26,700
Of course.

719
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:29,130
Tell your mom that on my behalf.

720
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,270
Why drag me into it?

721
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,430
Hey.

722
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,400
Don't tell your mom I smoke.

723
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,040
Okay.

724
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:38,370
Get me a new phone.

725
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:42,850
Fine, fine.

726
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,150
When?

727
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:46,320
Give me some time.

728
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,920
A phone costs up to 30,000.

729
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,050
It's very expensive.

730
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:50,750
I don't have that much egg money.

731
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:51,890
Liar.

732
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:52,990
Don't you know your dad is poor?

733
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,530
Off you go.

734
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:56,290
You go back first.

735
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,300
Yeah, I got a mobile phone.

736
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:06,500
Hey, how was it?

737
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,670
Nothing.

738
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:08,440
He's not having an affair.

739
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,040
How did you know?

740
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,380
What did you see?

741
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,040
I saw nothing at all.

742
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,510
You didn't see your dad?

743
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,250
Where has he gone?

744
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:20,220
Great, I knew it.

745
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,180
Hey, Mom.

746
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,220
Wait.

747
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,750
He was just chatting to a friend.

748
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:26,960
You said you didn't see anything.

749
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,230
It must be that woman.

750
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,390
Right?

751
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,000
What the hell are they doing?

752
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,600
They were just chatting.

753
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,930
Chatting?

754
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:38,370
Why are they chatting behind my back?

755
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,970
He wants to surprise you.

756
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,110
He…

757
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,170
He wants to give you a present.

758
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,910
So he asked the auntie for advice.

759
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:50,880
Is it true?

760
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,280
Your dad remember it?

761
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:56,690
Remember what?

762
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:00,960
It's our wedding anniversary tomorrow.

763
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,760
You know what present he is giving me?

764
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,460
Well, Mom, stop asking.

765
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,830
Or it won't be a surprise.

766
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:11,600
Remember to teach me the dance.

767
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,000
Okay, fine.

768
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,340
So annoying.

769
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,350
Recently,

770
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:29,590
You seem to have become prettier.

771
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:31,320
Have I?

772
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:37,990
Dad comes home so late every day.

773
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,000
Don't you mind?

774
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:44,270
No.

775
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:45,670
He needs to work.

776
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:49,770
I'm worried he might be up to something.

777
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,210
He doesn't dare.

778
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:55,110
You forgot you ran away from home when you were 12?

779
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,410
You scared us to death.

780
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:00,550
I was the one who got scared to death.

781
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,520
Of course I know that.

782
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:11,160
We were all scared to death.

783
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,240
(Young, don't forget it tomorrow.)

784
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:44,260
Hey.

785
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,230
How about this?

786
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,000
Will this do?

787
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,260
It's a hair clip.

788
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,030
Hair clip?

789
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:50,870
And this?

790
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:51,930
For massaging your face.

791
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:53,140
Women love massaging their faces.

792
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:55,000
No, it's mine.

793
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,670
Then find me something, quick.

794
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,810
Or your mom will find me absent.

795
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:02,950
She won't wake up in the middle of the night.

796
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:04,550
Don't you know she goes to the bathroom so often?

797
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:07,020
Why don't you get one yourself?

798
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:09,220
We've been married for more than ten years.

799
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,850
I never remember our wedding anniversary.

800
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:13,320
You deserve it.

801
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,660
Besides things like this…

802
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:16,090
Once you've done it, you'll have to do it again.

803
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:17,660
I give her a present this year.

804
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:18,760
I'll have to give her another next year.

805
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:19,800
What should I do in the future?

806
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,460
You really got me into big trouble.

807
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:22,870
Hurry up.

808
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:23,400
Okay.

809
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,070
This will do.

810
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,030
Don't forget to wrap it up.

811
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,710
Remember, don't make things up again.

812
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,240
Shut the door.

813
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,360
Darling.

814
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:24,830
Happy wedding anniversary.

815
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:26,930
Wow.

816
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:28,460
I can't believe you remember it.

817
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:32,300
We've been married for ages. No need to get a present.

818
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:45,820
Isn't it the birthday present

819
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,680
I gave Young last year?

820
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:50,120
Such a coincidence!

821
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,420
It proves.

822
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,660
we have the same taste.

823
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,760
This is what "fate" means.

824
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,490
Fate.

825
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,830
Liar.

826
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:00,530
Darling.

827
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,230
It's fate.

828
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,200
Fate.

829
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:06,400
I thought you didn't like it?

830
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:08,440
I decided to like it.

831
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,340
Now does it taste nice?

832
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:12,310
Yes.

833
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:15,640
No wonder people say girls are changeable.

834
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,680
Shall we swap?

835
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,620
It's fine if you don't want to.

836
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:24,790
Just asking.

837
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,360
Okay, let's swap.

838
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:37,770
Does it taste nice?

839
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,600
Everything tastes nice when I'm with you.

840
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,610
Let's come again.

841
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:46,010
Still so many flavors we haven't tried.

842
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:47,180
Lazy.

843
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,980
We came here last week and this week.

844
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,510
And next week too?

845
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,850
Haven't you got any other ideas?

846
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,650
What do you mean last week?

847
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,520
It was the week before the last.

848
00:41:58,090 --> 00:41:59,690
We've been together for 23 days.

849
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:00,720
I've been keeping count of it.

850
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:02,490
The week before the last?

851
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:04,790
I know.

852
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,960
Time flies faster when you're with me.

853
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:08,430
Well…

854
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:10,200
The tattoo artist is back.

855
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,270
Text me the time.

856
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:13,640
It's been two weeks?

857
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:15,200
Yes.

858
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:38,990
Dear Martian,

859
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,900
Do you like watching movies?

860
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,430
In the movies,

861
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:46,070
What scares you the most?

862
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:48,400
I've never been scared of horrors,

863
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,810
Ghost movies or thrillers since I was little.

864
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:52,740
What scares me the most are sci-fi movies.

865
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:57,050
Especially when I see the tether

866
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:59,180
Attached to the astronaut breaks.

867
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,980
Slowly,

868
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:04,020
The astronaut floats alone in the space,

869
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:07,490
Further and further away from the spaceship.

870
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:09,690
Excuse me!

871
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:11,390
Excuse me, open the door!

872
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:14,960
How about calling Tung first?

873
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,400
Don't be so worried.

874
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,800
You don't understand.

875
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:21,740
Excuse me!

876
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:39,460
Tung.

877
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,260
Tung.

878
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,040
Tung.

879
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:01,310
Tung.

880
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:25,430
Tung.

881
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,140
Tung.

882
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,240
Please don't be angry, okay?

883
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,170
I did go to the tattoo parlor that day.

884
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:34,140
I didn't expect it to close so early.

885
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:36,310
Stop being angry.

886
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:38,310
Or let's make another appointment.

887
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:39,150
See what time suits you.

888
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:40,420
I'm fine with it.

889
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,660
You already got it?

890
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:48,190
And it's a caterpillar.

891
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:49,930
Didn't we agree on a butterfly?

892
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:51,530
What's wrong with a caterpillar?

893
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:53,700
If you're serious about apologizing,

894
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,530
Go have a caterpillar tattoo.

895
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:57,030
Don't be like this, okay?

896
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:58,670
You can't change your mind once it's tattooed.

897
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:00,200
This is what I want. -Tung.

898
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,640
Let's go eat something, alright?

899
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:02,470
Go, go.

900
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:05,610
Yen.

901
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:07,640
Stop pursuing me.

902
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,080
It's Shao who I fancy.

903
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:18,390
Then…

904
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:19,790
Like this, I cut off

905
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:22,520
The only connection between me and Earth.

906
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,560
It's dark in the universe.

907
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:27,730
Dear Martian,

908
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:30,230
Now, apart from you,

909
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:31,930
I have nothing else.
