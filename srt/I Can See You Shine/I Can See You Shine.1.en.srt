1
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,230
(Young,)

2
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:59,530
(Be my girlfriend!)

3
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,270
(By Shao.)

4
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,550
Young.

5
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:22,550
Young, what are you smiling at?

6
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,760
Let me sleep for a little longer.

7
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,560
Are you dreaming?

8
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,500
Leave me alone.

9
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,330
It's six o'clock and you're still sleeping.

10
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,600
Don't be late on the first day of a new semester.

11
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,200
Get up.

12
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,940
Come on, get up.

13
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:45,240
You're a big girl and still can't get up on time.

14
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,150
I can't understand!

15
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:52,080
Alright, I'm getting up.

16
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,789
Don't keep your mom waiting.

17
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,650
Mister.

18
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,590
This is my first day in 11th grade.

19
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,960
Soon

20
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,360
Young's fate and mine will
head into different directions.

21
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,800
But to tell the whole story,

22
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,970
We have to start with the beginning.

23
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,030
Yesterday afternoon,

24
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,170
the day before a new semester started.

25
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,100
(Ep.1 The Missing Diary Diary)

26
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,200
Ma'am, please wait a minute.

27
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,570
Thank you, ma'am.

28
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,740
Hello girls.

29
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,440
What would you like? Take a look first.

30
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,220
Here's your meal.

31
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,620
Thank you.

32
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:36,920
Bye.

33
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,490
Thank you, bye.

34
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,900
How are your husbands doing?

35
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,400
Gosh, he's so lazy that he never helps.

36
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,570
My husband doesn't either.

37
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:53,170
He just talks on the phone all day.

38
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:54,940
I said it before.

39
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,180
Taiwanese men marry us and

40
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,280
treat us like their maids.

41
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,650
Yeah.

42
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,820
Ｍy husband is the same.

43
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:07,850
He can't even remember my birthday.

44
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,860
March 7th.

45
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,160
Pisces.

46
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,760
What about our wedding anniversary?

47
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:21,730
Mr. and Mrs. Chang.

48
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,430
Tung, Young is upstairs.

49
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,270
Young, Tung has come to see you.

50
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,670
Honey.

51
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,610
Why don't you answer me?

52
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,170
Chang You-Ming.

53
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:43,450
Rock, paper, scissors.

54
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,390
This is unbelievable.

55
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,820
We're about to break the record.

56
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,730
Pink.

57
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:57,540
Fine, pink.

58
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,640
Pink.

59
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,170
This time you've really made up your mind?

60
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,210
Yes.

61
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,710
Yes?

62
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:03,710
Yes.

63
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,340
I warn you, this is the last time.

64
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,250
Don't change your mind again.

65
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,210
You've fooled me many times.

66
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,320
It won't happen again.

67
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,280
It wasn't me who changed their mind last time.

68
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,920
We've really made up our mind.

69
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,360
Fine, wait here.

70
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,460
I'll be back soon.

71
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,909
You still prefer blue, don't you?

72
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:39,740
Don't mind me,
as long as you don't regret your decision.

73
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,580
Yeah and pink is the color of love.

74
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,120
We'll be in 11th grade.
We must get ourselves a boyfriend.

75
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,790
I don't want a boyfriend.

76
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,390
Come on, what about your…

77
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,560
Does it hurt a lot?

78
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,600
Be gentle.

79
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,970
Young.

80
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,570
Young.

81
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,210
Young.

82
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,540
Young.

83
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,980
Okay, don't be angry.

84
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,050
Give me a little more time.

85
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,920
I haven't prepared myself for it yet.

86
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,850
What do you mean "a little more"?

87
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,160
Over the whole summer vacation,

88
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,490
We even couldn't decide on the color and pattern.

89
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,790
Finally, we are here.

90
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:32,760
Please, don't be angry.

91
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:36,570
For you.

92
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,710
Didn't you say you finished the old one?

93
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,740
Yesterday, I bought it just for you.

94
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,550
I know you don't like anything too fancy.

95
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,680
So, I picked this for you.

96
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,990
It took me ages to choose it.

97
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,490
What do you think? Do you like it?

98
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,690
Fine, I'll give you a little more time.

99
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,030
Cool, then I'm going home.

100
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,130
Or my mom will say I never help her in summer vacation.

101
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,740
It's the last day. Does it count?

102
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,070
Cos I spent the whole summer vacation with you.

103
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,770
Very busy.

104
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,780
Fine, it's all my fault.

105
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:23,680
Dear Martian,

106
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,650
My best friend, Young,

107
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,890
Gave me a new diary.

108
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:31,490
It's about our summer vacation.

109
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,659
Also, a token of our friendship.

110
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,230
Although we'll be in different classes in 11th grade,

111
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,300
This diary will connect us

112
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,260
with each other.

113
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:54,150
Who drinks coffee after fighting?

114
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,450
We have no choice. Sheng doesn't drink during the day.

115
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,250
No, I don't want to drink.

116
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,120
Is it alright?

117
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,390
Yeah, sure.

118
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,090
Sit. Sit.

119
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:13,600
Well.

120
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,170
Don't come to me again for something like this.

121
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:16,200
I've promised my mom.

122
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:19,070
I know, Mrs. Gu is the boss.

123
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,440
Today we owe you one.

124
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,010
Why haven't you ordered yet?

125
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,850
Stop staring.

126
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:28,980
What the hell are you staring at?

127
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,310
I'm not looking at you.

128
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:37,890
Are you Shao?

129
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,220
Shao?

130
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,690
The guy who got beaten up?

131
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,860
Don't talk nonsense. He wasn't beaten up.

132
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,330
Really?

133
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:46,360
No.

134
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,330
His good friend took a beating for him.

135
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,370
But they're not good friends anymore.

136
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:51,840
Right, Sheng?

137
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,100
So boring.

138
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,610
Mister.

139
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,150
Iced latte, same as usual?

140
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,180
Hmm, thank you.

141
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,180
Okay.

142
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,660
August 31st. Sunny.

143
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,900
Since I was little…

144
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,830
I've been treated like an alien and mocked.

145
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,130
I told you to stop staring.

146
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:01,070
Sometimes, I wish I can be invisible.

147
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,070
I told you, I'm not looking at you.

148
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,140
Often I feel tired talking to people.

149
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,080
Hey, Shao finally spoke.

150
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,550
God no, I don't want…

151
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,980
Don't think Sheng will take a beating for you this time.

152
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:11,750
No one would expect…

153
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,080
Quiet!

154
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,420
This isn't your living room.

155
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,920
Can you have some respect for others?

156
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,460
Can you lower your voices?

157
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,060
But you're the loudest.

158
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:33,970
What are you staring at?

159
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,640
Forget it.

160
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,210
Or what do you want?

161
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,450
I'm so sorry. I really didn't mean it.

162
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,580
What should I do?

163
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,950
You stop!

164
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,760
Hello?

165
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,290
Tung.

166
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:55,590
What's wrong with you?

167
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,060
What should I do?

168
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,560
Where are you? I'll come see you.

169
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,440
Tung.

170
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,620
Shao has a girlfriend.

171
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:21,990
Tung.

172
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,990
Well.

173
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,800
I'm just kidding.

174
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:36,130
You're not helping me.

175
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,540
What do you mean?

176
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,040
I ran all the way here.

177
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,710
I thought something serious happened to you.

178
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:44,340
Can't believe it's just for that guy, Shao.

179
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,480
But I'm really upset.

180
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,250
This is ridiculous.

181
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,920
You aren't even in a relationship.

182
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,880
He doesn't even know you.

183
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,890
And all high school boys are idiots.

184
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,060
You're an idiot.

185
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:58,960
Fine.

186
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,890
I'm an idiot.

187
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:05,030
I'm an idiot who came all the way
to see you, another idiot.

188
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,330
Don't you think I don't know

189
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,430
You fancy that art teacher.

190
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,710
Has your skirt got shorter?

191
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,080
Yes, I altered it.

192
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,550
Don't tell my mom.

193
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,750
Shao has already got a girlfriend.

194
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,320
Who else do you want to seduce?

195
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,520
Everyone.

196
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,190
You're so honest.

197
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:34,090
Really honest.

198
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:36,660
Stop pulling my hair.

199
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,770
School starts tomorrow.

200
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,540
And we'll be in different classes.

201
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,600
Will you miss me?

202
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,570
Are you feeling lonely and cold?

203
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,280
You're making it sound like we're breaking up.

204
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:55,680
I'm going home now.

205
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,080
Eh, wait a minute.

206
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,280
What?

207
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:02,820
Are you too shy to admit that you miss me?

208
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,620
You're so sweet.

209
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,690
Bye bye.

210
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,290
Don't go.

211
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:08,560
I wanna go home.

212
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,530
Come on, stay with me.

213
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:11,260
Stop it!

214
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,900
Are they alright?

215
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,270
It's okay.

216
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,570
Just leave them alone.

217
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:23,070
Excuse me, I'd like to order.

218
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,410
Oh, okay, coming.

219
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:49,900
Young.

220
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,940
Don't look at your phone all day.

221
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,640
It's bad for your eyes.

222
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,910
Fine.

223
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,010
Mom.

224
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,280
My phone is so old.

225
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,380
Can you buy me a new one?

226
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,310
I've told you before.

227
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,480
Have you ever listened?

228
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,450
Hey, the pear is so sweet.

229
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:06,550
Where did you get it from?

230
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,060
Tung, my parents are fighting.

231
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,060
We're not fighting.

232
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:17,730
What?

233
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:18,360
What's wrong?

234
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,260
Okay, calm down.

235
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,770
Dad, give me a ride.

236
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,370
Quick.

237
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,240
Mister.

238
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,810
Mister.

239
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:39,350
Mister.

240
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,320
Is it closed?

241
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,690
What should I do? You gave it to me only today.

242
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,020
We've been friends for ages and

243
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,620
you never gave me any gifts.

244
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,630
Finally, it was the first.

245
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,430
Why are you saying that?

246
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,930
You never gave me anything either.

247
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,760
There's our photo inside.

248
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,830
And also...

249
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,240
What else?

250
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,170
Nothing.

251
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,510
But it's closed.

252
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,710
What could be so important that you lost?

253
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,680
It's nothing, Mr. Chang.

254
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,120
Sorry for bothering you.

255
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,380
No problem.

256
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,590
I might get told off by my wife, that's all.

257
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:15,450
I'm sorry.

258
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:17,620
I'll call Mrs. Chang and explain.

259
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,860
No need.

260
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,920
What could she do to me?

261
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,930
Dad.

262
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,860
Please don't contradict yourself, okay?

263
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,900
Please go home.

264
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,260
I'll call a cab and go home by myself.

265
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,730
No way.

266
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,530
It's very late and you're a young girl.

267
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,740
I will wait with you.

268
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,770
Make sure you get in the cab.

269
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:37,470
Dad.

270
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:39,940
Can't you go over there?

271
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,750
We can't discuss our secrets if you're so close.

272
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:45,480
Hey, you begged me to give you a ride earlier.

273
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,820
Now you're treating me like a burden.

274
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,920
I feel pity for myself.

275
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,520
Right.

276
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,590
Thanks, Dad.

277
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,290
What on earth did you write in it?

278
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,490
I'm back.

279
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,490
Why did you come back so late?

280
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,730
Tung, I'm so hungry.

281
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,060
Didn't you eat anything?

282
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,200
I did, just a little bit.

283
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,500
But you know?

284
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,970
You get hungry after drinking.

285
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:44,510
It's so late. Didn't you know I'd worry about you?

286
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,080
Hey, it was the college reunion.

287
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,450
Only once a year.

288
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,860
Wow, what is it?

289
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:59,860
Congee.

290
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,790
Finish it soon.

291
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:06,200
Take a shower and go to bed early.

292
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,599
Don't be late for the first day of a new semester.

293
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,270
I don't want to go to work.

294
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:15,210
I don't want to go to school either.

295
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:16,839
Oh, really?

296
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:20,310
I'll support whatever decision you make.

297
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,450
But I can't do that.

298
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,349
Because I'm your teacher.

299
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:24,780
Hello Miss.

300
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:45,540
Good morning.

301
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,650
Mister.

302
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,960
I'll be late.

303
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,770
Tung, you're really late.

304
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,640
It's almost time for the first class.

305
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,910
Are you coming or not?

306
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,240
Okay, everybody, put your phones away.

307
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,310
Hurry up.

308
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,780
Young, don't use your phone in the class.

309
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,220
I don't.

310
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,220
Hand over your phone, Young.

311
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,350
Okay, fine.

312
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,230
Such bad luck.

313
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:49,000
Can't believe we're in the same class again this year.

314
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,030
You don't want to be in the same class with me.

315
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,740
You'd better quit the Pop Dance Club too.

316
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,770
Just wait and see.

317
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:54,710
I'll be the Pop Dance Club President this year.

318
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:57,010
Come on, the online voting has begun on Instagram.

319
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,640
Currently, I have the most votes.

320
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,210
Alright, you two, stop chatting.

321
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,680
Who wanna chat with her?

322
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,750
Next, we'll select class officers.

323
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:10,520
Before we start,

324
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,820
There is something I need to tell you.

325
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,530
This year I set up the International

326
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:19,000
Folk Dance Club again.

327
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,570
I hope you will join me.

328
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,240
Miss, I'll be the first to sign up.

329
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:34,850
Very good. Anyone else interested?

330
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:38,080
Well, if you're interested,

331
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,180
Come to me after class.

332
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,460
You look so familiar.

333
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:49,930
What?

334
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,760
You and Shao are buddies, aren't you?

335
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,430
Yeah. So?

336
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:57,970
Nothing.

337
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:58,740
Let's talk after class.

338
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,410
So our activities coordinator for this semester is

339
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,480
Yao-Fan.

340
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,680
Quiet, we're still in class. Sit down.

341
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,530
Sorry, I'm late.

342
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:22,530
Tung.

343
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,290
You're late on the first day of a new semester.

344
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,630
Your mother will be embarrassed.

345
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,460
You know?

346
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,900
My mom is my mom and I am I.

347
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,600
You even talk back.

348
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,040
Hand over your phone first.

349
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,670
You're late. Why don't you just shut up?

350
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,310
Go to your seat, hurry up.

351
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,480
Hey, why is your skirt so long?

352
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:46,020
Because I'm not wearing it for guys to look at.

353
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:51,320
I bet you don't dare to show your ugly legs.

354
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,820
Case in point

355
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,430
Yes

356
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:58,200
What does it mean?

357
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,200
Leave her alone.

358
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,600
She's been like this since last year.

359
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,700
Pretentious.

360
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:12,780
Mister.

361
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,310
Please think carefully again.

362
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:17,010
That diary is really important to me.

363
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:18,880
If it's so important, why did you leave it here?

364
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,650
Are you sure you don't have it?

365
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:22,120
I don't.

366
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,800
Suspect No.1 (Giggling idiot)

367
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,800
Suspect No.2 (Silly Prince)

368
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,940
Suspect No.3 (Grumpy Gorilla)

369
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,610
The second period is coming up.

370
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:43,740
It's our turn to clean the courtyard.

371
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,740
Chief of Environmental Protection.

372
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:47,740
Bring others with you.
I'm off to the General Affairs Office.

373
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,850
Okay. Hurry up and go.

374
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:49,750
Class dismissed.

375
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,140
Hey, Yen.

376
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,670
What's up?

377
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:15,840
Who is she?

378
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,540
She's Shao's elder brother's girlfriend.

379
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,950
What?

380
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,750
Then why did he write "my first love"?

381
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,680
He had a crush on her when he was a kid.

382
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,350
Later she became his tutor.

383
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:31,020
Then his brother stole her heart.

384
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,820
Young, are you an idiot?

385
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,490
You can tell she's much older, okay?

386
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,400
So, he's not seeing anyone?

387
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,940
Young, you fancy Shao?

388
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,940
Anyway,

389
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,150
Shao and I have been buddies since we were kids.

390
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,720
What he likes for breakfast…

391
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,460
Remember.

392
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,920
Large iced milk tea,

393
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,630
tuna egg pancake.

394
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,090
Without chili but with soy sauce.

395
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,530
With soy sauce.

396
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:14,400
Everyone.

397
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,400
I can bring him breakfast on your behalf.

398
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,200
But, to all of his fans,

399
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,240
I want one portion too, okay?

400
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,710
Okay, no problem.

401
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:23,240
Let's go get breakfast.

402
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,840
I'm not a fan.

403
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,010
Come on, is he seeing anyone?

404
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,410
Where is your breakfast?

405
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,180
Young.

406
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,180
You're infatuated. How can you run the Pop Dance Club?

407
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,850
This is irrelevant to being
the Pop Dance Club President.

408
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,490
What else can you do apart from talking nonsense?

409
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:37,490
I'm not talking nonsense.

410
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:38,560
I'm helping you.

411
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,090
Come on, join the Shao Fan Club.

412
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,790
I said I'm not a fan.

413
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,030
You don't even dare to admit it.

414
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:45,460
Dare to admit what?

415
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,460
Why keep arguing?

416
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,030
No one will laugh at you for being infatuated with him.

417
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:51,540
Fine, even if I'm infatuated, so what?

418
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,670
It's perfectly normal to like someone.

419
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:53,940
Why wouldn't I dare to admit it?

420
00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:00,280
I, Young, like Shao.

421
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,850
He's really a school heart-throb.

422
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:13,760
School heart-throb, hey.

423
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,460
What if the guy took it?

424
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,470
He's sitting next to me.

425
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,430
I feel so embarrassed.

426
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,340
More embarrassed than me?

427
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:30,610
I declared my feelings for him before the whole school.

428
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,780
Why is it so different from the dream I had?

429
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,820
The feisty girl yesterday.

430
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:45,160
Is the girl next to her in the same class?

431
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,190
Oh, Young.

432
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,360
She is in my class.

433
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,290
What?

434
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:49,360
Were you shocked by her love declaration?

435
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:50,990
Of course not.

436
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,570
Oh, right.

437
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,670
You've always wanted this, right?

438
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:00,000
Wow, you got it.

439
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,370
Shao.

440
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:05,780
Are you still in the Taekwondo Club this year?

441
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:07,640
I think so.

442
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,810
If you decide to switch,

443
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:11,410
Remember to announce it on Instagram.

444
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:23,760
Shao.

445
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,430
Wanna join the International Folk Dance Club?

446
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,630
What's that?

447
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:30,130
The Folk Dance Club for short.

448
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,380
Young said she'd join.

449
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:43,780
Oh?

450
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:56,090
Are you sure?

451
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:57,360
Yes.

452
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,860
The owner said after I left,

453
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,300
there were only those boys at two tables.

454
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,100
He sat at one of the tables.

455
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,430
Who was at the other table?

456
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,200
Two of them looked a bit familiar.

457
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,870
But I don't know them.

458
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:10,010
You happen to be in the same class.

459
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,740
God is trying to help you.

460
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,510
Maybe you can get it back.

461
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:13,380
Do you wanna go ask him directly?

462
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,380
I don't dare.

463
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,650
If it's really him,

464
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:18,380
He'd have read everything I wrote in it.

465
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,250
Let me ask him for you.

466
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,120
Wait a minute.

467
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,650
Don't be so impulsive.

468
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,290
You're such a wimp.

469
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,050
I'm not.

470
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,830
How come he can ride a motorbike?

471
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:50,180
(Shao follows you)

472
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,060
Tung, Tung.

473
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,570
Hello. -Tung.

474
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:15,770
Shao follows me on Instagram and Facebook.

475
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,280
How did he know who I was?

476
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,110
Come on.

477
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,750
You shouted out loud.

478
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,250
I feel so shy.

479
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:30,050
Aren't you embarrassed?

480
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:32,320
No, I'm not.

481
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,160
If you like someone, you must shout it out loud.

482
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,560
What should I do?

483
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,230
You've got a boyfriend?

484
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:41,930
I'll call you back in a minute.

485
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:43,600
Okay, off you go. Bye bye.

486
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,200
Why didn't you knock before coming in?

487
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,710
Answer my question first.

488
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:54,340
No... It's Tung.

489
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:56,310
Young.

490
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:59,120
Don't see anyone before you graduate from college.

491
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,120
Do you understand?

492
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:01,950
What era are we in?

493
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,650
It's ridiculous I can't see anyone

494
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:04,820
before graduating from college.

495
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:06,960
What are you talking about?

496
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,590
Tung has a boyfriend.

497
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:13,200
Mom said I can't see anyone before finishing college.

498
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,230
That's a bit too strict.

499
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:18,030
Yeah, she's so strict.

500
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:22,140
So strict?

501
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:24,270
You're my daughter.

502
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,210
I can't say anything?

503
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,510
Dad!

504
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:30,850
Okay.

505
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:32,320
Let's not talk about this now.

506
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,620
It's too early to talk about these things.

507
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,420
Anyway, it is Tung who is seeing someone.

508
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,950
Let's go out first.

509
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:38,860
I'll ask her.

510
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:39,760
Fine.

511
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,130
Bye.

512
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,700
I want a new phone.

513
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:56,270
What a crappy phone!

514
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:59,880
Don't challenge your mom on too many things at once.

515
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,980
One step at a time.

516
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,610
Stop asking for a new phone for now.

517
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,320
Is it really Tung

518
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,790
Who has a boyfriend?

519
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,860
Not you?

520
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,690
No.

521
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:17,730
Right.

522
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:27,500
Dad, finish what you wanna say in one go, okay?

523
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,710
I just want to tell you…

524
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,740
If you really want to go out with someone,

525
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,340
You can talk to me.

526
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,340
I won't tell Mom.

527
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:36,610
Okay.

528
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,950
You really want to have a boyfriend?

529
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,450
No, I don't.

530
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:43,090
You can tell me... -Enough.

531
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:44,350
I really… Enough

532
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,690
…care about you. -Enough, I need to make a call.

533
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,440
Pass the exam papers down.

534
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:45,980
Write the answers carefully.

535
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,200
Yao-Fan.

536
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,540
What are you looking at?

537
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,370
Don't whisper to each other.

538
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:09,710
Hurry up. I'll come back to collect them later.

539
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:26,160
Hey.

540
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,990
Stop writing.

541
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,590
Tell you what.

542
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,090
This teacher is really annoying.

543
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:32,230
We all agree

544
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,300
we'll hand in blank papers.

545
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:33,960
Right?

546
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,200
Yeah.

547
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:38,470
Did he do something mean?

548
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,400
No.

549
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,670
He just loves nagging.

550
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:41,840
And loves meddling in others' business.

551
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,740
So?

552
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:46,080
You're asking too much. Just stop writing.

553
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:47,240
You really aren't cooperative.

554
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:49,280
Why should I be cooperative?

555
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,050
He didn't do anything wrong.

556
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,650
What you're doing is called "bullying".

557
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,320
Bullying your ass.

558
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,950
You're so full of yourself.

559
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,920
Bullshit bully.

560
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,490
Smarty-pants.

561
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:00,320
It's okay, you can write as much as you want.

562
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,600
Have you all finished?

563
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,140
You must have since you've time for napping.

564
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,140
Hey, wake up.

565
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,680
Come on, pass the exam papers to me.

566
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:24,650
What's happening?

567
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:26,150
Hand in blank papers all together?

568
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,450
Hurry up.

569
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:29,820
All blank papers anyway.

570
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:05,390
How did you know to turn in a blank paper?

571
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:06,460
I didn't tell you.

572
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:12,660
It's okay, I understand.

573
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,040
Alright, class dismissed.

574
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,710
Really?

575
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,080
Shao will join the Folk Dance Club?

576
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,010
That's right.

577
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:31,410
Yen, you aren't lying, are you?

578
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:32,420
No.

579
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,480
Don't lie to us.

580
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,180
It's true.

581
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,750
Hey, everyone.

582
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,250
Anyone else wants to join the Folk Dance Club?

583
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,860
Places are limited.

584
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,960
Young, do you wanna join?

585
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:45,500
Young.

586
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,360
Come on, join it.

587
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,900
You can leave the Pop Dance Club to me.

588
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:50,700
Wait, what's your name?

589
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:53,570
Chia-Ying.

590
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,910
Oh, Chia-Ying.

591
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:56,810
Tell you what.

592
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:57,610
Not all dancers

593
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:58,610
must join the Pop Dance Club.

594
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:00,840
The Folk Dance Club will be awesome this year.

595
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,110
Right, Young?

596
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,380
How should I know?

597
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:11,250
We have Young so, it will definitely be awesome.

598
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:12,860
I didn't say I want to join.

599
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:21,199
Shao will join it, idiot.

600
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:30,909
Tung.

601
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,389
Are you alright?

602
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:43,449
Who did this?

603
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:45,620
Which idiot?

604
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,930
Even I didn't cry.

605
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:28,530
Why are you crying?

606
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:32,500
I'm crying precisely because you aren't.

607
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,370
Why didn't you tell me something like this happened?

608
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,450
I don't know who played the prank on her.

609
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:51,750
But I warn you.

610
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,960
Tung's enemy is my enemy.

611
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,870
Isn't it a bit awkward?

612
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,070
A little bit.

613
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,040
Do you want to leave first?

614
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,370
Okay, I'll leave first.

615
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,350
Look over here.

616
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,080
Yeah.

617
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:21,480
Give me a smile.

618
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,320
So silly.

619
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:44,210
Did you find a diary?

620
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,940
That day in the café.

621
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,310
It was your fault that someone
spilled drink on my diary.

622
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:53,550
Don't pretend you don't remember, Sheng.

623
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,560
Sheng.

624
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,120
Did you or did you not find it?

625
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:08,160
Why aren't you answering me?

626
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,400
It's either yes

627
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,830
Or no.

628
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:13,700
If you don't answer, it means you're guilty.

629
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,450
This is the men's restroom.

630
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,650
If you don't answer, I won't leave.

631
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:27,950
Fine.

632
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:41,560
Fine, you just keep hiding in here.

633
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,030
Don't leave.

634
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,150
Tung.

635
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,680
Your name is Tung, right?

636
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,080
I'm in the same class as Young. My name is Yen.

637
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:01,980
What are you doing in here?

638
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,220
None of your business.

639
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:11,590
So awkward.

640
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,100
Suspect No.1 (Giggling Idiot)

641
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:17,770
Suspect No.2 (Silly Prince)

642
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,070
You're one of them.

643
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:24,840
What? Me?

644
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,110
Yes, you were there that day.

645
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:27,510
So was Shao.

646
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:30,180
Which day?

647
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:32,150
Yes, you were there as well.

648
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,880
That day in the cafe.

649
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,120
So, who did it?

650
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:39,860
What are we talking about?

651
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,460
Alright.

652
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,790
Tung is looking for me.

653
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:44,430
I'm the hero.

654
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:45,760
Don't try to steal the spotlight.

655
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,660
Don't sound as if you knew me well.

656
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:50,430
You three are all the same.

657
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:52,470
Who on earth took my diary?

658
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,980
It really wasn't me.

659
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,660
Shao is also a suspect?

660
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,790
Yeah.

661
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:17,360
But no one admitted it.

662
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,060
I don't believe them.

663
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,500
I was so unlucky.

664
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,300
They all happen to be boys in our school.

665
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,270
I'd never felt so embarrassed.

666
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:25,330
What did you write in it?

667
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:26,440
Why won't you let me see?

668
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,440
It's hard to explain.

669
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,210
Hey, Tung.

670
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:30,510
What's up?

671
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:35,750
Hey, are you crazy?

672
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:38,480
Are you alright?

673
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:41,950
Is it okay?

674
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:43,190
It's okay.

675
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,120
Are you sure?

676
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,390
Let's go to the health center.

677
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:53,060
Okay?

678
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,060
Fine.

679
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,570
What's up?

680
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,310
I'm afraid you'll argue with him.

681
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,680
Come on.

682
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,880
I mean it.

683
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,420
You want to be with him alone, right?

684
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:15,450
No. No way.

685
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:16,790
How could you misunderstand me like this?

686
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,790
Well, you go back first.

687
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:19,890
I can handle it myself.

688
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:22,860
Bye bye.

689
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:25,190
Come on, seriously.

690
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:51,450
Thank you.

691
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:30,830
Do you need any help?

692
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,400
Anyway, I'm quite experienced.

693
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,370
Oh, okay.

694
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,950
Let me disinfect it first. It might hurt a little bit.

695
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,300
Is it hurting?

696
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:19,710
Young.

697
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,480
Will you join the Folk Dance Club?

698
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:27,850
How about you?

699
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:38,790
This is not a place for dating.

700
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,660
Finish and leave, okay?

701
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:57,350
Yes? Did you take it apart?

702
00:42:58,510 --> 00:42:59,480
Hurry up! Give me that screw.

703
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,950
She is coming. Hurry up.

704
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:31,510
What the heck.

705
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:37,890
Did you get hurt?

706
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:44,290
Shall I get you another chair?

707
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,010
I told you to take it apart.

708
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:00,540
This is the last

709
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:02,540
and the only warning.

710
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,260
I thought your leg hurt?

711
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:56,530
No, not anymore.

712
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:58,670
What about the Pop Dance Club?

713
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,370
You can dance anytime in your life.

714
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:02,940
But you have

715
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:04,040
Only one first love, right?

716
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,840
You are totally infatuated.

717
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:13,450
Were you alright today?

718
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,450
Did they bully you again?

719
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,520
No, they didn't.

720
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:19,590
If they did, let me know.

721
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:21,060
Fine.

722
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:26,130
What's it now?

723
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,430
You wanna join the Folk Dance Club with me?

724
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:33,670
Think about it.

725
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:35,870
Though we can't be in the same class,

726
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:37,570
at least we can be in the same club.

727
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:38,310
Right?

728
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:40,040
We can hang out with each other again.

729
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:42,140
Come on, my queen, think about it.

730
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:44,610
How beautiful we'll look when we dance together!

731
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:45,680
I'll look like a flower.

732
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:46,750
You'll look like my flower.

733
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:48,780
And we'll look like two goofy flowers together.

734
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:50,020
Isn't that great?

735
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:52,820
Come on, I beg you.

736
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:53,860
Please, please.

737
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:54,590
Fine.

738
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:57,830
Hey, stop jumping.

739
00:45:57,830 --> 00:45:59,530
Tung! -Your leg will hurt again.

740
00:45:59,530 --> 00:45:59,930
No, it won't.

741
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:02,430
Stop. It'll hurt again.

742
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:03,500
Stop.

743
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,750
Here, three hundred.

744
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:31,890
She won't give up, will she?

745
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:33,530
No.

746
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:35,130
She often says I'm stubborn.

747
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:36,230
But I think she's the stubborn one.

748
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:38,100
Young.

749
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,140
No way.

750
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:01,860
No way.

Dear Martian,

752
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:12,430
from this day on,

753
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,540
Maybe because of you,

754
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,440
maybe because of him,

755
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:20,680
Maybe because it is arranged by the universe,

756
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:25,450
I, Tung,

757
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:27,220
will be brave too.

758
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,890
Hello From Mars.
