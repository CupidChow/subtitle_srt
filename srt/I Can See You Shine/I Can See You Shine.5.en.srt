1
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,120
Hey, Sheng.

2
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,720
Are you sure the key to the swimming pool is here?

3
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:19,860
Why ask it like that?

4
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,790
I've never done something like this before.

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,160
Me either.

6
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,400
Are you picking up the gift.

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,660
So slow.

8
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,030
Hey.

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,200
Shh.

10
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,640
Should you two wait for me outside?

11
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,210
Yes, good.

12
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:36,170
Let's get out first.

13
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:38,610
Go.

14
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:39,740
Okay.

15
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:42,210
I'll keep watch for you.

16
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,400
Sir.

17
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,300
Why did you come?

18
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,800
What are you two doing here?

19
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,140
We…

20
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,440
We come to play sports on the weekend.

21
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,110
Yes, play sports.

22
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,180
Play sports?

23
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,410
Playing sports is good.

24
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:17,250
Thank you, sir.

25
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,120
Nice weather.

26
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:36,630
Go play sports.

27
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,440
1, 2, 3, 4.

28
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,270
Hey.

29
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,440
Your girlfriend.

30
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:34,360
Wow.

31
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,930
My girlfriend is so hot.

32
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,860
So is my boyfriend.

33
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:46,970
What's up?

34
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,480
Nothing.

35
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:30,720
（Ep.5 Boys Are Idiots）

36
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:44,760
Stop daydreaming.

37
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,930
Your best friend is drowning.

38
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:48,400
Perform CPR on her.

39
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,370
I can't.

40
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,440
I don't dare to touch her.

41
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,170
Tung.

42
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,710
Tung, wake up.

43
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,510
Did you drown?

44
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,480
No.

45
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,050
Just a prank.

46
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,750
I'm here. No way Tung would drown.

47
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:09,820
Tung, seriously?

48
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,520
Yep.

49
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,060
What were you daydreaming about?

50
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,590
Grrr… Why did you trick me?

51
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:15,790
Babe, you too.

52
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,260
No.

53
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,100
It was Tung's idea.

54
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:20,600
Yes.

55
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,230
She said she wanted revenge.

56
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:23,700
Yen told me

57
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,540
You helped them snatch my diary from me.

58
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,510
Really?

59
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,540
No way I'd do something like that.

60
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,540
Still denying?

61
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,710
No way I would do that.

62
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,310
She fell.

63
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,920
Tung.

64
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,480
I worked so hard to get you into the pool.

65
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,650
And you're not practicing.

66
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:41,850
That's right.

67
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:42,850
Don't waste time.

68
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,960
Another fall.

69
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:50,630
What are you laughing at?

70
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,460
Go help them.

71
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,240
Sheng, you're doomed.

72
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:05,680
oh I

73
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,850
You’be mine

74
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:09,750
So annoying.

75
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,620
Get down.

76
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,050
I'm coming.

77
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,320
to run away my love just stay just stay

78
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,860
don’t keep runnin away

79
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,760
Let me call you "baby"

80
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,860
Let me get drunk, let me

81
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,070
Let me fall, let me

82
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:30,940
Burst into tears, be taken aback,
I don't understand myself

83
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,770
No one understands my sweetness

84
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:39,380
They think I'm boring so, I give up

85
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,450
Like a tsundere, never try to figure it out

86
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,480
Never try to understand my tenderness

87
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,620
I don't have many friends

88
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,290
They themselves may not understand

89
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,190
Dear Martian,

90
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,390
Have I already met you?

91
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:57,100
Have you already met me?

92
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,700
A question like this…

93
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,970
I don't dare to ask you in the diary.

94
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,430
I could ask only myself in my head.

95
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,670
Am I ready?

96
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,910
Can I let you see me?

97
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,280
Yes!

98
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,610
Damn, I can't believe you beat me.

99
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,350
Come here,babe.

100
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:21,720
Thanks.

101
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,550
And mine?

102
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,430
It's the sounds a Martian

103
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:37,470
Would like to give a Mercurian.

104
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,580
Yen.

105
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,480
What?

106
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,380
Would you like to go on a date with me?

107
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,790
Hey.

108
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,360
Oh, thanks.

109
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:02,960
Thanks?

110
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,100
What thanks?

111
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,060
Oh, you mean you want to go on a date with me?

112
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,330
No.

113
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,230
Yes.

114
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,440
You want to go on a date with me?

115
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,240
Yes, hooray!

116
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,340
I'm going on a date with a real girl.

117
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,310
Hooray!

118
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,940
I'm really going on a date with a real girl.

119
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,410
Can't believe you've got Tung.

120
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,350
Well done.

121
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,210
No, it's just a date.

122
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,180
Hooray!

123
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,320
I'm running late for cram school.

124
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,159
I'm off.

125
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:35,890
Bye bye.

126
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,600
You're staying?

127
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,600
Yes.

128
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,300
You…

129
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,840
You girls have your schedule.

130
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,100
We boys have ours.

131
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,000
Sheng, let's have another round before leaving.

132
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,270
Okay, I'm off.

133
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:48,970
Bye bye.

134
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,040
Young.

135
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,940
Hurry up or I won't wait for you.

136
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,250
What's up?

137
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,150
You get a cramp?

138
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,720
Thought you were so generous

139
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,060
That you let Yen win.

140
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,460
So, that's it.

141
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:09,990
For Christ's sake.

142
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,260
I'm a student athlete.

143
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,560
Yen always gets good grades

144
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,270
He can play the piano too.

145
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,970
Well, unlike me.

146
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:17,970
I'm sporty

147
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,270
But brainless.

148
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,470
Never do well in the exams.

149
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,170
If I lose in sports,

150
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,940
I'll have nothing left.

151
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:26,740
Why compare yourself with him?

152
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,380
He's a good friend. It doesn't matter.

153
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,120
Yes, it does.

154
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,280
Besides…

155
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:33,990
You still have me.

156
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,950
Sheng, you're so cheesy.

157
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,690
Idiot.

158
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:44,900
Hey.

159
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:46,060
What?

160
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,230
Your favorite.

161
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,570
Thanks.

162
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,410
Hey.

163
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,410
What?

164
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,180
Say it.

165
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,390
Well…

166
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:12,620
When you were in nineth grade,

167
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,790
You dropped out of school.

168
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,730
Was it really because your dad was ill?

169
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,630
Yes.

170
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:23,830
Even so, you didn't have to ignore me.

171
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,870
I was very upset.

172
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,740
I really worried about you.

173
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,250
Cheesy.

174
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,250
No, it's not.

175
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,480
I'm serious.

176
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,490
I know.

177
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,290
You thought I joined a criminal gang.

178
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:48,630
You insisted on

179
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,930
Rescuing me

180
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,260
And nearly got yourself beaten up.

181
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,870
But it was you who got beaten up.

182
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:00,040
I'm sorry.

183
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:02,970
It's alright.

184
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,580
Actually, those friends I made

185
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,040
Aren't bad guys.

186
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,280
Good.

187
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,350
Hey.

188
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,390
Did you transfer to this school

189
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,050
Because of me?

190
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,960
Shao.

191
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,320
You really love me, don't you?

192
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,190
Don't tell Yen about it.

193
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,360
He's very jealous.

194
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,500
Then…kissed me.

195
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,240
Oh my God!

196
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,240
Chia-Ying.

197
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,480
Cookies on the house.

198
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:39,880
Thanks.

199
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,180
Super high.

200
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,410
Not at all.

201
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,120
What was it like? Kissing a girl.

202
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,250
Sweet.

203
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,760
Pervert, don't listen in.

204
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,790
Fine.

205
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,330
I made these cookies myself.

206
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,790
Try and tell me if they're good.

207
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:58,460
Okay, will tell you later.

208
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,060
Pervert, go away.

209
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,600
If you were my daughter, I'd beat you to death.

210
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,430
I'd take you to court.

211
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:05,170
You win.

212
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,440
What? Describe it.

213
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,740
Super weird.

214
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,780
I didn't like it.

215
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,540
It proves you're super straight.

216
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,790
What?

217
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:29,960
I'm not listening in.

218
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:21,670
Mom.

219
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:25,440
I'm going out.

220
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:04,070
Now you'll all be given a late mark.

221
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,350
What?

222
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,180
Where are we going?

223
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:18,990
You can't run at all.

224
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:19,990
Heart problems?

225
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,460
It's your fault.

226
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,930
Hey, I'm being kind.

227
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,470
I see you've got so many late marks.

228
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,200
So, I share my secret with you.

229
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,040
Aren't you curious

230
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,180
Why I always get to the classroom before you?

231
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,460
No need.

232
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,500
You've got such a bad temper.

233
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,740
You won't get a boyfriend.

234
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,240
I don't want a boyfriend.

235
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,410
Really?

236
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,150
Let go of me.

237
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,120
The school bag.

238
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,570
What?

239
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,410
Don't dare to jump?

240
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,640
I'll catch you.

241
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:03,530
Sheng.

242
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,700
It's you again.

243
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:10,000
You not only are late but help a girl climb the wall.

244
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,400
Very romantic.

245
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,569
I'll grant your wish.

246
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:14,710
Come, both of you.

247
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:18,839
Hurry up!

248
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,550
During the lunch break,

249
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,319
Wipe all the volleyballs clean.

250
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:33,620
I'll leave them to you.

251
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,430
Hey.

252
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,360
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have got caught.

253
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,400
I didn't want to climb the wall.

254
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,230
You dragged me with you.

255
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,650
The exams are coming up. Still reading a novel?

256
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,690
It makes no difference.

257
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,220
No matter how hard I study.

258
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,930
Which novel are you reading?

259
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,200
A novel I totally can't understand.

260
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,440
Then why are you reading it?

261
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,240
Just curious.

262
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:00,810
What do you want?

263
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,780
I'm going on a date with Tung this week.

264
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,920
I don't know where to go.

265
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,950
So annoying.

266
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,160
You need to know what she likes

267
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,420
Before taking her somewhere.

268
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,190
What date?

269
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,460
Who is going on a date?

270
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,290
Don't tell him.

271
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,230
He's very gossipy.

272
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:21,270
Okay, don't be nervous.

273
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,370
Let me help you.

274
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:22,970
Listen.

275
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,440
Let me recommend you an ice cream parlor
I really like.

276
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,300
I can even recommend a flavor

277
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,040
She will like

278
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,580
Based on your description of her.

279
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,340
Like a fortune teller.

280
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,650
No, totally different.

281
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,250
I should take notes.

282
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:36,980
Let me get my phone.

283
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:37,680
Go, quick.

284
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,450
Wait for me.

285
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,720
You're such a sly businessman.

286
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,190
Always trick people into going to your stores.

287
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,720
Sheng.

288
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,500
Wow.

289
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,460
So hot.

290
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,170
Hi.

291
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,270
Have you been here for long?

292
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,600
Just arrived.

293
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:20,060
Drink it.

294
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,020
You're in a bad mood?

295
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,230
No.

296
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,530
Smile.

297
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,960
See how cute you look when you smile.

298
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:30,730
You do.

299
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,000
Teach me how to play.

300
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,640
Okay.

301
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:33,700
Hey.

302
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,400
What?

303
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,610
Thought you wanted to take notes?

304
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:36,970
Yeah, right, phone.

305
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:37,340
Yes.

306
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:37,740
Phone.

307
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,840
Wake up, come on.

308
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,380
The mid-term exams are over.

309
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,560
How did they go?

310
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:56,790
You?

311
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,200
So rarely you didn't fall asleep in the class.

312
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:01,770
Hey.

313
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,500
Sometimes I do work hard.

314
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,880
You're walking so slowly.

315
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,910
I'm off to sleep.

316
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:24,390
Sheng.

317
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:28,360
Please wake up.

318
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,130
Come on, wake up.

319
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,730
Get up.

320
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,330
Hey, why are you standing outside?

321
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,500
Sheng.

322
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,770
We're running out of time.

323
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:38,140
Get up. I've choreographed a small part.

324
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,270
I’m screwed

325
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,070
I thought Tung was my goddess.

326
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,370
But now I find she's just an ordinary girl.

327
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:45,140
Can't believe you get a new target so soon.

328
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,180
Tell you what.

329
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,910
This time, I met a femme fatale.

330
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:48,580
Look.

331
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,780
My heart…

332
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,850
…has been shot.

333
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,680
But I can't steal my buddy's girlfriend.

334
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,090
You're such a tragic hero.

335
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,490
I don't want to be one.

336
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,660
I didn't know you and Young…

337
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,490
Grrr…not her.

338
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:02,390
Who wants your girl?

339
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,690
It's Sheng's girl.

340
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,430
Sheng has a girlfriend?

341
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,760
That's not the point.

342
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,400
What?

343
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,770
What girlfriend?

344
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:11,470
He said Sheng has a girlfriend.

345
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,470
Tung.

346
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,810
Come over.

347
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,480
Say it again.

348
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,080
No. -He said Sheng has a girlfriend.

349
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:28,920
Since when?

350
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,420
Dunno.

351
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,590
He told me just now.

352
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,560
He never told us. -Then how did you know?

353
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,620
Heartbroken.

354
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,800
Martian,

355
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,070
We had better not meet up.

356
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:52,710
Nothing in the world could be

357
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,950
More beautiful than what we imagine.

358
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:59,580
The Martian is definitely not a boy on Earth.

359
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,150
They're all idiots.

360
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,250
Where are you going?

361
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,290
Skip class.

362
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,360
But I've choreographed a small part.

363
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,190
Tung.

364
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:11,860
Tung.

365
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,230
Tung. -What’s wrong with her?

366
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,730
What's wrong with them?

367
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,880
You're still having a fever.

368
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:28,510
I've been telling you.

369
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:31,210
Don't take the over-the-counter medicine.

370
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,580
Why don't you go see a doctor?

371
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,690
Well, I won't get better so soon.

372
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:38,360
I want to sleep.

373
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,960
Okay, go to sleep.

374
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,220
Wait.

375
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:42,730
Here.

376
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:45,430
Have the vitamin C drink.

377
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,210
Mom, would you like anything else?

378
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:57,470
I'd like some soup.

379
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,510
Go get your mom a bowl of hot soup.

380
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,080
Go.

381
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:04,110
Well, she can't do it.

382
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,520
Go help her.

383
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,620
She's a big girl.

384
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,020
How come she can't make soup?

385
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,750
She needs practicing.

386
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,650
Go, quick.

387
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:14,320
Well, here.

388
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,990
Let me help you lie down, okay?

389
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,330
Oh my gosh.

390
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,960
Your clothes are drenched in sweat.

391
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,200
Let me get you clean ones.

392
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:45,760
What should I do? I changed my mind.

393
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,360
Can I cancel my date with Yen?

394
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,030
No!

395
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:56,070
He's the Martian.

396
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:01,070
Tung.

397
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,040
Morning.

398
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,580
You're my woman.

399
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:10,110
Tung.

400
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,720
Which ice cream flavor do you like?

401
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,320
Great fireball justu.

402
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,490
Yo, Tung.

403
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:19,990
What kind of music do you like?

404
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,020
Or you would like to

405
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,360
Dance with me?

406
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:35,370
Hey.

407
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:37,540
Hey, what kind of music do you like?

408
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:40,280
Ringo Sheena.

409
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,550
Who is she?

410
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:50,020
You like "Clair de Lune" by Debussy?

411
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,450
Yeah, you like it too?

412
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,690
But I play it only occasionally.

413
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:55,430
Having played so many pieces,

414
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:56,990
My favorite is Mozart's

415
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:59,100
Piano Sonata No. 16 in C major, K. 545.

416
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,870
I don't know what you're talking about.

417
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:12,510
Hey.

418
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:13,910
I need to go to the restroom.

419
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:25,890
It looks quite nice.

420
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,170
Help!

421
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:39,700
You alright?

422
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:42,910
Super awkward.

423
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:47,110
Told you going to the movies was the safest.

424
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,810
Why did you go to an ice cream parlor?

425
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:59,220
I'm going to reject him outright.

426
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,460
No!

427
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:02,760
Marian!

428
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,830
You look like an old married couple.

429
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:22,510
I wonder how Tung and Yen are doing

430
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,850
On their first date.

431
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,050
oops

432
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:28,850
I bet they're fine.

433
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:30,020
Don't worry.

434
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,060
You were gone for so long.

435
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,430
It's melted.

436
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:36,390
It's okay.

437
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:37,830
It still tastes nice.

438
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,900
Why didn't you order blueberry chocolate?

439
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,770
I don't like blueberry.

440
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:44,100
I don't like any berries.

441
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,070
Hey, what?

442
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:51,010
Nothing.

443
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,810
I'm going to the ladies.

444
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:12,300
The Martian isn't Yen!

445
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,900
Game Over.

446
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,240
Thanks.

447
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,790
Yen.

448
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,360
Hm, yes?

449
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:44,090
I think we two

450
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:45,400
Really aren't suitable for each other.

451
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,870
Then why did you ask me out?

452
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,100
I'm sorry.

453
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,570
Are you really upset?

454
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,380
Then what should we do?

455
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:05,780
Can you do me a favor?

456
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,920
Okay, what is it?

457
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,490
Hey.

458
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:16,360
He's going out with Tung.

459
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,090
Really?

460
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:18,500
It's not true, is it?

461
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,560
I heard she's very feisty.

462
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,030
No way Yen could get her.

463
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:23,900
It's ridiculous.

464
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,870
Why are you looking at me like that?

465
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:32,240
I don't believe it.

466
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,210
Baby.

467
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:37,810
Hi.

468
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,580
I've prepared breakfast.

469
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,720
Thank you, baby.

470
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,680
Baby, bye bye.

471
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,450
See you later.

472
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:43,590
Okay, bye bye.

473
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,520
Wow

474
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,090
What's wrong?

475
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,790
Tung.

476
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,030
Tung, you and Yen…

477
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,270
Mm.

478
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,700
Didn't you reject him?

479
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,340
I changed my mind.

480
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,100
Don't be so impulsive.

481
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,270
Me?

482
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,810
How can I be impulsive?

483
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:05,410
How about the Martian?

484
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,580
It has nothing to do with it.

485
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,680
It's so strange…

486
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,550
No.

487
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:13,020
Or are you keeping something secret from me?

488
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,890
Chia-Ying.

489
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,590
Be brave and be yourself.

490
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:22,190
What?

491
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,190
Told you to keep it secret.

492
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,990
You'll get me into big trouble.

493
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,800
Really?

494
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,470
Hey, Tung.

495
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:37,640
You've got a boyfriend?

496
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,410
None of your business.

497
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:41,080
Well no…

498
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,650
I'm just very curious.

499
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:43,680
Who on earth is this guy?

500
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:45,880
Is something wrong

501
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,150
With his eyesight?

502
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:47,880
Yes

503
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,590
Is he a masochist?

504
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,390
You know who this guy is?

505
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,560
No.

506
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,330
Next…

507
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:04,130
They don't look good together.

508
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,040
Baby.

509
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,380
The class is over.

510
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,280
Shall I carry the books for you?

511
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,690
Baby.

512
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:28,320
Open your mouth.

513
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,270
Baby.

514
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,640
Whoa.

515
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,270
Thank you, baby.

516
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,750
Baby, go!

517
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,220
Damn.

518
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,150
It's okay.

519
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:03,630
Yes!

520
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,330
Wow!

521
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:06,760
Baby, you're super great!

522
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,000
Thanks.

523
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:12,700
Very hot, isn't it?

524
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,470
Let me wipe the sweat off you.

525
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:21,780
I don't believe it.

526
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:23,150
Enough.

527
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,210
Leave them alone.

528
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,280
Hey, come play video games at mine tomorrow.

529
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,320
Sure.

530
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,260
The novel your girlfriend is reading?

531
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:36,760
No.

532
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,300
I can't understand it.

533
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,240
It's just a book.

534
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,170
No need to be angry if you can't understand it.

535
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:50,270
Okay.

536
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,540
Tidy it up.

537
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,440
It's okay.

538
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,790
I’m hitting that wall.

539
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:14,660
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Luo.

540
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,730
I'm Young.

541
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:16,970
No, I'm not.

542
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:17,600
Sit

543
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,700
She's our servant.

544
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,470
Not my mother.

545
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,340
I'm sorry.

546
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,340
No wonder I thought she looked so young.

547
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,380
No need to apologize. It's fine.

548
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,080
Shao.

549
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,380
No one calls them "servant" anymore.

550
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,280
Right, Nina is Indonesian too.

551
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,820
Nina, Young's mother is Vietnamese.

552
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:36,720
So what?

553
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,720
They'd know each other cos
they're both Southeast Asian?

554
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,920
It's not what I mean.

555
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,920
I just think

556
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,190
They happen to speak the same language.

557
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,260
Shao, you're so ignorant.

558
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,130
Vietnamese is different from Indonesian, okay?

559
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,170
Sheng, why do you have a rocket

560
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,300
I'm sorry.

561
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,600
I can never tell the difference.

562
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,840
It's okay.

563
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,240
My mom is Vietnamese.

564
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,610
But I can't speak Vietnamese.

565
00:33:58,810 --> 00:33:59,780
You can't?

566
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,650
Well, Young is Taiwanese.

567
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:04,450
Why must she learn to speak Vietnamese?

568
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,480
I won!

569
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:08,989
Baby.

570
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:11,750
You made your boyfriend lose face.

571
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,120
Your girlfriend is very impressive.

572
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,219
You should be proud of her.

573
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,190
Bullshit.

574
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,290
Another round.

575
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:23,469
Tung.

576
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:24,900
You've got new tattoo stickers?

577
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,870
My baby is so cool.

578
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,670
Well, no.

579
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,639
Ask Mom to go to Mr. Chen.

580
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,480
She'll feel better after the massage.

581
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,980
I'm home. I'll unpack first.

582
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,210
See what happens. Talk later.

583
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:39,580
Mom, why did you come back so early?

584
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,320
Your grandma threw out her back.

585
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:42,719
Seriously?

586
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,620
Yes.

587
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:46,620
So many people.

588
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,690
This is my mother.

589
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:50,760
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Luo.

590
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,860
I'm Young.

591
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,000
You have such a beautiful home.

592
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:55,800
Thank you.

593
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,130
Mrs. Luo.

594
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:59,070
Yen, so rarely to see you.

595
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:01,000
You don't need to go to cram school today?

596
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:06,940
Very trendy.

597
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,480
Is it allowed in your school?

598
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,150
They're just stickers.

599
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,280
Auntie, this is Tung.

600
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:14,220
I'll get the real tattoos later.

601
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,550
It's not specified in the school rules.

602
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,120
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Luo.

603
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:18,390
Oh.

604
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:20,360
Good.

605
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,160
Nina.

606
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:25,390
Coming.

607
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:28,000
Didn’t I tell you a cold drink

608
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,800
Has to be put on a coaster?

609
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,300
Excuse me.

610
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,140
It's harder to teach a foreigner.

611
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:36,570
Wipe it clean.

612
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,310
I'm going upstairs.

613
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:39,810
You carry on playing.

614
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:50,350
We're off.

615
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:51,690
Mm, okay.

616
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:52,960
Let’s go.

617
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,960
We're off.

618
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,720
We're leaving.

619
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,830
Okay, bye bye.

620
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:56,860
Bye bye.

621
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,360
Bye bye.

622
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:51,810
Nina, let me help you.

623
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:53,320
No need.

624
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,180
It's okay. -I'll do it.

625
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:54,780
I mean it.

626
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,420
Shao.

627
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,050
I'll do it.

628
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:57,850
I forgot to ask if Yen's mother is

629
00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:00,220
Taking part in the International Food Festival.

630
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:00,820
Oh.

631
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:01,460
No.

632
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,330
She said it's too much trouble.

633
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,330
I think it's too much trouble too.

634
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:08,060
I wish I wasn't the chair of the parents' association.

635
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,600
Nina.

636
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,430
You need to wash the mop.

637
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:12,540
Oh, yes.

638
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,710
Did you start hanging out

639
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,180
With Sheng again?

640
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,580
Didn't he drop out of school

641
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:24,050
And join a gang?

642
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:27,220
You had better stay away from someone like him.

643
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:31,150
Are you listening to me?

644
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:32,490
Mm.

645
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:37,960
You never brought girls home before.

646
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,360
Which is your girlfriend?

647
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,570
Tung.

648
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:47,640
I'm going upstairs.

649
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,610
That rebellious one?

650
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:50,910
Yes.

651
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:09,190
You've recovered?

652
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:13,100
Having pretended for three days,
you can't do it anymore?

653
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,240
My wife is an idiot.

654
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,510
Mei-Yuan is an idiot.

655
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:37,690
Well.

656
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:46,300
(Food Festival.)

657
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,070
Hey.

658
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,740
Your mom has gone crazy.

659
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:32,910
Speak to her.

660
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:34,940
Ask her not to go to the International Food Festival.

661
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:35,750
I don't dare. Ask her yourself.

662
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:36,380
Hey.

663
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,850
She isn't doing it for me.

664
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:40,480
She isn't doing it for me either.

665
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:43,750
She's taking part as a parent.

666
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:45,120
If it's not for you, who else?

667
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,360
How would I know?

668
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,160
Chicken is very expensive.

669
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,400
She's thrown so many whole chickens away.

670
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,000
I'll go bankrupt soon.

671
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,300
Hey.

672
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,600
I've done so much for you.

673
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,570
Got you a phone and other things.

674
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:02,100
Because of you, I even got told off by your mom.

675
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,840
The phone cost a fortune.

676
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,740
How can you not help me save money?

677
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:12,720
You're such an emotional blackmailer.

678
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:15,450
Mom.

679
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:19,990
what happened?

680
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:24,030
We don't have to do no-escape chicken.

681
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,330
Other Vietnamese food you cook

682
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:26,630
Tastes nice too.

683
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,330
I know.

684
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:31,270
Then why are you upset?

685
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,140
I'm not upset.

686
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:37,340
I just feel really strange.

687
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,980
It tastes different from what I remember.

688
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,550
I've forgotten how my mom cooked it.

689
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:45,550
It's okay.

690
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:47,320
Don't be upset.

691
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,320
Keep trying till you run out of chicken.

692
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,190
And I'll buy you more.

693
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,840
It doesn't look good over there.

694
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,480
Put it here.

695
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,280
Morning, Mrs. Luo.

696
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,550
Morning.

697
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,160
Mom.

698
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,690
They look good.

699
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:30,990
Don't they?

700
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:32,190
Right?

701
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:37,800
Young.

702
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:41,170
Hey, is the food your mom cooks good?

703
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:42,140
Not too bad.

704
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:45,910
Pizza.

705
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,740
Nice.

706
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:58,320
Yummy.

707
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,600
I can't believe I forgot

708
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,100
My mom doesn't allow me to go out with a boy.

709
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,470
I didn't tell Shao about it.

710
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:12,030
Your girl.

711
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:13,870
Tung.

712
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:15,270
You must help me today.

713
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:17,070
Don't let Shao get close to my mom.

714
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:19,110
It's more important you keep it secret yourself.

715
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,840
True.

716
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,110
It's really dangerous for me today.

717
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:23,880
Where is my pizza?

718
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,550
Why did you tell a lie like that?

719
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:32,490
Hey, you don't fancy Tung, do you?

720
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:33,360
Of course not.

721
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,560
I just wanted to make my mom angry.

722
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,590
I didn't expect her to be here today.

723
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:38,060
Anyway, it's very dangerous for me today.

724
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:39,300
You need to cover me.

725
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:39,930
You hear me?

726
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:40,460
Yes.

727
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:41,730
Then you treat me to pizza later.

728
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:42,600
Okay.

729
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:47,000
There are here.

730
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:50,810
They keep watching us.

731
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:53,480
Why do they keep staring at us?

732
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,110
Here, Tung.

733
00:42:58,110 --> 00:43:00,450
You're the first one to have it. -Yes.

734
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:04,120
What do you think?

735
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,250
Good?

736
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:11,760
Yen.

737
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,290
Come here.

738
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:13,760
Hello Ms. Kuo.

739
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:14,760
Hello.

740
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:17,100
My mom made these.

741
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,400
Super rare.

742
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:20,740
Here.

743
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:21,800
Have as many as you like.

744
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,500
Here, have one.

745
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,040
Good.

746
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,410
I can easily have ten.

747
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:26,310
Seriously?

748
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:26,910
Here.

749
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:27,940
Have this first.

750
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:28,640
Good.

751
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,710
I'll get you more.

752
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:34,550
What do you think?

753
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:40,460
Super tasty.

754
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:41,060
Really?

755
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:41,690
Fantastic.

756
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:43,130
I'll give you more.

757
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:45,060
Here, I know you like them.

758
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,160
Then I'll give you more.

759
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,500
Young.

760
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,210
I didn't expect to see so many people today.

761
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:57,710
It'll be a fierce competition.

762
00:43:57,710 --> 00:43:59,110
Don't worry, Mom.

763
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:00,410
Even if we don't win any prizes,

764
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:02,280
We're promoting our bistro.

765
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:04,050
That's true.

766
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:09,820
Young.

767
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:11,920
Come call out to the customers.

768
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,820
No, it's embarrassing.

769
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:17,660
Why is promoting our bistro embarrassing?

770
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:20,200
Or you do it.

My Chinese is bad.

775
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,170
My food, good.

Oh, Master Shao is here.

789
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:07,410
Mom, what are you doing here?

790
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,680
You didn't tell me you'd come.

791
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:12,720
I have to. I'm the chair of the parents' association.

792
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,820
But you didn't cook the food.

793
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:17,650
You're cheating. -Yes, madam did.

794
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:18,750
Madam helped.

795
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:20,260
We made it together.

796
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,460
Isn't she a teacher of yours?

797
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,700
I remember her name is Kuo?

798
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:32,370
Yes.

799
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:35,840
She's Tung's mother?

800
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:41,040
Yes.

801
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:43,550
Wow, he really loves them.

802
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:45,150
Here, another.

803
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:46,350
He owes me that.

804
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:48,780
Right, baby?

805
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:50,450
You'll finish them all.

806
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:51,020
Yes.

807
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:51,650
I will.

808
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:53,860
Hello Ms. Kuo.

809
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:55,820
I'm Shao's mother.

810
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:57,790
Hello Mrs. Luo.

811
00:45:57,790 --> 00:46:00,700
I was wondering if Shao and Tung
are good for each other.

812
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:01,930
Now I know she's your daughter.

813
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:03,370
I feel relieved.

814
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:04,630
Tung and Shao?

815
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:05,370
Yeah, right.

816
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:06,870
Don't leave Nina alone at the stall.

817
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:08,070
Let's go help her.

818
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:10,040
What's wrong with you?

819
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,410
I want to know your girlfriend better.

820
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:12,510
And you're jealous?

821
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:13,410
It's not what I mean.

822
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:14,410
Mrs. Luo.

823
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:18,580
You're taking part in the competition too?

824
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:19,520
Yes.
