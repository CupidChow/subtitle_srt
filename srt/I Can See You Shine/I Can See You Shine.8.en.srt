1
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,620
Happy Christmas.

2
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,130
Sheng.

3
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,100
I like you

4
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,700
So so so much.

5
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,580
So much that I don't know what to do.

6
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,650
But I don't want it anymore.

7
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,920
So, stay away from me.

8
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,260
Because I'm such a stubborn,

9
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:55,930
Selfish,

10
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,030
And horrible girl.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,770
Even I find myself really annoying.

12
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,340
So, leave me alone.

13
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,110
Anyway, love is a lie.

14
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,480
Why haven't you

15
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,380
Shown your feelings?

16
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:20,289
Love or not, speak it out or not

17
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:22,450
Am I the only one guessing?

18
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,660
This is not a competition

19
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,930
To see who runs faster

20
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:32,200
It's so hard to say "I love you"

21
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,300
Why am I still waiting to see

22
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:19,480
（Ep.8 True Lovers）

23
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,590
Mom.

24
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:29,890
Hm?

25
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:32,090
I want to put on makeup when I perform.

26
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,460
Okay.

27
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,130
You still haven't made peace with Tung?

28
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,060
Who cares about her?

29
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,000
Call her.

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,340
I did.

31
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,110
She didn't answer.

32
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,280
Tung…

33
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,980
…is quite stubborn.

34
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,710
Don't blame her.

35
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,650
Something like this happened to her mother

36
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,520
And everyone knows about it.

37
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,520
She must feel quite embarrassed.

38
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,990
Don't tell anyone.

39
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,690
Or it'll sound like I'm gossipy.

40
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,360
I know.

41
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,770
But listen to me.

42
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,170
Don't be angry with her.

43
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,700
Try call her again.

44
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,710
Why?

45
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,310
Why?

46
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,440
Why am I always the one who don't understand her?

47
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,610
Why do I always make peace with her first?

48
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:31,020
Why am I always the one who forgive her first?

49
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,620
Why am I always the generous one?

50
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,920
Always the idiot?

51
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,120
That's why she thinks I'm stupid.

52
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:37,860
Hey.

53
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,960
Tung doesn't think you're stupid.

54
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,090
Yes, she does.

55
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:41,990
She said it herself.

56
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,900
She always thinks she's better than others.

57
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,360
She says she's an alien

58
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,230
And we people on Earth are inferior.

59
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:47,970
If it weren't for me back then,

60
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,670
She'd still have no friends.

61
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,580
You've said that many times.

62
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,480
Don't keep saying that.

63
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,650
You make it sound as if

64
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,880
You made friends with her

65
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,320
Because you pitied her.

66
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,120
This…

67
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,290
…is a very bad attitude, you know?

68
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,530
I didn't say anything wrong.

69
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,430
Back then was Tung

70
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,300
Really that unpopular?

71
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,329
She wasn't unpopular.

72
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,740
It was just she didn't have much to say to others.

73
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,070
The things she liked were different.

74
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,270
Young,

75
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,910
listen.

76
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,780
When I first arrived in Taiwan,

77
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,780
Sometimes when Dad was chatting to his friends

78
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,250
Or when I heard him chatting to the customers…

79
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,550
They were chatting

80
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,120
So happily that

81
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,560
They laughed out loud.

82
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,990
I laughed with them too.

83
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,990
But in fact,

84
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,100
I had no idea what they were talking about.

85
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,200
Just because they laughed

86
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,330
I laughed too.

87
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,570
Or it'd feel strange.

88
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,800
Back then your Chinese wasn't very good.

89
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:01,170
No.

90
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,710
I knew no one.

91
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,940
Apart from your dad, I had no friends.

92
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,280
Because my Chinese was bad

93
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,920
I didn't dare to go shopping.

94
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,590
And for a while,

95
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,060
I hid myself at home.

96
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,730
I didn't dare to go out at all.

97
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:26,760
Why did you never tell me about these?

98
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:31,700
Oops

99
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,070
Listen.

100
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,270
At that time,

101
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,340
I felt

102
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,540
I was like an alien.

103
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,610
I was so afraid of being found out, you know?

104
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,290
Tung is different from you.

105
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,090
She's never afraid of being herself.

106
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,930
She never cares about what others think.

107
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,990
Sometimes, I feel she doesn't need me at all.

108
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,100
Is that true?

109
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,570
But when you're always alone,

110
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,570
You'll feel lonely.

111
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:08,940
Mom.

112
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:10,810
Are you homesick?

113
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,580
Of course, I am.

114
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,210
When I first arrived,

115
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,550
I got so homesick

116
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,980
That I cried.

117
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,680
I hid myself and cried.

118
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,390
I didn't want your dad to know.

119
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,090
But now it's different.

120
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,530
This is my home.

121
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,830
Vietnam is your home too.

122
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,000
Yes.

123
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:34,600
Hey.

124
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,070
I haven't been back for Lunar New Year for ages.

125
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,500
For how long?

126
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,340
Since you were born.

127
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,380
So long?

128
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,250
Hm.

129
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:50,920
The flight tickets are very expensive.

130
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,320
No need to save that money.

131
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,320
This winter vacation

132
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,190
We'll all go to Vietnam for Lunar New Year.

133
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,130
Then…

134
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,670
You'll have to talk to your parents.

135
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,300
Or they would be very unhappy.

136
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,740
No, they won't.

137
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,370
We'll take them to Vietnam to visit their in-laws.

138
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,480
We'll go on a family trip.

139
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,110
Dad, you're so cool!

140
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,580
Of course, I am.

141
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,610
We'll book the flight tickets straightaway.

142
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:22,450
You can't regret it.

143
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:23,980
I absolutely won't.

144
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,180
Book the hotel too.

145
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,620
It's cheaper to book them together.

146
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,120
Tung.

147
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,390
It's alright if you don't want to come home.

148
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,060
At least let me know where you are.

149
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:13,200
Are you safe?

150
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,500
Or I'll call the police.

151
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,740
If you don't want to leave me a message,

152
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,710
At least call Young.

153
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,610
Let me know you're safe.

154
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,460
Hello Young?

155
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,490
Hello?

156
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,190
This is Ms. Kuo.

157
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:15,660
Tung has gone missing.

158
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,130
Is she with you?

159
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:24,140
Dad, Mom.

160
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,270
Tung has gone missing.

161
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,670
Come on, I'm going to look for her.

162
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,610
Hurry up.

163
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,310
Hello, what's up?

164
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:32,910
Tung is missing.

165
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:33,910
What?

166
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,010
Missing?

167
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,850
Wait for me. I'll leave at once.

168
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,350
I got it. I'll go now.

169
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,090
Well, what time is it?

170
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,820
Where are you going to look for her?

171
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,360
Doesn't matter. I'll start looking first.

172
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,270
Hey, wait till Ms. Kuo calls you.

173
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,360
Here I am!

174
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,260
Young.

175
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,000
Whoa, I want to ride it.

176
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,030
I want to ride it.

177
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,030
Stop messing around.

178
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,140
Shao is too slow.

179
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,300
You wait for him here. Let's go now.

180
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:32,800
Oh.

181
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,110
You know where to go?

182
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:34,870
I know.

183
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,510
It's a bit hard to describe where it is.

184
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:37,780
Shao can track my location on his phone.

185
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,110
Follow it to find us.

186
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:39,680
Okay, okay.

187
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,610
Off you go.

188
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,830
Why are you so late?

189
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:57,500
Where are they?

190
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,560
They left first.

191
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:08,440
No.

192
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,670
Let me call the police.

193
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,010
Argh, it's not that serious.

194
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:12,810
For Christ's sake.

195
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,810
Don't tell the whole world about it, okay?

196
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,450
It's not the first time.

197
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,250
She deliberately wants to make us worried.

198
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,120
She'll come back soon.

199
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:22,590
It's different.

200
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,060
This time I told her everything.

201
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,120
What did you tell her?

202
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:29,060
I told her everything.

203
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,700
You've got a new family.

204
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,360
Your child is already five years old.

205
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,500
Recently, I've been seeing someone.

206
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,640
In the past five years, we've been acting, lying to her.

207
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,870
Call her again.

208
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,340
I've called so many times.

209
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,940
She turned her phone off.

210
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,880
Don't think too much.

211
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:48,750
She's grown up.

212
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,710
She won't get into trouble.

213
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,120
Tung.

214
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,690
Where are you?

215
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:55,920
This is Dad.

216
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,390
Call me back at once.

217
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,620
Why did you sound so tough?

218
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,390
Don't you know what she is like?

219
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,760
Of course I know what she is like.

220
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,660
Or why would I do as you asked that

221
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,330
We wouldn't get divorced till she finished high school?

222
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,430
What you mean "do as I asked"?

223
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,770
It was something we both agreed on.

224
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,770
You don't even know I was just

225
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,000
Playing along with you?

226
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,400
Playing along?

227
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,670
With me?

228
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,610
Don't you care about your daughter?

229
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,440
In this case, neither of us needs you.

230
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,910
I lie to Tung for you.

231
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,710
Allowing you to play a good father.

232
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,180
You aren't doing it for me.

233
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,850
Of course not for you.

234
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,120
I'm doing it for my daughter.

235
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:27,990
Okay.

236
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,490
It's my fault.

237
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,020
I deserve it.

238
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,560
I'm a bastard, okay?

239
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,130
Since we've made it clear,

240
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:35,760
Let's sign the papers and get it done.

241
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,990
You don't need to say that.

242
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:38,930
I've got it ready.

243
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:40,160
I've signed.

244
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:52,640
Tung.

245
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,720
Ms. Kuo.

246
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,500
We're nearly there.

247
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,870
Over there.

248
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,230
How did you know she's there?

249
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,710
It was the place

250
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:26,280
Where I really got to know Tung for the first time.

251
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,850
In the summer when we were in tenth grade,

252
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:28,980
We went on a day trip with our classmates.

253
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,210
Weirdo. -Yep.

254
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,920
She comes to the beach but doesn't have fun.

255
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,850
Reading, eh?

256
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:33,850
Look at how she dresses.

257
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,320
So pretentious.

258
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:41,160
Everyone had left.

259
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,400
But Tung insisted on picking up
all the trash before leaving.

260
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,330
She said,

261
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:50,270
"Only when Earth becomes clean

262
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,670
Can we feel good."

263
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,040
I remember back then

264
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,280
I thought the girl standing before me

265
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,880
Was so cool.

266
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:07,320
At that moment,

267
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,120
I knew we would be best friends.

268
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,570
Tung.

269
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:37,550
Tung.

270
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,820
Tung.

271
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,360
I'm sorry.

272
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,530
I won't forgive you.

273
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:56,300
I'll punish you.

274
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,840
I'm sorry.

275
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:00,270
I'm sorry.

276
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,280
I can't believe you've found me.

277
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,210
Can't believe you still remember it.

278
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:12,250
I didn't realize it either.

279
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,320
Young.

280
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:21,760
My parents are getting divorced.

281
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,680
Tung.

282
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:43,550
I made friends with you definitely not out of pity.

283
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,420
I really like you.

284
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,150
I really love you.

285
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,520
Me too.

286
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,390
You're my best friend.

287
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:04,230
I don't like fighting with you.

288
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,000
Shao.

289
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,570
You lost.

290
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,110
Tung is Young's true love.

291
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:13,010
I don't like fighting with you.

292
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:17,250
I won't do it again.

293
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,250
I'm sorry.

294
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,290
We must be

295
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:23,250
Best friends.

296
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,210
It's ringing.

297
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:48,950
Young.

298
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,610
Hello, wait.

299
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:51,480
Let me put you on speaker.

300
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,450
Dad.

301
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,590
Young, this is Ms. Kuo.

302
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,850
Have you found Tung?

303
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:58,120
I've found Tung.

304
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,690
We're safe. Don't worry.

305
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:01,560
Tung.

306
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,990
Are you there? Tung?

307
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:03,860
Make a sound.

308
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,930
The battery is low.

309
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,130
Only one percent.

310
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:09,700
It's dead.

311
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,170
Hung up.

312
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,609
It's all your fault.

313
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:17,010
See how you've spoiled your daughter!

314
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,440
It's fine as long as Tung is found.

315
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,280
As long as Tung is found.

316
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:30,950
So cold.

317
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,490
Really cold.

318
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:33,820
Yeah, really cold.

319
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,490
Yes, I feel so cold.

320
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:41,900
What are you doing here?

321
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,470
Come to watch the sunrise?

322
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,400
But you can't see it in this direction.

323
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:46,900
No…

324
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:48,710
We're just chatting.

325
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,040
Chatting?

326
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,080
Don't you feel cold chatting like this?

327
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,240
Yes, a bit.

328
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,250
It's cold.

329
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,220
Have hot pot.

330
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,420
It warms you up quicker.

331
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:03,550
Thank you, coach.

332
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,820
You're welcome.

333
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:05,920
Hey.

334
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:07,960
Wanna drink?

335
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,160
I can't believe you've found it.

336
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:12,830
Thank you, coach.

337
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,640
Darling.

338
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,850
Did you feel that they…

339
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,350
You felt that too?

340
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,020
Hm.

341
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,220
Then what will happen to Tung?

342
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,720
Don't worry.

343
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,330
She has our Young.

344
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:46,060
Our Young can't have a boyfriend at this age.

345
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,800
She can't.

346
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,210
Wow.

347
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:03,450
Butterfly!

348
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,150
Well no…

349
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,280
Didn't you want a blue one?

350
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,390
Why is it black?

351
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,550
Black suits me.

352
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,390
No, it doesn't.

353
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,320
And you got it already.

354
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,090
How about me?

355
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,860
It's okay if you have a different one.

356
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,830
Yeah, right, Sheng.

357
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,330
Why did you

358
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:19,500
Tattoo an eagle on your back?

359
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,700
Yeah, why?

360
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,600
Because I was drunk at that time.

361
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,540
It's true.

362
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:30,610
Then…

363
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,210
Do you regret it?

364
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,480
Not really.

365
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,260
Young.

366
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,400
The tattoo…

367
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,000
Have it only if you want.

368
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,630
If you don't, don't get it.

369
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:58,170
I asked Shao.

370
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:01,510
He thinks it's sexy for a girl to have tattoos.

371
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,370
Don't do it for me.

372
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,080
Or for Shao.

373
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:08,110
Do it for yourself.

374
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:11,010
After all, once it's tattooed, it's there forever.

375
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,850
Do you regret it?

376
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:15,750
No.

377
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,890
Okay, go to sleep.

378
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:22,860
Goodnight.

379
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,880
I know you're still angry.

380
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,720
You may think you'll ignore me
for the rest of your life.

381
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,890
It's alright.

382
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,290
I know how we interact with each other

383
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,230
Is very different from other parents
with their children.

384
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,630
But it was the first time I became a mother.

385
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,300
There were many things

386
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,270
I didn't get them right.

387
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,910
I've been learning along the way.

388
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,150
What I want to say is…

389
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:58,520
No matter who I go out with now

390
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,020
Or in the future,

391
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,530
The person I love the most

392
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,830
Is Tung.

393
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,670
Even if in the future,

394
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,210
The person she loves the most

395
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,610
Might not be me.

396
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,250
She is my daughter.

397
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:33,290
This is the smell of Mom.

398
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:38,660
Goodnight.

399
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,270
Good morning.

400
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,490
Does it look good?

401
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,130
A bit tight.

402
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,500
Beautiful?

403
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,570
Really beautiful.

404
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,410
Does it look pretty?

405
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:58,440
Hey, Young.

406
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:01,240
Do you think I should put the phone horizontally

407
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,580
Or vertically when I film it tomorrow?

408
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,510
Horizontally, of course.

409
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,820
The stage is wide.

410
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,650
That's right.

411
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:07,950
Hey.

412
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,320
Let's go to the venue earlier tomorrow.

413
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:12,120
So I can find a good angle for filming.

414
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:13,560
Okay.

415
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,260
Now I'm getting nervous.

416
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,700
Oh my God!

417
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,730
Look.

418
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,100
You keep filming.

419
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,000
Now they're getting nervous.

420
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,870
Stop filming.

421
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:27,870
No.

422
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,240
It's a rare occasion.

423
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,270
It's okay, Mom.

424
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,540
It's your first time to be on the stage.

425
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,010
Maybe you won't have another chance.

426
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:35,250
That's right.

427
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,050
There is no chance.

428
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:38,980
Me too.

429
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,820
Me too.

430
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:42,650
What?

431
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:46,120
I'm going to give you flowers on the stage.

432
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,690
So, I have to go on the stage too.

433
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,130
I want flowers too.

434
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,760
Me too.

435
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:54,430
Really?

436
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:55,070
Me too.

437
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:55,670
Yes.

438
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:56,970
A bouquet for each of you.

439
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,010
Come on.

440
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,450
The presentation is about to start.

441
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:38,010
Excuse me, is this seat taken?

442
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:38,580
No, take it.

443
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,980
Okay, thanks. Thanks.

444
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:43,080
Everyone, be seated as soon as possible.

445
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,420
Why didn't you two have the costume with you?

446
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,290
It's too much trouble to fetch it from home.

447
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:49,690
We can dance without it.

448
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:50,390
Yes.

449
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,390
I bet you deliberately forgot it.

450
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,760
Stand apart.

451
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,460
Two steps apart.

452
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,110
Didn't we agree not to wear it?

453
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:17,950
Or…

454
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,150
It's enough that Sheng has put it on.

455
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,320
No!

456
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:20,920
Even my mom has put it on.

457
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,290
You two definitely have to put it on.

458
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:24,420
You two really piss me off.

459
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,420
I just forgot to bring it.

460
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:34,900
What?

461
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,440
Today, our first team

462
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,710
Is about to start performing.

463
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:15,010
Sorry, sorry.

464
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:16,210
Sir.

465
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:17,410
What happened to your costume?

466
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,810
Er…

467
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:19,640
Fine, hurry up, hurry up.

468
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,410
You're running late.

469
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:22,380
Off you go.

470
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:58,480
So many why, why, why

471
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,450
No need to guess

472
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:04,590
Just seize this moment, uh wo

473
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,960
who am I I I

474
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,030
No need to guess

475
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:13,260
Love with all your heart, don't wait

476
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,130
why why why

477
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,630
Dear Martian,

478
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:18,800
Although Earth isn't a big place,

479
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,740
It can accommodate all of us.

480
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:24,410
Whether you're a Martian,

481
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:25,980
A Mercurian,

482
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,410
Or a Saturnian,

483
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:31,010
As long as you arrive on this planet,

484
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:32,680
You'll become part of us.

485
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,050
On this planet,

486
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:37,620
Everyone is an earthling.

487
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,590
So many why, why, why

488
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,560
No need to guess

489
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,860
who am I I I

490
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,900
No need to guess

491
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,800
Say hi, hi, hi

492
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:52,440
Love with all your heart

493
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,200
Mom.

494
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,510
Mom.

495
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,710
Yo, fantastic.

496
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:58,480
Dad.

497
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,610
So rarely that everyone is dressed up.

498
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:01,680
Let's take a photo together.

499
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,350
Okay?

500
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,280
Yes.

501
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,350
I'm going to see Tung.

502
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,020
Only Tung, okay?

503
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,680
Hey, leave her alone.

504
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,090
She'll grow up one day.

505
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:10,350
Tung. -Go.

506
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,820
Are you bullying my Tung?

507
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,590
What’s up?

508
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,130
Here you are babe. -Hit him.

509
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,760
I'm hitting your baby.

510
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,660
Why hit me?

511
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,900
Why hit him?

512
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:21,770
Weird.

513
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:22,600
You deserve it.

514
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,670
This is my mom.

515
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,340
Hello Mrs. Ku.

516
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,240
Hello everyone.

517
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:28,870
Mom.

518
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,540
This is Shao.

519
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:31,540
Nice to meet you.

520
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,410
This is Yen.

521
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:33,510
Hi

522
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,610
This is…

523
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,680
Tung.

524
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,150
Young.

525
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:41,890
Nice to meet you, auntie.

526
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,020
Your performance was really great.

527
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,260
Thank you, auntie.

528
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:46,660
Don't lie.

529
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,760
No, I really enjoyed it.

530
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:55,000
Is your son cool?

531
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:57,600
Yes, very cool.

532
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,970
My mom says I'm cool.

533
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,100
Cool?

534
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,470
Cool.

535
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:03,940
I… -No.

536
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,550
Miss Lo, I gotta go.

537
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,510
Talk soon, good bye.

538
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,180
Shao.

539
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,350
Mom.

540
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:17,990
Just now I…

541
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,990
How was my performance?

542
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,290
Not bad.

543
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:26,260
You keep a high profile in school, don't you?

544
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,260
Mr. Luo.

545
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,500
No, I don't…

546
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,140
I don't.

547
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:39,810
We look good.

548
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,080
Right?

549
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:45,820
He fell.

550
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,120
Limp.

551
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,130
We look good, don't we?

552
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:58,660
Because I filmed it well.

553
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:05,000
I don’t want to know, Don’t tell me.

554
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:10,140
We have to face the reality.

555
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:12,510
I knew the Pop Dance Club would come first

556
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,280
Stop saying that.

557
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,350
Sheng, why are you so quiet?

558
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:17,510
I’m working. Shut up, you all!

559
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:38,840
Aaaaah!

560
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,840
I haven't started yet.

561
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,480
I'm starting.

562
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,240
Yes.

563
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:50,410
It's okay.

564
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:51,650
Just bear with it.

565
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,520
So…

566
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,460
Are you seeing him or not?

567
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,530
No.

568
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,930
Nothing happened after that.

569
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,100
He didn't ask you out?

570
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,030
No.

571
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:14,700
Then did you ask him if he was the Martian?

572
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:17,170
No.

573
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,910
Ah.

574
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:22,750
I know.

575
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,810
Because he already asked you to go to that…

576
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:25,780
…J something.

577
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,550
A1J.

578
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:29,020
Yes.

579
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,830
It's done.

580
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,100
So small?

581
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,630
It looks like a wound.

582
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,130
Yes.

583
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,370
A mosquito bite is bigger than this.

584
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:48,000
Yeah.

585
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,870
It looks like a mosquito bite.

586
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,640
No way.

587
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,710
It's just a gesture.

588
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,610
Yeah?

589
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:56,110
Mm.

590
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:58,250
Yeah?

591
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,980
Stop.

592
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,150
It looks very sexy.

593
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:03,120
Very sexy?

594
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:03,750
Mm.

595
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:05,150
No, it doesn't.

596
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,060
So sexy…

597
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,090
How?

598
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,830
Tung.

599
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:12,530
Tung.

600
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:13,460
What?

601
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:15,670
Where are my vacuum bottles?

602
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,100
What vacuum bottles?

603
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,740
Those bottles I collected before.

604
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,010
Where have they gone?

605
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,710
Did we give them away

606
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:26,310
After the spring cleaning?

607
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:27,910
No way.

608
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:30,580
Eh, or did we get burgled?

609
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,950
Let me help you find them.

610
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,720
Strange…

611
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,250
No?

612
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:41,660
The taxi is here.

613
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:42,530
Oh.

614
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:43,560
I'm leaving.

615
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:47,730
I've called the moving company.

616
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,970
When they arrive,

617
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:50,570
Just tell them

618
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,830
Which things to pack.

619
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:52,470
Oh.

620
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:53,100
Okay.

621
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,280
Tung.

622
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,050
It's better for Mom

623
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:05,110
That I move out.

624
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,450
Later

625
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:08,179
I'll find a new home in Taipei.

626
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,820
If you like,

627
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:10,790
You can come live with me

628
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,960
Any time.

629
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:24,670
Then I'm off.

630
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:33,280
Tung.

631
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,280
I’ve followed you on the app.

632
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,780
You can follow me too.

633
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:41,980
If there is anything,

634
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,449
You can call me at any time.

635
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,790
I'm using another app now.

636
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,330
Which one?

637
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:50,659
Just a social and communication app.

638
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:51,460
Go learn about it.

639
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,030
Yes.

640
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:53,900
I'll do.

641
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:57,930
I'm leaving.

642
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:20,020
Miss.

643
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,490
Didn't you say you'd help me find the bottles?

644
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:22,730
What happened?

645
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:23,690
No idea.

646
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:26,360
Grrr, come on, help me find them.

647
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,400
I'm going out.

648
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,070
It's always you who tidy the place.

649
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:29,670
Okay.

650
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,900
Come on.

651
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:32,700
Let me help you find them.

652
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,040
Everyone.

653
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,440
The winter vacation begins.

654
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,910
Don’t go crazy, okay?

655
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:41,740
Wait.

656
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,650
Wait, wait, wait.

657
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:43,150
What?

658
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:45,150
Our class chat group. Remember to check it.

659
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:47,520
Vote for the winter vacation trip, okay?

660
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,780
Okay.

661
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,690
And pay the fees, remember to pay the fees.

662
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:52,390
Okay.

663
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:54,320
It's voluntary. Or you'll be doomed.

664
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:54,960
Yes.

665
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,260
Yes, I mean you!

666
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:58,230
Pay the fees or you'll be doomed.

667
00:35:59,160 --> 00:35:59,900
My bag.

668
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,900
Okay.

669
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,070
Push the chairs in.

670
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,050
You found a diary, didn't you?

671
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,260
This is the gents.

672
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,360
If you don't answer me, I won't leave.

673
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,730
Fine.

674
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,330
What are you looking at?

675
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:47,960
Let's talk outside.

676
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:49,430
Hey, that's mine

677
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:50,900
Hey.

678
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,300
Hey, who are you?

679
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,380
Thanks.

680
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:08,980
You’re welcome.

681
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:11,890
A long time ago,

682
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:14,190
I had once wished

683
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:16,730
I could have a pair of wings.

684
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,860
But at that time, I didn't know

685
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:25,170
Growing a pair of wings was hard enough,

686
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:31,040
Let alone open the wings and fly towards the unknown.

687
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,340
It requires the courage I never have.

688
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:50,290
I'm not sure if I'm ready or not.

689
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:53,600
But it's not important anymore.

690
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,270
Finally, I come to realize

691
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:59,030
You saw who I was long ago.

692
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,000
And because of you

693
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,670
I can finally

694
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:05,540
See myself.

695
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:18,790
Sheng.

696
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:31,800
I'm…

697
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:35,300
…very nervous.

698
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:39,610
Me too.

699
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:43,450
Why are you nervous?

700
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,760
Every time I see you,

701
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,390
I feel very nervous.

702
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,940
Oh I

703
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:15,310
oh I

704
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:19,350
You’be mine

705
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:23,120
Don’t keep trying

706
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:27,960
to run away my love just stay just stay

707
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,490
don’t keep runnin away

708
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:32,390
Let me call you "baby"

709
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:34,500
Let me get drunk, let me

710
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,700
Let me fall, let me

711
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:40,570
Burst into tears, be taken aback,
I don't understand myself

712
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:45,910
Oh I

713
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:50,280
oh I

714
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:54,320
You’be mine

715
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:29,510
Young.

716
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:32,280
Where are you going with such a big suitcase?

717
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,480
Argh, let me do it myself.

718
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,650
Leave me alone.

719
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:39,420
I'll put the pineapple cakes here.

720
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:40,120
Mom.

721
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:42,420
Why is there a box of pineapple cakes in my suitcase?

722
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:45,660
Young.

723
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,660
Why do you need a teddy on a trip?

724
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,000
Are you a little kid?

725
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,370
Mind your own business.

726
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:52,970
Grrr, Dad, let me do it myself.

727
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:53,670
No.

728
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:55,340
Listen, there are tips for packing.

729
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:56,240
I'll sort it.

730
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,540
Let me sort it and you'll see.

731
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:58,310
Okay?

732
00:43:58,610 --> 00:43:59,340
Mom.

733
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:00,980
You put the pineapple cakes there, right?

734
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:02,240
Who are you?

735
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,550
Do I know you?

736
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:06,380
How long will you keep saying that?

737
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:07,780
It's your fault.

738
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,590
You didn't come home once during the semester.

739
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:12,190
The train tickets are very expensive.

740
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:14,360
Did we ask you to pay for that?

741
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:16,730
Finding excuses, eh?

742
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,730
Mom, just put them in another bag.

743
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,100
How many boxes do you need?

744
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,170
Hey.

745
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:26,040
Who are you?

746
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,100
Are you my son?

747
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:29,410
I hardly recognize you.

748
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:30,740
Dad.

749
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,940
Grrr, you all, get out.

750
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,440
Let me do it myself.

751
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:37,480
Fine, fine.

752
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,610
Do it yourself.

753
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,690
I was going on a round-the-island trip with my friends.

754
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:44,120
Go in summer vacation instead.

755
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:47,260
Later

756
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,290
I'll put a few boxes of sun cakes here.

757
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:52,330
No need to guess

758
00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:56,500
we gonn fly fly fly to the sky go high

759
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,430
who am I I I

760
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:00,640
No need to guess

761
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:03,070
The bear says bye-bye to you.

762
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:04,240
Give it back to me.

763
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,010
Mom, look at Bro!
