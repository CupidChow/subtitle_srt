1
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,510
Tung.

2
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,320
Tung.

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,220
Please don't be angry, okay?

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,620
I did go to the tattoo parlor that day.

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,860
I didn't expect it to close so early.

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,060
Stop being angry.

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,390
Or let's make another appointment.

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:22,490
See what time suits you.

9
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:23,530
I'm fine with it.

10
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:29,530
You already got it?

11
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,200
And it's a caterpillar.

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,200
Didn't we agree on a butterfly?

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,810
What's wrong with a caterpillar?

14
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,040
If you're serious about apologizing,

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,640
Go have a caterpillar tattoo.

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,250
Don't be like this, okay?

17
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,950
You can't change your mind once it's tattooed.

18
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,110
This is what I want. -Tung.

19
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,020
Let's go eat something, alright?

20
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:45,720
Go, go.

21
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:48,850
Yen.

22
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:51,090
Stop pursuing me.

23
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,360
It's Shao who I fancy.

24
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:01,700
Then…

25
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,170
Like this, I cut off

26
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,770
The only connection between me and Earth.

27
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,340
It's dark in the universe.

28
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,640
Dear Martian,

29
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,340
Now, apart from you,

30
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,580
I have nothing else.

31
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:22,420
I knew it.

32
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,060
Don't get the wrong idea.

33
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,720
So, you're the Martian.

34
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:27,060
What Martian?

35
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:28,789
You've been lying to me.

36
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:29,390
No, I haven't.

37
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,330
I really didn't know Tung fancied me.

38
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:32,560
Then who on earth do you fancy?

39
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,700
I've got a girlfriend. Who else do I fancy?

40
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,400
I'm going home.

41
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,170
Young.

42
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,440
Young.

43
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,140
There is really nothing between Tung and me.

44
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,009
Let go of me.

45
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,280
Don't you run after her?

46
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,320
I don't know what's going on. Why should I?

47
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,950
Because you're seeing both of them.

48
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:54,750
I'm not.

49
00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:56,420
But they both fancy you.

50
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:57,620
Yep.

51
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,990
So what should I do?

52
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:03,700
Yen.

53
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:05,730
Are you alright?

54
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:06,360
What?

55
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,530
Didn't you get rejected just now?

56
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,000
Yeah, right.

57
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,340
The girl I fancy

58
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,540
Was snatched away by my buddy.

59
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,910
I didn't want to snatch her at all.

60
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,310
Stop.

61
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,410
You didn't want to snatch her.

62
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,010
That makes it even more tragic.

63
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,710
You don't look too sad though.

64
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,310
Stop pretending.

65
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,180
No…

66
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,550
I was so shocked that I failed to react.

67
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,220
I'm the one who is shocked.

68
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,520
I need time to digest it.

69
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,750
You two, take your time.

70
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,590
I'm off.

71
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,820
Hey, Sheng.

72
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,130
Hey, where are you going?

73
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,490
Shouldn't you be comforting us?

74
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,030
Come on.

75
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,100
（Ep.4 Girls Are Troublesome）

76
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:13,730
Young.

77
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:27,650
I'll go check.

78
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,050
I'm sorry.

79
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:40,829
Tung.

80
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:44,500
So, the Martian isn't the art teacher.

81
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,230
Then in the past two weeks,

82
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:47,500
Who on earth have you been corresponding with?

83
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,200
But didn't you say

84
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,540
They three were the most suspicious?

85
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,370
You worry it might be Shao?

86
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,410
No.

87
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,440
Still so much left.

88
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,410
Tung, you waste a lot of food.

89
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,250
Young.

90
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:12,920
What?

91
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,830
Why did you come up?

92
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,029
No one is holding the fort.

93
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:17,200
It's fine.

94
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,100
Just for a minute.

95
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,370
She locked the door?

96
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,500
Shall I go get the key?

97
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:22,670
No need.

98
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,640
You know she's a cry-baby.

99
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,140
She'll be fine after crying.

100
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,540
Go back to work.

101
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,940
It's okay. They're all regulars.

102
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,080
How can you be so sloppy?

103
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,620
No wonder we never have more customers.

104
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,220
What a crappy phone!

105
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,820
The battery always goes dead at the crucial moment.

106
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,590
Told you ages ago I need a new phone!

107
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:49,530
A new phone.

108
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,800
You've ruined my life!

109
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,890
（voice message）

110
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,700
I'm having dinner with my colleagues.

111
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,030
Not sure when I'll be home.

112
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,570
Don't wait up for me.

113
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,870
I'll call you when I'm on my way home.

114
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,210
Okay, bye.

115
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,800
Whoa!

116
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,300
Luckily Young hasn't seen you like this.

117
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,370
Or I'll feel so much pressure.

118
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,670
Hey, mister.

119
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,110
Instead of worrying about this,

120
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,680
You should think about how you'll apologize to Young.

121
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:13,880
Why should he apologize?

122
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,780
He did nothing wrong.

123
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,010
Yep.

124
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:16,950
I did nothing wrong.

125
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,820
When a girl is angry,

126
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,990
It doesn't matter

127
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,120
If you did anything wrong.

128
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,190
Anyway, apologize to her first.

129
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,390
Seriously, I'm not lying to you.

130
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,960
You sound as if you had girlfriends before.

131
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,330
Before you could walk,

132
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,600
I was seeing Lucia,

133
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,130
the mermaid.

134
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:34,270
Sheng, I'd like to order.

135
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,900
You two have fun.

136
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,240
Okay. I'm back to work.

137
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:38,940
All my colleagues are off tonight.

138
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,370
Okay.

139
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:39,940
Bye bye.

140
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:40,510
Bye.

141
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:44,540
Hey

142
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,440
Can you play?

143
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,040
No. Can you?

144
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,280
It doesn't matter.

145
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,550
No one is watching.

146
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,380
That's true.

147
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,500
Young.

148
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,070
Hey.

149
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:53,980
Well.

150
00:07:54,409 --> 00:07:55,850
Girls are so troublesome.

151
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,680
Yep.

152
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,250
Then do you want to pursue Tung?

153
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,390
She doesn't fancy me.

154
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,990
You give up so easily?

155
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,600
Tell you what.

156
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,560
A real man

157
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,960
Knows when to let go.

158
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:15,070
There are so many tress in the woods.

159
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,170
So many fish in the sea.

160
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:16,930
They're all waiting for

161
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,070
Me, Yen.

162
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,740
Before I graduate from senior high,

163
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,640
I'll definitely find one.

164
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:24,010
Go!

165
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:24,980
You can do it.

166
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:29,380
Prince Shao.

167
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,820
You had better stay away from me.

168
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,990
It's all your fault I failed to ask any girls out.

169
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:35,490
Well.

170
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,250
You're very attractive too.

171
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,760
Really?

172
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,630
If you were a girl,

173
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:43,159
Between Shao and me,

174
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,030
Who would you choose?

175
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:51,970
I knew he wouldn't choose me.

176
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,540
I'm not a girl.

177
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,410
How would I know?

178
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:55,370
Fine.

179
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:56,910
He doesn't count.

180
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,580
If you were a girl,

181
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,680
Between Sheng and me,

182
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,410
Who would you choose?

183
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,660
Damn, neither of you choose me.

184
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,930
Well, no.

185
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:15,830
I'm thinking hard.

186
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,090
One is an ex.

187
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:18,430
The other is a new buddy.

188
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,570
It's hard to choose.

189
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:22,670
What do you mean "ex"?

190
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,300
Yen.

191
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,540
I'll definitely choose you.

192
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:26,500
I don't believe you.

193
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,440
Seriously, I like you more.

194
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,370
Don't feel sorry for me. I mean it.

195
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:31,510
You don't believe me?

196
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:33,610
Come over.

197
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,550
What do you want?

198
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:35,610
Come over.

199
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,650
Whoa, what do you want?

200
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,120
I want to prove my love for you.

201
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,750
No need.

202
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,220
No kiss.

203
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,190
Yes.

204
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:45,960
You turn me down?

205
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,860
You'll break my heart.

206
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,260
If you get closer, I'll…

207
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,090
If you get closer,

208
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:49,890
I'll break your arm.

209
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,530
Come on.

210
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:54,870
I'm not afraid.

211
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:55,770
Get off.

212
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,480
Attention, everyone.

213
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,150
Get ready for holding your breath.

214
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,680
Ready, go.

215
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,120
You already got it?

216
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,920
And it's a caterpillar.

217
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,360
Didn't we agree on a butterfly?

218
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,990
What's wrong with a caterpillar?

219
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,400
If you're serious about apologizing,

220
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,830
Go get a caterpillar tattoo.

221
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,530
Don't be so bossy.

222
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,180
It's Shao who I fancy.

223
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,430
Tung.

224
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,110
Tung.

225
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,380
Tung.

226
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,140
Are you alright?

227
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,420
Tung.

228
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,120
Retake the test next time.

229
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,030
Make sure you learn how to hold your breath.

230
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:03,160
You understand?

231
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,980
Wow, so cool.

232
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,510
Really?

233
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,110
Mm.

234
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,710
You don't feel a caterpillar is disgusting?

235
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,150
Is it?

236
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,520
Sheng, what do you think?

237
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,420
No.

238
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,590
A caterpillar will turn into a butterfly, right?

239
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,520
Wow, it's true.

240
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,290
So, that's what the caterpillar means.

241
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,260
But maybe it's not a caterpillar

242
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:36,660
But a maggot.

243
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:38,330
It'll turn into a fly.

244
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,660
You're so wicked. -So rude.

245
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,000
Anyway, it looks great.

246
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,330
Really?

247
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,240
The class is starting. Back to your seats.

248
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,780
Tung.

249
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,510
Go to the school counselor after the class.

250
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:55,750
Sheng, you too.

251
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,710
Why?

252
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:57,820
What do you mean why?

253
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,020
We care about you.

254
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,650
It's just a tattoo. Why make such a fuss?

255
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,320
Whoa…

256
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,590
Quiet.

257
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,360
Don't argue with me.

258
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:08,790
You…

259
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:09,760
Talk to the school counselor.

260
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,230
You think we'll be led astray?

261
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,730
Enough. Let's start the class.

262
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,500
Open your math textbook to p.86.

263
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,570
Sir.

264
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,740
Tattoo is an art.

265
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,810
Don't be influenced by the bias in our society.

266
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,480
That's a stereotype.

267
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,510
Whoa.

268
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,010
Enough, enough.

269
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:28,650
We're in class.

270
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:29,550
P. 86.

271
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,020
Today we'll learn differential of a function.

272
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,660
You still don't admit she's your girlfriend?

273
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:43,330
She really isn't.

274
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:44,730
She likes someone else.

275
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,900
Likes someone else.

276
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,570
Clearly, she's waiting for you to finish work.

277
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,270
No, she isn't.

278
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,210
She just needs a place to stay.

279
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,210
Go.

280
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:02,810
Hurry up.

281
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:03,680
Leave the rest to me.

282
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:04,780
Go, now.

283
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:05,520
Go.

284
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,690
Or I'll dock your wages.

285
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,560
Put the helmet on.

286
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,330
No.

287
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,580
If you take it off again,

288
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,920
I'll leave you by the roadside.

289
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:38,920
Fine.

290
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,450
Leave me by the roadside.

291
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,620
If you have the guts, ask your mom directly.

292
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,660
Stop being difficult and making people pity you.

293
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,470
Tung, what are you doing?

294
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,330
I'll go home by myself.

295
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,100
Let me give you a ride.

296
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,270
No need, thanks.

297
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,970
I've been trying so hard not to be stubborn.

298
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,940
And trying so hard to be understanding.

299
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,580
What I hate the most

300
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,140
is people pitying me.

301
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,280
Don't intervene in my business.

302
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,890
You think I love intervening in your business?

303
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,060
Such a bad temper.

304
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,100
No wonder no one dares to ask you out.

305
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,300
My best wishes to Yen as he pursues you.

306
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,370
I feel sorry for Shao as you fancy him.

307
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:37,940
You're back.

308
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,010
Have you eaten?

309
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,050
Where did you go on that day?

310
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,480
What happened to your hair?

311
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,850
I saw it all.

312
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,580
What did you see?

313
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,220
That hair color is temporary, isn't it?

314
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,320
Yes, don't you think it looks great?

315
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,890
What happened to you?

316
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,360
Did you have a fight with Young?

317
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,630
Yes, we did. We fell out.

318
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,060
All because of you.

319
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,400
Where on earth did you go that day?

320
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,630
What on earth are you talking about?

321
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:01,300
Which day?

322
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,900
That day I came home very late.

323
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,600
Recently, you come home late every day.

324
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,500
I saw it all.

325
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,310
I saw you play billiards with a guy.

326
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,510
Why did you lie to me?

327
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,810
No wonder you have no time to go out with me.

328
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,750
It turns out you went on a date with that guy.

329
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,850
If you don't want me anymore,

330
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,120
You could have told me.

331
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,650
Make it clear so I wouldn't have become like this.

332
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,490
I'm always very independent.

333
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:23,590
I can be on my own.

334
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,220
I don't need anyone.

335
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:41,530
Tung.

336
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,540
I didn't mean to lie to you.

337
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,440
Who on earth was that guy?

338
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,240
He was a friend I met at college.

339
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,260
No way.

340
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,130
How could you meet at college?

341
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,430
He looks so old.

342
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,840
Why did you play billiards together that day?

343
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,710
Just now you said

344
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,110
I had no time for you.

345
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,240
In fact, have you ever thought

346
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,510
It's you who have no time for me?

347
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,010
Really?

348
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:30,850
Yes.

349
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,520
Since you became good friends with Young last year,

350
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,450
We've rarely hung out with each other.

351
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,020
At first,

352
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,760
I felt a bit lonely.

353
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,630
But later I thought

354
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,990
My daughter was growing up.

355
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,930
One day, she would leave me.

356
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,300
Yeah.

357
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,400
I know.

358
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,570
I always cling to you.

359
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:51,870
I'm not like you.

360
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,440
You're so independent.

361
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,940
So strong and brave.

362
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:57,640
But as a mother,

363
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,510
How can I be weaker than my daughter?

364
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,950
So, I thought…

365
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,710
I wanted to learn from you.

366
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,020
I wanted to become someone independent

367
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,520
Who can live on their own.

368
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:09,350
So, Tung…

369
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,390
I'm sorry.

370
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,590
Why did you say sorry to me?

371
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,730
I never thought

372
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,070
You would feel so lonely

373
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:24,300
When I left you on your own.

374
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,500
Well.

375
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,510
It's not that serious.

376
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,140
I was just a bit lonely.

377
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,410
Yes, it is.

378
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,080
I'm sorry.

379
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,280
Silly girl.

380
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,920
You're being so insistent.

381
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,890
We can dye it tomorrow.

382
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,530
Hey, you know what?

383
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:49,730
Your home teacher Mr. Huang

384
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,730
has been pestering me.

385
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:53,700
He told me about the tattoo on your arm.

386
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,300
You know life is hard for me?

387
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,400
I'm your mother and I also

388
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,000
Need to keep good relationships with my colleagues.

389
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:00,340
Come on.

390
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,380
Wait for me.

391
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,380
It's okay. Take your time.

392
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,080
Good morning, miss.

393
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:13,580
Morning.

394
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,420
Do your job. Don't mind me.

395
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:17,620
Hey.

396
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,590
I can't believe you won't help me.

397
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,320
You deserve it.

398
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,030
Write it yourself.

399
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,800
She's my mother.

400
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,130
I know.

401
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:29,870
But she asked me to do my job.

402
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,240
Hey, Tung.

403
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,210
Maybe Young won't be coming?

404
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:42,210
The club is finished without a president.

405
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:44,080
Let it be then.

406
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,320
We're doomed.

407
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,990
Oh, yes.

408
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,090
Madam President.

409
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,730
Finally, you've come.

410
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:58,900
Aren't you teaching us the dance?

411
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,760
Come on.

412
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:22,690
Hey.

413
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,250
What are you waiting for? Do something.

414
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,190
Do what?

415
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,190
Doesn't matter. Apologize first.

416
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:29,790
Strange…

417
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:31,930
Why do boys always have to apologize first?

418
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,300
Clearly, it's not our fault.

419
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,500
Why is she taking it out on us?

420
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:39,000
She never thought when she was in a bad mood,

421
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,200
She upset us too?

422
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,840
Ridiculous.

423
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:49,450
Ignore her.

424
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,110
Why is she pissed off?

425
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:56,620
Hey.

426
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,220
Hey.

427
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:05,000
Grrr, you…

428
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,400
We'll fail if we don't do the dance.

429
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:10,030
Oh.

430
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,940
Tung.

431
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,380
I'm sorry.

432
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:25,750
I didn't deliberately forget it that day.

433
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:30,490
Let's make peace with each other, please?

434
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:43,200
Still fighting with Tung?

435
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,240
What is this?

436
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,640
A second-hand phone.

437
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,710
I checked. It works fine.

438
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,410
Dad, thank you.

439
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:58,620
You're the best.

440
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,480
Shh, quiet.

441
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,520
I didn't let your mom know about it

442
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:03,950
She didn't suspect you?

443
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,590
The trick you taught me.

444
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:09,460
A little present works miracle.

445
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,570
It's late.

446
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,850
Go to bed soon.

447
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,450
Tung, look.

448
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:04,980
My dad got me a new phone.

449
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,850
You forgot you're still fighting with each other?

450
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:11,860
No, I didn't.

451
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,820
I'm talking to you.

452
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,020
I just called the wrong name.

453
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:14,760
Sheng, look.

454
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,730
My dad got me a new phone.

455
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,530
Oh, congratulations.

456
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:18,700
Okay, that's it.

457
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,200
Bye bye.

458
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,140
Tung.

459
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,140
You'll have internal injury by doing that.

460
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,110
None of your business.

461
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,860
Sorry, we're closed.

462
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,560
No, we come to see Young.

463
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,760
Let's talk outside.

464
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,000
Hey, where are you going?

465
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,270
You can talk in here.

466
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,030
Please come in.

467
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,100
Come on in.

468
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:57,870
Sit, please.

469
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,270
Sit.

470
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,840
It's okay, auntie, thanks.

471
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,310
Young, I really didn't know…

472
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,240
He's not saying that to me.

473
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,640
He's saying that to Yen.

474
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,180
Yen.

475
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,050
Don't ask me to be the go-between again.

476
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,480
Say it to Yen yourself.

477
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:18,960
Shao, say it.

478
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:22,760
What's going on?

479
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,430
Shh.

480
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,100
She said she liked you.

481
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,910
But I like someone else.

482
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,510
How would I know…

483
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,640
How could you do that behind my back?

484
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:44,180
Besides, you look good together.

485
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,880
And you knew her before me.

486
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,790
I don't care.

487
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:52,690
I just feel you like her more.

488
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:58,700
Say something.

489
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,330
Just trust me.

490
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:01,530
Not to me.

491
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,470
Since we're going out, we should trust each other.

492
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,080
Seriously, I love only you.

493
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,380
It's fine, Shao.

494
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:22,250
I know you love me the most.

495
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,350
I forgive you.

496
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,220
We're off.

497
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:09,730
I'll go have a shower.

498
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,640
So, those two are…

499
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,610
Times have changed…

500
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,690
Tung.

501
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:36,790
Yesterday Shao and Yen…

502
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,330
Are you talking to me?

503
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,200
Mm…and then?

504
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,900
Who are you?

505
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,340
Who am I?

506
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,340
Where am I?

507
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,280
Idiot.

508
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,050
Where am I?

509
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:10,990
It's really not good for your health.

510
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,810
Dear Mercurian,

511
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:59,910
I wonder if you've ever thought

512
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,710
how the different species from different planets

513
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,180
communicate with each other?

514
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:14,290
I really love a piano piece.

515
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:15,590
It's called "Clair de Lune"

516
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:18,600
Composed by Debussy.

517
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,170
If you have the chance, you should give it a try.

518
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,940
It's the sounds that a Martian

519
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:28,040
Wants to give to a Mercurian.

520
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,340
I don't fancy Shao.

521
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,190
Hey, you've made your peace?

522
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:22,690
Not yet.

523
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,160
Then what are you happy about?

524
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,400
I feel happy for you.

525
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,060
Tung says she doesn't fancy Shao.

526
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,370
Is it true?

527
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,130
Yes.

528
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:30,770
Is it true?

529
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,300
Yes, it's true.

530
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,070
You sure?

531
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,170
Of course.

532
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:35,470
Tung never lies to me.

533
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:37,040
She just did, didn't she?

534
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:38,940
Shut up.

535
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:39,980
Ouch! -Unbelievable.

536
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,360
Take a break.

537
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:01,930
Am I cool?

538
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:02,800
Super cool.

539
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,630
Wow, Young.

540
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:05,170
You really love men in taekwondo suits.

541
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:06,200
Not only that.

542
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:08,870
Right.

543
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,910
You got it from the claw machine?

544
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:16,510
Mm.

545
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,750
It's a match to the one we got last time.

546
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,850
Very nice of you.

547
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:20,720
You forgot?

548
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,120
What?

549
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,120
It's been exactly a month since we started going out.

550
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,220
You remember it?

551
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:27,760
Mm.

552
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,660
Let me ask you one thing.

553
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,660
You must be honest.

554
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:34,260
Yes.

555
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,930
Are you the Martian?

556
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,170
What?

557
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,310
Has my sweetie lost her mind?

558
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,610
I'm serious.

559
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:50,980
I'm an earthling.

560
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,520
Not a Martian.

561
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:56,790
You don't understand what I'm saying?

562
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:57,520
What are you saying?

563
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,390
Nothing.

564
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,160
And me?

565
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,730
Okay, back to practice.

566
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,060
Go.

567
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,070
Bye bye.

568
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,040
Excuse me.

569
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,340
Excuse me.

570
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:19,080
Excuse me.

571
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:29,390
What?

572
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,740
I'm sorry.

573
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,170
You know it's called "an infringement of privacy"?

574
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,740
But you said you fancied Shao.

575
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,740
Because you forgot

576
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,340
our appointment with the tattoo artist.

577
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:56,650
I apologized countless times to you.

578
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:03,290
I'm sorry.

579
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:06,490
I've been a bit too much.

580
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,330
I was upset in the last few days.

581
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,760
So…

582
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,570
Do you fancy Shao?

583
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:20,700
Why are you laughing? Do you?

584
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:23,340
I told you, didn't I?

585
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,380
You could tell I just wanted to make you angry.

586
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,710
Be serious.

587
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:29,850
I want to hear you say it again.

588
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,050
No.

589
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:32,180
No.

590
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,980
I don't fancy Shao.

591
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,650
I feel nothing about him.

592
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:37,550
For Christ's sake, if it weren't for you,

593
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:38,860
I wouldn't be bothered to talk to him.

594
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:40,290
Really?

595
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:41,660
Yes.

596
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,360
A sporty brainless boy like him

597
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,930
Is more like an ape.

598
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:49,070
He is indeed an ace.

599
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,830
I mean like a chimp. What are you talking about?

600
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:53,040
What are you talking about? A chip?

601
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,640
I mean like a "monkey".

602
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,470
Tung.

603
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:56,710
You're talking nonsense.

604
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:57,470
I'm not but you are.

605
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,670
Something wrong with your hearing?

606
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,040
Something wrong with your brain?

607
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,980
What? Idiot.

608
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,680
You're the idiot!

609
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,050
Yes, I'm an idiot, so what?

610
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:06,020
I'm an idiot. That's why we're friends.

611
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:08,920
I think you're the same.

612
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,250
An equal to each other.

613
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,830
I knew it.

614
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:17,889
Must be him.

615
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,060
Not necessarily.

616
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,260
Yes.

617
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,400
Yen.

618
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:24,969
What?

619
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,040
You can play the piano, can't you?

620
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,010
Yes.

621
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:29,969
How did you know?

622
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:31,370
Nothing.

623
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:32,739
I heard it by accident.

624
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,179
You've made peace with each other?

625
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:36,580
What? We didn't fight with each other.

626
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,780
Yeah, what?

627
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,980
We didn't fight with each other.

628
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,350
Ridiculous.

629
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:45,920
It's you two who are being ridiculous.

630
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,060
Well, no…

631
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:48,830
I mean

632
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:50,960
Shao and Sheng are being ridiculous.

633
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,400
Don't misunderstand me.

634
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:54,130
Babe.

635
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:55,800
Make sure you're available this Sunday.

636
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,000
Tung needs your help.

637
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,300
No need.

638
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,000
Yes.

639
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,200
That's it.

640
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:00,970
Oh.

641
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,310
Okay, bye bye.

642
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,010
What do they want?

643
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:09,950
I've no idea.

644
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,550
What?

645
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:16,590
Babe.

646
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,860
Baby.

647
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,020
Sweetie.

648
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,020
Get off.

649
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:23,330
Wait for me.

650
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:23,860
Get off.

651
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:24,890
Babe, wait for me.

652
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,000
We do everything ourselves.

653
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,160
Like the stage design,

654
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,970
Costume design, everything by ourselves.

655
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:31,900
So, auntie, I wonder if you could

656
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,800
Donate a bit money.

657
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,370
We're students.

658
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:35,540
What are you doing at mine?

659
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:39,780
I came to raise fund for the end-of-year presentation.

660
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,540
Auntie is really nice.

661
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,710
She even allows us to put up the poster.

662
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,580
She looks so young and beautiful.

663
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,410
And kind.

664
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,150
Well, not really.

665
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:51,120
This school event is good.

666
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,190
At the…

667
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:55,560
…Wen…Hall…

668
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,230
Wenyu Hall.

669
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,660
It's the school assembly hall.

670
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,230
Well, I'm sorry.

671
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:05,870
I've been so busy since I moved to Taiwan.

672
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:07,600
I've no time for learning to read in Chinese.

673
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,770
I started learning English when I was little.

674
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:11,070
My English is worse than your Chinese.

675
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,280
Auntie is really a language person.

676
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:13,810
Miss.

677
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:14,780
Isn't it time for you to go?

678
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,610
Goodbye.

679
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:17,750
Young.

680
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,820
How can you be so rude to your classmate?

681
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,090
I'm sorry.

682
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:25,990
Our Young is just like this.

683
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,960
Messy.

684
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,930
Like a monkey.

685
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:30,930
Always leave things around.

686
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,830
Why are you saying these?

687
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:35,060
She even broke a phone, you see?

688
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:36,370
Dad.

689
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,640
No wonder she got a new phone recently, right?

690
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:48,340
Young.

691
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,380
Did I say anything wrong?

692
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,280
Nothing.

693
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,330
How can I live without a phone?

694
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:05,030
Two days are too much.

695
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,430
And you say two weeks?

696
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:07,160
If you keep protesting…

697
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,400
It'll be three weeks.

698
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:13,040
Dad.

699
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,740
Stop calling him.

700
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,710
You two work together to lie to me.

701
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:21,310
I'll make sure you pay for it.

702
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:22,380
Well…

703
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:25,350
That phone she had was really too old.

704
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,120
You're speaking up for her?

705
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,150
I wanted to get a phone for my daughter.

706
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,120
Can't I do that?

707
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:32,820
Right.

708
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,090
You've been living in Taiwan for so long.

709
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:36,230
And you still haven't learned Chinese.

710
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,860
What do you mean I haven't learned Chinese?

711
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:43,000
Am I not speaking to you in Chinese?

712
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,230
Or am I speaking to you in Martian?

713
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:45,940
What?

714
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,070
But you can't read.

715
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,440
I asked her to go to the lessons.

716
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,010
She kept avoiding it.

717
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:54,710
I'm so busy working. I've no time for learning.

718
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,110
You just go.

719
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:58,050
I can handle it on my own.

720
00:37:58,050 --> 00:37:58,780
Well.

721
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,180
Chinese is so difficult.

722
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:00,950
I can't do it.

723
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,520
So…

724
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,090
You're lazy.

725
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:05,660
And you keep making excuses.

726
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,560
You're my daughter.

727
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,760
Why can't you speak Vietnamese?

728
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,300
Why drag me into this?

729
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,830
You're my husband.

730
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:15,830
Why can't you speak Vietnamese?

731
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:17,430
I can.

732
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,470
You can? So what?

733
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,540
I can speak Taiwanese too.

734
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,080
Can you?

735
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,940
I can speak Taiwanese.

736
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,810
Of course I can.

737
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:31,210
I can speak not only Taiwanese

738
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:32,880
But Hakka.

739
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,920
Soft mochi.

740
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:38,720
I can speak even Cantonese.

741
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,520
Can you speak Cantonese?

742
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,190
Cantonese?

743
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:46,860
Yes, I can.

744
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:49,230
The next stop is Tsim Sha Tsui. Please mind the door.

745
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:49,930
Hag…

746
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:50,500
Throw…

747
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,510
You didn't hear what I said just now, eh?

748
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,970
Did anyone say anything just now?

749
00:38:58,970 --> 00:38:59,610
I don't think so.

750
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:30,140
You said you didn't like fish sauce.

751
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,440
Yeah, last time you accidentally added it.

752
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,310
You threw away

753
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:34,440
The whole plate of food.

754
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:38,450
Oh no, shrimp paste stinks.

755
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:40,650
Fish sauce is bad enough. Don't add shrimp paste.

756
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:42,050
Grrr.

757
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,390
You often say shrimp paste is bad for health.

758
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:46,560
Don't eat it too much.

759
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:56,500
Don't eat it if you don't like it.

760
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,240
We're just having dinner.

761
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,640
Why are you angry?

762
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,850
What?

763
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:18,420
I'm not your daughter.

764
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,590
Can't I look at my phone while eating?

765
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,190
What?

766
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,760
Yu-Ming.

767
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,630
Hm?

768
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:39,810
Whoa.

769
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,750
You're ordering food on foodpanda.

770
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:43,850
That is…

771
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:45,010
Late night snacks.

772
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,620
And for two.

773
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:47,950
Thank you, Dad.

774
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:50,690
Young.

775
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,020
You and your dad work together to lie to me.

776
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,720
No, I don't.

777
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:57,090
You're still denying?

778
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:57,860
Then tell me.

779
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:58,530
Why?

780
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:02,030
Why does he stay out for so long
when taking the trash out?

781
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:03,500
Where on earth does he go?

782
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:06,800
How would I know?

783
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,110
You clearly know your dad is having an affair.

784
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:12,910
You help him lie to me.

785
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:14,540
Dad isn't someone like that at all.

786
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,980
He just goes for a smoke in secret.

787
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,720
Just goes for a smoke

788
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,850
in secret?

789
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:28,060
Hey.

790
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,090
My phone.

791
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,360
Ouch.

792
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:37,600
Every time my parents have a fight

793
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,100
They drag me in.

794
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,710
Then?

795
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,770
Did you eat the food in the end?

796
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,880
No way.

797
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:57,890
So you and your dad can't use your phones?

798
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:00,660
Then what are you using to text me now?

799
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,230
I still keep my old phone. Silly you...

800
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:47,300
You're very impressive.

801
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,640
You persuaded all the store owners.

802
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,810
I was taught a trick.

803
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:52,440
Just call them "handsome" or "beautiful".

804
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,710
Mei-Yuan Bistro?

805
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:55,240
I've been there too.

806
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:58,450
You know when I showed the flyer to the owner,

807
00:42:58,450 --> 00:42:59,550
She even… -My mom is Vietnamese.

808
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:01,420
It's only natural she can't read Chinese, okay?

809
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:03,520
It's not what I was going to say.

810
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,450
Why are you getting so excited?

811
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:05,650
Young.

812
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:07,060
Your family run the bistro?

813
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:08,720
Your mom is Vietnamese?

814
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:09,630
Yes.

815
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:11,060
My mom is Vietnamese, so what?

816
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:12,190
Nothing.

817
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:13,860
The food is good.

818
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:16,570
Hey.

819
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,970
What's wrong with her?

820
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:19,600
Ignore her.

821
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,570
She's just jealous of you.

822
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:21,700
You've raised money.

823
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:02,680
Are you alright?

824
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,080
Alright?

825
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,870
Quietly

826
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:27,540
Much courage I need to

827
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:30,710
Get a bit closer to you

828
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:31,940
What are you doing?
