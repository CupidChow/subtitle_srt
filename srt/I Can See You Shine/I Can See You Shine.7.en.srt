1
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:30,670
Dad,

2
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:31,870
It's your motorbike.

3
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:33,570
Please help!

4
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:14,140
(Ep.7 Bye then, Who Cares? )

5
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,040
The Martian is Sheng?

6
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,340
No…

7
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,579
Not necessarily.

8
00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:20,350
Just maybe.

9
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,680
Oh my God!

10
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,550
Is it the art teacher

11
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,750
Or Sheng?

12
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,990
If the Mermaid didn't fall for someone else,

13
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,660
How would she meet the prince?

14
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,530
If Liang San-po didn't make Brokeback Mountain,

15
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,860
How would he fall in love with Quasimodo?

16
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,130
All the secrets

17
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,870
Lie in the orange UFO.

18
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,130
What?

19
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,390
Why is there another one?

20
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,300
What is this?

21
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,130
I think it's an underground music band.

22
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,400
The Martian wants to meet you.

23
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,070
No…

24
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,670
I bet he does.

25
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,210
Because you said bye bye to him

26
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,370
He thought it was the ultimatum

27
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,880
So he decides to meet you.

28
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,079
Tung.

29
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,680
You'll be going out with the art teacher.

30
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,450
No.

31
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,780
With Sheng.

32
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:30,880
No.

33
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,690
Sheng doesn't play in an underground band.

34
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:34,320
Grrr.

35
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,560
Tung, who on earth is the Martian?

36
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,890
Why are you getting more excited than me?

37
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,730
How can you not get excited?

38
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,390
I'm not sure I'll go.

39
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,000
You must go.

40
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,600
What?

41
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,500
You fancy more than one guy.

42
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,340
Hey, give it back to me.

43
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,470
Young.

44
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,280
Give it back to me.

45
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,250
Well.

46
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,120
Let me treat you to cake.

47
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,040
The sun is shining outside the window

48
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,580
A new day is waiting

49
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,680
I'm facing the beauty of the unknown

50
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,580
Maybe I'm scared but it's alright

51
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,450
will be fine

52
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,480
Don't worry about being right or wrong

53
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,520
Follow your expectation

54
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,590
Even if you'll fall

55
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,720
Why?

56
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,860
So many why, why, why

57
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,930
So much confusion is left after summer

58
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:50,060
The world is too big, too many question marks taken down

59
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,560
How to solve them or leave them to time?

60
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:56,330
Don't reveal the answers in a hurry

61
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:00,510
How about breaking the structure,
folding before flipping it?

62
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,640
So many why, why, why

63
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,610
No need to guess

64
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:08,750
Just seize this moment, uh wo

65
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,120
who am I I I

66
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,180
No need to guess

67
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,420
Love with all your heart, don't wait

68
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,100
I didn't understand till this moment

69
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,570
That you're the Martian in my mind.

70
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,409
Grrr, we're running out of time.

71
00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:41,450
The Pop Dance Club finished choreographing their dance.

72
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,250
Yo.

73
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,720
Here you are.

74
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,020
I suddenly decide make a change.

75
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,360
Young, stop making changes.

76
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:56,190
Well.

77
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:59,000
Back then I joined this club because of the teacher.

78
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,570
I didn't expect to have another teacher taking it over.

79
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:01,430
For Christ's sake,

80
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,670
You can't even remember

81
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,070
That teacher's name, okay?

82
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,300
Back then I joined this club

83
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,540
Because of Yen.

84
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,810
I didn't expect to find a treasure.

85
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,840
Now I have such a pretty girlfriend.

86
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,850
I'm so lucky.

87
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,150
I joined it because of Young.

88
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,520
You said it would be easy

89
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,220
But...

90
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,520
You do gain something out of this disaster.

91
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,290
Sheng.

92
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,290
Why did you join the Folk Dance Club?

93
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,430
Because other clubs were full.

94
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,230
I guess so.

95
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,270
Okay.

96
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,670
Come practice the dance.

97
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,270
Come on.

98
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,940
Go, off you go.

99
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,740
5, 6, 7, go.

100
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,510
1, 2, 3, 4.

101
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,480
Wait.

102
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,280
Yen.

103
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,650
You started with the wrong side.

104
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:48,150
Oh.

105
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:48,980
Grrr.

106
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,310
Again.

107
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,520
5, 6, 7, go.

108
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,790
1, 2, 3, 4.

109
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,390
5, 6, 7.

110
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,190
Wait.

111
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:01,590
Shao, stretch your arms before pulling them back.

112
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,260
Oh.

113
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,660
And you, Sheng.

114
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,730
You fail to do any movements right.

115
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,430
Did you practice at home or not?

116
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,630
Oh.

117
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,700
And you, Yen.

118
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,670
Stop messing around.

119
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:12,970
What the hell.

120
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,870
Time is tight and you keep messing around.

121
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,540
Strange…

122
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,040
Clearly, Tung looks the worst.

123
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,880
Why don't you correct her?

124
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,710
That's right.

125
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,450
You can't be partial just because she's your buddy.

126
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,320
Do I look very bad?

127
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,320
Very bad.

128
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,790
Do I?

129
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,190
No.

130
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,960
Just a bit special.

131
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,360
Special?

132
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,330
I mean

133
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,500
You've got your own style.

134
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:43,330
I mean it.

135
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:44,870
Again.

136
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:45,840
Do it again.

137
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,240
Let's take a break.

138
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:47,740
Yes.

139
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,010
A break.

140
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,010
Sheng.

141
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,010
We've got you a present.

142
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:51,740
Yeah, right.

143
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,480
What is it?

144
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,010
Hey, we're practicing.

145
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,909
Can't you wait till we finish?

146
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,220
Wow, a designer brand.

147
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,650
Shao and I bought them together.

148
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:04,990
Well…

149
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,290
My uncle sells sneakers.

150
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,090
We got 50% off.

151
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:07,990
Yes, a big discount.

152
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,890
Second-hand.

153
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:09,430
No.

154
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,190
They are…

155
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:11,760
...brand-new second-hand.

156
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,230
Er…

157
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,600
There is a term…

158
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:14,670
It's called…

159
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,700
Ex-display.

160
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,330
Yes, that's right.

161
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:17,840
Is it?

162
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,800
Doesn't matter.

163
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,900
No need to explain so much.

164
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:21,840
Thanks.

165
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,010
Do they fit?

166
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,280
Yes, they do.

167
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,040
Bravo!

168
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,840
Yes, I really love this design.

169
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,850
Stand up and walk around.

170
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,780
Let me try running.

171
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,250
Yes.

172
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,590
Together. -Let's run together.

173
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:38,159
Very comfortable.

174
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:38,860
Let's run outside.

175
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,130
Sure. -I'll come with you.

176
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,559
Hey, no…

177
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,230
Hey.

178
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,400
They're not coming back, are they?

179
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,700
Hey.

180
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:54,170
Young has become a tyrant.

181
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,310
Shao.

182
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,170
You must help me.

183
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,810
I'm waiting for you to help me.

184
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:00,710
She forces me to practice dancing after school.

185
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,080
I've missed several taekwondo training sessions.

186
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,180
I don't dare to tell her.

187
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,850
You're her boyfriend.

188
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,850
Please, be a real man, okay?

189
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,550
Yeah, right, Shao.

190
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,720
We three all count on you.

191
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:12,720
Young.

192
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,660
He needs to tell you something.

193
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,090
Young.

194
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,160
What's your plan for Christmas?

195
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,830
How about you?

196
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:24,600
Would you like to join us?

197
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,440
Together?

198
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,200
All together?

199
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,210
Yes.

200
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,970
Let's go somewhere further out.

201
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,510
How about a guesthouse?

202
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,110
Sounds good, eh?

203
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:33,780
Sheng has to work.

204
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,310
Oh right.

205
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,320
And we need to go somewhere cheaper.

206
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:41,290
He didn't say anything to me in the gig.

207
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,720
Or shall I ask him out first?

208
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,590
Or let's go somewhere free?

209
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,190
Somewhere free?

210
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,160
Park.

211
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:47,960
What?

212
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,690
But parks suck.

213
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,860
No.

214
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,600
It's pretty in Xinyi District around Christmas.

215
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,730
We can just walk around.

216
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,100
Hello Sheng.

217
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,140
Sheng has to work.

218
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,900
Right, I forgot again.

219
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,470
You two can go on your own.

220
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,780
Hey, then we two…

221
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,040
There is no "we".

222
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,550
Or we four go without him.

223
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,020
I guess he won't mind.

224
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:24,930
Hey.

225
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,260
I suddenly remember

226
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,600
I need to go somewhere.

227
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,000
Where are you going?

228
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,100
I'll just walk around.

229
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,610
You go first.

230
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:35,440
Oh.

231
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,470
I'm off.

232
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:37,380
Oh, okay.

233
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,110
Bye bye.

234
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,790
Hey.

235
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,320
I suddenly remember

236
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,420
I need to go somewhere too.

237
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,490
I'm off.

238
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:52,060
Bye bye.

239
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:52,960
Hey.

240
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:56,860
I smell something fishy.

241
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,400
Me too.

242
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,090
Tung.

243
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:00,860
Go!

244
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:28,920
What are you doing?

245
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,520
I…

246
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,190
I…

247
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,760
Quietly

248
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:45,370
I judge how much courage I need to

249
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,840
Get a bit closer to you

250
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:47,740
Tung.

251
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,210
I forgot what I wanted to do.

252
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:50,040
Bye bye.

253
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,940
Listen

254
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,810
Looking for the trace of attraction

255
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:58,450
Slowly, I build it up but

256
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,890
It gets blown all over

257
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,640
What happened between them?

258
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,180
Yen, can't you tell?

259
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,710
I can't, that's why I want to make sure.

260
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:31,850
Young.

261
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,480
Does Tung fancy Sheng?

262
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,690
She asked you to keep it secret?

263
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:40,660
Wait.

264
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,860
She cheats on me?

265
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,560
Didn't you break up already?

266
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,600
Yeah, right.

267
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,830
I should let her go.

268
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,170
And you wanted to break up first.

269
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,840
That's right.

270
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,600
You were just pretending.

271
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,170
And it was a simple deal.

272
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,240
But this is serious.

273
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,440
It's driving me crazy.

274
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,640
Does Sheng fancy Tung?

275
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,640
How would I know?

276
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:01,910
Hey.

277
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,410
Don't ask him about it.

278
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,180
And what you saw today…

279
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,420
You mustn't tell anyone.

280
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,990
Or I'll be a dead man walking.

281
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,860
If anything happens to me,

282
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,320
I'll drag you down with me.

283
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,530
Okay.

284
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:16,560
Is it so serious?

285
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,730
Yes.

286
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,060
Okay, let's go.

287
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,900
Hey, kiddo.

288
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:30,770
What happened just now?

289
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,840
How would I know?

290
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,450
How would you know?

291
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:37,280
Just tell her you like her.

292
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,380
I was waiting for her to tell me first.

293
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,450
How can you wait for a girl to tell you first?

294
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,460
But she wants to tell me first.

295
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,720
How did you know?

296
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,090
I just did.

297
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,490
How?

298
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:50,900
I just did.

299
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,600
Fine, suit yourself.

300
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,370
And then?

301
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:58,540
Then…

302
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,040
I've been waiting for some time.

303
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,450
Idiot.

304
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,310
Why do you keep waiting?

305
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,680
Just tell her.

306
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,520
On second thought, forget it.

307
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,590
Forget it?

308
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,190
Maybe she's not ready yet.

309
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,990
Anyway, it's not a good time for me
to have a girlfriend.

310
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,600
No…

311
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,700
Hey.

312
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,800
It doesn't sound like you at all.

313
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,100
Well

314
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,700
Dating costs a lot.

315
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,070
And I've no time for it either.

316
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:34,940
Bullshit.

317
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,240
You never said that when you went out with girls before.

318
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,470
You just borrowed money from me.

319
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,650
Anyway, she's different.

320
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,750
In what way?

321
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,350
Anyway, she's different.

322
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,160
Hey.

323
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,260
Where should we go for Christmas?

324
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,430
I'm still thinking.

325
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:46,680
Oh I

326
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:51,050
oh I

327
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:55,090
You’be mine

328
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,860
Don’t keep trying

329
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:03,690
to run away my love just stay just stay

330
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,230
don’t keep runnin away

331
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:08,130
Let me call you "baby"

332
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:10,230
Let me get drunk, let me

333
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,440
Let me fall, let me

334
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:16,310
Burst into tears, be taken aback,
I don't understand myself

335
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,250
Oh I

336
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,750
Burst into tears, be taken aback,
I don't understand myself

337
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:35,930
Follow me.

338
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:36,890
Okay.

339
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,900
3, 2, 1, go.

340
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,170
1, 2, 3, 4.

341
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:44,440
5, 6, nod.

342
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:44,970
Motorbike.

343
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:45,670
Wait.

344
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,170
What?

345
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,340
You dance so fast that we can't follow you.

346
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,580
Okay, slowly, slowly.

347
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,710
Okay, again.

348
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:56,180
3, 2, 1, go.

349
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:00,380
1, 2, 3, 4.

350
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:03,290
5, 6, nod.

351
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,560
Motorbike.

352
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,470
Which one do you think I should hit?

353
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,170
This one, of course.

354
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,210
It's okay.

355
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,160
Tung.

356
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,060
What are you doing here?

357
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,630
What's wrong?

358
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,600
Bravo!

359
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,500
Yes.

360
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,130
Wow.

361
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,480
YA!

362
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,280
Here, sorry for keeping you waiting.

363
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,510
Fried chicken for you.

364
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,720
You're welcome.

365
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:05,980
Enjoy.

366
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,520
Sheng.

367
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:12,860
Sit down.

368
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:18,700
You'll attract more attention like this.

369
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,640
Do you want me to chase them out?

370
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,970
Would you like a drink?

371
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,180
I'm going to the restroom.

372
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:28,170
Yes, thanks.

373
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,340
It's done.

374
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:35,740
Hello Ms. Kuo.

375
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:36,610
What?

376
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,840
I'm a student in your school.

377
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,250
I'm Tung's classmate.

378
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,680
Oh, hi.

379
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,450
Hi.

380
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,720
Okay, thanks.

381
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:50,320
You're welcome.

382
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:50,790
Let's go.

383
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,420
Yeah.

384
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:52,760
Bye bye.

385
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,560
Thanks.

386
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,230
I…

387
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,400
I'll go…

388
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:39,600
Go.

389
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:40,970
Quick.

390
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,100
Would you like to eat in or take out?

391
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:17,800
Take out.

392
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:19,500
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

393
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,640
Enjoy. -Thanks.

394
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,710
Tung.

395
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:23,770
Go wait for me upstairs.

396
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:24,980
I'll go to you later.

397
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,510
Hey, listen.

398
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,180
Go.

399
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,580
Tell your mom we need one more chicken.

400
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,410
What do you mean one more chicken?

401
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,210
Guess she didn't cook enough.

402
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:31,780
Oh

403
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,750
Go, quick.

404
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,150
The customers will be here soon.

405
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,190
Mom.

406
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,690
Hey, Tung.

407
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,320
Let me find you a seat, okay?

408
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,620
It's fine, Mr. Chang.

409
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,060
How about this?

410
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,090
Sit here for now.

411
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:43,360
When a seat is available,

412
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,630
You'll be the first to take it.

413
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,600
Why do we need one more chicken?

414
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,700
How would I know?

415
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,130
It means you cooked one less.

416
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,600
I didn't.

417
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,970
You got the order wrong.

418
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:55,340
Okay.

419
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,870
It's my fault, okay?

420
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,110
Please hurry up.

421
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,210
Do all you can

422
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:00,580
To make another chicken.

423
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,950
I'm not a hen.

424
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:04,210
A hen lays eggs not chickens.

425
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:07,020
So annoying. They fight all the time.

426
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,060
I'm leaving.

427
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,220
What's up? Go wait for me upstairs.

428
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,990
It's okay. You're very busy today.

429
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,290
You should help your parents.

430
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:18,760
Excuse me.

431
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:19,730
Wait a second.

432
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,060
Go wait for me upstairs.

433
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,430
It won't be this busy later.

434
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:23,430
Excuse me.

435
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:23,900
Coming.

436
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,600
Yes.

437
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,500
This.

438
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:26,970
This.

439
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:27,670
Yes.

440
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:29,610
And this too.

441
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:30,310
Yes.

442
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,240
You want it spicy?

443
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,010
Yes.

444
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:32,480
Okay.

445
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:34,580
And this too.

446
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:35,910
Young, I'm off.

447
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:36,480
Hey.

448
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:37,250
Hey.

449
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,150
And this too.

450
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,550
Oh, sure.

451
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,690
Careful.

452
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,360
Don't drop it.

453
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,360
It took me ages to decorate it.

454
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:07,780
Morning.

455
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,070
Again.

456
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,960
Why is Dad never home?

457
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,720
Did he abandon us?

458
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,430
Tung.

459
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,300
Tung.

460
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:47,940
Hey, Sheng.

461
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:49,650
She's not here yet?

462
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,550
No.

463
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,480
Unbelievable.

464
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,990
She missed the first period.

465
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:04,630
Sure?

466
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,560
Sure.

467
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:36,860
Dear Martian,

468
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:39,060
I'm going to grow a pair of wings.

469
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,860
Relying on my own strength,

470
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:45,200
Without anyone's company and not flying to anyone,

471
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,370
I'm going to leave this planet full of lies alone.

472
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,390
Tung is still absent.

473
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,060
Did you talk to her?

474
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,560
I kept calling but she didn't answer.

475
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,220
Ms. Kuo took a day off too.

476
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,860
Hey, tomorrow is the last session.
Make sure you'll be there.

477
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,630
I know. I'll take half a day off work.

478
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,370
Hey.

479
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,410
Is that Ms. Kuo?

480
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,310
It's fake, right?

481
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,420
Tung.

482
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,130
I knew something was wrong.

483
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,100
Okay?

484
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:00,280
Cool girl.

485
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,040
Smurf.

486
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:01,680
Cool girl.

487
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,410
So happy.

488
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:05,120
Ms. Kuo's toy boy.

489
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,120
Hug him tight.

490
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:10,150
You're bleeding.

491
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:11,320
Whoa.

492
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,820
Tung, you're too much.

493
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,390
Oh my gosh.

494
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,360
Who on earth

495
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,730
Hurt you so badly?

496
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:21,900
Who?

497
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,800
Who did it?

498
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:24,700
I did.

499
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,140
I'm sorry.

500
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,440
How dare you hurt my son?

501
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,340
Not him.

502
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,110
It was me who hurt Hei… -It was me.

503
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,780
It was me.

504
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,410
No, actually, it was me.

505
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:36,850
It was me.

506
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:38,620
Have you had enough?

507
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,180
Hei, tell your mom it was me.

508
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:42,450
Mrs. Liu

509
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:44,550
Actually it's just a scratch.

510
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,360
Who hurt you so badly?

511
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,300
I didn't see it.

512
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:52,860
You didn't see it.

513
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,460
It's really just a scratch. It's fine.

514
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,370
You… this is serious.

515
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:58,540
A violent act like this.

516
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,840
The school should take it seriously.

517
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,840
Enough, Mom.

518
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:04,270
I cut it myself.

519
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,780
It's true. I cut it myself.

520
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,080
Fine.

521
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,490
All of you, get out.

522
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:27,560
Tung, don't be angry.

523
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,370
They're just being gossipy.

524
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,100
Ignore them.

525
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,730
I believe Ms. Kuo has her reasons.

526
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:33,270
She's definitely not someone like that.

527
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,440
Yes, she is.

528
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,610
She is.

529
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:38,840
You're right.

530
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,410
It's fine, you keep spreading it.

531
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:41,780
It'd be the best the whole world knows about it.

532
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,310
My mom is unfaithful.

533
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,150
Not only my mom.

534
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:44,980
So is my dad.

535
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,020
I'm their daughter so I must be like them.

536
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,320
What are you saying?

537
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,550
I don't know you…

538
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,960
Of course you don't know.

539
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,090
You don't know anything.

540
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:54,820
You just fall in love and dance.

541
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,490
So, your mom really…

542
00:30:58,490 --> 00:30:59,260
Yes.

543
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,400
It's true.

544
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,400
Anything else you want to know?

545
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,300
Ask in one go and keep spreading it.

546
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:04,770
I didn't mean that.

547
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:05,870
Yes, you did.

548
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:07,870
Because you never tell me anything.

549
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:09,370
What should I tell you?

550
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:10,310
I spend all the time listening to you.

551
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,770
When is my turn to talk?

552
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,710
It's not true.

553
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:15,450
What you're saying is not fair to me.

554
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:16,250
No, no.

555
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,610
Enough, stop fighting.

556
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,350
I always do what you ask.

557
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:21,280
You dance badly but I still let you dance.

558
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,620
You have such a bad temper. Apart from me,

559
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,190
Who would be your friend?

560
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,220
Are you stupid or something?

561
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,220
You get overenthusiastic about things you want to do

562
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,590
And ignore others' feelings.

563
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,960
No one wants to dance apart from you.

564
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,800
You enjoy dancing

565
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,460
But we're all forced to dance with you.

566
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,170
Are you?

567
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:38,100
Of course not.

568
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,640
Absolutely not.

569
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,070
A bit.

570
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:43,540
Look, they say no.

571
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:44,970
They're all lying to you

572
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,410
Because you're stupid.

573
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,750
Tung, have you had enough?

574
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,110
Enough.

575
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:52,150
If we dance, we dance happily.

576
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,180
Don't be angry, okay?

577
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,550
Why are you speaking up for her?

578
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:56,890
Well.

579
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:59,590
Shao missed several taekwondo sessions.

580
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:00,590
Isn't he supportive enough?

581
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:01,690
Yes.

582
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:03,290
You don’t know how hard

583
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:04,030
I fought against my mom for you.

584
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,160
What do you mean "for me"?

585
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,570
Sheng, was it you?

586
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:10,930
Did you take that photo?

587
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,000
You really think I'm that kind of person?

588
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,970
Really think I'd do something like that to you?

589
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:19,810
How would I know?

590
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,710
If you suffer so much for me,

591
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,150
Let's break up then.

592
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,980
Can you stop being such a princess?

593
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:27,580
I…

594
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,050
Haven't I done enough to please you?

595
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,950
I never like sharing food with anyone.

596
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,390
But I do it for you.

597
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:33,760
Fine.

598
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,660
Let's break up.

599
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,430
Anyway, I don't like dancing.

600
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:37,730
Why should I force myself for your sake?

601
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,930
Don't be like this.

602
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,170
We all volunteer to dance.

603
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:44,430
And I know it's very hard for us.

604
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:45,700
You think it's hard?

605
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,170
Dance.

606
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:48,170
Practice taekwondo.

607
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:48,970
It's nothing.

608
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:50,810
Your mom is having an affair.

609
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,410
Your parents are getting divorced. So what?

610
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,340
At least your parents are still alive.

611
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:57,750
You all have such sheltered lives.

612
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,120
You know nothing about hardship.

613
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,480
What you do all day is playing house.

614
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,850
Shut up.

615
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:03,890
Among us, you've no right to be angry.

616
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:05,290
We were trying hard to find a way

617
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:06,860
Since we worried you couldn't afford to go out.

618
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,090
Being poor isn't embarrassing.

619
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:10,790
I never feel embarrassed about being poor.

620
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,700
You stop looking down on people.

621
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,140
Don't be like this.

622
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,080
You've gone too far this time.

623
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,220
Hey…

624
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:36,080
Why did you come downstairs so late?

625
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,350
Come on, eat.

626
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:40,980
Young.

627
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,550
What on earth happened?

628
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,920
Did someone bully you?

629
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:53,630
So, someone did bully you?

630
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:55,870
Who?

631
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:57,600
Who was it?

632
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,700
Who dared to bully my daughter?

633
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,240
Who is it?

634
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:12,280
It's late. Anything?

635
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,350
Mom, let me talk to him.

636
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,830
What's up?

637
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,700
My feet are cold.

638
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:39,480
And ugly too.

639
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:42,310
They don't go well with my helmet and jacket.

640
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,720
Well, you threw away the shoes we bought you.

641
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,490
Give them back to me.

642
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:57,490
They're mine now.

643
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:59,160
But you threw them away.

644
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,830
You didn't bring them back for me?

645
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:02,000
Of course we didn't.

646
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:05,370
But I couldn't find them when I went looking for them.

647
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,570
You went back to look for them?

648
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:08,500
Yes.

649
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:12,810
Fine.

650
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,210
Let's talk inside.

651
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:15,610
We look as if we were secret lovers out here.

652
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:17,850
No need.

653
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:19,850
Your mom doesn't like me.

654
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:25,250
Wait here for a minute.

655
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,620
Let me lend you a pair of shoes.

656
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:27,860
No need.

657
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:30,230
Hey.

658
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,010
Here you are.

659
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,110
I knew you'd bring them back for me.

660
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,310
Why did you refuse to admit it?

661
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:51,250
Shut up.

662
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,400
You really broke up?

663
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:10,930
What?

664
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:14,200
Split up?

665
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,540
Yes.

666
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:17,210
Well.

667
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,480
Don't be so impulsive.

668
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:22,510
Then…

669
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,580
How about the presentation?

670
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,880
Mom is asking.

671
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:28,380
Why doesn't she ask me herself?

672
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:30,250
She feels embarrassed.

673
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,460
What she means is…

674
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,960
If you don't want to do it, don't force yourselves.

675
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,660
Don't worry about her.

676
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,960
And the aunties.

677
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,470
Anyway, they don't really want to perform.

678
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,370
Argh.

679
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,240
It's not what I said at all.

680
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:49,440
She feels embarrassed.

681
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:51,870
Anyway, don't force yourselves.

682
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:05,490
Mom.

683
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,660
Even if I'm the only one left,

684
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,090
I'll still invite you to perform.

685
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,970
You worry too much.

686
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,770
It was you.

687
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,050
You're home.

688
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,490
I'm ready.

689
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,720
Tell me.

690
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,890
All in one go.

691
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,360
Don't worry about whether I can take it or not.

692
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,390
I'm ready.

693
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:47,660
Hurry up or I'll change my mind.

694
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,170
I want to hear you say it.

695
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,990
Mom told me everything.

696
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:13,420
It turns out that everything in my life is fake.

697
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,770
After the big row,

698
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:25,230
they stay with each other.

699
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,980
After they parted,

700
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:37,350
they still want to go back to each other.

701
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,530
And I…

702
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:57,070
…have been living in lies.

703
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,840
Why is everyone lying to me?

704
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:12,550
Tung.

705
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:24,260
It's cold. Why are you staying in the rain?

706
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:38,570
I've called a taxi.

707
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,370
You can go.

708
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:45,210
Let me wait with you.

709
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:57,890
Bye bye.

710
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,300
Happy Christmas.

711
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,680
Sheng.

712
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,980
I like you

713
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,190
So so so much.
