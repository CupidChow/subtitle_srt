1
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:13,596
Hello, Tien-ching. It's me again.

2
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,682
What's your reason this time?

3
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:17,142
Did you forget your keys,

4
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:19,394
or is your mom out
with her boyfriend again?

5
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:26,484
If I told you my mom ran away with a man
and didn't want me anymore,

6
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:28,361
would you take me in?

7
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:33,450
Are you okay?

8
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:37,829
You're so gullible!

9
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:39,372
That's what I like about you.

10
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,583
I want hot chocolate.

11
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,460
Not too hot. Extra sugar.

12
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:55,138
The view from your place is so beautiful.

13
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:58,266
Looking at it cheers me up.

14
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:34,445
HAD I NOT SEEN THE SUN

15
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,526
<i>Whatever happens in the future,</i>

16
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,570
<i>I'll always be with you.</i>

17
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,239
<i>I won't let go of your hand</i>
<i>so easily again.</i>

18
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,951
<i>Really? You said it.</i>

19
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:04,827
Hsiao-tung.

20
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,664
Are you still sleeping?

21
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,458
Hsiao-tung?

22
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,753
Do you hear me?

23
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:20,218
I just went to your new school
and completed all the paperwork.

24
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,971
Well, school is starting soon.

25
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,306
Do you want to check out your new school?

26
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,020
Hsiao-tung?

27
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,116
MISSED CALL FROM YUN-CHEN

28
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:29,579
<i>Are you okay?</i>

29
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,748
<i>Why didn't you pick up?</i>

30
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,082
<i>It's been several days.</i>

31
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,542
<i>I'm so worried.</i>

32
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,127
<i>Call me when you can.</i>

33
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,379
<i>Or reply in the messaging app.</i>

34
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,464
<i>Okay?</i>

35
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,321
WHAT'S WRONG?
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ONLINE IN A WHILE

36
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,963
WICKEDYA: HI, HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

37
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,593
WHEN ARE WE HANGING OUT AGAIN? MISS YOU

38
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:31,432

THE PERSON IN IT LOOKS JUST LIKE YOU

00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:47,573

THEY ALL CAME IN HER?
SHE'S DESTROYED

43
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,753
FUCK! I WENT TO YI-X SCHOOL

44
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,923
JERKED

45
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,091
I EVEN KNOW HER MOM

46
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:07,969
I GOT HARD AND CAME

47
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:10,054
SHE WAS CLEARLY RAPED
JERK OFF TO THIS

48
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,391

00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,549
What happened?

53
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:32,220
Hsiao-tung!

54
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,804
Hsiao-tung, what's going on?

55
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:35,223
Open the door!

56
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:38,309
What should we do?
You're scaring us! What are you doing?

57
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:40,478
What are you doing inside? Open the door!

58
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,522
Pry open the door. Hurry.

59
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,482
Hsiao-tung!

60
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,843
Mr. and Mrs. Chiang, do you mind
stepping out with me for a bit?

61
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:19,850
Come on.

62
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,036
<i>Let's meet our first lucky listener.</i>

63
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,706
<i>Could you introduce yourself?</i>

64
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:45,042
<i>Hi, everyone. My name is Hsia Tien-ching.</i>

65
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:49,255
<i>My dream is to become a radio DJ.</i>

66
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,924
<i>Why?</i>

67
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,219
<i>Truth is, due to a congenital condition,</i>

68
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,096
<i>I have optic atrophy.</i>

69
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:03,394
<i>Since my illness started in high school,</i>
<i>my vision has dropped to 0.01.</i>

70
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:07,690
<i>Now all I can see are blurry silhouettes.</i>

71
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,651
<i>I can barely see colors.</i>

72
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,820
<i>So instead of watching TV,</i>

73
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,530
<i>I prefer listening to the radio.</i>

74
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,282
<i>I also like classical music.</i>

75
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,703
<i>Hi, everyone. My name is Hsia Tien-ching.</i>

76
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,790
<i>My dream is to become a radio DJ.</i>

77
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,960
<i>Why?</i>

78
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:31,005
<i>Truth is, due to a congenital condition,</i>

79
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,798
<i>I have optic atrophy.</i>

80
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,967
<i>Hi, everyone. My name is Hsia Tien-ching.</i>

81
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,803
<i>My dream is to become a radio DJ.</i>

82
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,597
<i>I also like classical music.</i>

83
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,766
<i>Hi, everyone. My name is Hsia Tien-ching.</i>

84
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:44,477
<i>My dream is to become a radio DJ.</i>

85
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,230
<i>Hi, everyone. My name is Hsia Tien-ching.</i>

86
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,123
Wanna play with me?

87
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,043
I spat boba all over his head.

88
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,545
You can't blame me.

89
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:15,132
It's his own fault
for passing by at that very second.

90
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,592
The street is only so wide.

91
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,222
Hey. I'm Chi-chi.

92
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:23,891
What about you?

93
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,309
What is your name?

94
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:33,317
Hey.

95
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,569
Let me tell you a little secret.

96
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:38,906
I really hate this world.

97
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,700
But

98
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,619
I don't seem to hate you.

99
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:46,664
Hey.

100
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:48,124
Hey!

101
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,292
Don't give me the cold shoulder.

102
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,461
Hey.

103
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,339
Hurry up and tell me your name.

104
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,049
Hey!

105
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,051
Hurry!

106
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:02,054
Hurry up and tell me.
How else can we become good friends?

107
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,013
Hey.

108
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,518
Hsiao-tung.

109
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,188
Do you feel okay today?

110
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,149
Are your wounds hurting?

111
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,611
Mr. and Mrs. Chiang,

112
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,822
there is something I must tell you.

113
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:23,242
Hsiao-tung has
a few deep wounds on her face.

114
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:26,871
We took extra care while stitching them,

115
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:30,583
but I'm afraid they will still leave
big scars on her face.

116
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,877
You can consider
getting laser therapy later.

117
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:35,337
But you should still be mentally prepared.

118
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,964
No matter how hard you try,

119
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:40,009
she might never look the same again.

120
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,263
Then let her become different.

121
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:46,599
The bigger the change, the better.

122
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:50,728
Right, the more she changes, the better.

123
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,938
It would be best
if nobody could recognize her.

124
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:21,592
Look.

125
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:23,594
I'm a caterpillar.

126
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:26,806
You are a butterfly.

127
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,057
I am you.

128
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,683
You are me.

129
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,185
Hey.

130
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:35,773
Did you know that butterflies
are the world's most morbid creatures?

131
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:38,234
Why did you tattoo a thing like that
on your finger?

132
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:40,277
It's true.

133
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,405
Do you know
how caterpillars turn into butterflies?

134
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:46,158
First, they dissolve into a soup.

135
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,494
Then their organs develop gradually.

136
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,579
Finally, they become butterflies.

137
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:54,166
They kill themselves first.

138
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,044
Hey, isn't that twisted?

139
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,305
Hey.

140
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:09,765
Hey.

141
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,267
Can you

142
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,770
do me a favor?

143
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:19,149
Tell me!

144
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,698
Can you

145
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,492
help me

146
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:29,827
kill myself?

147
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,582
You're really twisted!

148
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,083
Okay!

149
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,459
I promise you!

150
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,128
I love it!

151
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,755
I promise you.

152
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,091
I will make sure

153
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:46,010
to kill you properly.

154
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,362
Hsia Tien-ching!

155
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,083
It's been a while.

156
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:26,634
Hsia Tien-ching.

157
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,681
I'm sorry I didn't answer
your call last time.

158
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:36,936
You don't have to explain.

159
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,355
I understand.

160
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,690
After all, I'm different from most people.

161
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,109
I misunderstood you earlier.

162
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:45,569
Don't worry.

163
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,573
I don't want to, and I won't, bother you.

164
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:53,452
No.

165
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,666
I didn't run away because of you.

166
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,834
It was because of me.

167
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,088
What do you mean?

168
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,925
I've been hiding a lot from you

169
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,719
because I'm afraid

170
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,806
you won't accept me once you know.

171
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:16,725
You haven't told me.

172
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,602
How do you know I won't accept you?

173
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:29,571
I once stabbed someone with a knife
and was imprisoned for six years.

174
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,366
I was just released this year.

175
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,997
Now I'm doing odd jobs to make a living.

176
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,669
Sometimes at a construction site,

177
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,879
other times at a cleaning company.

178
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,633
The pay at the cleaning company
is more stable.

179
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,094
But some of the places I go to

180
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,263
are crime scenes

181
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,056
and hoarder houses.

182
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:58,809
Even with protective gear,

183
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:01,437
I feel like that smell is still on me
when I go home.

184
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,606
So every time I meet with you,

185
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:07,234
I take a shower before heading out.

186
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,488
Because I'm scared…

187
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,617
I'm scared you'd smell that stench.

188
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,458
I'm not a catch.

189
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:26,128
Anyone would think
I'm not good enough for you

190
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:28,213
if they saw us together.

191
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,091
I also know

192
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,427
that I should stop seeing you,

193
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,679
that I should forget you.

194
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:37,222
But…

195
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,772
we haven't seen each other
these past few days…

196
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,233
and I…

197
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,783
I've missed you so much.

198
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:06,543
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

199
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:10,464
Just because you've told me now
doesn't mean I'm not angry.

200
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:16,720
I'm sorry.

201
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:19,932
As long as you stop being angry,

202
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,392
I'll do anything you want.

203
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,190
Really?

204
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,151
You said it.

205
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,664
Are you sure this is where you want to go?

206
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,251
Yes.

207
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,379
When I was in high school,

208
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,756
my friends who were a couple
brought me here.

209
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,967
They had so much fun at the time.

210
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,137
Perhaps my vision started getting worse

211
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,305
because I saw how affectionate they were.

212
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:06,228
I've always wanted to come back to
a place like this and have some real fun.

213
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:10,315
But later on, I couldn't see anymore
and didn't want to trouble anyone.

214
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,235
But I will keep troubling you today

215
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,238
because you said

216
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,407
I can ask you to do anything.

217
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,493
Sure, I'll play with you.

218
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,205
You have to introduce
every single game to me.

219
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,624
I will be really annoying today.

220
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,084
I'm not scared of that.

221
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,044
Let's go.

222
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:14,815
Thank you.

223
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,110
Let's go.

224
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,196
Hey, this is for you.

225
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,117
No need. You won this.

226
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,286
It's okay. I have this one.

227
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,668
Did you have fun today?

228
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:01,320
Let's go.

229
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,176
Hey.

230
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,762
I haven't forgiven you yet.

231
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:32,017
Then… what else do I have to do?

232
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,604
You said you were going to send me
a photo of yourself.

233
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:39,232
So I've decided
that if you're good-looking,

234
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:40,984
I'll forgive you.

235
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:45,447
Okay.

236
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,533
No editing the photo.
We'll take it together.

237
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,703
<i>5:05. Camera.</i>

238
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:55,999
<i>Camera mode.</i>

239
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,125
<i>Capture.</i>

240
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,424
Is it aligned?

241
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,346
<i>Capture. Press.</i>

242
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,726
TIEN-CHING: I FORGIVE YOU

243
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,117
<i>5:30 p.m.</i>

244
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,410
<i>One notification.</i>

245
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,537
<i>Messages. Now.</i>

246
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,831
<i>Li Jen-yao. What's for dinner?</i>

247
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:54,576
Tien-ching.

248
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,023
That's okay. Do your thing.

249
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,611
Well, let's wait
until you pick me up later

250
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:55,614
to figure out where to buy it.

251
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,290
<i>End. Press.</i>

252
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,512
Ms. Hsia.

253
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,349
Was that your boyfriend?

254
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,478
What does he do for a living?

255
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:28,563
Is he nice to you? What's he like?

256
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:33,860
Ms. Chou,
you're acting like I'm your daughter.

257
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:36,905
Do you question your daughter
that way at home too?

258
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:40,200
No, I don't.

259
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,704
She wouldn't give me the chance

260
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,456
to ask her these questions.

261
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:49,542
How can that be?

262
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:53,588
I remember you said
your daughter is studying dance abroad.

263
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:56,549
She must have a lot of suitors.

264
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:59,010
You should worry about her, not me.

265
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:09,771
What's wrong, Ms. Chou?

266
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:13,400
It's nothing.

267
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:15,819
It's just…

268
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:20,532
I haven't seen her in a long time.

269
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,159
Now that you suddenly ask about her,

270
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,079
I kind of miss her.

271
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,379
Okay, no problem.

272
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:37,966
I will ask our legal team
to send you the contract soon, Mr. Chang.

273
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,510
We'll count on you, Mr. Chang.

274
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,178
Okay.

275
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,305
Thank you. Okay, bye.

276
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,600
Hey, Wen-ling.

277
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:49,811
The boss asked about tomorrow's proposal.

278
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,563
Reply as soon as you can.

279
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:52,772
I'll reply now.

280
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,779
PAY YOUR DEBT, OR I'LL RUIN YOU!

281
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:01,865
LAST WARNING,
REPLY IN TEN MINUTES, OR ELSE!

282
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:09,038
I'LL MAKE SURE EVERYONE
IN YOUR COMPANY RECEIVES THIS VIDEO

283
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:17,547
<i>Motherfucker, I had to do that</i>
<i>before you would call me back, didn't I?</i>

284
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:19,799
Please don't be angry.

285
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,384
I'm sorry.

286
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:24,637
I didn't ignore your messages. I was just…

287
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,139
<i>Cut the chatter.</i>

288
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:29,768
<i>I'll send someone to your place tonight</i>
<i>to collect payment for this period.</i>

289
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,686
I'm not refusing to pay.

290
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:35,190
I really don't have the money
to pay you back right now.

291
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,317
<i>If you don't have money, we can negotiate.</i>

292
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,152
<i>But you ignored my calls and texts.</i>

293
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:42,447
<i>You're fucking asking me</i>
<i>to send someone after you, aren't you?</i>

294
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,950
I just didn't know what to do.

295
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,661
<i>How about this? Here's one last option.</i>

296
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,789
<i>I'll still send someone</i>
<i>to your place today.</i>

297
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,707
<i>I'll try to get a job for you,</i>

298
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,502
<i>so that you can at least pay</i>
<i>the interest for this period.</i>

299
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,295
<i>All right?</i>

300
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:27,909
Okay, it's assembled.

301
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,661
Do you want to check it out?

302
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:48,054
You picked a good shelf.

303
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,182
It's exactly at hand level
when I reach out.

304
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:54,853
Glad you like it.

305
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,819
How come it's suddenly raining?

306
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,697
I just watered my plants.

307
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:08,658
I should head home

308
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,535
before the rain picks up.

309
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,727
Do you want to…

310
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:41,733
do you want to wait
until the rain stops before you leave?

311
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:27,779
Can I ask you a question?

312
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,242
What is it?

313
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:38,706
You can answer me honestly. It's okay.

314
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:44,295
Do you feel bored when you are with me?

315
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,594
Why do you ask?

316
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:56,057
Because I realized

317
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:59,352
that you're very quiet
when you are next to me.

318
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,605
I'm always the one who speaks up.

319
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:05,024
Like right now.

320
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:08,319
I don't think I've asked
if you like classical music.

321
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,905
But I keep playing it for you anyway.

322
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:15,994
To be honest,

323
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,455
I don't know if I like classical music.

324
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,500
But I do know…

325
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,714
I like every piece you've played for me.

326
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,010
Really?

327
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,474
If anything,

328
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:41,352
I'm the one who should be afraid.

329
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:44,939
Because I don't talk much.

330
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,985
I'm afraid you'll find me boring.

331
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,112
I'm afraid

332
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,407
you'll get bored with me.

333
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,789
If that's the case,

334
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:04,876
when you are with me,

335
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,962
it's okay if you don't want to talk

336
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,506
or don't know what to say.

337
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:14,552
Just let me know that you're not sad.

338
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:21,934
How could I possibly be sad…

339
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:25,438
when I'm with you?

340
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:21,619
Let me tell you a secret.

341
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,915
I can't see well with my eyes,

342
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:29,210
but amazingly…

343
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,090
I always feel like I can see you.

344
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:00,283
<i>I know you won't believe it.</i>

345
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:03,953
<i>But every time I'm with you,</i>

346
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,290
<i>I secretly picture your face.</i>

347
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,959
As I continue to picture you,

348
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,212
your face

349
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:17,592
appears effortlessly in my mind.

350
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,847
Just like right now.

351
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:51,811
Take the key card.

352
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,313
The elevator leads to guest rooms.

353
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,067
Hey.

354
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:01,279
Hey! I said to take the key card.

355
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,781
The elevator at the back
leads to guest rooms.

356
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:05,574
Must I repeat it? You want a beating?

357
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,747
Now get out. What are you waiting for?

358
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:14,208
I have to pick up other ladies, okay?

359
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:17,837
Hurry up and get out!

360
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,044
I'm sorry.

361
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,381
Did I tell you to run?

362
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,383
You're good at running, aren't you? Run!

363
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:05,676
Where were you running to?

364
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,805
Easy. If you beat her to a pulp,
how will I fuck her?

365
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,018
Hey, fatty, I told you.

366
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:15,686
This is her first.

367
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,855
She would definitely run.

368
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,065
-Fuck.
-Come on.

369
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:22,026
It's just selling your body.
Why'd you run? You cost me my bet.

370
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:23,611
Hurry up.

371
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,333
I heard we went to the same school.

372
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:41,045
Is that true? I don't remember.

373
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,339
We've never hooked up, have we?

374
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:45,299
Come here.

375
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:47,802
You're quite pretty.

376
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:50,513
If no one looks too closely,
you come off as above average.

377
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,432
I don't see any signs of surgery.

378
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,726
Girlfriend vibes could be
your selling point.

379
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,186
I've seen your video.

380
00:39:57,269 --> 00:40:00,147
Nice color down there.
That could add a few thousand.

381
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:02,608
What do you want?

382
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:05,361
What? A test-drive of course.
How else can we price you?

383
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:06,695
What do you mean?

384
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:11,117
Sorry.

385
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:13,828
Hey, miss.

386
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:16,247
The debt that you owe Nan

387
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:20,418
has now been sold to us.

388
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:22,586
That means, miss,

389
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:24,755
we've bought you.

390
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:28,843
From now on,

391
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:32,471
you are our merchandise.

392
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:38,144
No.

393
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:41,897
No.

394
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:44,108
No!

395
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:04,396
<i>Did you say</i>

396
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:07,149
<i>they recorded everything</i>

397
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:08,567
<i>from that day?</i>

398
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:12,696
They also posted the video online.

399
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,448
That night,

400
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:17,993
Hsiao-tung found that video online

401
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:21,413
in this very room.

402
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:25,584
By the time we realized this,
it was already too late.

403
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:29,463
Millions of people
had already seen the video online.

404
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:34,093
We lost count of
how many people we hired to help.

405
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:35,844
We spent a lot of money

406
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:38,013
hiring lawyers to find ways

407
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:42,393
to remove that video from the Internet.

408
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:44,436
But it was no use.

409
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,902
Then how did Hsiao-tung become this way?

410
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:54,530
Her face

411
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:57,324
and her eyes…

412
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:02,204
Why did she turn into a different person?

413
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:05,082
It's like she doesn't know me.

414
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:09,712
Hsiao-tung didn't just forget you.

415
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:14,550
She doesn't remember

416
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:15,801
who we are either.

417
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:20,639
Since the day
we took Hsiao-tung to the hospital,

418
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:23,726
she has been confused and delirious.

419
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,562
Later, I asked the doctor

420
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,898
to not only fix the scars on her face

421
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:33,235
but also make sure
nobody would recognize her.

422
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,697
We even changed her name.

423
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,741
But then Hsiao-tung started saying

424
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:40,743
she couldn't see.

425
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:42,911
She didn't know why she was there either.

426
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:45,706
She even said
she wasn't the Chiang Hsiao-tung we knew.

427
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:49,877
<i>She said her name</i>

428
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:52,546
<i>was Hsia Tien-ching.</i>

429
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:56,925
<i>At first,</i>

430
00:43:57,426 --> 00:44:00,721
<i>we couldn't accept</i>
<i>how Hsiao-tung had turned out at all.</i>

431
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,140
<i>We thought</i>

432
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:05,434
<i>she had driven herself crazy</i>

433
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:07,770
<i>because she couldn't handle the trauma.</i>

434
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:13,233
<i>So we went to many doctors and counselors,</i>

435
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,402
<i>trying to bring her back to her old self.</i>

436
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:18,656
<i>But none of that worked.</i>

437
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:23,911
<i>She still can't remember</i>
<i>anything that happened in the past.</i>

438
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:27,498
<i>But later on, we realized</i>

439
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:31,877
<i>things weren't quite what we thought.</i>

440
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:38,133
<i>Although Hsiao-tung is nothing like</i>
<i>her old self,</i>

441
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:40,761
<i>and she has forgotten us,</i>

442
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:46,100
<i>she has also forgotten</i>

443
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,727
<i>her worst nightmares.</i>

444
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:50,312
<i>At that moment,</i>

445
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:52,189
<i>we finally understood.</i>

446
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:54,274
<i>Hsiao-tung didn't lose her mind.</i>

447
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:57,569
<i>She just chose a different way</i>

448
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:01,323
<i>to give herself a chance to start over.</i>

449
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:04,034
<i>If possible,</i>

450
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:05,619
<i>once I'm in Taipei this time,</i>

451
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:08,789
I want to start over.

452
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:11,291
Trust me.

453
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:15,129
The next time we meet,

454
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,423
I'll definitely be better

455
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,550
than I am now.

456
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:30,519
<i>If we want to feel that happiness again,</i>

457
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:33,355
<i>the only thing we can do</i>

458
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:36,442
<i>is perhaps let go.</i>

459
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:40,070
<i>Let the happiness we couldn't keep</i>

460
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:41,989
<i>remain in the past.</i>

461
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,157
Hsia Tien-ching!

462
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:55,627
It's been a while.

463
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:54,162
Go to hell.

464
00:47:54,746 --> 00:48:00,377
Go to hell…

465
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,629
Go to hell!

466
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:23,609
<i>Could you tell us about</i>

467
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:26,069
<i>how your eyes have affected your life?</i>

468
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:29,364
<i>Any inconveniences or things like that?</i>

469
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:33,535
<i>Rather than inconveniences in life,</i>

470
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:36,580
<i>I think the greatest trouble</i>

471
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:42,502
<i>is that many people pity me</i>
<i>because of my eyes.</i>

472
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:45,547
<i>When that happens,</i>
<i>I'm glad that I can't see well.</i>

473
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:48,634
<i>At least I don't have to see</i>
<i>what I don't want to.</i>

474
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:51,637
<i>So sometimes I even feel</i>

475
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,722
<i>that perhaps not being able to see</i>

476
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:56,975
<i>is the best gift God has given me.</i>

477
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:38,019
