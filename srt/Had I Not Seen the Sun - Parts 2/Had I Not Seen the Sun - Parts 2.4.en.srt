1
00:00:06,047 --> 00:00:07,298
The last one is cute.

2
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:09,551
Hey, the one on the left is hot.

3
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:11,553
I was hard the whole time.

4
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:13,138
Fuck, you're still hard now?

5
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:14,139
Fuck, are you dumb?

6
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:16,808
Those are ballet clothes,
not underwear and stockings.

7
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:19,602
-You're still hard?
-It's… Yeah.

8
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:20,937
-You're hard?
-Show me.

9
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,063
No.

10
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:52,552
Help me.

11
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:55,597
Help.

12
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,307
Help me.

13
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,111
Fuck!

14
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:15,241
Fuck!

15
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,744
Fuck!

16
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,663
Fuck!

17
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,556
Fuck! I'm going to kill you!

18
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:43,937
You're dead!

19
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,571
I'm going to kill you.

20
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,573
I…

21
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,450
I'm going to kill you.

22
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,411
I'm going to kill you.

23
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,498
I'm going to kill you.

24
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,208
Darling.

25
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,585
I'm going to kill you.

26
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,129
Darling, what's wrong?

27
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,049
Did you have a nightmare again?

28
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,384
I'm going to kill you.

29
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,637
It's all right. Mom's here.

30
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,515
Mom's here. It's okay.

31
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:23,143
It was just a nightmare, okay?

32
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:25,687
Don't be scared. Mom's here. Don't--

33
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,355
Who's scared of him?!

34
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,443
Who's scared of him?! Who…

35
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:40,994
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:43,788
I misspoke.

37
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,248
It's my fault.

38
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,293
The doctor said the reason you often

39
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:50,712
do this…

40
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,132
is something psychological.

41
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,843
If you don't want to see a doctor,

42
00:02:56,926 --> 00:03:00,138
then how about I take you to a temple?

43
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:03,892
I know of a master who's good at treating

44
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,436
this.

45
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,734
I'll wash the bedsheet for you.

46
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:17,614
I won't let anyone know about this.

47
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,074
If…

48
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:24,662
if you want me to buy… adult diapers,

49
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,414
I can buy them for you too.

50
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,750
-Just tell me--
-Are you fucking done yet?!

51
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,252
Even you look down on me, don't you?!

52
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:34,714
Even you think I'm useless, don't you?!

53
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:35,715
Don't you?!

54
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,884
Don't you?!

55
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:53,066
Darling, don't be like this.

56
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:54,984
I don't think--

57
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,528
You're the most useless,

58
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:58,446
you know?

59
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:03,701
Why didn't you kill Li Jen-yao
when he was in prison?

60
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,079
Why didn't you kill him?

61
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:07,789
Speak!

62
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,874
You're the most useless!

63
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,252
Who made me

64
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,087
turn out this way?

65
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,589
Why didn't you kill him?!

66
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,425
Who made me turn out this way?!

67
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,386
It's all because of you!

68
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:22,804
It's because of you!

69
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,889
You're useless! Trash!

70
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,767
You're the most useless.
How dare you talk about me!

71
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,561
Are you looking down on me?!

72
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:33,940
You're looking down on me.

73
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,567
You're useless. It's all because of you!

74
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,194
Speak!

75
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,279
What?!

76
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:42,907
Speak!

77
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:12,747
HAD I NOT SEEN THE SUN

78
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,050
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

79
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:27,678
Do you know
if that family still lives here?

80
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,515
They moved out a while ago.

81
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,851
Do you know where they are now

82
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,686
or how I can reach them?

83
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,438
No, I don't.

84
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:38,689
I'm sorry.

85
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,716
FOR RENT, FURNISHED, 9,000 NTD

86
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:09,137
Where exactly did you go?

87
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:53,598
Oh, you are up.

88
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,436
Just a moment. The coffee's almost done.

89
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,158
Good morning.

90
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:13,534
Good morning.

91
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,588
How did you get these injuries?

92
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,010
They were

93
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,721
from when my dad used to beat me.

94
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,901
I can't imagine that.

95
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,862
Why would someone
treat their child that way?

96
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,624
That's all in the past now.

97
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,507
If we had met earlier,

98
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,094
would our lives have been different?

99
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,256
I can't stop you two.

100
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,718
So you'd better keep your word.

101
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:10,818
Offer flowers.

102
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:17,533
Next, the Lai Foundation.

103
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,743
Please be ready.

104
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:22,079
Please bow to the deceased. One.

105
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,916
The ritual is complete.
Please return to your seats.

106
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,504
Yun-chen.

107
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,049
This is madam's…

108
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,925
-Granddaughter.
-I see.

109
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,677
You're finally dead.

110
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,615
Class leader?

111
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:01,202
It's been a while.
Here for your grandma's funeral?

112
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,331
Let's have a meal some time.

113
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,668
Hey, you can invite Chiang Hsiao-tung too.

114
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,171
But I heard she's dead.

115
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,423
I think it was suicide.

116
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,384
You… you didn't know?

117
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:20,721
Explain it to me.
Why did you say it was suicide?

118
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,264
What exactly happened to her?

119
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:26,477
Calm down.
I don't know if she's really dead.

120
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,979
Everyone just says she killed herself.

121
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,148
I think it's such a pity.

122
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,650
I think about her often too.

123
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:35,319
All right.

124
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,655
Let's meet while we still can.
We were classmates.

125
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,532
My condolences. I'll head inside.

126
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:48,541
MIGHTY GOOD CLEANING SERVICES

127
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:49,875
Here you go.

128
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,101
You forgot your drink from Dad.

129
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,116
Thank you.

130
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,879
What? Do you like handsome guys?

131
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,590
You never give me one.
I always get it myself.

132
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,717
-Here, give it to Dad.
-Bad girl.

133
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,428
-Give it to Dad.
-One for me? How nice of you.

134
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:43,721
Big K.

135
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,893
Can we talk later?

136
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,438
What did you say?

137
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:54,815
I said…

138
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,068
this is my last month.

139
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:00,946
Why?

140
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:09,371
You found her.

141
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:17,797
Hang on.

142
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,384
Hi, Mighty Good Cleaning.

143
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,225
Sorry, you've asked the wrong guy.

144
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,727
I'm not in touch with that family anymore.

145
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,524
Fuck. What the hell do you mean?

146
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,568
I told you.
I'm not involved with them anymore.

147
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:43,322
I don't know where that jerk is,
what he's doing, or what he's up to.

148
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:44,615
Nor do I want to know.

149
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,659
Get it? Don't call again.

150
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:47,868
Why did he call me?

151
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,042
It was an old friend.

152
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,586
He was asking about your classmate.

153
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:01,131
He said your classmate's underling
slept with a boss's woman.

154
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,300
The gang is now looking for him.

155
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,436
You really don't know where Ouyang Ti is?

156
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,609
Back then, to get out,

157
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,820
do you know the price I paid?

158
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:27,199
Don't you know what I paid
to walk normally like other people?

159
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,244
Would I be stupid enough
to reconnect with them?

160
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,882
Since you've found her,

161
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,134
forget the past.

162
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,344
Move on.

163
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:51,765
Don't let things from the past
that you can't change

164
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,101
ruin your future with her.

165
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:17,583
<i>Legislator Ouyang announced last week</i>
<i>he'd run in Taichung's mayoral primary.</i>

166
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,794
<i>He seems to have recovered</i>
<i>from his son's alleged drug involvement.</i>

167
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:24,798
<i>Although his son wasn't prosecuted</i>
<i>in the end due to insufficient evidence,</i>

168
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:28,135
<i>the drug case still cost</i>
<i>Ouyang Hsiang the election.</i>

169
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:31,013
<i>He brought his youngest son,</i>
<i>who just started middle school,</i>

170
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,681
<i>to canvass the streets with him today.</i>

171
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,351
<i>The first stop was</i>
<i>in Wu Ching-ming's electoral district.</i>

172
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:39,063
<i>Since Wu declared his intention</i>
<i>to run in the primary just a few days ago…</i>

173
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:41,315
What's with you
and news about that old man?

174
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:44,109
<i>…to dissuade Wu Ching-ming</i>
<i>and consolidate the party…</i>

175
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,194
Nothing.

176
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:48,155
It just happened to be on TV.

177
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,201
Do you also think

178
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,620
we've ended up like this

179
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,080
because of me?

180
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:58,540
No.

181
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,335
I never thought of it that way.

182
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,046
Stop lying.

183
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,758
Did it never occur to you

184
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:12,179
that the bitch who threw herself at him

185
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:15,182
couldn't have replaced you

186
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:17,434
if it weren't for your disgraceful son?

187
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:24,108
I've never thought of it that way.

188
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,042
What's up?

189
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:55,347
I see.

190
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,059
Right.

191
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,352
Okay.

192
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,396
-I see.
-I got bentos.

193
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,231
Okay.

194
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:08,235
So you haven't kept in touch
with Hsiao-tung?

195
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,530
Then

196
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,868
do you know why Hsiao-tung
transferred to a school in Taipei?

197
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:17,745
I see.

198
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,497
Okay. All right, thank you.

199
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,041
Okay. Bye.

200
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,836
Why have you started looking for
your good friend again recently?

201
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:29,423
I remember you looked for her
for a while a few years ago,

202
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:31,592
then you gave up, didn't you?

203
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:37,973
Back then, she disappeared without a word.

204
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:42,186
She moved and changed her cell number.

205
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,064
I tried everything
and still couldn't find her.

206
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,192
Later on,

207
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,235
I was too scared to look for her.

208
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:51,862
Why?

209
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,659
Maybe I was afraid
she really didn't want me as a friend.

210
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,037
All these years,

211
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,872
even while I was in the UK,

212
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:04,500
I was afraid to change
my email and cell number

213
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,835
because I was waiting

214
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,630
for a day when she might think of me…

215
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,716
and want to reconnect.

216
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:18,764
But when I was in Taichung this time,
I met a high school classmate.

217
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:23,060
He…

218
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,564
he said Hsiao-tung committed suicide.

219
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:28,774
Suicide?

220
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,692
I don't know.

221
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,694
I don't believe it either.

222
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,074
But no one has seen
Hsiao-tung all these years.

223
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,620
She moved and transferred schools.

224
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,541
Maybe something did happen.

225
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:51,964
But if that's why she couldn't contact me…

226
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:56,385
then I really can't forgive myself.

227
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,680
Hi, everyone.

228
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,348
I'm Lisa, and this is Mimi.

229
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:03,142
We are Lisa Mimi.

230
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:06,395
Check out my new favorite lip gloss.

231
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,355
Everyone, this is

232
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,691
Bobo Seamless Kissie…

233
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,610
This… is

234
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:16,822
Bobo Perfect Seamless Kissie…

235
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:20,826
Fuck! Why the hell
is the name so fucking long? Damn it.

236
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,204
Such a fucking bad product.

237
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,248
And I can't get a single word wrong.

238
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:29,168
Shitty company. Stingy as hell.

239
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,669
This is too gluey!

240
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,296
Super annoying!

241
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,256
If only I weren't short on cash now.

242
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:38,177
Only 100,000 NTD, and they want all that?

243
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,136
Hey.

244
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:42,139
I market myself as
a cultured, elegant, ethereal goddess.

245
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:44,266
I have hundreds
of thousands of subscribers.

246
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,311
They wanted me,
but didn't bother to check my rates?

247
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,443
Could you not smoke here?

248
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,862
I don't really like secondhand smoke.

249
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,406
What now?

250
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,617
Idiot.

251
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,040
Hello?

252
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:10,751
Tsai Wen-ling.

253
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,294
What's this about?

254
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:15,380
A class reunion?

255
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,806
-This is from the same store?
-Yes.

256
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:25,807
No.

257
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:27,726
It's a bit hard.

258
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,479
Yes, I think so too.

259
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,481
-That's great.
-Hey, how's your drink?

260
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:35,734
Sorry. Excuse me, I'm late.

261
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:38,695
-It's okay.
-The cameraman was so slow just now.

262
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,323
Hey, we're all subscribed.
You're so popular now.

263
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,282
-Really?
-Yes.

264
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,617
-Thanks.
-You're so pretty.

265
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,202
-Thank you.
-You're great.

266
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,787
-I'm so jealous of you.
-Nah.

267
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:51,083
-We've ordered. Pick whatever you like.
-Okay, thanks.

268
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,585
Have you all received a call from a girl

269
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,420
asking about Hsiao-tung recently?

270
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,214
Yes, I have.

271
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:59,591
She asked if I knew
who still talks to Hsiao-tung.

272
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:02,552
I just said,
"I haven't heard. I don't know."

273
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:03,553
Who's that girl?

274
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:05,305
Lai Yun-chen.

275
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:08,600
I forgot which class she was in,
but she was close to Hsiao-tung.

276
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:12,104
She changed schools before Hsiao-tung,
so she didn't know what happened later.

277
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,064
I was afraid to tell her.

278
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:16,817
I said I don't know, or I'm not in touch.

279
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,820
Right, she's Hsiao-tung's friend,
and even she doesn't know.

280
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,613
I couldn't say it either.

281
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:24,283
So do any of you still talk to Hsiao-tung?

282
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,993
Didn't she commit suicide?

283
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:28,161
Is that true? Why does everyone say that?

284
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:34,918
I think it's because of that.

285
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:39,172
Wasn't Hsiao-tung filmed?

286
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,759
After she transferred schools,
some boys shared the videos.

287
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:46,596
Then someone said they saw her
being sent to a hospital in Taipei.

288
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,057
She was all bloody,
like there was no hope for her.

289
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,310
-Yes, I remember it was like that.
-Yeah.

290
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:52,728
Isn't that such a pity?

291
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,688
She was the best dancer in our class,

292
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,607
but she ended up like this.

293
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:15,125
We were all chatting earlier.
I didn't get to talk to you alone.

294
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:18,337
Actually, I've been watching your videos.

295
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,089
You look more beautiful in person.

296
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,925
-You must have a lot of suitors.
-It's all right.

297
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:27,888
But if you are comparing me
with those ordinary girls,

298
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,222
of course, I have a lot.

299
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:33,143
Your job must pay well.

300
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,729
Actually, it's not that much.

301
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:38,023
My channel earns little.
Brand deals are flaky.

302
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:40,942
Besides, I have to pay
my editors and content managers.

303
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,903
They earn more than I do.

304
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:44,488
After paying them this month,

305
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:46,531
I can't even afford a handbag.

306
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,579
If you need money,

307
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:54,206
I can refer you for a job.

308
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,500
I'm in ad sales now.

309
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,543
We often work with clients abroad.

310
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:01,963
We have a US client
who's planning to move to Taiwan.

311
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:05,217
He's looking for a pretty
and classy girl like you to hang out with.

312
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:08,095
-Hang out?
-Actually, it's just having meals.

313
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,305
And going to attractions
in Taiwan with him.

314
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,807
Like a companion.

315
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:12,933
You know, bosses.

316
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:16,228
Relationships are too much trouble,
but they don't want to be lonely.

317
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:20,273
Then how much is it
for each meal and each hangout?

318
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:22,859
100,000 NTD for meals.
Not sure about hangouts.

319
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:25,362
Maybe you'll have to meet and discuss it.

320
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:26,446
But don't worry.

321
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,907
I'll make sure you're happy with the deal.

322
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:32,077
But I won't sleep with him.
After all, I'm somewhat known.

323
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,620
Yes, of course.

324
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:35,705
Why don't you meet with him first?

325
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:38,333
He said if he's pleased,

326
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,793
he'll pay you

327
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,586
a 200,000 NTD deposit at once.

328
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,338
200,000 NTD just to meet?

329
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,923
Are you free after we're done?

330
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:47,843
I can let him know
if you can meet him tonight.

331
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:50,720
Sure.

332
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:51,638
Okay.

333
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:03,316
My client highly values privacy.

334
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,568
Don't worry.

335
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:07,821
Although I'm not going up with you,
I'll wait for you here.

336
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:09,364
Just come to me if anything is off.

337
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:11,408
Sure, as long as he pays me.

338
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:12,576
Okay.

339
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,123
Just swipe in.

340
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:21,751
Thanks. I'll buy you a meal
after I get the money.

341
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:23,211
It's nothing.

342
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,297
You're the one helping me.

343
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:41,146
You found a replacement so quickly?

344
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:42,898
Hey.

345
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:45,567
Who is it?

346
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,155
It's okay.

347
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:51,865
I'll take a look myself.

348
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,783
That room was prepared for you anyway.

349
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:54,910
It has

350
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,411
a camera.

351
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,877
It's an old classmate.

352
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:06,004
Is this a class reunion?

353
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,674
You look like such a good girl.

354
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:10,842
I didn't expect this.

355
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:15,972
Hey.

356
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,182
Do you want to watch?

357
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:18,350
It's heating up.

358
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:20,685
Come.

359
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,103
Come here.

360
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,772
You can't see if you look down.

361
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,273
Come on.

362
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,234
Can't face what you've done?

363
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:52,801
<i>Tsai Wen-ling.</i>

364
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,220
<i>You really have been an idiot</i>
<i>since high school.</i>

365
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:58,056
<i>You wanted to trick me,</i>
<i>but didn't check who Ouyang is to me?</i>

366
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,350
<i>Since high school,</i>

367
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:03,228
<i>Ouyang and I have hooked up</i>
<i>countless times.</i>

368
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:06,147
We couldn't be closer.

369
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,902
In fact, when you were discussing
prices with me,

370
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:13,113
I already knew what you were up to.

371
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:15,699
Earlier downstairs,

372
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:18,118
Ouyang and I were laughing at you
in our texts.

373
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,580
<i>Ouyang.</i>

374
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:24,624
-Yes.
<i>-Punish that bitch properly for me.</i>

375
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,334
Oh, give it to me.

376
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,836
Sure.

377
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:30,797
What do you want her to do
before you forgive her?

378
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:34,342
<i>She wanted to turn me into a porn actress.</i>

379
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:36,678
Given my status,

380
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:40,265
<i>it's only fair to pay me</i>

381
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,225
<i>a few million NTD, right?</i>

382
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:49,941
Sure. Let me handle this.

383
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:53,445
Come on.

384
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:02,162
A two-million NTD promissory note.

385
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:03,246
Sign before you leave.

386
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,833
I really don't have any money left.

387
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,960
I'm sorry. Spare me.

388
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:11,212
I can't afford that.

389
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:15,425
I know you don't have money.

390
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,678
Aren't your parents civil servants?

391
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,764
They should have some money, right?

392
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,728
Don't go to my parents.

393
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,146
They have no part in this.

394
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:30,857
Spare me.

395
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:33,943
I won't go to them, then.

396
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,613
You come to me, all right?

397
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:39,574
Each week,

398
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,409
I'll only charge you

399
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,119
3% interest.

400
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,663
Okay? All right?

401
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:46,831
Hang on.

402
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:57,509
Okay, got it, bye.

403
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:01,554
Remember,

404
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:05,725
if I don't see the money
by next Wednesday,

405
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,061
you'll see what happens.

406
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:11,147
Come on.

407
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:15,860
You can do it.

408
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,571
Hey, get the actress to sign.

409
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,365
Then take some promotional shots.

410
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,120
Fatty!

411
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,621
What's up?

412
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:27,747
What's going on?

413
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,419
-I just got a call.
-Yeah.

414
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:35,463
A few call girls
filed a police report yesterday.

415
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,091
They testified that Wei-ting drugged them

416
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:40,844
and that he was the one
who sold the videos online.

417
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,724
Let's set a breakpoint first, okay?

418
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,350
You took the site down?

419
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:48,685
Yes.

420
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,979
I also removed
the hard drives in the office.

421
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:53,064
What are your plans for the warehouse?

422
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:56,526
I already asked someone to move
all the goods to a different place.

423
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:57,610
It should be fine.

424
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,364
Great job, then, fatty!

425
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,825
You don't need to worry.

426
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,493
There is no evidence.

427
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,579
The police can't do anything about us.

428
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:09,289
No.

429
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,460
The problem now isn't the cops.

430
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:16,254
-Okay.
-It's Kun.

431
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,641
How's Baldy Kun involved?

432
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:33,146
One of the call girls
who filed a report yesterday

433
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:34,647
is

434
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,400
Kun's chick.

435
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,415
Didn't I warn you guys earlier

436
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,251
not to touch that girl?

437
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:56,628
Didn't I?

438
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,339
We never touched her again
after your warning.

439
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:03,676
Who knows what got into Fan Wei-ting
that he messed around with her later on?

440
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:09,015
Fuck, I'm not his penis!
How could I control him?

441
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:25,740
Anyway…

442
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:28,743
anyway, Kun's men have spread the word.

443
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:33,081
He said if we don't hand Wei-ting over,

444
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:35,166
from now on,

445
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:36,835
when he sees us,

446
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,253
he'll shoot first.

447
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:42,340
Ouyang, how about…
we ask your dad to handle it?

448
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:50,515
Find that damn idiot, Fan Wei-ting, first.

449
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,934
Where is he now?

450
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:55,144
I don't know.

451
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,312
His phone is off.

452
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,273
He's been missing since yesterday.

453
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,788
Fuck!

454
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:26,509
Do you think Kun and his men
have already got hold of Fan Wei-ting?

455
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,096
Fuck, if that's the case,

456
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:32,223
he's really dead meat.

457
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,267
I don't fucking care if he's dead or not!

458
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:39,397
I'm worried that coward
will sell us all out to cover his ass!

459
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,398
Okay?

460
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,776
What matters most now

461
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:46,487
is to find him

462
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:48,364
before anyone else does.

463
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,324
Okay?

464
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,743
Got it?

465
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,077
Go!

466
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,629
This lamp seems nice,

467
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,548
but it might be a bit too short.

468
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:09,928
Can you help me pick a lamp?

469
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,805
It can have a more unusual shape.

470
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:15,475
I want it in the living room.
The old one is broken.

471
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,685
Will regular ceiling lights work?

472
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,480
It's not that they won't work.

473
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:24,150
It's just that if I wake up
in the middle of the night

474
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:27,195
and there are different light sources
to help me orient myself,

475
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,571
I'll feel more at ease.

476
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,407
That's why you have all kinds of lamps.

477
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,159
Right.

478
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,245
Come on. Let's check over there.

479
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,413
Okay.

480
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,846
<i>Let's celebrate Christmas together.</i>

481
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,264
<i>How do we celebrate it?</i>

482
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,183
We'll decorate
the Christmas tree together,

483
00:32:58,518 --> 00:32:59,894
have a feast,

484
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:01,270
and exchange gifts.

485
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:07,777
Does it have to be a lamp?

486
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:11,531
What about a Christmas tree with lights?

487
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,075
Why get a Christmas tree?

488
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:17,453
It's a while before Christmas.

489
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:23,793
I remember

490
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:26,295
when I was in high school,

491
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,716
I once told someone

492
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,135
that I had never celebrated Christmas,

493
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:36,014
so I didn't know
what to do during Christmas.

494
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:40,560
They told me Christmas is spent
with someone special to you,

495
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:42,603
decorating the Christmas tree together,

496
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,564
and exchanging gifts.

497
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:51,195
That must be a girl.

498
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:56,200
So, in the end,
did she decorate the Christmas tree,

499
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,994
exchange gifts,

500
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:00,496
and celebrate Christmas with you,
her special someone?

501
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:07,462
No.

502
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,173
Later on,

503
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:12,550
I still didn't get to celebrate Christmas.

504
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:18,389
But it's my wish now to celebrate
Christmas with someone special to me.

505
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,767
It's not Christmas yet.

506
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,101
However,

507
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,313
if possible…

508
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,692
I want my first Christmas to be with you.

509
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,284
I'm freer these days.

510
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,203
A few straight days off.

511
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:42,038
Is there anywhere you want to go?

512
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:45,708
The seaside.

513
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:49,629
Sure.

514
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:53,049
Forget it.

515
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:55,968
I think we'd need to keep
changing buses to get there.

516
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:58,346
It's such a hassle. Forget it.

517
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,556
It's okay. I'll find a way.

518
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,809
If you want to go there, let's do it.

519
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,187
Okay.

520
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:10,650
Why do you

521
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:13,194
suddenly want to go to the seaside?

522
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:16,781
I had a dream a few days ago.

523
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,826
<i>I dreamed that I went</i>
<i>to the seaside with you.</i>

524
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,370
<i>But this dream was unique.</i>

525
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,038
<i>It wasn't just you and me.</i>

526
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,749
<i>There was another girl</i>
<i>walking in front of us.</i>

527
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,126
<i>I don't know why,</i>

528
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,169
<i>but I felt nostalgic</i>

529
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:33,089
<i>looking at her back.</i>

530
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:37,802
<i>It's like I've been waiting for her</i>
<i>for a long time.</i>

531
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:43,015
I remember calling her name in the dream.

532
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:44,517
Her name is…

533
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:46,269
Yun-chen.

534
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,194
Yun-chen. Her name is Yun-chen.

535
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,280
But I don't know her at all.

536
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:02,160
Maybe that's why I still remember it
after a few days.

537
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,600
Long time no see.

538
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,810
Yun-chen, you still look the same.

539
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,395
You haven't changed much.

540
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,150
I remember you were your class's leader.

541
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,777
And your family seemed well-off.

542
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,155
I heard from my classmates

543
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:41,240
that your grandma
was a landowner back home.

544
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:42,158
Is that true?

545
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:44,869
You didn't ask to meet
just to discuss my grandma, did you?

546
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,079
No.

547
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:49,498
At our class reunion a while ago,

548
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:52,585
I heard from my classmates that
you were asking about Chiang Hsiao-tung.

549
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:56,547
But you didn't want to tell me anything
over the phone

550
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,633
and insisted that we meet in person.

551
00:36:58,716 --> 00:36:59,550
Why?

552
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,095
Because

553
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:06,015
I don't know
where Chiang Hsiao-tung is now.

554
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,644
But I know what happened to her

555
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,312
after you transferred schools

556
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,357
and why she cut contact with everyone.

557
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:31,082
It's just that I'm in some trouble now,

558
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:32,541
and I need money.

559
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,168
If you lend me two million NTD,

560
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,963
I'll tell you everything I know.

561
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,631
Are you kidding me?

562
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,175
Wait.

563
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:45,429
Don't you want to know what happened
to your friend Chiang Hsiao-tung?

564
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,182
Stop wasting my time.

565
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:49,850
Let go.

566
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:54,647
Leave if you want.

567
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:55,898
When you get home,

568
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:58,401
look up a few keywords if you have time.

569
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,197
"Yi-no High School,"

570
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:04,615
"leaked video,"

571
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:06,742
and "gang rape."

572
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,542
If you want to know more details,

573
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:17,086
as long as you lend me two million NTD,

574
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:19,213
I'll tell you everything I know.

575
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:23,217
I guarantee you,
no one else in the world will tell you

576
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,094
what exactly happened to Hsiao-tung.

577
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,724
Mr. Li, the transfer is done.

578
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,475
Here are the documents and keys.

579
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:32,685
They are yours now.

580
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,272
Thank you.

581
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,828
<i>Are you taking me to the seaside?</i>

582
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:52,246
<i>It's such a hassle.</i>

583
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:53,914
<i>From now on,</i>

584
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:57,710
<i>I'll take you wherever you want to go.</i>

585
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:01,857
Give me 100,000 NTD first.

586
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:05,027
That's not a problem, of course.

587
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,196
You'll enjoy it so much
that you won't be able to work.

588
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:16,664
Li Jen-yao, your girl's a good bang.
Have you boned her before?

589
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,833
We're brothers if you have.

590
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,588
Fucking moron.

591
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:19,119
<i>Call ended.</i>

592
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,401
I thought

593
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:53,571
whoever was following me was probably
a police officer or Kun's man.

594
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:57,866
I didn't expect it to be you,
a fucking mad dog.

595
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:08,711
I even wondered

596
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:11,839
if I should ask
why you were following me for no reason

597
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:13,382
and let you explain.

598
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:16,885
But look at your damn face.
It's fucking pointless to ask.

599
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:21,765
I really don't get it.

600
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:25,436
That was fucking centuries ago, you…

601
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:27,062
You're that mad?

602
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:33,694
We just fooled around
and fucked your girl.

603
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,904
Was it that big a deal?

604
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:38,407
Do you have to back everyone into a corner
like that?

605
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,326
Do you?

606
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:44,788
Well…

607
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:51,211
I apologize.

608
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:54,423
We were wrong.

609
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:56,216
I'm sorry, okay?

610
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,354
I fucked your girl and made you upset.

611
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:10,648
It's my fault.

612
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,107
I'll let you fuck me.

613
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:15,527
Fuck me till you're satisfied, go ahead.

614
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:19,073
We'll both have fun
and call it even then, okay?

615
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:22,785
Come on.

616
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:36,840
Or do you want me to fuck you?

617
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,553
I can do you too.

618
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:43,514
I fuck really well.

619
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:46,850
Ask Hsiao-tung if you're not convinced.

620
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,236
Many people fucked her that day,
but she had the most fun with me.

621
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:00,572
She screamed so loudly.

622
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:02,533
When it was my turn,

623
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:04,034
she was a bit loose already.

624
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:06,829
But it was fine, I was good.
You saw it then, right?

625
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:08,664
She still loved it when I fucked her,

626
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:12,876
so much so that, even though she said no,
her whole body was shaking!

627
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:25,764
Fuck! What the hell?

628
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,402
I'm sorry.

629
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:40,362
I'm sorry.

630
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:42,698
I'm sorry.

631
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:36,147
