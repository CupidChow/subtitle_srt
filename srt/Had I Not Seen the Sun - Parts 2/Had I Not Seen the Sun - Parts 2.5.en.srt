00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,398
TIEN-CHING

2
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:13,031
2 NEW MESSAGES, 8 MISSED CALLS

3
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:18,411
3 NEW MESSAGES

4
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,330
WHERE ARE YOU? WHY DIDN'T YOU PICK UP?

5
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,998
ARE YOU OKAY? IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

6
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,917
WHERE ARE YOU? WHY DIDN'T YOU PICK UP?

7
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:35,386
What should I do?

8
00:02:55,049 --> 00:03:01,306
HAD I NOT SEEN THE SUN

9
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:26,831
Come.

10
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,045
-Look, it's so easy.
-Hurry up.

11
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:33,838
Hurry up!

12
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,381
What are you afraid of?

13
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:38,676
<i>Don't open the door.</i>

14
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:14,587
It's me.

15
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:18,633
What's wrong?

16
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,136
You didn't pick up.
I thought something happened to you.

17
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,225
Why are your clothes wet?

18
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,562
You came here in the rain?

19
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,452
I'm sorry.

20
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,122
I know we had a date today.

21
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:53,293
I thought today's job
was going to be simple,

22
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,295
and I'd be here sooner.

23
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,132
I didn't think something would come up.

24
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,009
-I--
-It's okay.

25
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,010
It's fine.

26
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:03,845
I wasn't angry.

27
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:05,638
Just worried about you.

28
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,098
Look.

29
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,434
You're all drenched.

30
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:13,062
Go take a hot shower first,
or you might catch a cold.

31
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:14,814
I'll get a towel for you.

32
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,335
<i>Hold her tight!</i>

33
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,252
<i>Hurry up.</i>

34
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,087
<i>Come on.</i>

35
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,465
<i>Get up here.</i>

36
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,987
FAN WEI-TING

37
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:07,820
You're done showering?

38
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,493
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

39
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,786
Ms. Chou left some food.

40
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,246
It's really delicious.

41
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,956
Let me heat it up real quick.

42
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,084
I'll help.

43
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,753
It's okay.

44
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:27,048
Heating up food is easy.
I can do it myself.

45
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,341
Get some rest.

46
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,594
Okay.

47
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,219
I'll only ask you once.

48
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,805
Where is Fan Wei-ting?

49
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,350
Who are you guys?

50
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:28,067
You don't understand simple English,
do you?

51
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,443
I'm asking you…

52
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,072
You want me to ask again?

53
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,658
I don't know where he is.

54
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,828
I've been looking for him for days too.

55
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:40,997
You can check my phone.

56
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,873
I texted him. He didn't even--

57
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,675
Speak!

58
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,430
Okay.

59
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,890
I'll bring some folks over now, okay?

60
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:07,898
He's still missing.

61
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:09,942
But his vehicle is nearby.

62
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:13,154
Some of Wei-ting's stuff is here.

63
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,574
We also found some receipts.

64
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:20,202
They are from the past two days.

65
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,955
So I think

66
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,999
he should still be hiding nearby.

67
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:26,542
Unlikely he went far.

68
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,965
Do you smell some kind of cleaner?

69
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:34,842
Is there?

70
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,827
Don't bother searching.

71
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,996
He's not here.

72
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,382
Okay.

73
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,758
I'll let you go.

74
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,009
I'm almost at work too.

75
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,761
It's true. I swear.

76
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,513
-See you later.
-I'm not lying.

77
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:23,265
-Really?
-Are there pictures?

78
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:25,851
Tien-ching, there you are.

79
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,895
-Morning.
-Good morning.

80
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,230
What were you discussing?

81
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:32,149
We were talking about Joy.
You know Joy, right?

82
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,819
That new hire in advertising.

83
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:38,656
I met her when I was working on
sponsorships for my show.

84
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:40,074
Yes, that's her.

85
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:42,660
You know what?
She traveled to New Zealand this week.

86
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:46,247
So I thought I might as well ask her
to bring something for me.

87
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:49,208
When I called her,
she told me to call back later.

88
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,085
She was trying on wedding dresses.

89
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,463
Trying on wedding dresses?
Is she getting married?

90
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,465
Exactly, I thought it was weird too.

91
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,217
Then I found out

92
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,261
that she's marrying a tomboy.

93
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,846
Joy is so gorgeous.

94
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,140
But she's a lesbian.
Isn't that unbelievable?

95
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:05,641
Not really.

96
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:09,395
As long as she's happy, it doesn't matter
if she likes men or women.

97
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:13,107
No, the point is that her tomboy

98
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:16,277
is just a server at a restaurant.

99
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,738
Hey, I heard that
Joy's family is super wealthy.

100
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,990
If I were her mom,
I'd probably blow a fuse.

101
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,533
-Seriously.
-Totally.

102
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,034
Wang,

103
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:27,663
if I tell you
that my boyfriend is just a cleaner

104
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,206
who went to jail before,

105
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:34,253
and I'm just a blind person
who may have to trouble others forever,

106
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:37,757
then, from your perspective,
which of us is unworthy of the other?

107
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,425
And who is ruining whose life?

108
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,803
Or would you say that
my boyfriend and I are a perfect match?

109
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:50,728
Tien-ching,

110
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,605
I didn't mean it like that.

111
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:53,898
Don't say that.

112
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,775
I just think

113
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,986
that whether two people like each other

114
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,989
is more important
than meeting social expectations.

115
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,910
I think I've found
the topic for this episode.

116
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:11,624
"What makes two people
a good match in romance?"

117
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,918
Let's discuss it this time.

118
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,046
I'm going to get ready.

119
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,172
Tien-ching.

120
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:27,765
Yun-chen,

121
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,435
I've already told you
what I know about the incident.

122
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,437
You believe me now, right?

123
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,068
Here's the money.

124
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,111
Thank you.

125
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,451
There's one thing you haven't explained.

126
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:51,455
What was your role

127
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:54,083
in this incident?

128
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:58,754
Why do you know so much about it?

129
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:38,627
Tien-ching.

130
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,845
Let's go.

131
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,361
What's wrong?

132
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:09,700
I… don't want to care about
what others think of us.

133
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:11,785
I just wanna hug you.

134
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:23,213
Did something happen to you at work today?

135
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:26,008
How come you seem a bit down?

136
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:30,304
Nothing.

137
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,600
I'm happy that I can be with you.

138
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,226
Besides…

139
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,107
we're going to spend the weekend together.

140
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,734
Why would I be sad?

141
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:46,153
Good.

142
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,155
Where do you want to go?

143
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:49,782
Should we eat first,

144
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,575
or do you want to go for a walk?

145
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,996
Actually, there is a place
that I really want to go,

146
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,165
but I haven't had the chance yet.

147
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:02,503
Where is that?

148
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,132
I want to go

149
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:08,550
to your place.

150
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:29,989
One moment.

151
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,921
Sorry, there isn't an elevator.

152
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:53,220
You… can give me your bag and jacket.

153
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:56,765
Thank you.

154
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:09,194
This is where I live.

155
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:13,282
That's it?

156
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,036
It's my first time here.
Aren't you gonna tell me more?

157
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,206
Okay.

158
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,669
My place is a bit small.

159
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:31,216
I don't have a sofa or TV.

160
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,929
There is a table in front of you

161
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,933
and a bed further out to your right.

162
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,937
On your right is a window.

163
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,857
There are lots of shop signs outside.

164
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,818
They're lit 24 hours a day.

165
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,238
They're too bright for me.

166
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,159
On your left

167
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:00,287
is a bunch of stuff left by the landlord.

168
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,622
And…

169
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,251
That's all.

170
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:14,176
By the way, if you want to sit and rest,

171
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,970
I'll clear some space for you.

172
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:18,639
It's okay.

173
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:24,269
Can I walk around on my own for a bit?

174
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:28,524
Sure.

175
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,333
That's the window.

176
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:50,587
A helmet.

177
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,464
Yours.

178
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,051
A drawer.

179
00:18:58,428 --> 00:18:59,263
Keys.

180
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:02,558
Is this your CD?

181
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,269
It's classical music I bought a while ago.

182
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,354
You listen to that?

183
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:10,691
As long as it's something
you've recommended on your show,

184
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,943
I'll buy and listen to it.

185
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:19,908
Do you want to listen?

186
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:38,260
This is Debussy's "Clair de lune."

187
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,761
I really like it.

188
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,513
I know.

189
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,098
You've mentioned it.

190
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:47,227
When you got sick in high school
and started losing your vision,

191
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,688
you used to fall asleep
to this piece every day.

192
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:53,066
When did I tell you this?

193
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,777
Actually,

194
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,448
I heard you say that on your show.

195
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:04,203
You said every time you hear this piece,

196
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:07,414
every piano note in the quiet night

197
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,918
feels like a slow step

198
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,628
down a long, dark corridor.

199
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:15,797
It feels like

200
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,883
you are waiting for a certain moment

201
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,385
and a certain person.

202
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:24,431
You always feel like when the music ends,

203
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:28,227
the darkness before you will fade,

204
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:30,229
and dawn will come.

205
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,986
The view and the person

206
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,114
you've been waiting for

207
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,326
will appear in front of you.

208
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:50,457
I don't understand music.

209
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,168
So when I first started listening,

210
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,880
I didn't know what I was listening to.

211
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,134
I only knew

212
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,263
that this was your favorite music.

213
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:08,767
But as I continued to listen…

214
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,437
I thought of you.

215
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:18,151
And then, suddenly, I got it.

216
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:23,949
It feels like…

217
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:30,455
when the music ends…

218
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:40,841
The person I've been waiting for
will appear in front of me.

219
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:51,852
Thank you.

220
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,606
Why did you say that?

221
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,157
Because I feel lucky…

222
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:08,785
to have met you.

223
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,331
Honestly, I never thought

224
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:14,166
that one day

225
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,793
this could happen.

226
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:20,339
Being in the apartment of someone I like.

227
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,592
Hearing you say…

228
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:26,845
how much you like me.

229
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:30,891
Hearing you describe

230
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:35,604
how well you remember what I've said.

231
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:41,318
What makes me feel even luckier

232
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,821
is that you like me too.

233
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:51,787
Li Jen-yao,

234
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,331
I am very lucky…

235
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:57,250
to have met you.

236
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,823
Hurry up!

237
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,286
Fuck, you don't want that?

238
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:46,002
Again.

239
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,341
Film her face.

240
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,677
Nice. Smile.

241
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,599
<i>Don't open the door.</i>

242
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,497
I'll go first.

243
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,249
Who is second? Hold on.

244
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,294
-You're second. Be my dick.
-Why don't you follow him?

245
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:31,006
-You're big.
-Why do you want to be the last?

246
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,091
What about Che-li?
Have you considered him?

247
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:34,009
-I…
-Come on.

248
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:34,926
Come on, be brave.

249
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,845
Take this. It will make you hard.

250
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,055
It stinks!

251
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,140
What's the matter?

252
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:58,825
Chiang Hsiao-tung!

253
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:28,521
Didn't I tell you not to open the door?

254
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:37,132
Chiang Hsiao-tung.

255
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:38,591
Chiang Hsiao-tung.

256
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:42,846
<i>Is this a dream?</i>

257
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:45,932
<i>Why can I see?</i>

258
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:58,838
How come you're awake?

259
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:06,513
I had a nightmare and woke up.

260
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:08,765
It's okay.

261
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,184
It's just a nightmare.

262
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:13,019
It's not real.

263
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,870
<i>It's just a nightmare.</i>

264
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:33,873
<i>It's not real.</i>

265
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:47,762
Insurance card.

266
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:02,777
Did you bring it?

267
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:04,445
Yes.

268
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,240
Sorry.

269
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:17,166
Doctor, why can I suddenly see?

270
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:20,003
Is there a change in my condition?

271
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:24,632
Will I suddenly lose my vision again
after a while?

272
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,885
Will it get worse afterward?

273
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,805
Actually, being able to see
is normal for you.

274
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,185
How can that be normal?

275
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,980
In high school, my optic nerves started--

276
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:41,316
I've already told you this before.

277
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:44,110
We've done so many exams.

278
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:46,070
Everything is normal with your eyes.

279
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:50,033
None of the exams
showed any abnormalities.

280
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:52,827
Have you considered

281
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,121
that your inability to see

282
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:57,040
wasn't caused by your eyes?

283
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,627
I suggest you go to
the neurology department for a brain scan.

284
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,420
You may even want

285
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,924
to consider a consultation
with a psychiatrist.

288
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,130
<i>Aren't my parents called…</i>

289
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,553
<i>Why can't I remember their names?</i>

290
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,306
<i>What are their names?</i>

291
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:58,184
<i>Why can't I remember?</i>

292
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,982
<i>Why did I think they were dead?</i>

293
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:05,733
<i>They…</i>

294
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:08,444
<i>Are they really dead?</i>

295
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:15,076
<i>In other news,</i>

296
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:19,747
<i>on the morning of the 12th, a body</i>
<i>was found floating near a fishing port.</i>

297
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,749
<i>The police, firefighters, and coast guard</i>

298
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,293
<i>responded to the report</i>
<i>and recovered the body.</i>

299
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:28,131
<i>The condition of the body suggests</i>
<i>that the man suffered severe head trauma.</i>

300
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:30,717
<i>There was no identification,</i>

301
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,095
<i>and the body was unrecognizable,</i>
<i>having been in water for days.</i>

302
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,930
<i>Dental impressions and DNA analysis</i>

303
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,224
<i>revealed the deceased man's</i>
<i>surname as Fan.</i>

304
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:39,726
<i>He was allegedly linked to gangs.</i>

305
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:42,061
<i>The police are now investigating</i>

306
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:45,898
<i>whether the case was motivated</i>
<i>by a romantic dispute or a gang feud.</i>

307
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:00,204
<i>That day,</i>

308
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,124
<i>those boys weren't the only ones there.</i>

309
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,710
<i>Chang En-ya was there too.</i>

310
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:09,464
And it seemed like
she already knew what would happen.

311
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:12,258
When those boys threw
Hsiao-tung onto the table,

312
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:14,093
she immediately dragged me away.

313
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:17,764
I had no idea that
this would happen beforehand.

314
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:21,434
I wanted to call the police,
but Chang En-ya threatened me.

315
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:24,937
She said that if I told anyone,
they would do the same thing to me.

316
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:29,484
She even warned me
not to testify against them.

317
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,611
So you just left Hsiao-tung there?

318
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:34,030
I was just a high schooler.

319
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,032
I was innocent.

320
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:38,201
I didn't do anything wrong. It was them.

321
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:41,788
Are you sure you really were innocent?

322
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:46,918
Later on, when the school
asked you what had happened,

323
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:48,711
you know very well

324
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,214
what you told them.

325
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,597
Not only did you do nothing
to save Hsiao-tung,

326
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,058
but you also kicked her when she was down.

327
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,436
-How dare you say you were innocent!
-It wasn't like that.

328
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:09,273
I won't let this go.

329
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:11,526
You will all pay

330
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,112
for what you did to Hsiao-tung.

-Yeah.
-So I have the place to myself?

357

Of course. Pick a seat.

358

Then I'll take the one closest to you.

I owe you and Yu an apology.

You introduced Yu to me,

I'm fine.

366
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,582
Ta-wei is fun.

367
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:56,417
How?

368
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:00,212
He's a damn stubborn mama's boy.

369
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:04,050
Whenever I ask him
to decline unprofitable jobs,

370
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:05,676
he just ignores me.

371
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:09,430
Does he even know how tiring it is
to sustain the company all by myself?

372
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,807
He has never thought about you

373
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,017
or me.

374
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,144
He only thinks about himself.

375
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:16,228
Hey.

376
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:18,689
I want a drink too.

377
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:20,858
Make it sweet.

378
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,069
Isn't it better not to drink?

379
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:29,617
Just give me a tiny bit.

380
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:31,660
It's all your fault.

381
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,039
Good thing you're not married.

382
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:56,977
Remember.

383
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:00,564
For our good friend's sake…

384
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,860
you have to keep this secret.

385
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:11,385
What happened?

386
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:19,810
What is this?

387
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,687
What happened?

388
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:32,114
I went to see Shen Mu yesterday.

389
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:33,866
Then what?

390
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:36,869
I'll just ask her.

391
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:40,372
The 17th?

392
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:42,666
Yesterday was only the 5th.
How is it the 17th?

393
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,585
Is this broken?

394
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:46,170
APRIL 17TH, MONDAY

395
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:48,589
It really is the 17th? What's going on?

396
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:49,757
TA-WEI

397
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,383
<i>-Chou Pin-yu!</i>
-Hi, Ta-wei.

398
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:54,136
<i>Don't fucking tell me</i>
<i>that you're still sleeping.</i>

399
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:57,598
No, I'm already on my way.

400
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:58,807
<i>You're still on the way?</i>

401
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:00,184
<i>What? Still on the way?</i>

402
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:02,686
Ta-wei, I'm sorry.

403
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:05,898
Could you first tell me
what we're doing today?

404
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,943
<i>Didn't I tell you yesterday</i>
<i>we're meeting an investor?</i>

405
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:10,903
<i>You even set the time and place yourself.</i>

406
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:12,780
<i>What's going on with you, Chou Pin-yu?</i>

407
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:19,453
I told you. We should've taken the stairs…

408
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:23,374
<i>Sis, I don't remember anything</i>
<i>after I visited you that day.</i>

409
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:26,085
<i>Suddenly, a few days have passed.</i>
<i>What exactly happened?</i>

410
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:28,212
<i>Did you take me home that day?</i>

411
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,673
<i>Did I say anything to you afterward?</i>

412
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:35,261
<i>Can I come over after work?</i>
<i>I need to talk to you about something.</i>

413
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:37,096
Chou Pin-yu.

414
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:40,349
How many times have I told you?
Don't text and chat at work.

415
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:41,600
Sorry.

416
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,519
Which number is it?

417
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:06,917
Tien-ching?

418
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,935
What a coincidence.

419
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:26,061
Why are you here?

420
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,688
It's been so long.

421
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:28,981
How have you been?

422
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:30,941
Are you here to see a doctor?

423
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,495
We're here for work.

424
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,165
I'm her boss. Hello.

425
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:47,333
Hello.

426
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:51,128
You haven't forgotten me, have you?

427
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:53,047
I'm Joy.

428
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,383
Hey, Yu.

429
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:58,135
What's that look for?

430
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:00,304
What's wrong?

431
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:03,432
You know, you did me
a huge favor back then.

432
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:05,184
I've always wanted to thank you.

433
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:09,146
-I've been meaning to.
-Yu?

434
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:10,397
-Back at the radio…
-Yu?

435
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:12,441
Lucky you were there for me.

436
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:14,777
So everything went well
for me and my wife.

437
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:16,612
Tien-ching?

438
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:19,406
-Yu?
-Are you okay?

439
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:20,616
Yu?

440
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:21,825
Hey, you're scaring me.

441
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,119
Yu.

442
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,080
Chou Pin-yu.

443
