1
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:09,134
What do you see now?

2
00:00:09,926 --> 00:00:10,969
Nothing.

3
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:15,015
How about this?

4
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:16,766
Can you see this way?

5
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:20,729
It's still the same as before.

6
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:22,355
I can't see anything.

7
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,027
Ms. Chou.

8
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:10,945
It's me, Tien-ching.

9
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:14,032
Yes, I just left the hospital.

10
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,659
Don't worry.

11
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:19,287
I've already called a cab.

12
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,539
I can go to work on my own later.

13
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:24,876
I have to go. Someone's calling me.

14
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,377
I'll call you back later.

15
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,632
<i>Accept and answer. Press.</i>

16
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,261
-Hello?
<i>-Miss, may I ask where you are?</i>

17
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,805
I'm at the pickup location.

18
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:37,931
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

19
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,767
<i>Well, I'm already at the intersection.</i>

20
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,852
But I can't see well.

21
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,687
Could you come get me?

22
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,356
<i>Okay, sure.</i>

23
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:47,816
Thank you.

24
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,195
<i>End. Press.</i>

25
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:55,448
Miss, I'm sorry.
I didn't know you couldn't see. Sorry.

26
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,158
-It's okay.
-Let me guide you.

27
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,799
Where did the driver take me?

28
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,885
I was very clear with him.

29
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:52,797
Chiang Hsiao-tung.

30
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:17,155
I'm sorry.

31
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,657
I thought you were someone else.

32
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:05,972
HAD I NOT SEEN THE SUN

33
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,202
Are you

34
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,787
Chiang Hsiao-tung?

35
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,469
May I ask if you're Chiang Hsiao-tung?

36
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,558
I mistook you for someone else.

37
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,454
I'm sorry.

38
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,331
I know I shouldn't have shown up.

39
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:20,880
I'm sorry.

40
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,633
I didn't mean to disturb you guys.

41
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,052
Wait!

42
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,262
Stop hitting me.

43
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,974
Earlier, I mistook her for someone else.

44
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,018
I thought she was Chiang Hsiao-tung.

45
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,228
Stop hitting me.

46
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,108
Why are you looking for her?

47
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,320
I want to apologize.

48
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:49,367
I want to know if she's doing well now.

49
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:53,287
If she's not,
I'm willing to make it up to her.

50
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,373
I hope she can forgive me.

51
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,218
Let me tell you two things.

52
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,139
First, don't show your face
around me again.

53
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,098
Second,

54
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,476
stop looking for Chiang Hsiao-tung.

55
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:17,895
Otherwise,

56
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,273
I'll definitely kill you.

57
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,840
Sorry for the wait.

58
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:48,634
No worries.

59
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:51,846
Did you find your phone?

60
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,100
Yes, I found it.

61
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,288
Be careful, there's a step ahead.

62
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,217
Wait.

63
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,388
This is Debussy's "Clair de lune."

64
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:38,226
I love this piece.
Have you heard it before?

65
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:54,951
Perfect timing.

66
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:15,721
What's wrong?

67
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:19,976
Why are you

68
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:21,936
so quiet?

69
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,864
Do you like to dance?

70
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,329
I don't know.

71
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:42,748
But I have poor balance.

72
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,542
I'm no good at sports.

73
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,044
Forget about dancing.

74
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,505
I can't even ride a bike.

75
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:51,716
Even if

76
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,635
I could see well now,

77
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,096
I don't think I'd like dancing.

78
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,308
Did you ask me that

79
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,935
because you like dancing?

80
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:11,652
No.

81
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:18,909
Let's go.

82
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,286
It's about to rain.

83
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:22,663
Okay.

84
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:42,850
Be careful.

85
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:57,865
I'm sorry.

86
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:00,076
You're soaked because of me.

87
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:03,829
It's okay.

88
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:05,498
Don't worry about it.

89
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,208
Well,

90
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,210
you can wipe yourself down.

91
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,191
Do you like rainy days?

92
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:28,766
No.

93
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,438
Me neither.

94
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:39,360
Rain changes the smell of the air.

95
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:43,072
People and the environment
smell different.

96
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:47,409
I rely on my sense of smell a lot.
That's why I don't like rain.

97
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,329
But…

98
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,084
I don't seem to dislike…

99
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,755
the smell of rain today.

100
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,875
We're here.

101
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,093
I had fun today.

102
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,428
Thank you.

103
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,768
I'll go home, then.

104
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,414
Wait, Li Jen-yao.

105
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,047
Are you still there?

106
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,931
I'm all sweaty from earlier.

107
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:15,808
Don't get too close.

108
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,184
It's uncomfortable.

109
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,654
I've wired this month's rent
to the landlord.

110
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,030
When are you gonna pay me?

111
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,116
And 1,200 NTD for water and electricity.

112
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:35,244
With the next rent.

113
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:39,790
That's what you said last month.
When are you gonna look for a job?

114
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,669
Enough. You're such a nag.

115
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,258
What are you watching?

116
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,427
Lisa Mimi.

117
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,220
She's been a popular YouTuber lately.

118
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:54,388
Gosh.

119
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,098
She's so busty.

120
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:58,851
That's all padding.

121
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,770
She'd be lucky
to have had a B cup in high school.

122
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,480
How do you know they're padded?

123
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:07,651
Don't be fooled by her pure looks
in front of the camera now.

124
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,236
It's all an act.

125
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,989
In high school,
she was basically a delinquent.

126
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:14,116
She was always around hooligans

127
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,118
and picked on whoever she disliked.

128
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,205
-Hey!
-What?

129
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,457
I'm serious.

130
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:25,753
She thought a girl in our class
stole her solo part and got jealous,

131
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,379
so she got a bunch of guys to rape her.

132
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:28,797
Did you see it?

133
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,136
<i>Save me!</i>

134
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:35,554
Shut up!

135
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:38,265
-Bitch. You'd better behave.
-Save me!

136
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:39,933
Save me!

137
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:42,644
Wen-ling!

138
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,863
Of course I didn't see it myself.

139
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,783
I wasn't close to those people back then.

140
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:57,534
I just heard about it.

141
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,584
Anyway, she's not who you think she is.

142
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:07,795
She's disgusting.

143
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,564
Thanks for listening.

144
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,525
Have a good night.

145
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,902
I'm Hsia Tien-ching. Good night.

146
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,910
RISING RADIO

147
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:43,956
-Tien-ching.
-Yes?

148
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,457
You're in great shape today.

149
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,292
You recorded three episodes in one go.

150
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,503
Really? I feel the same as always.

151
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,755
No, you're great today.

152
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:52,923
Also,

153
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:54,550
you've been glowing lately.

154
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,136
Are you dating?

155
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,846
You had me help you put on makeup.

156
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,639
No, don't talk nonsense.

157
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,391
Yes, you are.

158
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,977
What does he look like?
Show me a picture of him.

159
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:08,480
I don't believe
someone can be nice and handsome.

160
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,773
He must be ugly, right?

161
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,067
Or he's a con artist.

162
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,320
The next time he sees you, he'll say,
"Tien-ching, have you heard of--"

163
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,530
Gosh, I'm leaving.

164
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,532
Hey, all right.

165
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:21,326
I'm just worried about you.
You've never acted this way.

166
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:26,039
You're so proud and guarded,
and you don't like bothering others.

167
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:29,459
What's so special about him
that you're acting like this?

168
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,091
Even though it only lasted a moment,

169
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:38,927
I saw him.

170
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:50,772
What?

171
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,275
What did you see?

172
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,737
What do you mean? Hey!

173
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,472
Damn, how long has it been ringing?
Why don't you answer?

174
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,813
I found what you wanted.

175
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:42,783
I learned about the girl, Hsia Tien-ching,
from Chi-ming School.

176
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,456
Because of a genetic disease,

177
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:52,000
she can't see well
and does radio shows now.

178
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:02,928
Hey, I really don't understand
why you keep going to this girl.

179
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:05,180
They don't look alike at all.

180
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,100
Hey, their hair, eyes, auras, and figures

181
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,018
are completely different.

182
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,313
Anyway, I think
what you're doing is terrible.

183
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,816
If she knows
she's just a replacement to you,

184
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,317
shit, she'll be miserable.

185
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,152
Hey, she's a nice girl.

186
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,779
She'll be sad for sure.

187
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,616
I don't see her as a replacement.

188
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,703
And she won't know anything.

189
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,248
I won't be seeing her again.

190
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:36,920
What's up with you lately?

191
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:38,797
Talk to me.

192
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,173
Hey, listen.

193
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,967
I've dated enough girls

194
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,052
to form a parade around Taiwan.

195
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:47,431
I've seen a lot of relationships.

196
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:50,100
Want me to enlighten a virgin like you?

197
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:51,143
Yeah?

198
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:54,688
No need.

199
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,940
Just help me find Chiang Hsiao-tung.

200
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,320
Don't forget

201
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:04,197
that I'm working for you

202
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,783
because you said you'd help me find her.

203
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,703
I have been looking for her.

204
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:11,747
However,

205
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:15,751
speaking from my experience
as a debt collector,

206
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:18,003
not finding her after this long…

207
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,548
you need to be prepared.

208
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,175
She's either abroad…

209
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:26,553
or dead.

210
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,308
I'm just asking.

211
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,479
If Chiang Hsiao-tung…

212
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,648
is really

213
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:40,984
dead,

214
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,070
what will you do?

215
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,084
Then I'll kill them all.

216
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,753
No one will get away.

217
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,519
<i>Your message.</i>

218
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:17,479
<i>Li Jen-yao, are you busy?</i>

219
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,356
<i>14:45.</i>

220
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,149
<i>Your message.</i>

221
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,859
<i>Li Jen-yao, are you busy?</i>

222
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,986
<i>14:45.</i>

223
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:39,251
<i>Answer call. Press.</i>

224
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,590
<i>Miss, I've arrived. Where are you?</i>

225
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:48,093
Oh, the car's here. Okay.

226
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:49,928
I'm sorry. I'll be right down.

227
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:16,872
Wait!

228
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,124
-Thank you.
-No worries.

229
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,751
Can you press eight for me, please?
Thank you.

230
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,611
-For the name list…
-Confirm this for me later.

231
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:49,404
-Sure. I'll call you.
-Thank you.

232
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,573
-Hey, Wang.
-Yes?

233
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,783
This is content for the next episode.
Take a look.

234
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,744
-Content for the show?
-Yes.

235
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:57,496
Gosh, that's not important.

236
00:24:58,121 --> 00:25:00,207
What I'm curious about right now is

237
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:03,126
why you haven't contacted that guy lately.

238
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,128
What happened?

239
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:08,215
Nothing. It's just how it is.

240
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:11,009
We haven't seen each other
since that meal.

241
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:13,553
He hasn't answered or called me back.

242
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:17,098
I guess that's it, then.

243
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,059
Isn't that such a shame?

244
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:22,687
It's rare for you
to like someone the way you like him.

245
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:27,526
Actually, come to think of it,
I don't know him at all.

246
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,946
I only know his name and phone number.

247
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:34,783
I don't know
where he lives or what he does.

248
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:38,870
If he stops contacting me,
I don't think I'll know how to find him.

249
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:43,875
Forget it.
Maybe he never saw me as a friend.

250
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,669
That's why he ghosted me.

251
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:48,713
-It's fine.
-What do you mean "it's fine"?

252
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,925
It's not fine.
I'll help you find a better guy right now.

253
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:53,051
What's your type?

254
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:56,680
Why are you playing matchmaker for me?
I'm doing fine.

255
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:59,266
No way.
What are your requirements? Tell me.

256
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:01,935
This way, please.

257
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:04,312
Is this your office area?

258
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,522
It's much larger than I…

259
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:08,108
-Sounds good.
-Let me show you.

260
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:09,401
-I'll revise it.
-Thanks.

261
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:10,986
Here's engineering.

262
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,737
This is the recording studio.

263
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,221
Hi, are you Mrs. Chiang?

264
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:39,556
Who are you?

265
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:42,017
I'm Hsiao-tung's classmate.
I'm looking for her.

266
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,603
She hasn't been in touch with us
for a long time.

267
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:47,230
Could you tell me how I can reach her now?

268
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:48,940
She's abroad.

269
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,525
And she's not coming back.

270
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:54,404
If she doesn't keep in touch with you,
that means she doesn't want to.

271
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:56,323
Don't bother us again.

272
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,046
What's up with you?

273
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:14,049
You're so quiet. It's so unlike you.

274
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:18,470
When I went to a client
for a project discussion yesterday,

275
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,472
I met a blind person in the elevator.

276
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:21,681
The tattoo on her hand

277
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:24,100
looks exactly the same
as my high school classmate's.

278
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,186
So I thought of her.

279
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:27,771
Who? Which classmate?

280
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,899
The girl I told you about before.

281
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:33,068
The one who was gang raped.

282
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:36,071
I see. I think you've told me.

283
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,781
How's that girl now?

284
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:40,492
Shortly after that incident,

285
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:42,577
she transferred to a school in Taipei.

286
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,537
Then a little while later,

287
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:46,414
I heard she had committed suicide.

288
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:47,832
Was it that serious?

289
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,295
What about those who raped her?

290
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:53,505
What happened to them?

291
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,298
Speaking of it…

292
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:56,841
speaking of it makes me furious.

293
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:57,967
You know what?

294
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:00,637
One of those bastards
is the son of a councillor.

295
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,639
So this was entirely swept under the rug.

296
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:05,100
Nothing happened to those bastards.

297
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,768
Later on, at a class reunion,

298
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,812
I even heard they're all doing great.

299
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,690
All right.

300
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:14,567
Listen, I'm going out later.

301
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,612
For mah-jongg with my friends.

302
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:18,697
Hey.

303
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,032
Didn't you agree
to spend time with me today?

304
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,826
Why are you going to play mah-jongg?

305
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,789
If you feel bored,

306
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:30,709
come join us.

307
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:33,878
Didn't you say you're good at it?

308
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:38,800
Just… think of it
as growing our dating fund.

309
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,260
Come on.

310
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:42,679
That doesn't sound like a bad idea.

311
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,516
Give me tiles if you go before me.

312
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:49,060
I'll help you for sure.
Just tell me what you need.

313
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:52,439
Okay.

314
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:59,154
-Seven Characters.
-Hey, Chow.

315
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:00,780
Gap tile.

316
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:02,866
Three Bamboo.

317
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:04,284
Pung. One Character.

318
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,578
Come on.

319
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:07,495
Pung.

320
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,415
-West Wind.
-Hey, I win.

321
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:11,791
I was waiting for it.

322
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,710
That's ridiculous.

323
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:16,129
Who waits for that now?
You're so shameless.

324
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:17,714
What? I knew you'd discard it.

325
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:19,883
North Winds, Green Dragons, White Dragons,

326
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,342
Triplets Hand, and Half Flush,

327
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:24,429
plus the banker, 12 points in total.
Thank you, ma'am.

328
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,850
Okay, I'm going to stop.
I'm so unlucky today.

329
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:32,061
It's okay. You can recoup your losses.

330
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:35,607
I have work tomorrow. Let's settle up.

331
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:37,984
Here is…

332
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,320
-5,000 NTD.
-Hey!

333
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,947
What's this pocket change supposed to be?

334
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,868
I'm paying up.
Aren't we betting 100 and 20?

335
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,995
It can't be more than 5,000 NTD in total.

336
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:51,956
Fuck. 100 and 20 NTD?
You think we're college students?

337
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,374
We start at 10,000 NTD.

338
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:57,462
-10,000?
-You've lost at least 600,000 today.

339
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:01,216
Since you're Chuan's new friend,
I'll give you a discount.

340
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:03,092
600,000 NTD will do.

341
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,804
Hey, give me a promissory note.

342
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,598
Wait a sec.

343
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,058
Are you serious?

344
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,142
Of course!

345
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,853
Chuan, what's with your girlfriend?

346
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,480
She doesn't want to pay up?

347
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:17,941
Hey, Nan. Don't say that.

348
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,609
How can she be my girlfriend?

349
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:22,529
She has to own what she did.

350
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:23,988
I'm not involved with her.

351
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,281
What are you talking about?

352
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,367
Don't look at me that way.

353
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:30,745
Don't say I didn't warn you.
This spot's really run by a crew.

354
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,289
It's different from
the other sessions you go to.

355
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,625
If you play dumb and don't pay up,

356
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:37,961
it will be no joke.

357
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,930
Mr. Chen, here's the latest update.

358
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,974
We found Chiang Hsiao-tung's mom.

359
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:52,267
But according to her,

360
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,269
Chiang Hsiao-tung is abroad.

361
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:56,437
-She's abroad?
-Yes.

362
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:59,274
That's the last lead we have for now.

363
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,109
If you want to further investigate

364
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,819
Chiang Hsiao-tung's whereabouts,

365
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:05,446
the only options left are illicit means.

366
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,865
Mr. Chen,

367
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,825
are you sure you want to continue?

368
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,127
When I was eating
with my colleague Wang today,

369
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,296
I'm not sure if it was due to a hangover

370
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:24,048
or the Monday blues,

371
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,551
but she asked me
a very philosophical question.

372
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:28,469
She asked,

373
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:29,971
"Hey, Hsia Tien-ching,

374
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:34,517
how can I get
yesterday's happiness back today?"

375
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:38,771
When I heard that, I really couldn't help
but roll my eyes at her.

376
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:41,566
Yes, you heard me right. I rolled my eyes.

377
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:45,361
Your ability to see and roll your eyes
are two separate matters.

378
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:47,030
The point is,

379
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:49,449
after I rolled my eyes at her,

380
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:52,952
I decided
to answer her question properly anyway.

381
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,955
To be honest, we all know that

382
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,833
there aren't many things in life

383
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,293
that truly make us happy.

384
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:03,171
We also tend to look on the bright side

385
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:07,300
to guard that rarely found happiness,

386
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:08,718
so as to keep it in mind.

387
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:14,307
<i>Recently, I encountered something</i>
<i>that made me realize</i>

388
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:17,310
<i>that a lot of the time, we feel unhappy,</i>

389
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:20,980
<i>maybe because we're too eager to hold onto</i>

390
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:24,359
<i>those happy moments</i>
<i>we're so obsessed with.</i>

391
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:28,488
<i>If we want to feel that happiness again,</i>

392
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,990
<i>the only thing we can do</i>

393
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,660
<i>is perhaps let go.</i>

394
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:37,372
<i>Let the happiness we couldn't keep</i>

395
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,332
<i>remain in the past.</i>

396
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,002
<i>All right, just a few more hours,</i>

397
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:45,088
<i>and this Monday will be over.</i>

398
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,714
<i>We can do this.</i>

399
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:50,843
<i>Let's forget the happy moments in the past</i>
<i>that we're obsessed with</i>

400
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:54,263
<i>and listen to some music that suits today.</i>

412

You didn't answer my call
or reply to my message.

413
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:27,899
What are you doing here now?

414
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,369
Li Jen-yao, don't stay silent.

415
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,121
Answer me.

416
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:44,207
You stopped contacting me,

417
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,375
so why did you come to my office?

418
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:15,404
Ms. Hsia.

419
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,365
Hey, Mr. Chiang.

420
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:20,076
I've been waiting for you.

421
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:23,079
I saw you talking to your friend here.

422
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:27,375
I don't mean to rush you,
but I have clients after this.

423
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:28,793
I see.

424
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:31,420
Sorry to keep you waiting.

425
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,048
I'm good to go now.

426
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,217
-I'll take you, then.
-Okay.

427
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:37,635
Here.

428
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:41,973
-Let's go.
-Okay.

429
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:10,626
Ms. Hsia.

430
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:14,338
Who was that guy earlier?

431
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,592
A new boyfriend?

432
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,595
You've been getting rides
from me for years,

433
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:21,888
but I've never seen

434
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:24,891
or heard you mention any guys.

435
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,518
Mr. Chiang, you're overthinking.

436
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,729
He's just an ordinary friend.

437
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,732
Have you been feeling better?

438
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:36,319
Didn't you just get out of the hospital?

439
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:39,947
Why are you driving so soon?
Shouldn't you rest some more?

440
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,868
I have no choice.

441
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:46,412
I don't have any income if I don't drive.

442
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,207
But don't worry.

443
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,250
I'm only driving you

444
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,044
and some other regulars.

445
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:56,797
Just a few hours a day. It's fine.

446
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:05,431
Ms. Hsia, you're home?

447
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:06,933
Ms. Chou, you're still here?

448
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:08,976
I'm just about to leave.

449
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:09,894
I see.

450
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:14,899
I brought some cherry tomatoes.
They're washed and in the fridge.

451
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,817
Our relatives grew them.

452
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:20,488
They're organic and super sweet.
You have to try them.

453
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,531
You always come with food.

454
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:23,574
I feel bad.

455
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:24,867
It's fine.

456
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:26,786
I'll get going if that's all.

457
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,913
-Oh, Ms. Chou, wait.
-Yes?

458
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,296
Here.

459
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:41,259
Here's your pay
for the last two weeks of cleaning.

460
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:42,843
Thank you.

461
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:46,264
I'll be counting on you again next month.

462
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:53,271
Hey.

463
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:54,647

464
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,499
Hang on.

465
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:57,501
Let me get something.

466
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:00,755
What is it?

467
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:03,132
Our clothes are still on,
and you're getting a condom?

468
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:08,137
Only a fool would get
such a buzzkill right now.

469
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:29,528
Fuck you.

470
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:31,071
That damn idiot, Fan Wei-ting.

471
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:34,909
How many times have I said it?
Don't look at the camera!

472
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,994
He keeps looking at it.

473
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,584
Give this to Ming

474
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,462
to blur Fan Wei-ting's face.

475
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:48,297
If there's no problem,

476
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,383
upload it, and let's make money, okay?

477
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:53,219
Okay, no problem. I'll handle it.

478
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:56,514
-Hi, Hsiang.
-Hey.

479
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:57,890
Ouyang, here.

480
00:41:57,973 --> 00:41:59,391
Thanks.

481
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:00,809
Come on.

482
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:02,061
Where'd you get this?

483
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:03,812
She couldn't pay her debt.

484
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,856
Mr. Chien asked if we'd take it for 50.

485
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:07,858
Fifty?

486
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:09,276
Expensive.

487
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:13,739
<i>What are you looking at?</i>

488
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:14,698
<i>Strip.</i>

489
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:17,409
<i>Hurry. Do you want me to do it for you?</i>

490
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,453
<i>Take them off, hurry.</i>

491
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:25,584
<i>Show your ID.</i>

492
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,878
<i>Higher, do you hear me?</i>

493
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:29,672
Fuck.

494
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:32,216
-Haven't I seen this girl before?
-Yeah.

495
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:37,137
-Our high school classmate?
-Right.

496
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,139
-From the dance class.
-Right!

497
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,934
Nothing beats familiarity.

498
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:43,394
-Right?
-Yeah.

499
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:47,147
Hey.

500
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:50,276
If we take this one,

501
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:52,528
how much do you think
we can squeeze from her?

502
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:55,197
She was our classmate. Why talk money?

503
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:56,699
That would be so hurtful.

504
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:07,251
You're so naughty!

505
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:10,045
Fuck.

506
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:19,930
RED ANT TRANSPORTATION COMPANY

507
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:36,238
RED ANT FLEET

508
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:40,242
Excuse me.

509
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:42,494
I took one of your cabs yesterday.

510
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:44,538
I think I left my phone in the car.

511
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:47,124
Could you help me contact the driver?

512
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:50,628
Sure. Do you know
the plate number or the driver's name?

513
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,548
Here's the plate number. Take a look.

514
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:58,594
Do you remember
around what time you took the cab?

515
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:02,264
Around 10:00 p.m. or so.

516
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:03,432
10:00 p.m.

517
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:08,562
This is indeed the plate number
for one of our cabs driven by Mr. Chiang.

518
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,899
But is there any chance
you got the wrong plate number?

519
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:16,278
Mr. Chiang usually picks his daughter up
from work around this time.

520
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:18,405
I doubt he would've accepted customers.
