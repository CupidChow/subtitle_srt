1
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:09,022
HAD I NOT SEEN THE SUN

2
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:15,028
ROAD WORK, DETOUR

3
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:34,464
Take it.

4
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:40,929
Motherfucker.

5
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,765
Don't you know how to say thank you?

6
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,351
Damn kid.

7
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,144
You don't know how to be grateful.

8
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,730
Have you ever seen a boss like me?

9
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,398
I bought you breakfast

10
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,401
and picked you up for work.

11
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,448
Fine. Whatever.

12
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,536
Didn't you say the roadwork here
would end last week?

13
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,372
Why is it still happening?

14
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,958
How long will you be working here?

15
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:15,546
Hey, do you have the energy
to work for me after a whole night shift?

16
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:19,968
Here you go again.

17
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:23,054
You really just ignore me when I talk.

18
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,268
How sad.

19
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:33,189
MIGHTY GOOD CLEANING SERVICES

20
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:47,745
MIGHTY GOOD CLEANING SERVICES

21
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:57,130
Hey, Mr. Chang.
It's Mighty Good Cleaning Services.

22
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,965
Our cleaning is mighty good.

23
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,341
You're at the door?

24
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,801
Okay, we'll be right there.

25
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:04,012
Just a moment, please. Thank you.

26
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,061
Hey, this isn't enough. Grab some more.

27
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,440
THIS WAY

28
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,265
Hey, I'll do it.

29
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,600
Work on that over there.

30
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:54,455
I just heard from the building manager
that the previous tenant here

31
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,040
was a professor at NTU.

32
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,752
I heard that he was very frugal.

33
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,296
He had tens of millions in savings.

34
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:06,467
But what's the point
of saving all that money?

35
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,010
Look.

36
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,805
He lived here all alone.

37
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:13,599
No wife, no kids, and no one to rely on.

38
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,436
Nobody knew he was dead
for nearly a month.

39
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,276
Here's some real talk.

40
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,653
Change your personality a bit.

41
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,073
At least respond when people talk to you.

42
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:31,492
<i>You are now listening…</i>

43
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:35,621
Or you'll end up with no friends.
Maybe no one'll even know your name.

44
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,081
<i>Rumor has it</i>

45
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,625
<i>that Mahler didn't finish this symphony</i>

46
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:43,129
<i>because of a mysterious death curse.</i>

47
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:51,971
Li Jen-yao,
you should be called Loner-yao.

48
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:55,558
<i>Fans of classical music spread the rumor</i>

49
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,059
<i>that the ninth symphony</i>

50
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,687
<i>is a death curse</i>

51
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,607
<i>because many famous composers</i>

52
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:07,904
<i>happened to die soon after</i>
<i>finishing their ninth symphonies.</i>

53
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,398
<i>Thank you for tuning in today.</i>

54
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,150
<i>I am Hsia Tien-ching.</i>

55
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,985
<i>See you next week at the same time.</i>

56
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,081
2-2-7-0-0.

57
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,298
Are you focusing on your homework?

58
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,383
Yes.

59
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,468
-Then let me quiz you.
-Okay.

60
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,637
What is five times seven?

61
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:19,559
Thirty-five.

62
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:22,728
Good job.

63
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,942
Daddy is back!

64
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,402
Hey, what did I say?

65
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,237
Wait until the car stops.

66
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,738
-Okay.
-Hey!

67
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:33,948
Kidney Bean!

68
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:36,617
-I've missed you!
-Daddy!

69
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,204
I've missed you so much.

70
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:43,082
-Why are you back so late today?
-The last job was tough.

71
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,792
It took a long time to clean.

72
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:48,337
Loner-yao, do that tomorrow. Let's eat.

73
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:50,339
You guys go ahead.

74
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,632
I'm going home to rest.

75
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,886
He's hard to get along with.

76
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:44,018
PAY ENVELOPE

77
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,881
<i>Do you remember the last time</i>

78
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,424
<i>you made a wish?</i>

79
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,553
<i>Did your wish come true?</i>

80
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:21,972
<i>Before I got sick…</i>

81
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:22,890
RISING RADIO

82
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:23,933
<i>…I was always impatient</i>

83
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:25,935
<i>and eager to go.</i>

84
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:29,355
<i>I couldn't even wait</i>
<i>for my wishes to come true.</i>

85
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,149
<i>Rather than make wishes, I preferred</i>

86
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,070
to set a lot of goals for myself.

87
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,572
I prepared a notebook for myself.

88
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,743
If there was anything I wanted to do,
I'd write it down.

89
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,497
I remember in those days,

90
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,624
the first thing I did when I woke up

91
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,335
was open this notebook

92
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,296
and see what was left to do.

93
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,968
<i>If I wrote down something I wanted to buy,</i>

94
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:02,638
<i>I'd start thinking of ways</i>
<i>to work and save up for it.</i>

95
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,266
<i>If I wrote down something I wanted to do,</i>

96
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,351
<i>I'd make a plan right away</i>

97
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:10,104
<i>and see how I could achieve it</i>
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

98
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:14,817
That was until the summer
of my second year in high school.

99
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:16,902
I got sick.

100
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,198
My vision suddenly declined.

101
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:23,993
In less than a few months,

102
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,413
the words I'd written in that notebook

103
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,206
were no longer visible to me.

104
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:35,838
<i>Those goals that I was so eager to achieve</i>

105
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,215
<i>all became</i>

106
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:43,012
<i>wishes that might come true</i>
<i>someday in the future.</i>

107
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:47,725
I remember the last wish
I wrote down in the notebook.

108
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,686
It was also the first wish I fulfilled

109
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,772
after losing my sight.

110
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,441
It was to become a radio DJ.

111
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,195
Coming up next

112
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,113
is the first piece I played

113
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,073
after becoming a radio DJ,

114
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:07,244
a piano trio of Johann Pachelbel's Canon.

115
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,440
Excuse me.

116
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:03,652
Could you check
the expiration date on this for me?

117
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,614
This expires on the 29th.

118
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,657
Thank you.

119
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,422
Hey, watch out.

120
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,309
Are you…

121
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:25,526
the man who took me to the radio station

122
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:28,529
when I was lost last time?

123
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,990
I was just passing by

124
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,659
and saw you almost bump into something.

125
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:35,828
So I warned you.

126
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,164
Thank you.

127
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,917
-How come you--
-Previously…

128
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,628
-Sorry, you were--
-Sorry, you first.

129
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,431
It's okay.

130
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:57,891
Go ahead.

131
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,104
I was going to ask

132
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:03,689
if you had…

133
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,959
Do you want to have dinner together?

134
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,099
Do you eat here often?

135
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:40,517
Yes.

136
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,313
This is the best place I know of nearby.

137
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:47,024
They're better known for their pork ribs,

138
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,485
but I prefer
their chicken drumsticks with rice.

139
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,248
Can I ask you a question?

140
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,586
Do we know each other?

141
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,924
I know it's a bit strange to ask this.

142
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,134
But for some reason,

143
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,720
from the first time we met,

144
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:17,971
your voice

145
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,641
sounded familiar to me.

146
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:24,478
It was as if we'd known each other
for a long time.

147
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,487
I don't think

148
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,197
we know each other.

149
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:38,742
That figures.

150
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:40,911
I thought so.

151
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,504
Can I ask you a question?

152
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:53,465
Sure.

153
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,217
About

154
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,803
the tattoo on your hand.

155
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:03,851
A friend of mine has a butterfly tattoo
just like yours in the same spot.

156
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,019
So every time I see it,

157
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:07,938
I want to ask

158
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,566
why you chose that design.

159
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,653
Honestly,

160
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:17,990
I don't know why I have this tattoo.

161
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,367
In fact, it's not just you.

162
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,452
Many people have asked me this.

163
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:24,454
I never know how to answer

164
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:28,458
because I don't remember
ever getting a tattoo.

165
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,420
I have no idea
what this tattoo looks like.

166
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,136
Do you not believe me?

167
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:43,473
No.

168
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:46,018
I believe you. It's just…

169
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:49,146
I was kidding.

170
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:57,696
I got this tattoo with a friend.

171
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,198
There's no special meaning.

172
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,252
So

173
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,422
will we see each other again?

174
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:28,227
Taxi's here.

175
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:33,899
Be careful.

176
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,532
I've written down
the taxi's license plate number.

177
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,160
Let me know when you're home.

178
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,162
Wait.

179
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,081
I don't have your number.

180
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,541
Can I have it?
I'll call you when I'm home.

181
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:58,840
<i>Contacts.</i>

182
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,926
<i>Add. Press.</i>

183
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,428
<i>Add phone number.</i>

184
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:04,346
<i>Finish.</i>

185
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,264
It's done.

186
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,268
Don't forget your things.
They're on your left.

187
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,270
I'm closing the door.

188
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,670
OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY

189
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,506
Number 38.

190
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:44,052
Look. Our little girl's legs
are pretty long, don't you think?

191
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:46,972
She's going to be a leggy girl.

192
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,684
What are we going to do?

193
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,477
Calm down.

194
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,667
Stop telling me to calm down, okay?

195
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,753
You're her mother. You have to be strong.

196
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,297
She was violated so badly.

197
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,507
How am I supposed to calm down?

198
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,718
…you're upset, but you have to be strong.

199
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:28,680
If it were possible,

200
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:31,516
I really wish
those people would go to hell.

201
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:03,108
Ms. Chou, are you here?

202
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,862
Yes, I finished cleaning
and had a bit of time.

203
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,364
I thought I would cook something for you.

204
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,082
It smells so good.
Did you make sesame oil chicken?

205
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,168
You have a keen nose.

206
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:22,502
Yeah.

207
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,671
Your sesame oil chicken is my favorite.

208
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,424
My daughter loves it too.

209
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:30,177
Whenever winter comes around,
I make her a bowl of it.

210
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,553
Let me get you some.

211
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:33,138
It's okay.

212
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:35,348
I just ate with a friend.

213
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:39,102
Why don't you put it in the fridge?
I'll heat it up later.

214
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,020
Okay.

215
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:43,565
I'm going to call my friend.

216
00:24:58,455 --> 00:24:59,998
<i>00:02.</i>

217
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:04,377
<i>Phone. Contacts.</i>

218
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:06,922
<i>Li Jen-yao.</i>

219
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:09,424
<i>Li Jen-yao.</i>

220
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:23,980
<i>Your call will be forwarded to voicemail.</i>
<i>Charges will apply after the beep.</i>

221
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:28,818
<i>Press pound after the tone</i>
<i>to leave a message, or simply hang up.</i>

222
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:32,489
<i>End. Press.</i>

223
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,622
So you really haven't heard anything
about Chiang Hsiao-tung lately?

224
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,207
<i>No, seriously.</i>

225
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,833
Why would I lie to you?

226
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:46,586
It's not like we just met.

227
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,755
If I'd really heard anything about her,

228
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:51,049
wouldn't I tell you right away?

229
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:54,803
Hey.

230
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:56,513
What's up with you?

231
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:59,182
Why suddenly ask about your girlfriend?

232
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:02,394
I…

233
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:07,232
I recently… met someone
who's a lot like her.

234
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:10,610
What?

235
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,239
Never mind. It's nothing.

236
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:15,156
Not important.

237
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,498
Okay, students, pay attention.

238
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,460
-Sir, you're awesome!
-Amazing!

239
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,546
Sir, do it again! My turn!

240
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:31,548
My turn!

241
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:35,302
Okay, I want to tell all the girls here

242
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:38,471
that self-defense is mainly
for protecting yourself,

243
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:39,723
not hurting others.

244
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:43,101
But I'd rather you take precautions
than put yourself in danger.

245
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:47,564
Do your best
to avoid situations that might be unsafe.

246
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:48,523
Also,

247
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,650
when you're around boys,

248
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,485
no matter how well you know them,

249
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:55,238
you should maintain
a basic level of awareness.

250
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:56,156
Understand?

251
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,782
Yes.

252
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,327
Good. That's all
for today's self-defense lecture.

253
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:03,455
-Dismissed.
-Thank you, sir.

254
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:04,539
He's so handsome.

255
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:05,749
So good-looking.

256
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:07,959
Hello? It's me.

257
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,462
Yes, I was in class and couldn't answer.

258
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:11,963
What's up?

259
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:18,887
Shit, you're getting married? Seriously?

260
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:21,056
LIN'S EATERY

261
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:21,973
Hey, Che-li.

262
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:25,018
Besides inviting Meng-hung
and me to your wedding,

263
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:26,144
did you invite

264
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,104
Ouyang and Yu-hsiang?

265
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:33,985
I… probably won't.

266
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,615
I've only stayed in touch
with you two after high school.

267
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:40,367
Inviting them now

268
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:43,161
would feel like I'm only doing it
for their cash gifts.

269
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:45,872
Fuck.

270
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:48,792
The last time I saw them
was at Yu-hsiang's wedding.

271
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:52,087
We hadn't talked in so long
that it felt like he just wanted my money.

272
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,216
You talk to them, right?

273
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:57,258
How are they?

274
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,719
Don't mention it.

275
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:02,263
They're still doing something shady.

276
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:05,684
Earlier, Fan Wei-ting said
he'd count me in,

277
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:08,561
that I'd make good money,
at least 100,000 a month.

278
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,940
Hey, don't you dare. You're a teacher now.

279
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,775
Don't do stuff like that with them.

280
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:18,363
Do you guys know
where Chiang Hsiao-tung ended up?

281
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,660
I heard she committed suicide.

282
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,286
Is that true?

283
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,663
Fuck, why bring that up now?

284
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,585
To be honest, I often think about her.

285
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:34,963
Sometimes, I even dream about her.

286
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:37,757
When I went with my wife
to her prenatal checkup,

287
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:40,969
I thought I saw her.

288
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,347
To this day, I don't understand

289
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,809
how we could've done
such a horrible thing.

290
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,018
What's wrong with you?

291
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:51,438
You're getting married.

292
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:52,647
Why bring her up?

293
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,733
Don't go looking for trouble, all right?

294
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,568
Her family accepted the money.

295
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:57,902
You know what that means?

296
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:00,572
It means that it ended then and there.

297
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:02,282
It's all in the past.

298
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:03,992
If it's really in the past,

299
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,537
when I mentioned her name just now,

300
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:10,457
why were you so scared?

301
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:13,168
Fuck!

302
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,211
What happens after you find her?

303
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,297
What do you want to do?

304
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,717
I want to tell her in person…

305
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:24,179
that I'm sorry.

306
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:26,973
You've fucking lost your mind,
haven't you?

307
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:30,351
Do you know how many years
I've slaved away to get my current job?

308
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:33,146
How many people
I've begged and been at the mercy of?

309
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:35,356
If you feel guilty and can't live with it,

310
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:36,983
that's your business.

311
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:38,693
Just go to hell.

312
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:39,986
Don't get me involved!

313
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:42,697
All right, Jung-tai.
Let's just talk. Calm down.

314
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:49,913
Sorry.

315
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,290
I can't make it to your wedding.

316
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:53,875
Here's your gift.

317
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,170
If anything ever happens to you,
don't fucking call me.

Yes.

341
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,465
I live alone.

342
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:10,011
Actually, it's not as inconvenient
as I thought.

343
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:11,888
I did hire a helper.

344
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:14,557
She comes by every week
to help me clean and cook.

LI JEN-YAO

346
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,477
Her sesame oil chicken is delicious.

347
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:28,905
<i>We've been chatting like this</i>
<i>for a long time.</i>

348
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:30,573
<i>Has it been</i>

349
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,450
<i>half a month?</i>

350
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,204
I think so.

351
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:40,333
At first, I thought

352
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:42,877
you wouldn't keep calling me like this.

353
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:44,921
<i>Why?</i>

354
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:50,259
<i>Because ever since losing my sight,</i>
<i>I care a lot about what others think.</i>

355
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:51,469
MIGHTY GOOD CLEANING SERVICES

356
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:53,137
<i>And I don't want to burden others.</i>

357
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:58,142
<i>I also try very hard</i>
<i>to prove that blindness isn't pitiful.</i>

358
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,478
<i>It's just a little inconvenient.</i>

359
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:05,400
So I try to appear cheerful.

360
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,573
When I first joined the radio station,

361
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:15,618
my colleague was kind enough
to set me up with someone.

362
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:20,289
I guess this person
was attracted only to my cheerful side.

363
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,711
<i>So our relationship gradually changed.</i>

364
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,089
<i>What made me different</i>

365
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:30,133
<i>didn't make me unique.</i>

366
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,011
<i>Rather, it was a sort of pressure.</i>

367
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:37,557
At the time, I only saw him as a friend.

368
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:44,188
But sometimes when I think about it,
I still feel pretty sad.

369
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,569
Actually,

370
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:54,032
I don't know why
I'm telling you these things.

371
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:59,620
I want you to know…

372
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:02,457
I'm glad

373
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:07,086
<i>that we can keep talking like this.</i>

374
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:18,639
Well,

375
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,017
are you free on Friday?

376
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:22,560
Let's meet up.

377
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:30,568
Sure.

378
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,782
<i>I'll set up a time with you later.</i>

379
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,083
I'm going to hang up now.

380
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:52,173
<i>End. Press.</i>

381
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:05,853
Who is it?

382
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,064
Who else can it be?

383
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:11,442
Of course it's me.

384
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:14,028
The cute Ms. Chi-chi!

385
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:15,947
I knew it was you.

386
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:19,992
My mom went out with her boyfriend
and abandoned me.

387
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,537
Can you take me in? Just for one night.

388
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,080
Okay, I'll get a blanket for you.

389
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:26,499
I knew you were the best, Tien-ching!

390
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:33,923
Good thing I have you,
or else I'd be doomed.

391
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:58,197
LI JEN-YAO: THAT'S OKAY, I'M SLOW TOO

392
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:07,206
MIGHTY GOOD CLEANING SERVICES

393
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,421
Hey, Loner-yao. Wanna grab a drink later?

394
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:14,505
I'm busy.

395
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:16,382
Busy?

396
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,468
Oh, I know. I saw you
took a shower at the office.

397
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,972
Damn, you smell so fresh.

398
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:25,141
Fuck, you used my shower gel, didn't you?

399
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:26,267
Meeting a girl?

400
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,519
Why else would you shower first? Hey.

401
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:31,105
Hold up. Tell me or I won't let you go.

402
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,858
You said you met
someone like Chiang Hsiao-tung.

403
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:35,109
Alike in what way?

404
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,987
Hair? Eyes? Nose? Ears?

405
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:39,864
Tell me.

406
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,200
They don't look alike.

407
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,202
But they have the same tattoo.

408
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:50,708
It's getting late. I'm leaving.

409
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,261
Hey, honey.

410
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,639
How are you? Still feeling sick today?

411
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,265
<i>No, I feel great today.</i>

412
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:09,227
<i>Are any of your high school classmates</i>
<i>attending our wedding?</i>

413
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,811
<i>Is the number confirmed?</i>

414
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,063
<i>I need to know.</i>

415
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:14,232
My high school classmates?

416
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:16,692
Some live too far away.

417
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,402
Some are busy and can't make it.

418
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:21,280
Hold those spots for my college friends.

419
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:24,575
Honey, I'm busy right now.

420
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:25,660
Let's talk later.

421
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:26,619
<i>Okay.</i>

422
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:27,536
Okay, bye.

423
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:40,383
SEARCH OR INPUT WEB ADDRESS

424
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,596
CHIANG HSIAO-TUNG

425
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:51,644
CHIANG HSIAO-TUNG

426
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,331
PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR TO FIND SOMEONE

427
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,313
Sorry, I'm late.

428
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:38,024
No, you're not late.

429
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,108
I was early.

430
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:43,237
I like to be early
when I'm meeting someone.

431
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:46,699
That lipstick

432
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,368
looks nice on you today.

433
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:52,079
My colleague applied it for me.

434
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,165
She said I'd look better this way.

435
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:00,963
So,

436
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,049
for today,

437
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:04,508
where are we going?

438
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,178
It's a bit far from here.

439
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,347
Not somewhere you're familiar with.

440
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:12,099
Do you have your cane?

441
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:14,101
It's okay.

442
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:15,978
Just walk next to me

443
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,522
and let me put my hand on your shoulder.

444
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:33,954
Let's go this way.

445
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,370
Are you nervous?

446
00:40:58,038 --> 00:40:59,415
I'm not nervous.

447
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:00,583
I just…

448
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:03,377
I don't know what to do.

449
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,257
Since I can't see your expression,

450
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,259
I don't know what you are thinking.

451
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:11,677
I'm afraid

452
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:14,180
you'll get bored being with me

453
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:16,390
or feel awkward.

454
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:20,519
The thought of that
makes me a bit anxious.

455
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:30,154
I'm… not good at conversation.

456
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:32,990
Right now,

457
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:35,117
I really don't know what to say.

458
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:37,953
But

459
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,623
hanging out with you today…

460
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,335
makes me very happy.

461
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:48,839
Really?

462
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,090
Yes.

463
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:57,431
Well,

464
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:02,019
can you send me a selfie?

465
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,648
Sure.

466
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:10,653
But what do you want my selfie for?

467
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:15,241
I want to see
if you look just like I imagined.

468
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:19,954
But you…

469
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:23,707
Are you wondering
how I can see with my eyes like this?

470
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,838
Actually, my vision right now feels like

471
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:33,342
having foggy glasses while eating noodles.

472
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:36,554
But at certain angles
or under certain lighting,

473
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:39,390
I can see what you look like just fine.

474
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:45,938
Okay. Give me a moment.

475
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,779
I think I dropped my phone.

476
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:55,531
Wait here for me.

477
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:57,741
Let me go back and look for it.

478
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:50,586
Are you Chiang Hsiao-tung?

479
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:38,884
X-NO HIGH SCHOOL BALLERINA'S

<i>Let's meet our first lucky listener.</i>

481
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:47,184
<i>Could you introduce yourself?</i>

482
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,896
<i>Hi, everyone. My name is Hsia Tien-ching.</i>

483
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:55,401
<i>My dream is to become a radio DJ.</i>

484
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:56,694
It's okay.

485
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:57,945
<i>Why?</i>

486
00:44:58,028 --> 00:44:59,988
You're safe here.

487
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:02,449
I'll protect you.

488
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:05,077
I won't let anyone hurt you again.

489
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:09,665
<i>Since my illness started in high school,</i>
<i>my vision has dropped to 0.01.</i>

490
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:14,169
<i>Now all I can see are blurry silhouettes.</i>

491
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,964
<i>I can barely see colors.</i>

492
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:19,174
<i>So, compared to watching TV,</i>

493
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:21,468
<i>I prefer listening to the radio.</i>
