1
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:09,342
Hey, listen.

2
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:11,803
They're from the best caterer in town.

3
00:00:11,886 --> 00:00:14,347
Hey, I even waited in line
to buy them for you.

4
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,808
Listen, if we can't finish these later,

5
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:18,685
share them with the others, okay?

6
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:23,356
You've got to be mindful of
how things work in this place. You know?

7
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,568
Hey, did I tell you

8
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:28,528
I used to stay here too?

9
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:30,530
For five years.

10
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:32,532
So when you see me, you should say,

11
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:33,575
"Hello, my senior."

12
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:35,035
Why are you here?

13
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:39,873
I came here…

14
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:44,753
I came here…

15
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:48,256
to…

16
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:52,510
apologize.

17
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,055
Do you remember

18
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:58,558
I once asked
if you wanted to stick with me?

19
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,477
I wasn't joking.

20
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,978
I meant it.

21
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:05,732
When I was your age,

22
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:08,860
I always thought

23
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,489
that if I'd had

24
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,326
an older brother
who could look out for me,

25
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,412
my life wouldn't have ended up this way.

26
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:23,249
So when I saw that you, like me,

27
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,836
had a useless, deadbeat dad
who loved to gamble

28
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,715
and was just as stubborn,

29
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:34,302
I wondered if I could help you a bit.

30
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,263
That way, maybe your life

31
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,682
would turn out differently from mine.

32
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,111
Talking about that killed my appetite.

33
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:54,155
I'll get going. Enjoy.

34
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,284
BIG K MIGHTY GOOD, 0933-721-83, CALL ME

35
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,494
This is my number.

36
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:03,039
I'll try to get into
some legit business soon.

37
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,249
After you're released,

38
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,459
if you don't know where to go,

39
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:08,586
come find me.

40
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,209
BIG K MIGHTY GOOD, 0933-721-83, CALL ME

41
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:17,674
HAD I NOT SEEN THE SUN

42
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,075
How long have you been looking?

43
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,540
Don't tell me you didn't sleep all night.

44
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,964
How will you have the energy
to take care of Hsiao-tung?

45
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:00,216
Yun-chen offered to look after Hsiao-tung

46
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,302
so that we could get some rest, but you…

47
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,729
All right, well,

48
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,272
forget it.

49
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,567
I'll take care of Hsiao-tung today.

50
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,402
Rest up at home.

51
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:23,865
I'll freshen up.

52
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,454
Speaking of Hsiao-tung…

53
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,916
I've almost forgotten it.

54
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:39,839
Yesterday, before going to school,

55
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:41,215
Hsiao-tung told me

56
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:44,010
her competition costume didn't fit.

57
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,888
She wanted me to ask Ms. Lin to alter it.

58
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,518
It's past six o'clock?

59
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,854
Is Hsiao-tung up?

60
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,857
Gosh, she's always like this.

61
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,485
Asks me to wake her up,
but goes back to bed when I do.

62
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,362
I'll go check. Hsiao-tung.

63
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,404
Hsiao-tung.

64
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,323
Hsiao-tung.

65
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:08,368
Hey, wake up!
You're going to be late for school.

66
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,204
Breakfast is ready. Come down and eat.

67
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:12,955
Hey, Hsiao-tung!

68
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,917
Stop sleeping in, Hsiao-tung.

69
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,387
<i>The unidentified body parts</i>
<i>found in Yilan days ago</i>

70
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,263
<i>have now been confirmed</i>

71
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,431
<i>through DNA matching</i>

72
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:33,684
<i>as belonging to Chen, an engineer</i>
<i>reported missing by his family last month.</i>

73
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:40,566
<i>Police say that seven bags of body parts</i>
<i>were found in total near the crime scene.</i>

74
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,361
<i>In an attempt</i>
<i>to disrupt the police investigation,</i>

75
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:46,280
<i>the murderer allegedly removed</i>
<i>the victim's fingerprints</i>

76
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,366
<i>and all his teeth.</i>

77
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:52,412
<i>Security footage from the parking lot</i>
<i>where the victim was last seen</i>

78
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:55,456
<i>shows that the suspect</i>
<i>even disguised himself as the victim</i>

79
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,251
<i>and drove his car away from the scene.</i>

80
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,546
Take the money.

81
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,715
You need money for everything you do now.

82
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,301
I'm doing this for Hsiao-tung, not you.

83
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:12,598
The police have found Chen Che-li's
and Fan Wei-ting's bodies.

84
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,725
If Chuang Jung-tai is also found,

85
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:18,229
they will likely look into
their shared past contacts.

86
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:19,939
Just to be safe,

87
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,859
plan your routes to avoid security cameras

88
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,610
and cut off any leads you can.

89
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,863
And stop using your current phone.

90
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,823
Get a burner phone or a prepaid card.

91
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:31,117
Anyway, I hope you don't get caught

92
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,327
before you take care of everyone.

93
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,082
NAME: LIN MENG-HUNG

94
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:42,420
This is the info I got when I checked out
Lin Meng-hung's place earlier.

95
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:43,713
His noodle shop is remote.

96
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,339
There aren't many cameras nearby.

97
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,884
I've marked where the cameras are located.

98
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,970
Also, Lin Meng-hung's grandma
lives in a nursing home.

99
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,264
He occasionally video calls her.

100
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,808
Other than that, he has no family.

101
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,560
NAME: CHANG EN-YA

102
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,686
That's Chang En-ya

103
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:00,521
from Hsiao-tung's class.

104
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:03,065
I found out
what happened to Hsiao-tung that day

105
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:06,027
from someone else in their class,
Tsai Wen-ling.

106
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,071
According to her,
Chang En-ya was there at the time.

107
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,158
She was in the know

108
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:13,993
and an accomplice.

109
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,620
The problem is that

110
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:19,499
I got her address
by claiming I was sending her PR packages.

111
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,834
I scoped out the area
over the past few days

112
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,628
and found it's a busy location,

113
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,339
making it almost impossible

114
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,299
to avoid all the cameras.

115
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,179
This is enough.

116
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,681
You've done enough.

117
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,060
I'll handle the rest on my own.

118
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:46,192
We probably shouldn't meet again
after today.

119
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,985
Just take good care of Hsiao-tung.

120
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,320
It's better

121
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,906
if you don't know too much.

122
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,713
Who is it? I'm going out.

123
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,049
UNLOCK, DISCONNECT

124
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:12,885
So annoying.

125
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,891
-Are you Ms. Chang En-ya?
-Yes.

126
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,768
I need your signature for this package.

127
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:23,062
Which brand sent this?

128
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,689
It's too big.

129
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,440
Bring it in for me.

130
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,359
Hurry, I'm going out.

131
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,877
LIN'S EATERY

132
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,253
Sir, here's the money.

133
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,630
Thank you, sir.

134
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,466
Have you had dinner yet?

135
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,427
Oh.

136
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,054
Then you have to eat more.

137
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,014
Don't be a picky eater.

138
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,644
BEEF NOODLE SOUP AND ASSORTED SIDE DISHES

139
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,188
Menu's on the table. Please sit.
Everything is available today.

140
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,069
Sorry for the wait. Ready to order?

141
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,032
One large beef noodle soup.

142
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:58,949
Okay.

143
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:54,338
LIN'S EATERY

144
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,633
Here you go. Careful, it's hot.

145

Don't.

158

Don't!

159
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:08,657

Don't.

161
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:17,625
Don't.

162
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,086
Fuck! Go away!

163
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:08,801
What the hell?

164
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,231
Hey, what is this?

165
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,233
What are you doing?

166
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,734
-What's up?
-Darling.

167
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,152
Darling.

168
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:30,531
I got a Buddha here, especially for you,

169
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:33,534
and asked my sisters to perform a ritual
to cleanse your bad karma.

170
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:36,161
Hope things will go more smoothly for you.

171
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,999
-You're cleansing my bad karma?
-Yes.

172
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,583
You're doing a ritual for me?

173
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:42,668
Hey.

174
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,211
You spent quite a lot of money.

175
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,132
Fucking hell, what bad karma?

176
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,676
You think I had it coming, don't you?

177
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,344
-That I asked for all this?
-No.

178
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,679
What do you mean?

179
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,473
Your mom is doing this for your sake.

180
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,517
-It's okay.
-How can you say that to her?

181
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:00,978
Hey.

182
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,981
She's my mom, not yours.

183
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:07,317
I'm fucking talking to her.
How is this your business?

184
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:08,777
Get out.

185
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,988
Now! At once!

186
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:12,489
Please go home. I'm sorry.

187
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:13,532
-Don't.
-What?

188
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:14,658
Darling, don't.

189
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,035
I'm sorry.

190
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,036
It's all my fault.

191
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,830
I'm sorry. You're right. It's my fault.

192
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,957
You don't even know what you did wrong!

193
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,667
I've told you hundreds of times.

194
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,712
Did you hear me? Did you?

195
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,464
You didn't?

196
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,381
Fine.

197
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,591
Fine, here.

198
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:35,054
Here, be careful.

199
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,180
No!

200
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:49,359
Hey, what fucking good
does praying all day do?

201
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,029
Why don't you ask that old man to help?

202
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:53,489
Beg him.

203
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,282
The moment he asks,

204
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:59,536
who among the cops
or criminals wouldn't help?

205
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,831
Who wouldn't help me catch Li Jen-yao?

206
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:06,085
It's just a simple phone call.

207
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,545
And you can help me. Why won't you do it?

208
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,589
Why won't you do it?

209
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,305
Buddha.

210
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,057
I'm sorry.

211
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:23,143
I'm sorry.

212
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,437
I'm sorry.

213
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,816
Please forgive my son.

214
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:31,860
He didn't mean to disrespect you.

215
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,946
He's really not a bad kid.

216
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:36,323
He just lost himself for a moment.

217
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,367
-Buddha, please forgive him.
-Fuck.

218
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,744
-I'm talking to you.
-For everything he did to you.

219
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,871
I'm sorry, Buddha.

220
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,414
Please forgive my son.

221
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:47,167
-Buddha, please…
-I'm talking to you!

222
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:52,381
Buddha, he just lost himself for a moment.

223
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,509
Buddha, I'm sorry. Please forgive my son.

224
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:58,345
Why the hell are you apologizing
to a piece of wood?

225
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:00,639
He didn't mean to disrespect you.

226
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:02,683
Mom!

227
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:05,477
I'm talking to you. Look at me, okay?

228
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,396
Look at me! Open your eyes and look!

229
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,731
Mom!

230
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,775
-Listen to me, okay?
-He's not a bad kid.

231
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:12,734
Listen to me!

232
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,027
-Please forgive him.
-Mom!

233
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,280
It's really no trouble at all.

234
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:21,535
And no one's happier than me
to be by Hsiao-tung's side, okay?

235
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,663
Her colleagues came by yesterday.

236
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:25,998
Yeah.

237
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,585
Oh, okay, no problem.

238
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:30,752
Go ahead, Mr. Chiang.

239
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,213
Okay. Let's talk when you come over.

240
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,465
Okay, all right.

241
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:36,967
Okay, bye.

242
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,463
So is this your look now?

243
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,259
I quite like it.

244
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:21,845
Who are you?

245
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,017
Whatever.

246
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,269
This isn't the first time anyway.

247
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,398
I'll tell you for the last time.

248
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,942
Listen carefully.

249
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:39,029
I'm your best friend, Chi-chi.

250
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:39,947
Chi-chi.

251
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:43,116
Please don't forget me again, okay?

252
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,827
It's so awkward
to introduce myself every time.

253
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,915
Do you know who I am?

254
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,459
Do you know what happened to me?

255
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,711
You're sure you wanna ask that?

256
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:58,340
That's a long story.

257
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,259
Let me think.

258
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,474
Ask her the question you just asked me.

259
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,518
She's much more patient than I am.

260
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:13,939
She can talk to you for a long time.

261
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,529
I'll hand her over to you.

262
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:45,345
Why are you suddenly awake? Are you okay?

263
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:49,391
Who are you?

264
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,395
Who am I?

265
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:02,904
I'm Shen Mu.

266
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:05,365
Shen Mu?

267
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:06,700
Yes.

268
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:11,872
Why are you here?

269
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:15,334
I…

270
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:26,345
<i>I am</i>

271
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,305
your family.

272
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,350
My family?

273
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:35,520
Yes.

274
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,440
I'm your family.

275
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,221
<i>That's right.</i>

276
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:11,556
<i>I'm your family.</i>

277
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,851
<i>No matter what happens in the future,</i>

278
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,646
<i>I'll never leave you again.</i>

279
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:21,441
We're family.

280
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,252
JEFF: IS THIS YOU?

281
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,098
How's the search going?

282
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:57,727
Jung-tai's scandal has blown up.
The school told him to lie low.

283
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:59,646
He's been missing for a while.

284
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:03,233
I can't reach Meng-hung either.

285
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,486
And I just found out

286
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,281
that En-ya has been missing for days too.

287
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,658
Her assistant called the police.

288
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,994
Not to mention Wei-ting and Che-li.

289
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,746
Fuck, why is it us?

290
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:23,211
Fucking hell!

291
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:28,383
Do you think

292
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,219
Chiang Hsiao-tung
has become a malevolent spirit

293
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,637
and came back for revenge?

294
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:35,557
How the hell is this

295
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:38,059
related to Chiang Hsiao-tung?

296
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:42,022
Well, didn't people say
that she killed herself?

297
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:44,024
It'd make sense if she wanted to haunt us.

298
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,485
Listen.

299
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,069
I heard some ghosts

300
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:52,407
hold a Black Command Flag to seek revenge
so that those who hurt them die horribly.

301
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:55,118
Look at how Che-li and Wei-ting died.

302
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:57,496
It's Li Jen-yao.

303
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,499
It must be him.

304
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:02,834
Li Jen-yao?

305
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:05,045
Has he been released?

306
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:07,214
He's been out for a year.

307
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:10,884
He's out,
yet we can't find any trace of him.

308
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:14,429
Someone must be covering his tracks.

309
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,556
No way.

310
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,642
He's been out for a year.

311
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:19,851
Why wait until now?

312
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,812
Does he love Hsiao-tung that much?

313
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:25,524
That can't be. Is he crazy?

314
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:27,943
Ti.

315
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,363
Tsai Wen-ling is here.

316
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:39,996
Why didn't you keep your word?

317
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:44,334
Didn't you say
that if I behaved and took clients,

318
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:46,127
you'd destroy the video?

319
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,214
Why did you upload it?

320
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,677
Tell the police if you have the guts.

321
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,346
Cuff me.

322
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:58,557
Come on.

323
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,393
You didn't get that many views.

324
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:04,229
It's been several weeks
since I uploaded it.

325
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,982
Just about 10,000 people have watched it.

326
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:08,608
Honey,

327
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:13,238
if you can make every man on the street

328
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,615
recognize you,

329
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,578
I will give you a performance bonus.

330
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:23,540
Hey, if you need money, come to me.

331
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,750
I'll pay you 50 for each blow job.

332
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:29,087
-Hey, what are you doing?
-Don't cross the line!

333
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:40,390
Come on.

334
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:42,934
Here.

335
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,396
You have only one chance.

336
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:50,525
If you don't kill me…

337
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,321
I'll kill you.

338
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:51,252
<i>It's been several weeks</i>
<i>since I uploaded it.</i>

339
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,463

<i>I will give you a performance bonus.</i>

343
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:51,354
<i>I was wondering if you have news</i>
<i>about Chiang Hsiao-tung.</i>

344
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:52,731
<i>Lately…</i>

345
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:55,108
<i>lately, I keep</i>

346
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:59,362
<i>seeing her in front of me</i>
<i>wearing her high school uniform.</i>

347
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:02,407
<i>The unidentified body parts</i>

348
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:05,452
<i>have been confirmed through DNA matching</i>

349
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:08,830
<i>as belonging to Chen, an engineer</i>
<i>reported missing by his family last month.</i>

350
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:11,166
<i>Police say that near the crime scene…</i>

351
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,209
<i>But I heard she committed suicide.</i>

352
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:15,879
<i>I want to confirm if that's true or not.</i>

353
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:19,507
<i>If that's true,</i>

354
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,384
<i>what exactly did I see?</i>

355
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:40,695
I'm sorry.

356
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,239
I'm sorry.

357
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:45,450
I'm sorry!

358
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:48,453
I'm sorry!

359
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:54,209
I'm sorry.

360
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:55,835
I'm sorry.

361
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:01,174
Kidney Bean, look, I bought you…

362
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:21,903
Young master.

363
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:24,864
It's been a long time.

364
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,116
What the hell are you doing?

365
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:30,161
You're scaring my wife and kid.

366
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:40,588
After all, I used to work for your dad.

367
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,591
I helped you a lot too.

368
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:47,345
Can't we talk about this?

369
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,728
<i>Big K, we can't hide it anymore.</i>

370
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:57,647
<i>Young master's investigating.</i>

371
00:30:58,147 --> 00:31:01,568
<i>I could get by if he only asked</i>
<i>a thing or two when it crossed his mind.</i>

372
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:03,278
<i>But the way he's going,</i>

373
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,989
<i>he'll soon find out</i>
<i>that you're hiding Li Jen-yao.</i>

374
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:08,116
<i>Sorry for all the trouble.</i>

375
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,787
<i>I don't mean to ditch you,</i>
<i>but at this rate, I'll be screwed too.</i>

376
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:13,705
<i>As your buddy,</i>

377
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:16,374
<i>I can only tell you to lie low for now.</i>

378
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:18,042
<i>Don't let him catch you.</i>

379
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,003
<i>Otherwise, we're dead meat.</i>

380
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:29,345
Big K.

381
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,639
Where's my classmate?

382
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,057
Where are you hiding him?

383
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:35,351
Tell me, come on.

384
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:37,604
Young master.

385
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,856
You got it wrong.

386
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,984
I'm not hiding Li Jen-yao.

387
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:45,486
I'm helping your dad

388
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,531
so that he doesn't bury his own son.

389
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:53,328
You…

390
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:57,498
Do you know
how many people have died so far?

391
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,752
You do.

392
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,295
So you're scared.

393
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:05,214
You'd better pray
Li Jen-yao doesn't find you first.

394
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:06,633
He's different now.

395
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:07,675
This time,

396
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:09,677
he won't spare you.

397
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,683
You're dead.

398
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:27,362
Fuck!

399
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:32,158
Hey, fuck. He's gone.

400
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:33,868
What should we do now?

401
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:43,878
It hurts.

402
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:44,963
Just hang on.

403
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:47,632
Hello?

404
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:49,175
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

405
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:50,885
<i>What's up?</i>

406
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,096
-Kidney Bean.
-Nothing.

407
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:54,514
I've really let you down.

408
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:00,687
Well, for the sake of my wife and kid,

409
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:01,771
I sold you out.

410
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:03,731
We're protecting different things.

411
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,608
Just take care of your family.

412
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:06,985
<i>You really want to do this?</i>

413
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:09,988
If so, make sure
you hide Chiang Hsiao-tung well.

414
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,948
If Ouyang Ti catches her, you're screwed.

415
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:16,619
<i>Don't think he won't find out just because</i>
<i>she changed her name and appearance.</i>

416
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:19,872
<i>He has a lot of tricks.</i>
<i>He has many ways to figure it out.</i>

417
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,333
I'll be honest with you.

418
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,628
About six or seven years ago…

419
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,841
when Hsiao-tung was in the hospital,

420
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,343
I went to visit.

421
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,851
Do you guys think

422
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:43,688
that apologizing now

423
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,357
and paying us this money

424
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:48,651
will bring my daughter back?

425
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:51,070
Impossible.

426
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,284
She'll never come back.

427
00:33:56,367 --> 00:34:00,413
I never told you
because I felt like you both had it rough.

428
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:03,666
I wanted you two to go live your own lives

429
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,293
<i>and not get mixed up again.</i>

430
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:08,171
<i>But I was wrong.</i>

431
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,048
I shouldn't have decided

432
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:11,758
for you.

433
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:15,303
No.

434
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:16,471
You're right.

435
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,681
I shouldn't have gone to her.

436
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:20,850
She'd be better off

437
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,061
without me.

438
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,605
If the police come to you,

439
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:27,356
don't blab.

440
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,485
Don't mention the past.

441
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:32,361
Especially about Hsiao-tung.

442
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:34,781
-Otherwise--
<i>-Okay, I got it.</i>

443
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,449
<i>I have principles, okay?</i>

444
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:37,867
And you? Where are you?

445
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,660
Can I help with anything?

446
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,622
Hello? Hey.

447
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,918
Delete it.

448
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,337
Otherwise, I'll sue your ass.

449
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:50,963
REPORT

450
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:57,345
Why are there more?

451
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,514
She was forced to do it.

452
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:02,141
The person who filmed this is a scumbag.

453
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:05,269
Delete the video.

454
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,646
Otherwise,

455
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:10,983
I'll sue all of your asses.

456
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:14,112
WE WILL REMOVE VIOLATING CONTENT, OKAY

457
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,322
Why are there more?

458
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,282
Why are there more?

459
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,201
Why can't I delete them all?

460
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,702
Why me?

461
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,162
Hurry, delete them.

462
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:35,299
Right.

463
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,843
Why?

464
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,805
You knew what would happen.

465
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,057
I asked you to call the police

466
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,892
and help me.

467
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:47,019
Why did you ignore me?

468
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,729
Hurry, help me.

469
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:52,024
Help me.

470
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:58,698
Why did you side with them
when you knew what happened to me

471
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,284
and said everything

472
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:03,202
was my fault?

473
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:06,539
What exactly happened that day?

474
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,337
At the time,

475
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:17,216
I told Hsiao-tung it was dangerous there
and asked her to leave with me,

476
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:18,718
but she said no.

477
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:20,845
She wanted to stay and hang out with them.

478
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:21,762
Really?

479
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:25,641
Before I left,
I even saw her hug Ouyang Ti willingly.

480
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:30,980
-I'm sorry.
-Why did you do that to me?

481
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:32,023
I'm sorry.

482
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:35,443
Aren't we friends?

483
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,283
I'm sorry.

484
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:49,790
It's okay.

485
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:52,501
Back then,

486
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,503
you left me there.

487
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:59,842
But I'll always stay by your side.

488
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:05,556
I will always,

489
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:09,268
always

490
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,479
be watching you.

491
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,564
<i>Watching you.</i>

492
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:24,825
I'm sorry.

493
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,748
I plan to bring my family
to the US to hide out for a while.

494
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:32,333
Like a vacation.

495
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,963
Hey.

496
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:38,589
Fatty.

497
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,716
Are you kidding me?

498
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:46,722
I'm serious, okay?

499
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:48,182
I'm not like you.

500
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,142
Why risk my life over someone like that?

501
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:51,686
I am my dad's only son.

502
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:52,853
I'm the only son.

503
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:56,148
Only son?

504
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:59,235
Oh, I forgot you're the only son.

505
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,779
Take good care of yourself.

506
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,366
I'm sorry.
I forgot you hate your half-brother.

507
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,660
Fuck you.

508
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:09,578
Fuck off.

509
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:12,206
-I will. To the US.
-Don't come back or I'll beat you.

510
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,374
Don't mind him.

511
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,043
Don't look at him.

512
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:17,753
Hey, Wang Yu-hsiang.

513
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:22,902
Can we go out for a walk?

514
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:25,112
I'm so bored with staying at home
every day.

515
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,030
I'm gonna die.

516
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,576
Let's go out for dinner later, then.

517
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:35,456
Really?

518
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:37,875
I'll go get changed.

519
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:39,293
Don't fool me.

520
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:47,593
What do you want to eat later?

521
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:50,513
Let's grab some hot pot
after checking out the lights.

522
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:51,430
Sure.

523
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:52,723
What kind of hot pot?

524
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:55,518
Anything works.

525
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:57,186
-Spicy hot pot?
-Sure.

526
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:58,979
-I haven't had it for ages.
-I see.

527
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,272
It's so beautiful.

528
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,820
-Merry Christmas.
-Thank you.

529
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,447
-Merry Christmas.
-Thank you.

530
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,828
Merry Christmas.

531
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,998
-Merry Christmas.
-Thank you.

532
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:42,082
Hey, let me.

533
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,045
It's so cute.

534
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,090
You look cute too.

535
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:01,101
I've already asked my men to look into it.

536
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,356
I'm sure
someone Li Jen-yao knows lives there.

537
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,399
And my gut tells me

538
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,277
it could be his woman.

539
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:14,823
We'll find her, no matter what.

540
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:18,035
Catch her and mess her up.

541
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:22,039
We'll film everything

542
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,083
and show it to Li Jen-yao.

543
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:28,587
Hey, only son.

544
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,297
Listen.

545
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,634
This time, I'll definitely make Li…

546
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:57,491
<i>Hello?</i>

547
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:58,951
<i>Ouyang.</i>

548
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:06,959
Fatty.

549
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:10,963
Fatty.

550
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:12,965
Fatty.

551
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:15,926
<i>-Ouyang.</i>
-Fatty, save me.

552
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:17,845
<i>Ouyang, say something.</i>

553
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:19,680
Fatty.

554
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:22,558
Fatty.

555
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:23,767
Save me.

556
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:44,204
Darling, are you home?

557
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,414
Why are the lights off?

558
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:55,257
Darling.

559
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,634
Darling.

560
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,427
I'm home.

561
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:01,240
What's wrong?

562
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:05,619
I remembered something important.

563
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:15,045
I promised
to spend Christmas with someone.

564
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:50,914
<i>I waited for them a long, long time</i>
<i>at the place we agreed to meet.</i>

565
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:54,001
They didn't come.

566
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:58,338
I only remember
feeling disappointed at the end.

567
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,258
And now…

568
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:07,473
I can't remember who they are.

569
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:15,731
<i>Why don't I remember who they are?</i>

570
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,779
<i>How can I not remember?</i>

571
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:09,639
