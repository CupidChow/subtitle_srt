00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:20,562
Hey!

4
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:22,439
One, two, three, freeze!

5
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:25,942
One, two, three, freeze!

6
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:27,736
Oh, no.

7
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:29,612
One, two, three, freeze!

8
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,531
I got you!

9
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:33,366
I'm the devil!

10
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,410
BIG K MIGHTY GOOD, 0933-721-83, CALL ME

11
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:38,455
<i>After you're released, if you don't know</i>
<i>where to go, come find me.</i>

12
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,794
You can be the devil.

13
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:45,712
Your turn.

14
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:47,213
One, two, three, freeze!

15
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,367
Kiddo!

16
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:22,290
Gosh. You really came to me.

17
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:37,764
Where is Ouyang? Tell me!

18
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:40,642
Hand him over. Then you and I are even.

19
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,979
You just got out.
Do you wanna get locked up again?

20
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:47,315
Even if I tell you, what can you do?

21
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:48,733
You're on your own.

22
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,861
Do you think you can kill them all?

23
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,446
Do you know what could happen?

24
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:55,782
I don't care.

25
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:57,867
You don't care.

26
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:00,203
But what about your sweetheart?

27
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,664
Have you asked her?

28
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,457
Does she want you to do this?

29
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,920
Maybe she's already started a new life.

30
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:13,174
Is this… helping her or hurting her?

31
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,732
Don't you want to see Chiang Hsiao-tung?

32
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,077
Where is she?

33
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:42,871
I don't know.

34
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,708
But I'm good at finding people.

35
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,796
I used to collect debts. You know that.

36
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,174
Wherever she's hiding,

37
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,301
I can help you find her.

38
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,261
But you have to promise me.

39
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:00,555
Stay here and work for me

40
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:02,557
until I find her.

41
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,227
And don't go around causing trouble.

42
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:38,736
HAD I NOT SEEN THE SUN

43
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:40,571
Mrs. Ouyang.

44
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,201
Do you recognize this person?

45
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,416
I do.

46
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,336
He is…

47
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,257
Li Jen-yao.

48
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:02,302
<i>This fateful Christmas Eve</i>
<i>at around 11:00 p.m.,</i>

49
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:06,180
<i>a horrific murder occurred</i>
<i>during a home invasion in Taipei.</i>

50
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,766
<i>Legislator Ouyang Hsiang's eldest son,</i>
<i>Ti, was killed.</i>

51
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,103
<i>The police have identified the suspect</i>
<i>from security footage.</i>

52
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,188
<i>The suspect, Li, and the victim</i>

53
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:16,357
<i>reportedly had a dispute seven years ago.</i>

54
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,359
<i>They were once high school classmates--</i>

55
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:27,910
Wang Yu-hsiang.

56
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:29,871
What's wrong with you?

57
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:30,788
Are you unwell?

58
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,498
Why the outfit?

59
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,501
Just having a meal with a friend.

60
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:37,378
Say you're not going.

61
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,715
I'm going to be late.

62
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,514
Fuck you.

63
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,271
What the heck? What are you doing?

64
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,024
Let go!

65
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:02,070
Fuck.

66
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:08,451
Let go!

67
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,037
-Let go!
-Go to hell!

68
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,502
Bitch! Fucking bitch!

69
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,837
-Fucking bitch!
-Go to hell!

70
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:22,423
Let go of me!

71
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:23,591
Go to hell!

72
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,010
-What are you doing?
-What the heck?

73
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,226
Shih-yu.

74
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,270
Shih-yu, where are you?

75
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,107
Shih-yu.

76
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:40,983
Where are you?

77
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:42,693
Shih-yu.

78
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,197
Where are you?

79
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:47,740
Shih-yu.

80
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,535
Where are you?

81
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,204
Shih-yu.

82
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:56,791
Shih-yu.

83
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,210
Where are you?

84
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,339
Shih-yu.

85
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,342
Shih-yu.

86
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,014
Shih-yu.

87
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:15,977
Found you.

88
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:24,569
Mommy, I'm sorry!

89
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,742
Mommy, I'm sorry!

90
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,707
<i>The suspect, Li Jen-yao,</i>
<i>and the victim, Ouyang Ti,</i>

91
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,375
<i>reportedly had a dispute seven years ago.</i>

92
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,127
<i>But the real motive for the murder</i>

93
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,297
<i>can only be found out</i>
<i>when the suspect is arrested.</i>

94
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,467
<i>We will continue to follow this story</i>
<i>and keep you updated.</i>

95
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,387
<i>Shouldn't Ouyang Ti have been the last?</i>

96
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,347
<i>Why did you kill him first?</i>

97
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,433
<i>And you were seen on camera.</i>

98
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,894
When I went to Hsiao-tung's that day,

99
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,563
I think Ouyang Ti was following me.

100
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:02,815
He might have found her.

101
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,817
That's why I acted immediately.

102
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,611
I called you

103
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,489
because Hsiao-tung's place
might not be safe.

104
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,240
Take her away quickly.

105
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,408
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>

106
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,536
<i>You, on the other hand,</i>
<i>are wanted by the police.</i>

107
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,829
<i>Can you get Wang Yu-hsiang?</i>

108
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,290
If not, I will.

109
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,208
<i>No.</i>

110
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,043
Just remember one thing.

111
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,212
Take good care of Hsiao-tung.

112
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,255
The rest

113
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,174
is my responsibility.

114
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:33,513
Later on, no matter what happens,

115
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:35,890
I won't contact you again.

116
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,601
<i>You just have to remember our pact.</i>

117
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,480
<i>Pretend you don't know anything, or me.</i>

118
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,036
Mommy, I'm sorry!

119
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,413
I'm sorry!

120
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:02,792
Sorry!

121
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,091
Mommy, I'm sorry!

122
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,930
Mommy, I'm sorry!

123
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,189
Mommy, I'm sorry!

124
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,108
Absolutely. Sure.

125
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,069
At my place. Yes, I'm home.

126
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,198
It's on me.

127
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,452
Who else did you invite? Amber.

128
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,373
Bring Angela along.

129
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,875
Those two were popular last time.

130
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,795
Mr. Chen and the others quite liked them.

131
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,674
<i>Jen-yao, don't come out.</i>

132
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,092
<i>Be good.</i>

133
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:55,886
<i>Stay inside. It'll be okay, all right?</i>

134
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:57,888
Move the fuck aside!

135
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,308
-What are you doing? No!
-Move aside! Get lost!

136
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,602
Just hit me. Hit me. Stop hitting Jen-yao.

137
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,604
-Don't!
-Fuck.

138
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,272
Why are you pulling me away?

139
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:09,483
-He's so young and already talking back.
-Don't!

140
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,777
And you're fucking telling me
not to hit him?

141
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,946
-How will he turn out?
-He saw you hitting me.

142
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:14,864
Go away!

143
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,699
He wanted to protect me.

144
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:17,783
You beat him up.

145
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,327
Get out of the way!

146
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,454
UNCLE COW'S STEAKHOUSE

147
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:07,541
Hello.

148
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,419
I'm Wen-ling's
high school classmate Lai Yun-chen.

149
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,005
Hey.

150
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,676
Let her come in and take a look.

151
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:26,644
About two weeks ago,
Wen-ling suddenly came home one day

152
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,437
and locked herself in her room.

153
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,941
She kept saying a ghost was haunting her.

154
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,860
She's clearly having mental issues,

155
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,655
but we can't force her to see a doctor.

156
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:42,493
We… really don't know what to do.

157
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,038
Can I go in and see Wen-ling?

158
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,999
If I talk to her about high school

159
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,168
and help her recall happy memories,

160
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,170
she might get better sooner.

161
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,388
Okay. Please be careful.

162
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,587
WAY-YA STUDIO, ADULT VIDEOS, ADULT PHOTOS

163
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,305
I was going to let you die.

164
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,934
But now I think
it's better to keep you alive.

165
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,195
You left Hsiao-tung in that hell.

166
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,280
Now it's your turn.

167
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,117
No one will save you.

168
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,912
You can stay in this hell.

169
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:09,914
Grieve for Hsiao-tung.

170
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,919
Hsiao-tung.

171
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,130
Hsiao-tung.

172
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,257
Chiang Hsiao-tung.

173
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,384
Chiang Hsiao-tung!

174
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,553
Chiang Hsiao-tung.

175
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:26,430
Chiang Hsiao-tung.

176
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:52,748
Chiang Hsiao-tung!

177
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,835
Chiang Hsiao-tung!

178
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,169
Chiang Hsiao-tung!

179
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:02,883
Chiang Hsiao-tung, I'm sorry!

180
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:36,041
Fuck!

181
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,461
No! What do you want?

182
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,630
Stay away.

183
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,300
No. Fuck!

184
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,218
Fuck!

185
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,893
Wang Yu-hsiang, what are you doing?
You're so damn loud.

186
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:56,562
My wife's innocent.

187
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:59,064
She doesn't know you!
You wouldn't kill the innocent.

188
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,276
I'm going to the US tomorrow for good.

189
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,652
Like I'm dead!

190
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,987
Don't!

191
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,996
Don't.

192
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,763
Don't.

193
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:42,524
Don't.

194
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,655
Fuck!

195
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:07,841
Don't.

196
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,927
Let… me explain.

197
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,136
Let me explain.

198
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,264
I don't think
I raped Chiang Hsiao-tung that day.

199
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:18,268
I… I really didn't rape Chiang Hsiao-tung.

200
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,606
There were so many people.
I couldn't even get hard.

201
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,735
I really didn't!

202
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,779
I didn't! I…

203
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,074
I'll give you money.

204
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,743
I'll give you money.
Lots of it. As much as you want.

205
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,412
My wife is rich too.

206
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,705
It's all yours.

207
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,498
Don't. Wait, you…

208
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,210
<i>Don't forget about me.</i>

209
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,131
No! Don't take it! No!

210
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,216
EXQUISITE LODGING FOR RENT

211
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,133
No!

212
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:14,927
Get lost!

213
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:17,304
Please!

214
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,223
-Why are you grabbing me?
-Please.

215
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,938
Didn't I say I'd pay you back

216
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,815
with some extra next week?

217
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:30,984
This is what Jen-yao has sent me.
I can't give it to you!

218
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,237
You're making me do this.

219
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,613
Come here! Give it to me.

220
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,366
Or I'll beat you. You're asking for it.

221
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,535
Give it to me.

222
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,829
I'll pay you back. What are you doing?

223
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,163
No!

224
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:44,581
Please.

225
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,170
Give it to me.

226
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,947
Jen-yao, don't do this.

227
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,824
I was wrong.

228
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,993
I'll go with you, okay? I'll go with you.

229
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:23,871
I promise I'm done with him.
Don't do this.

230
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:25,080
I'm begging you.

231
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,416
Listen to me. I'll go with you.

232
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,002
No, don't do this. Don't.

233
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:30,919
Jen-yao.

234
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:43,682
Jen-yao, listen to me. Listen, okay?

235
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:44,892
Listen to me.

236
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,238
Mom.

237
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,451
Take good care of yourself from now on.

238
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,248
I won't be coming back.

239
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,700
Hello? I'm Li Jen-yao.

240
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:26,660
I killed someone.

241
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,330
I am at Lane 16, Ching-chuan Street.

242
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,258
Don't you know?

243
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:42,926
-He even killed his own dad.
-What?

244
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,388
Yeah, why did he do that?

245
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,931
-I don't get it.
-He's out.

246
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:51,518
Li Jen-yao,
why did you kill so many people?

247
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:52,686
What was your motive?

248
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:55,314
-Do you feel guilty?
-You even killed a child!

249
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,898
Could you explain?

250
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,525
Who's that influencer to you?

251
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,153
-Why did you kill them?
-What was the feud about?

252
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:03,447
Li Jen-yao, would you like to explain?

253
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,824
-What did that influencer do?
-Could you explain?

254
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:06,783
Look this way.

255
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:09,161
-Please tell us.
-Li Jen-yao, any comment?

256
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:10,620
Camera is here, Li Jen-yao.

257
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,148
Li Jen-yao!

258
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:40,233
-What was the feud about?
-Please explain!

259
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,193
Li Jen-yao!

260
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:02,589
What did you do
after killing Wang Yu-hsiang and his wife?

261
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,300
What did their child do to you?

262
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,887
Why didn't you spare him?
What did he do wrong?

263
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:21,441
<i>Don't forget about me.</i>

264
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:31,451
<i>If it hadn't been for you,</i>

265
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:36,373
<i>Mommy wouldn't have cried so much.</i>

266
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,208
<i>It's all your fault.</i>

267
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:41,420
<i>Everything is your fault.</i>

268
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,632
<i>If it hadn't been for you,</i>

269
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,260
<i>Hsiao-tung wouldn't have been like this.</i>

270
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:55,142
<i>If it hadn't been for you…</i>

271
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:01,064
<i>If it hadn't been for you,</i>

272
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:03,442
<i>we wouldn't have been in so much pain.</i>

00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:09,906
<i>If it hadn't been for you…</i>

274
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,075

275
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:17,038

<i>Everything is your fault.</i>

278

<i>Everything is my fault.</i>

279
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,297
<i>If they hadn't met you…</i>

280
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,715
<i>If they hadn't met me,</i>

281
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:30,677
<i>they wouldn't have suffered so much.</i>

00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,429
<i>It's all your fault.</i>

00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,698
<i>It's all your fault.</i>

291
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,867
<i>It's all your fault.</i>

292
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:55,994
<i>-It's all your fault.</i>
-Stop talking.

293
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:59,998
Stop talking!

294
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:13,011
Stop talking!

295
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:16,056
Shut up!

296
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:04,479
Answer me!

297
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,147
Why did you kill that child?

298
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:12,112
<i>I don't know why I killed him either.</i>

299
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:15,991
Maybe…

300
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,495
I'm just a jerk.

301
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,875
<i>Perhaps I shouldn't have lived</i>

302
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:28,795
<i>in the first place.</i>

303
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:32,048
<i>Serial murders in the past few months</i>
<i>have caused widespread fear.</i>

304
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:34,175
<i>The murderer is finally caught.</i>

305
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,637
<i>Li Jen-yao, dubbed "The Rainstorm Killer"</i>
<i>by the media, is only 25 years old.</i>

306
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:41,850
<i>He turned himself in to the police</i>
<i>after killing his father yesterday</i>

307
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,853
<i>and confessed to multiple murders.</i>

308
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,896
<i>Li Jen-yao,</i>
<i>who committed multiple murders,</i>

309
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,440
<i>was sentenced to death in 2017.</i>

310
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:50,483
<i>Now, six years later,</i>
<i>he still awaits execution.</i>

311
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,611
<i>Attorneys are reportedly exploring</i>

312
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,863
<i>a constitutional review for Li Jen-yao,</i>

313
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:57,324
<i>but Li Jen-yao has yet to sign</i>
<i>an engagement letter</i>

314
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,659
<i>and has refused to file</i>
<i>an extraordinary appeal.</i>

315
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:27,187
Pin-yu?

316
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:31,399
I remember when I first met you…

317
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,694
you said we were family.

318
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,615
You said I had forgotten a lot
because of a car accident.

319
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:41,993
None of this is true, is it?

320
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,333
Tien-ching never met you.

321
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:50,752
But you knew so much about me.

322
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,379
This can't be a coincidence.

323
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,506
Did Li Jen-yao plan it?

324
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:02,931
Did everything

325
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:04,933
come back to you?

326
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:07,227
Answer me first.

327
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:10,397
When you stayed and took care of me,

328
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:12,899
did you already know

329
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:18,113
that Li Jen-yao was going to kill
everyone who hurt Hsiao-tung?

330
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,246
Why didn't you stop him?

331
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:28,373
Why did you let him do it?

332
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:30,959
Why should I have stopped him?

333
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:32,961
If he hadn't done it,

334
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:36,047
I would've done it myself
and killed him too!

335
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,761
Because if it hadn't been for him,

336
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,181
this wouldn't have happened to you.

337
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,728
He was with you back then.

338
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:53,022
But he failed to protect you
and even let this happen.

339
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:03,199
<i>Yet, in fact,</i>
<i>I know better than anyone else</i>

340
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:06,619
<i>that deep down, the person I hate the most</i>

341
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,289
<i>is myself.</i>

342
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,959
<i>Back then, I really wanted to contact you.</i>

343
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,003
<i>I really wanted to know</i>

344
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:17,922
<i>how you were doing</i>
<i>after I moved to Taipei.</i>

345
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:22,343
<i>But I was afraid to hear</i>

346
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:26,890
<i>that you were doing well without me.</i>

347
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:29,893
<i>I was afraid you would realize</i>

348
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,229
<i>that I had been missing you,</i>

349
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,690
<i>that I wished we could go back to</i>

350
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,401
<i>when we were together all the time.</i>

351
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:41,279
<i>But I was afraid to say it.</i>

352
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:43,740
HSIAO-TUNG CALLING

353
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:48,870
Hello? Hsiao-tung.

354
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,955
How come you're calling out of the blue?

355
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,292
<i>You seriously said that?</i>
<i>What's been keeping you so busy?</i>

356
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:56,085
<i>Why haven't you called me?</i>

357
00:29:58,546 --> 00:29:59,631
Sorry.

358
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,300
I've had a lot of homework lately.

359
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,552
I'm also taking
tutoring classes after school.

360
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:07,180
And on weekends,
I have to help out at my mom's store.

361
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:09,474
Why did you leave without waiting for us?

362
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,227
Sorry, I forgot.

363
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:15,104
-I'm talking to a friend. One moment.
-Okay.

364
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,315
-Hey, Hsiao-tung. So…
<i>-Hey, Yun-chen.</i>

365
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:18,817
<i>It's okay.</i>

366
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,860
<i>I'll let you get back to your friends.</i>

367
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:22,904
<i>My dance practice is starting.</i>

368
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:24,531
<i>We'll talk soon.</i>

369
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:27,534
<i>I'm going to hang up now. Bye.</i>

370
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:28,660
Hey, then--

371
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:43,925
<i>That's why</i>

372
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:48,763
<i>I pretended that I was doing well</i>
<i>on my own in Taipei,</i>

373
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,809
<i>that I was living</i>
<i>a great and fulfilling life…</i>

374
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:56,813
<i>that I'd gotten used to</i>

375
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:59,190
<i>life without you by my side.</i>

376
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:04,571
<i>Yet I didn't know</i>

377
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,657
<i>that was when it all happened.</i>

378
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:12,078
<i>I didn't know I wasn't there for you</i>

379
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,747
<i>when you needed me the most.</i>

380
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,877
<i>I didn't know anything.</i>

381
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:21,671
<i>I didn't know any of it.</i>

382
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,591
How could I not have known any of it?

383
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:26,342
How could I…

384
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,679
how could I have let you
go through that alone?

385
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:47,488
I'm sorry.

386
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,368
I'm sorry.

387
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:56,915
Hsiao-tung, I'm sorry.

388
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,462
I'm so sorry.

389
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:16,351
<i>Have you ever regretted</i>
<i>the crimes you committed?</i>

390
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:19,187
<i>I don't regret them.</i>

391
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:24,275
<i>Will you not regret them</i>
<i>even if you're executed in the end?</i>

392
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:27,195
<i>This is what I deserve.</i>

393
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,823
<i>No matter what my punishment is…</i>

394
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:34,702
<i>I accept it.</i>

395
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:37,056
WE FILM PRODUCTIONS

396
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,058
If every person Li Jen-yao killed

397
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:41,269
was connected to that video,

398
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,187
that means his motive for murder

399
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,898
was to get revenge for Chiang Hsiao-tung.

400
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,901
Rather than revenge,

401
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:51,320
I think

402
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:54,365
Li Jen-yao was trying
to protect Chiang Hsiao-tung.

403
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:55,992
To protect Chiang Hsiao-tung?

404
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:57,035
Yes.

405
00:33:57,118 --> 00:34:00,538
I think he did what he did
to protect Chiang Hsiao-tung.

406
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:03,041
He didn't want other people to know

407
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:06,335
that those things
happened to Chiang Hsiao-tung,

408
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:09,422
nor did he want anything
to trigger her memory.

409
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:11,049
Hold on, Yu.

410
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:12,884
Can you first tell us

411
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,720
where you learned about these things?

412
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:18,014
Like the relationship between Jen-yao
and Hsiao-tung,

413
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:20,433
and the people who hurt her.

414
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:23,686
How do I even start?

415
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:25,313
Yu,

416
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:27,440
have you found Chiang Hsiao-tung?

417
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:30,234
What?

418
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:31,778
Isn't she already dead?

419
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:34,489
Didn't you two find out
about Chiang Hsiao-tung

420
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,532
because Yu was possessed by a ghost?

421
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,326
No, listen.

422
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,745
If you follow Yu's train of thought,

423
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:43,539
everything Li Jen-yao did

424
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,959
was not only to avenge Chiang Hsiao-tung

425
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,754
but also to protect her,

426
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:52,006
so she wouldn't remember
those things, right?

427
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:52,965
What does it mean?

428
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,677
Chiang Hsiao-tung isn't dead!

429
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:02,433
Is she still alive somewhere?

430
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:12,068
Wait.

431
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:15,446
If

432
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:19,367
Li Jen-yao had risked so much
to hide Chiang Hsiao-tung,

433
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,494
he would never tell you all this.

434
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,123
Hsu Ta-wei.

435
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:32,213
Hey, besides, I've watched that video.

436
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,133
No one else's face was shown,

437
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:37,468
except Chiang Hsiao-tung's.

438
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:38,803
What does it mean?

439
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:41,806
She was the only one
who could have told you about it.

440
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:48,312
Yu.

441
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:51,357
You two have met, right?

442
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:56,612
Yes.

443
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:58,990
Everything you just said is correct.

444
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,867
Chiang Hsiao-tung

445
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,494
told me all this.

446
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:04,996
Hey, then,

447
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,665
can you arrange for us to meet?

448
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:11,085
Strictly speaking,

449
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:14,505
I'm trying to figure out
a way for you guys to meet.

450
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,357
What's on your mind?

451
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,365
Do you think

452
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,701
what Yu said earlier

453
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,036
is true?

454
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:52,960
Hey.

455
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:55,755
Do you remember

456
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:58,341
when we first made it
into the Taipei Film Festival?

457
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:02,011
How could I possibly forget?

458
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,598
We were supposed to receive
our award that day.

459
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:08,226
But we ended up at the police station.

460
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:09,977
<i>What was the honk for?</i>

461
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,188
What was that? Get out of the car.

462
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:15,191
Get out! Why are you being
a coward now? Get out!

463
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:17,276
Hsu Ta-wei, you're not getting out.

464
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,278
I'll call the cops. Let them handle it.

465
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:20,196
Honking nonstop!

466
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,366
You kept honking.
What the hell was that for? Get out!

467
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:25,534
-Hsu Ta-wei! You--
-Get out!

468
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:26,827
Get out.

469
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,329
Don't think I won't hit you.

470
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,420
Stop!

471
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:37,964
Stop!

472
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:39,799
Hsu Ta-wei!

473
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:42,093
Hsu Ta-wei, what are you doing?
Hsu Ta-wei!

474
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:44,303
Hsu Ta-wei!

475
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:46,514
Hsu Ta-wei!

476
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:57,858
I lied to you.

477
00:37:58,734 --> 00:37:59,902
What do you mean?

478
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:01,237
I don't get it.

479
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:11,038
He dropped the charges against me

480
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:15,209
because after we got
to the police station,

481
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,669
he recognized who I was.

482
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:19,463
You knew each other?

483
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,804
I left the car and beat him up,

484
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,057
not because he blocked us in,

485
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:31,976
but because he was…

486
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:39,775
the one who raped my sister…

487
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:43,821
and drove her to suicide.

488
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,620
I could never forget

489
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,790
that, in court,

490
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,084
he knelt on the floor

491
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:59,295
and said tearfully,

492
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:02,048
"Please forgive me."

493
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,676
"I know I made a mistake."

494
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,888
"I will turn over a new leaf."

495
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:19,231
<i>I could never forget</i>
<i>the way my sister died.</i>

496
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,234
<i>None of us said we would forgive him.</i>

497
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,530
But the court

498
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,950
was swayed by his damn crocodile tears.

499
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,746
They believed he was truly remorseful

500
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:36,374
and still had a conscience.

501
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:40,628
Not to mention he was a minor.

502
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,297
Fuck.

503
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:46,801
He… only did a few years and was released.

504
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,356
Since the day

505
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:03,901
I left the courthouse,

506
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,028
you know,

507
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,906
I have been so angry.

508
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,575
I'm still furious.

509
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:17,248
That's why I wanted to film Li Jen-yao.

510
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:21,252
Why film that murderer?

511
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:31,595
I was thinking that if it was
because I couldn't release my rage,

512
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:34,849
then maybe I could use my documentary

513
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:37,810
to let others see

514
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:41,814
and understand the hatred inside me.

515
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:55,578
TALENTED HIGH SCHOOL BALLERINA VERSUS SIX

516
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:02,126
TALENTED HIGH SCHOOL BALLERINA VERSUS SIX

517
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:17,558
But I could never have imagined
that the only person in the world…

518
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:24,648
who could understand my pain

519
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:27,776
would actually be Li Jen-yao.

520
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:26,669
Chiang Hsiao-tung, I know you can hear me.

521
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,193
These past few days,

522
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:55,364
I've been watching Li Jen-yao's interview.

523
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:01,120
I also secretly went to see your parents.

524
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:11,130
I didn't know what was going on back then…

525
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:15,175
so I didn't feel much.

526
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:19,722
Now that I've experienced
everything you went through…

527
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,352
seeing them

528
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:28,355
made my heart ache.

529
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:35,654
But I couldn't tell

530
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,532
if that was your pain or mine.

531
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:43,495
Hsiao-tung.

532
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:45,831
Let me ask you.

533
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:49,335
Are you sure
you don't want to see Li Jen-yao?

534
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:54,173
Because I know you do.

535
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:59,428
That's why you took my computer then
and looked up what happened to Li Jen-yao.

536
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:02,556
And after learning
that he was put on death row,

537
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,683
you wanted to see him one last time.

538
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:07,102
Were you crying?

539
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,229
<i>That wasn't me.</i>

540
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,648
<i>It was her.</i>

541
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:13,525
LI JEN-YAO

542
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,861
Why did she look up Li Jen-yao?

543
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:17,988
What's their relationship?

544
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,119
I don't know why you backed out later.

545
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:28,082
But I know you want to see Li Jen-yao.

546
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:31,794
That's why you told me
all about the two of you.

547
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:35,422
You want me to protect him and help him

548
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:36,924
on your behalf.

549
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:39,176
But you should know

550
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:42,596
that, although I am happy
to face anything for you,

551
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,723
there's one thing

552
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:46,850
I can never do for you.

553
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:48,811
That is…

554
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:55,192
I'm not the person
Li Jen-yao wants to see.

555
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:16,296
Just like you,

556
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:18,632
all these years,

557
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,009
the person Li Jen-yao wants to see most

558
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:23,470
has always been you.

559
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:28,350
No matter how you've changed,

560
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,687
he still only wants to see you.

561
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,706
TO LI JEN-YAO

562
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:44,504
CHIANG HSIAO-TUNG

563
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:47,382
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE

564
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:31,653
Hey, Li Jen-yao.

PLANNER: CHOU PIN-YU

567
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:38,887
It's about time. So…

568
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:45,435
Will you… come again?

569
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:49,022
I will come again.

570
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:20,595
Dummy.

571
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:23,431
I've missed you so much.

572
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,019
Me too.
