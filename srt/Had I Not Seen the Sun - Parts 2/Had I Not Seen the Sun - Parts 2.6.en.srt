1
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,169
Have you seen a ghost?

2
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:29,798
Hey, Yu.

3
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,674
Chou Pin-yu!

4
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:47,524
Hello, Chi-chi.

5
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:48,900
I received your gift.

6
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,568
Thank you.

7
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,403
Hey.

8
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:54,823
You didn't invite me over when you moved?

9
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,157
How's it going?

10
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,786
Not bad. Things are going smoothly.

11
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,011
The view from your place…

12
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:17,929
…is so beautiful.

13
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:19,848
Looking at it cheers me up.

14
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,908
Wanna play with me?

15
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:58,506
HAD I NOT SEEN THE SUN

16
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,302
NOVEMBER 2014

17
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,511
Tell me.

18
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,724
At least you're real, yeah?

19
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:35,918
Kiss me.

20
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,110
If…

21
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:07,784
I can… never see again…

22
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,414
will you still stay by my side,

23
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:15,875
just like this?

24
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,176
Yes.

25
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:09,720
Do you want to know… everything?

26
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:16,519
<i>No, I don't.</i>

27
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,647
<i>I don't want to know anything.</i>

28
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,135
Tien-ching.

29
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,144
What was with you yesterday?

30
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:00,605
What happened?

31
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:04,150
It's nothing.

32
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:07,778
Just something at work

33
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,447
that made me sad.

34
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,658
I didn't scare you yesterday, did I?

35
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,791
No. You didn't.

36
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,472
If anything ever upsets you,

37
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,891
you can tell me.

38
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:45,149
Don't worry about me.
I feel better after some rest.

39
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,159
Hi.

40
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,496
I'm Hsiao-tung's high school classmate.

41
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,334
I'm Hsiao-tung's
high school classmate. Today…

42
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:06,254
I'm just about to go to Hsiao-tung's.

43
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,509
Her appetite hasn't been great
the past two days.

44
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:14,011
She didn't finish the food I made.

45
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:18,432
So I'm going to the market to see
if there's anything she likes to eat.

46
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,227
I know.

47
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,646
How can I ask her now

48
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,898
if she fought with that Li Jen-yao?

49
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:26,941
Goodness, please.

50
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,057
LIN'S EATERY

51
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,768
Sure, have a seat.
Help yourselves to drinks.

52
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:48,898
Have a seat.

53
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,274
The menu is on the table.

54
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,736
Sir, it's my first time here.
Any recommendations?

55
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:58,991
You were our class leader, Lai Yun-chen.

56
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,869
You are… Lin Meng-hung.

57
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:04,080
LIN'S EATERY

58
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,707
Who do you still keep in touch with
from our class?

59
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,502
Now, just

60
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,295
Chuang Jung-tai and Chen Che-li.

61
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:18,511
You were close to Ouyang Ti, Fan Wei-ting,
and Wang Yu-hsiang too, weren't you?

62
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,096
Don't you talk to them now?

63
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,766
I grew up.

64
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:25,518
We're not the same.

65
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:27,895
We live our own lives.

66
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,694
What do Che-li and Jung-tai do now?

67
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:38,030
Che-li is working at a tech company
in Taoyuan.

68
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:41,701
Jung-tai is a PE teacher
at our old school.

69
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,244
Many girls like him.

70
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,330
And I just…

71
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:48,666
You're doing well.

72
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,252
You're your own boss.

73
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:52,795
No one can mistreat you.

74
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:54,672
You're right.

75
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,717
I didn't expect everyone
to be doing so well.

76
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,886
Not everyone.

77
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,598
Wei-ting was hunted down
by gangsters a while ago.

78
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:07,309
Really?

79
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,019
You didn't see it on the news?

80
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,521
Why did he become a gangster?

81
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:11,939
Gosh, he wouldn't listen.

82
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:15,443
He liked to hang out
with Ouyang and Fatty.

83
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:18,779
It was bound to happen.
He bit off more than he could chew.

84
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,115
I don't want to talk about it.

85
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,959
-Be careful.
-Okay.

86
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:04,241
Thank you.

87
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,202
Tell me when you're done.

88
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,244
I'll pick you up.

89
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:08,788
No need.

90
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,832
I've already asked Mr. Chiang
to pick me up today.

91
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:12,917
Well then,

92
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,211
I'll come over later.

93
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:17,421
Okay.

94
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,423
I'll go up, then.

95
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:20,758
Okay.

96
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,455
MIGHTY GOOD CLEANING

97
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,373
Hey, baby.

98
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:56,168
Why are a few bottles
of blood stain remover missing?

99
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,796
How would I know? You take inventory.

100
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:02,174
Did you not write
"4" and "9" properly again?

101
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,843
"4" and "9"?

102
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:10,224
49, 949, 49, 949.

103
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,517
I'll recheck it for you.

104
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,560
Okay.

105
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,144
It's almost time.

106
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,272
I'll pick up Kidney Bean
from school first.

107
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,189
Okay.

108
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,576
What?

109
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:34,081
Nothing. I'm leaving.

110
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,292
Just so you know.

111
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,255
I'll pay you next week.

112
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,884
What are you going to do next?

113
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,219
I'm not sure yet.

114
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,472
Seriously.

115
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,976
If you're not sure yet, just work here.

116
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,895
What's a few more days or months?

117
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,605
You think I'd treat you badly?

118
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:00,983
Whatever.

119
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:02,735
All right. I'm going.

120
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,953
Do you still remember
your classmate, Fan or Chuang?

121
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,664
Anyway, he was
one of your trashy classmates.

122
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:21,253
I heard from a friend that your classmate
was killed by gangsters out to get him.

123
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,297
But just you wait.

124
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,883
This case will be shut down soon.

125
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,385
What do you mean exactly?

126
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,181
This means

127
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,683
God is watching.

128
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,227
If prison doesn't do its job, God will.

129
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,897
So just forget the past.

130
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,859
If you want to leave, fine.

131
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,695
But live well.

132
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:47,821
Just like me.

133
00:15:58,874 --> 00:15:59,708
I get it.

134
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,713
Thanks for everything during this time.

135
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,553
MIGHTY GOOD CLEANING SERVICES

136
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,813
What's up with that kid?

137
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:29,321
In a moment, after the opening,
we'll introduce Mr. Ho and Ms. Chu.

138
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:32,241
Don't be nervous.
Tien-ching will take care of you.

139
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,204
Tien-ching, what's wrong?

140
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,167
Okay, let's get ready.

141
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,814
Welcome to <i>New Life with Classical</i>.

142
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,367
I'm sorry, I got tongue-tied.
One more time.

143
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,704
<i>Let's start again. Ready.</i>

144
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:57,159
Welcome to <i>New Life with Classical</i>.

145
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:58,952
I'm Hsia Tien-ching.

146
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:03,499
We're honored to have
two classical pianists here today

147
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:08,712
to discuss
when they first got into classical music

148
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:11,799
and when they started
learning to play the piano.

149
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:28,982
Ms. Hsia.

150
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,490
It's me, Mr. Chiang.
I'm here to pick you up.

151
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,534
The car is over there. Let me take you.

152
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,535
Here.

153
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,215
Be careful.

154
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,522
Ms. Hsia.

155
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:11,900
You know, these days, before I go out,

156
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,945
I always check to see
how my wife is feeling

157
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:17,197
to decide if I should bring an umbrella.

158
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,699
Hey, I mean it.

159
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,451
My wife's mood

160
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:25,289
is so in sync with Taipei City's weather.

161
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:26,707
It's true.

162
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:30,169
If she scolds me
or throws a fit in the morning,

163
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:33,463
there's going to be
storms, rain, and thunder that day.

164
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:34,840
It's scary.

165
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,134
However,

166
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:40,137
if she smiles when I leave,

167
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:44,224
it's going to be sunny
the whole day for sure.

168
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:45,809
The bigger her smile…

169
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:46,810
CHIANG CHIH-CHENG

170
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,061
…the brighter the sun.

171
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,147
That's why I say

172
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,524
we're meant to be married.

173
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,391
Mr. Chuang.

174
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,060
Why haven't you left yet?

175
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:28,977
Right.

176
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:33,398
I'm substituting for Mr. Chang tomorrow,
so I'm cramming before class.

177
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:36,568
I'll leave you to it.
You can take care of the lights.

178
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:37,903
-No problem.
-Okay, bye.

179
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,696
-Bye, get home safe.
-Okay.

180
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,343
Hello, Lin Meng-hung?

181
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,428
Did you read about Fan Wei-ting?

182
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:05,889
We thought the same thing.

183
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,058
He must've crossed the line
with his affairs.

184
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,185
That's why he died so tragically.

185
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,480
Ms. Hsia.

186
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,941
-You're back?
-Yes.

187
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,778
It's been raining for two days.
Your clothes just wouldn't dry.

188
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,697
I've put them in the dryer.

189
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:25,284
Also, I'm thinking,
since it's getting colder,

190
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:28,704
I'll organize your clothes
the next time I come

191
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,373
and change your wardrobe for the season.

192
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:47,347
I'll leave if that's all.

193
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,974
-Okay.
-Bye.

194
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,810
Ms. Chou, wait.

195
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:54,938
What is it?

196
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,359
Can I ask

197
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:01,611
your full name?

198
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:03,864
My name?

199
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:04,906
Yeah.

200
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,616
I was just thinking

201
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,077
you've been helping me out
for a long time,

202
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,705
but I don't think
I've ever asked your name.

203
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,915
My name is Chou Mei-yun.

204
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,085
-Chou Mei-yun.
-Yes.

205
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,963
"Mei" as in "beautiful."
"Yun" as in "clouds."

206
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,506
Common and easy to remember.

207
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,052
I'll leave, then.

208
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,262
-Okay. Bye.
-All right, bye.

209
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,565
CHOU PIN-YU
DATE OF BIRTH: JULY 23, YEAR 1990

210
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:46,114
FATHER: CHIANG CHIH-CHENG
MOTHER: CHOU MEI-YUN

211
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:05,133
Ms. Chou, is that you?

212
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,070
Who are you looking for?

213
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:27,489
Is Chiang Hsiao-tung here?

214
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:30,409
No one by that name here.

215
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:31,785
Wait.

216
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:33,954
You're Chiang Hsiao-tung, right?

217
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:35,747
No, I'm not.

218
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,249
You've got the wrong person.

219
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,292
Chiang Hsiao-tung.

220
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,920
Chiang Hsiao-tung, I know it's you.

221
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,923
Don't act like this. Hear me out, okay?

222
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:47,676
I don't know what you want.
Just leave, okay?

223
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:51,221
I told you. I'm not her,
and I don't know who she is.

224
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:53,306
I know you don't want to see me again.

225
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:56,852
I also know why you say
you aren't Chiang Hsiao-tung.

226
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,228
But don't do this.

227
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,272
Let me finish.

228
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:03,900
Give me a chance to apologize
for what happened back then, okay?

229
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,152
Listen to me.

230
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,988
I really didn't want to do that
at the time.

231
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:11,575
I only did it

232
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:14,703
because Ouyang Ti
and the others forced me.

233
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:16,580
I'm sorry.

234
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:19,249
I'm sincerely sorry about it.

235
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,919
<i>I know I can't make up for my mistake,</i>
<i>no matter what I say.</i>

236
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,338
But… believe me, okay?

237
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,425
I hate them as much as you do.

238
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,511
Really, I hate them.

239
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,930
They wanted to stop me
from talking about what happened.

240
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,766
<i>-Stop. I don't want to listen.</i>
-They gave me drugs.

241
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,478
They forced me to do
those unspeakable things to you.

242
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:42,022
<i>-I don't want to know.</i>
-…bastards like them.

243
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:43,773
<i>I don't want to know anything.</i>

244
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:45,692
That wasn't me.

245
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:48,028
-I really didn't want to do it.
<i>-Stop.</i>

246
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,530
-Believe me, okay?
<i>-I don't want to know.</i>

247
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,699
I know I was wrong.

248
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:54,659
I really do.

249
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,036
I said stop.

250
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,496
Will you forgive me?

251
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:08,924
Hsiao-tung.

252
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:14,095
Hsiao-tung.

253
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,438
Are you done?

254
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:29,861
If you're really sorry, then drop dead.

255
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,659
Tien-ching, calm down.

256
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:44,626
Run! Run away!

257
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:45,794
I will find you.

258
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,128
I'll find all of you!

259
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,922
I'll kill every single one of you!

260
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:58,473
Do you know you're really hurting my arm?

261
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:28,086
Tien-ching.

262
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:31,381
What happened just now?

263
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:42,767
Li Jen-yao.

264
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,313
Could you be any more spineless?

265
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,816
Didn't you know
that they raped Chiang Hsiao-tung?

266
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:51,067
And yet you let him go.

267
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:53,403
If you're too weak to kill, fine.

268
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:55,780
But why did you stop me?

269
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,704
You deserve to rot
more than anyone else, you know?

270
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:04,539
If it hadn't been for you,

271
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,334
Hsiao-tung wouldn't have been raped
by those scumbags.

272
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:09,544
She suffered so much because of you!

273
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:11,129
And you?

274
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,839
What did you do?

275
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,883
Nothing at all!

276
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:21,681
How dare you show your face
to Hsia Tien-ching!

277
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:24,559
How dare you let her fall for you?

278
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:28,980
If they hadn't met you,
they wouldn't have suffered.

279
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,607
It's all your fault.

280
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,317
Everything is your fault.

281
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,569
You won't hurt her again.

282
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,325
So fucking go to hell.

283
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,293
Tien-ching, are you okay?

284
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,879
Please don't open the door.

285
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:19,174
I don't know how I can face you now.
I'm sorry.

286
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,181
I'm sorry.

287
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,686
I don't know what got into me.

288
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:36,941
I don't know why I did that to you.

289
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:40,153
I don't know
why I said those things either.

290
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:44,532
I really don't know what happened.

291
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,615
Are you still there?

292
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,370
Yes.

293
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:14,789
I'm here.

294
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,044
Can I ask you a question?

295
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,047
Go ahead.

296
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:30,597
When we first met…

297
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,767
didn't you mistake me for someone else?

298
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,022
At that time…

299
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,484
did you call me

300
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,029
Chiang Hsiao-tung?

301
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:52,660
Yes.

302
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:59,542
So you thought I was Chiang Hsiao-tung?

303
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,259
Yes.

304
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:16,976
So later on, you called me…

305
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:20,813
hung out with me,

306
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:22,357
spent time with me,

307
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,193
started dating me,

308
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,571
and told me you liked me…

309
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,535
It was all because…

310
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:42,585
you saw me as a stand-in
for Chiang Hsiao-tung?

311
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:13,700
Yes.

312
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:28,047
<i>Li Jen-yao.</i>

313
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:30,717
<i>What's the matter?</i>

314
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:33,761
<i>Do you like me?</i>

315
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:37,515
<i>Yes.</i>

316
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,600
<i>Really?</i>

317
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:42,145
<i>Really.</i>

318
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,481
<i>Will you</i>

319
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,900
<i>suddenly stop liking me one day?</i>

320
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,528
<i>Will you suddenly disappear one day?</i>

321
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:54,240
<i>Impossible.</i>

322
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,077
<i>How can you be so sure?</i>

323
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,330
<i>Because</i>

324
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,417
<i>I finally found you.</i>

325
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,044
<i>So</i>

326
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:08,796
<i>I'll never leave you.</i>

327
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,257
<i>Ever.</i>

328
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,203
Tien-ching.

329
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:27,458
Tien-ching.

330
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:43,850
Hey.

331
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,269
Does this look very painful?

332
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,193
I'll tell you a secret.

333
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:57,071
Compared to the pain you brought them,

334
00:35:58,364 --> 00:35:59,949
this is nothing at all.

335
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:10,084
Why can't you just go away?

336
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:12,503
Why must you use your affection

337
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,797
to remind her now

338
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:17,675
that she's damaged,
that she'll never recover,

339
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:19,093
and that she'll never be

340
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:22,096
the same Chiang Hsiao-tung she was
before she met you?

341
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,907
So she won't be in Taipei
next week, right?

342
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,868
I'll reschedule, then.

343
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:45,786
I see.

344
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:49,707
Then let's arrange a time to meet
after Lisa returns to Taipei.

345
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,502
Okay. Bye.

346
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:50,977
-Flatten it.
-Ma'am, is business good?

347
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,270
Mr. Chuang.

348
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,398
How nice of you to ask.
It's been the same as usual.

349
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:56,816
What brings you here?

350
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:59,860
Oh, I was in the area,
so I thought I'd visit you and Hsuan.

351
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,821
Thank you so much

352
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:04,240
for looking out for Hsuan.

353
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,285
It's nothing.
She's so smart and independent.

354
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:08,494
She's fine on her own.

355
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:09,912
Don't hold back.

356
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:12,832
If Hsuan doesn't behave,
you can smack her.

357
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:14,125
Really, you can smack her.

358
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:16,085
Nah, times have changed.

359
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:18,170
Corporal punishment is banned now.

360
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:21,257
If I do that
and the Education Ministry finds out,

361
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,508
I'll be in trouble, right?

362
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:28,723
Ma'am, do you mind
if I borrow Hsuan for a bit?

363
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,266
It's something for school.

364
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:31,726
No problem.

365
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:33,978
Hsuan, your teacher needs you.

366
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:35,688
I'll handle it here.

367
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:36,939
Go with him.

368
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,107
Go.

369
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:10,848
You really haven't learned.

370
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,684
You thought going to
the ministry would work

371
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,270
when reporting me to the school didn't?

372
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,065
-I don't follow.
-Stop pretending.

373
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:21,108
The school already told me

374
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,319
you reported me to the ministry

375
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:26,489
for unfair treatment
and corporal punishment.

376
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:29,325
The director specifically asked me
to come and talk to you.

377
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:30,951
Don't you get it?

378
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,287
Why do I only target you at school?

379
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,707
Think about your attitude at school.

380
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:40,127
Not to mention your parents
are in jail for drug use and fraud.

381
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,046
Forget about the teachers at school,

382
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:45,174
I bet no one in your class even likes you.

383
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,979
Do you know what I dislike most about you?

384
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:03,234
You know how poor your family is
and how cheap you are,

385
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:06,320
yet you still fucking give me
those condescending looks.

386
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:10,950
As your teacher,

387
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,786
I'll show you
what it means to know your place.

388
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:15,663
When it's time to bow,

389
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:17,665
you'd better bow.

390
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:19,375
I don't get it.

391
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:22,002
How can someone so lousy become a teacher?

392
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:34,890
You're scared?

393
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:36,642
So you know fear?

394
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,522
Go ahead, be cockier.

395
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:42,940
Just you wait.

396
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:45,734
I could fucking pin
a few random things on you next week.

397
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:48,654
When the school asks your grandma
to withdraw you from school,

398
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:50,906
let's see if you're still cocky.

399
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,821
That's a tough pill to swallow, isn't it?

400
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:35,826
If so,

401
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:38,579
let me help you make things right.

402
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:48,964
Hello, honey?

403
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:50,633
Hello? Chen Che-li.

404
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:53,010
Where exactly are you?

405
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:55,012
I'm already in the parking lot.

406
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,515
I'll be there in about ten minutes.

407
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:00,643
<i>You say that every time.</i>
<i>Do you care about this or not?</i>

408
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:03,312
<i>Don't you dare drink with your friends</i>
<i>behind my back again.</i>

409
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:05,981
Okay, don't worry. I'm by the car.

410
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,525
I'll be right there.

411
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,360
<i>How much longer do I have to wait?</i>

412
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,862
<i>Your head injury just healed.</i>
<i>Don't you remember?</i>

413
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:18,035
<i>Hello? Do you hear me?</i>

414
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,538
<i>Hello, Chen Che-li?</i>

415
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:21,997
<i>Hello?</i>

416
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,291
<i>Hello, Chen Che-li?</i>

417
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,878
<i>I'm talking to you. Did you hear me?</i>

418
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,005
<i>Chen Che-li.</i>

419
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,384
<i>Chen Che-li, stop joking.</i>

420
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:34,927
<i>This isn't funny at all.</i>

421
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:36,720
<i>Chen Che-li.</i>

422
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:38,639
<i>Chen Che-li.</i>

423
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:41,392
<i>Chen Che-li, what's wrong?</i>

424
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,019
<i>Chen Che-li!</i>

425
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:46,146
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

426
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:47,815
<i>Hello?</i>

427
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:50,359
<i>Chen Che-li, what exactly--</i>

428
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:28,191
