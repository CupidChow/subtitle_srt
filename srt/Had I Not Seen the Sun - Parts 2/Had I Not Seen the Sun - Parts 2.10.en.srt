1
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,680
Hey, Pin-yu.

2
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:54,512
Yun-chen.

3
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:58,558
I'm sorry.

4
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:01,936
Did I make you wait long?

5
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,030
Not at all.

6
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,417
Hsiao-tung.

7
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:27,378
Let's go.

8
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,224
Mom.

9
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:18,990
I'm sorry.

10
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,785
I'm sorry.

11
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:37,795
HAD I NOT SEEN THE SUN

12
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,592
Did you like the snack
I brought last time?

13
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,260
Was it too sweet?

14
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,306
No.

15
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,807
It was delicious.

16
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:55,396
I wonder if visitation
is allowed on Christmas.

17
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,400
If it is…

18
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,738
we can spend Christmas together.

19
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,907
Even if visitation is allowed,

20
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:07,492
you don't

21
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,453
have to come see me that day.

22
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,125
Why?

23
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,878
Isn't

24
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,924
Christmas meant to be joyful?

25
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,927
I don't want you…

26
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,472
to be sad that day.

27
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,100
Hey, Li Jen-yao.

28
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,143
What are you talking about?

29
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,980
I would only be sad
if I couldn't see you, okay?

30
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,065
But even if we met…

31
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,152
would you feel any better?

32
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,407
Right now,

33
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,160
just being able to look into your eyes

34
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:54,288
and hear your voice

35
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:58,876
makes me… happy.

36
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,421
But then

37
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:04,799
waiting to see you again

38
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,761
feels tougher and longer.

39
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:14,559
While I hope time can go by faster,

40
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,978
I'm scared it will fly by.

41
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:21,858
I'm… afraid of dying

42
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,068
the day before we're supposed to meet.

43
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,655
I'm afraid of making you sad.

44
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,075
The last thing I want to see now…

45
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,205
is you being sad.

46
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,500
Stop coming here.

47
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,963
Stop wasting time on me.

48
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,551
The only thing I want to do now

49
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,721
is to make you happy.

50
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:54,765
But…

51
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,936
I can't do that at all.

52
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:04,859
So at least

53
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,571
don't be sad because of me.

54
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,824
Okay?

55
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:27,965
Is that why…

56
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,845
you refuse to have a lawyer
request a retrial?

57
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,432
I read the information Pin-yu found.

58
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,018
It says

59
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:44,565
many death row inmates file for retrials

60
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:47,068
to delay execution.

61
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,196
But you haven't.

62
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,699
You won't let anyone else
file one for you either.

63
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,786
Why?

64
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:02,917
Do you think
I'm wasting my time by visiting you?

65
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:07,463
Hsiao-tung.

66
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,841
I was never innocent.

67
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:14,554
I killed many people.

68
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,227
I deserve the death penalty.

69
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,114
How can you go back on your word?

70
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,535
You said whatever happens,

71
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,746
you would always be with me.

72
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,541
You wouldn't let go of my hand easily.

73
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,461
Have you forgotten all that?

74
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,466
Even if this is
the only way we can meet now,

75
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,054
at least I know you're here,

76
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,889
and you haven't left me all alone.

77
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,895
As long as I'm allowed to visit,
I'll come.

78
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,065
I'll come every single time.

79
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,153
I'll come on Christmas too.

80
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:16,449
Don't call it a waste of time again.

81
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,876
WE FILM PRODUCTIONS

82
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:16,378
Let me ask again.

83
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:21,091
Are you sure
you want to use our documentary

84
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:26,013
to share everything you've been through
with the public?

85
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,393
I'm sure.

86
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:36,148
Although I can't change
what has already happened,

87
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:41,445
if I'm willing to speak about it
so that more people understand Li Jen-yao,

88
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,657
maybe there's a chance…

89
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,119
to reduce his sentence.

90
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:52,498
But Li Jen-yao's death sentence
has been finalized.

91
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,627
Is this really going to change anything?

92
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,085
I'm sorry, Ta-wei.

93
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,254
Let's take a break.

94
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:49,221
It's me, Yu. I'll speak for Hsiao-tung
since she can't do it.

95
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,850
Although getting the public
to understand Li Jen-yao

96
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,477
will not suffice
to get an appeal or a retrial,

97
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,105
we can use Chiang Hsiao-tung's interview

98
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,107
to sway public opinion.

99
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,736
She can then convince Li Jen-yao
to let a lawyer help

100
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:06,530
and file an extraordinary appeal
or something.

101
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:10,451
Maybe there's a chance
it could delay his execution.

102
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:12,453
But…

103
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:17,041
In that case,

104
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:20,127
everyone would be talking about

105
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,004
Chiang Hsiao-tung's rape again.

106
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:27,092
Is Chiang Hsiao-tung
mentally prepared to face all that?

107
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,470
Look, when she was speaking,

108
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,347
didn't you get the feeling

109
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,892
she still has the maturity of a teenager?

110
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,688
Are you sure
she can really handle all this?

111
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:46,612
Anyway, we've decided
to cancel production.

112
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:48,989
Um, so naturally,

113
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,700
there's no investment anymore.

114
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,995
Uh, we're terminating our arrangement.

115
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,707
Do whatever you want.

116
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,170
I just want to know

117
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:06,840
if Li Jen-yao told you anything about…

118
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,304
my son?

119
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:15,265
Uh,

120
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,101
no.

121
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,394
Honestly,

122
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,105
we're canceling production

123
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,941
mostly because he wouldn't say
anything about the case,

124
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:27,695
including how the conflict
with your son started

125
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,947
or why he killed him.

126
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,782
He never said a word.

127
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,127
Okay, then,

128
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,337
I'll let you get some rest.

129
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,140
Mrs. Ouyang.

130
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,392
I'll be honest.

131
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,310
You should be relieved

132
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,271
we canceled production.

133
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,774
Based on the information I gathered,

134
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,609
I personally believe

135
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:11,071
that neither your son nor you

136
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:14,283
are as innocent as everyone says.

137
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,161
Right?

138
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:27,629
We'll be going.

139
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:31,884
DIAMOND SUTRA

140
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:41,143
-Hey, Hsu Ta-wei, what was that?
-Huh?

141
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,979
Why didn't you give me a heads-up
about something so important?

142
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,733
Hasn't Chiang Hsiao-tung agreed
to let us interview her

143
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:51,445
so that she could use this documentary
to delay Li Jen-yao's execution?

144
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:54,990
If we cancel the film,
what's Li Jen-yao going to do?

145
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:57,910
Yeah, I know.

146
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:02,331
I saw Li Jen-yao
before meeting this old bat today.

147
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,625
You met Li Jen-yao?

148
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:08,796
No matter what I asked,

149
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:13,509
he insisted that what he did
had nothing to do with Chiang Hsiao-tung.

150
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,928
Although he won't say it,

151
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:18,305
it's so obvious

152
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,432
that, even now,

153
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:23,018
he's still doing his best
to protect Chiang Hsiao-tung.

154
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,187
Think about it.

155
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,564
If Chiang Hsiao-tung's story

156
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,650
becomes known to the public

157
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:32,945
because of our documentary, what happens?

158
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,909
Li Jen-yao might be able
to delay his death sentence.

159
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:42,454
But the media won't leave
Chiang Hsiao-tung alone.

160
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,747
Not just the media.

161
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,166
Everyone will come after her.

162
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,919
Her video will resurface.

163
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:52,381
The animosity that drove her to despair

164
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,716
will rear its ugly head again.

165
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,969
Should a victim have to endure that?

166
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,771
Hey, you didn't happen to say no

167
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,190
to that commercial project,

168
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:12,484
did you?

169
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:17,489
I'll take it.

170
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,993
Fuck this Li Jen-yao project.

171
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,369
What a waste of money.

172
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,247
I'll sort it out.

173
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,473
<i>Did he really say that?</i>

174
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,058
Yes.

175
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,144
In his statement,

176
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,354
Li Jen-yao said

177
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,858
he heard the door open
at the time of the murder.

178
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,028
Based on your statement,

179
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,030
it matches when you came home.

180
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:03,160
That means you arrived home
when he was committing the murder.

181
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:07,080
To stop your son from crying out for help,

182
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,874
he covered his mouth and nose

183
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,501
until he died from suffocation.

184
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,365
There's one thing

185
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,368
I want to ask you.

186
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,038
What is it?

187
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,376
You know what I want to ask.

188
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,254
Hurry.

189
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,090
Hurry.

190
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,634
Hurry.

191
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,637
You're the most useless, you know?

192
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,476
Why didn't you kill him?

193
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,270
Speak.

194
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:56,356
You're the most useless!

195
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:00,402
It's all because of you! You're useless!

196
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,738
<i>You're trash!</i>

197
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,114
Mom!

198
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:20,088
Be good.

199
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,133
Hang in there.

200
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:26,178
It'll stop hurting soon.

201
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,602
<i>Speak.</i>

202
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:35,437
<i>Answer me!</i>

203
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,646
<i>Whose fault is it?</i>

204
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,982
<i>It's all because of you, isn't it?</i>

205
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,109
<i>You're looking down on me!</i>

206
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,112
<i>What are you looking at? Speak.</i>

207
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,697
<i>Speak!</i>

208
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,116
<i>I turned out this way</i>

209
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:49,701
<i>because of you.</i>

210
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,828
<i>It's all because of you.</i>

211
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,289
<i>It's all because of you!</i>

212
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:13,850
Be good.

213
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:18,814
It's over now.

214
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:28,698
Come here.

215
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:37,749
It's over now.

216
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,045
It's over now.

217
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:23,503
That's how it's hummed, right?

218
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,590
You saw everything.

219
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:29,301
Then why…

220
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,558
Because it's better this way.

221
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,313
What could hurt more

222
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:44,733
than ruining your most precious baby

223
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:50,363
and living in fear every day?

224
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,373
OUYANG HSIANG

225
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:43,959
I, Ouyang Hsiang,

226
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:47,587
speak for all the victims' families

227
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,881
when I say our ruling party…

228
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,049
ENFORCE DEATH PENALTY BY LAW

229
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:53,468
…is, in essence,
an accomplice of serial killer Li Jen-yao!

230
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,637
How long has it been since his sentence?

231
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,223
Why hasn't he been executed yet?

232
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:00,308
Has he asked for a constitutional review?

233
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,561
Has he asked for a retrial?

234
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:05,730
Has he filed an extraordinary appeal?

235
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:06,940
No.

236
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:10,694
In that case,
I want to ask the Ministry of Justice

237
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:14,573
why you haven't carried out
his death sentence?

238
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:20,537
I'm asking the ruling party
to bring justice to the victims' families!

239
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:34,843
1027.

240
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:47,647
Here. Someone sent you a Christmas gift.

241
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,403
We were meant to remove the wrapping.

242
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:56,114
But after I checked the package,
I wrapped it up again.

243
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,533
So you'd get to unwrap a gift.

244
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,994
Keep this between us.

245
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:03,121
Merry Christmas.

246
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:05,790
Thank you.

247
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:24,225
Li Jen-yao.

248
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,399
The execution is in three hours.

249
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,658
I know.

250
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:27,664
What are they thinking?

251
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:29,249
Why did they choose today?

252
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:35,880
What do you want to eat? We'll prepare it.

253
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:52,021
I'd like to listen to a song.

254
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,152
Hey, Li Jen-yao.

255
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,888
1027, LI JEN-YAO

256
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:50,491

257
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,993
JEN-YAO, MERRY CHRISTMAS!

258
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:55,079
HERE'S TO OUR FIRST AND NEXT ONE TOGETHER!
HSIAO-TUNG

259
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,498
1027, LI JEN-YAO

260
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,711
<i>The execution was carried out</i>
<i>at 2:32 p.m. today.</i>

261
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:04,464
<i>The confirmed time of death is 2:49 p.m.</i>

262
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:10,720
<i>Murderer Li Jen-yao brutally took away</i>
<i>others' right to life,</i>

263
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:12,597
<i>including that of a child,</i>

264
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,641
<i>which is enshrined in the CRC.</i>

265
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:18,895
<i>Deputy Chief, was the sudden execution</i>
<i>driven by the recent press conference</i>

266
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:21,105
<i>where Legislator Ouyang</i>
<i>and victims' families</i>

267
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,024
<i>demanded it to be carried out?</i>

268
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,359
<i>Was this a political move?</i>

269
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:28,321
<i>The decision to execute was primarily</i>
<i>influenced by the criminal's motives,</i>

270
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:29,864
<i>his methods,</i>

271
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:33,242
<i>the harm caused to victims</i>
<i>and their families,</i>

272
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,745
<i>and the risk to public safety.</i>

273
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:37,830
<i>It was carried out lawfully.</i>

274
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:39,749
Hsiao-tung.

275
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,718
Jen-yao.

276
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,265
We're home.

277
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,178
Jen-yao.

278
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,184
You had it rough.

279
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,361
I'm sorry.

280
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,409
Remember,

281
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:08,661
for your next life,

282
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:14,333
choose carefully.

283
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:20,172
Make sure to choose a better mom.

284
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:39,567
Don't pick someone…

285
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:46,073
don't pick someone like me.

286
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:48,409
Do you understand?

287
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:16,997
Mrs. Li.

288
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,961
Can I take Jen-yao somewhere?

289
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,141
The three of us said we'd come back.

290
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:37,518
Today we did.

291
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,649
You must have been pretty bored
these past few years.

292
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,529
I brought you here to listen to the waves.

293
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:19,328
Li Jen-yao wrote you this letter
after the first time you met him

294
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:21,330
as Pin-yu.

295
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,904
<i>He told me to give it to you</i>

296
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:57,241
if you ever remember him.

297
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:00,327
To be honest,

298
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:03,122
I wanted to throw it away.

299
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:08,335
But I hesitated for a long time.

300
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:14,717
I think only you have the right
to decide if you want to read it.

301
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:33,360
<i>Infamous death row inmate Li Jen-yao</i>
<i>was executed for multiple murders,</i>

302
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:38,449
<i>including that of his own father</i>
<i>and an innocent child.</i>

303
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:41,869
<i>People were generally</i>
<i>in favor of his execution.</i>

304
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:45,581
<i>Almost 80% of the Taiwanese population</i>
<i>still support the death penalty after all.</i>

305
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:49,251
<i>However, Li Jen-yao's execution</i>
<i>was carried out very suddenly,</i>

306
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:51,253
<i>leading to speculation</i>

307
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:54,548
<i>that the death penalty</i>
<i>was used as a political tool.</i>

308
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,175
<i>While the debate was ongoing,</i>

309
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:59,762
<i>on April 5th, an anonymous post appeared.</i>

310
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:01,472
<i>It was titled</i>

311
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:04,308
<i>"Thank You, Li Jen-yao,</i>
<i>for Killing Those Monsters."</i>

312
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:07,728
<i>Wow. The post sparked</i>
<i>heated discussions online.</i>

313
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:10,230
<i>The person who shared it was a victim.</i>

314
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:14,193
<i>She wrote in great detail</i>
<i>about how three of Li Jen-yao's victims,</i>

315
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:17,321
<i>Ouyang Ti, Wang Yu-hsiang, Fan Wei-ting,</i>

316
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:19,907
<i>with Ouyang Ti as the mastermind,</i>

317
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:24,912
<i>used various illegal means</i>
<i>to control and coerce dozens of women</i>

318
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,997
<i>into becoming their sex slaves.</i>

319
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:30,209
<i>They used indecent videos</i>
<i>and photos to threaten victims</i>

320
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:33,879
<i>and even force them to appear in sex tapes</i>
<i>and engage in prostitution.</i>

321
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:36,965
<i>To make it worse,</i>
<i>some were controlled with drugs.</i>

322
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:40,969
<i>The victim who posted this said</i>
<i>she was underage at the time.</i>

323
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:43,263
<i>But since Ouyang Ti</i>
<i>was the son of a politician</i>

324
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,182
<i>and Wang Yu-hsiang was a rich heir,</i>

325
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:47,226
<i>she didn't dare speak out.</i>

326
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:49,687
<i>After hearing of their murders,</i>

327
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:52,481
<i>she felt truly free at last.</i>

328
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:55,192
<i>The heart-wrenching post</i>
<i>stirred public sympathy</i>

329
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:56,985
<i>and led to an official investigation,</i>

330
00:44:57,069 --> 00:45:01,115
<i>which uncovered</i>
<i>over 60 additional female victims.</i>

331
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,909
<i>The news has sparked outrage online,</i>

332
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:06,370
<i>and the public</i>
<i>is now turning its attention</i>

333
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:09,206
<i>to Ouyang Ti's father,</i>

<i>-Any comment?</i>

337
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:17,506
<i>Did you know the victims…</i>

338
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:18,841
<i>Did you know he sold drugs?</i>

339
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:21,009
<i>-How do you feel?</i>
<i>-Any words for the victims?</i>

340
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:22,636
<i>…secretly film sex tapes?</i>

362
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:05,072
-Tickets, please.
-This way.

363
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:07,741
Ticket, please. Odd numbers to the right.

364
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:11,370
JOINT DANCE SHOWCASE, NEW TAIPEI CITY

365
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:12,579
There she is.

366
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:16,708
Come on.

367
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,087
Hey, why are your hands sweaty?

368
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,588
I'm nervous.

369
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,549
Why? You're not the one dancing.

370
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:25,133
Hsiao-tung hasn't danced in ages…

371
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:27,886
What's wrong with you? Can't I be nervous?

372
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,972
Oh, fine, you're nervous. Come on.

373
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:41,733
Over there.

374
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:57,374
Most of the audience is seated.
Dancers, stand by.

375
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:01,587
Pin-yu, get ready to go on stage.

376
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:23,950
How is your new job going?

377
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:25,994
It's okay.

378
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:27,996
There's a lot of trivial work.

379
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:31,708
I manage the fan club, answer calls,

380
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:33,210
and write press releases.

381
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:34,836
Oh, I edit videos too.

382
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:39,507
When there's a performance,
I help out a lot backstage.

383
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:41,843
I feel exhausted every day.

384
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:45,305
Things were way easier
when I could just practice dancing.

385
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:49,809
-Hey.
-Hmm?

386
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:52,729
Are you really not going to keep dancing?

387
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:00,570
No, I'm not.

388
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:04,366
I enrolled in the adult ballet class

389
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:06,326
just so that

390
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:09,079
I could fulfill a promise.

391
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:23,718
Hey, Hsiao-tung, I have news.

392
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:25,220
What is it?

393
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:28,348
My mom passed the bar on to me.

394
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:29,599
She's retiring.

395
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:33,937
I'm renovating it
to make it look the way I want.

396
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:35,355
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

397
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:37,399
So what do you want it to look like?

398
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:41,027
Not sure yet.

399
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:44,656
But I want to become a barista.

400
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:45,949
I'm taking a course.

401
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:50,662
Come to my place next week
and be my guinea pig?

402
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:53,790
Sure.

403
00:54:57,585 --> 00:54:59,170
I'll go get some drinks.

404
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:00,338
What do you want?

405
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,093
Anything is fine.
I'll have whatever you get.

406
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:06,136
Okay.

407
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:17,637
<i>Hey, Li Jen-yao.</i>

408
00:59:24,602 --> 00:59:25,728
You made it.

409
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:27,105
Finally.

410
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:33,778
We said we'd spend Christmas together.

411
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:34,988
Remember?

412
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:37,490
I do.

413
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:38,783
Your first task.

414
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:40,660
Put it up there.

415
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:33,022
IF YOU OR SOMEONE YOU KNOW NEEDS SUPPORT,
THERE IS HELP.

416
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:34,982
YOU ARE NOT ALONE.

417
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:39,278
BELOW YOU CAN FIND INFORMATION
AND RESOURCES ON HOW TO GET HELP.

418
01:01:46,452 --> 01:01:47,412
Li Jen-yao!

419
01:05:58,245 --> 01:05:59,413
Lame!

420
01:06:51,757 --> 01:06:53,092
Shadow Clone <i>Jutsu</i>!

421
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:00,266
What now?

422
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:01,600
Have you seen a ghost?

423
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:03,227
Imagine this is Alice Ko.

424
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:04,812
-Imagine her face.
-Right.

425
01:07:04,895 --> 01:07:06,188
We didn't switch shots.

426
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:08,065
I'll hand her over to you.

427
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:45,311
We're on TV.

428
01:07:53,986 --> 01:07:55,362
I'm out of breath.

429
01:08:35,486 --> 01:08:36,862
Stop it! Stop.

430
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:37,988
Here.

431
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:05,599
It's a wrap!

432
01:09:05,683 --> 01:09:09,520
