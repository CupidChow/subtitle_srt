1
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,781
Don't bother going in.

2
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,199
You should leave.

3
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,495
Please let me just take a look at her.

4
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,664
-Please--
-You don't deserve that.

5
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,130
What did I tell you that day?

6
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,633
What did you promise me?

7
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:53,928
You didn't take good care of her.

8
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:58,808
You even upset her so much
she's in the hospital with cuts all over.

9
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,061
How could I possibly let you see her?

10
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,818
We are tired.

11
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,738
We are really tired.

12
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,408
Please just let us be, okay?

13
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:54,322
TOGETHER WE MOVE FORWARD

14
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,578
CHECK, NT$8,000,000

15
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:09,045
THANK YOU, HSIANG'S MEDICAL DEVICES LTD.

16
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,093
TOGETHER WE MOVE FORWARD

17
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:45,975
HAD I NOT SEEN THE SUN

18
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:50,063
You're doodling? Hurry up and study.

19
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:58,738
Kuo Hsuan-jung.

20
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,365
If you won't study,

21
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,617
then go clean up the gym.

22
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,118
Sort the equipment.

23
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,464
It's all right. Keep reading.

24
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,061
Why did you lock the door?

25
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:37,151
What?

26
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:40,571
Are you scared?

27
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,741
Weren't you cocky
in the classroom earlier?

28
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:50,290
Sir, what have I done
to make you hate me so much?

29
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,459
Haven't I made myself clear?

30
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,045
Your grades suck. Your family is a mess.

31
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,297
You're trash.

32
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,008
You won't be able to find a good job.

33
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:02,844
Why bother staying in school?

34
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,804
You just give me so much trouble.

35
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,308
Wouldn't it be easier if you dropped out?

36
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,560
You don't want to study anyway.

37
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,233
Fuck. What's with that look?

38
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,446
You have two days.
Withdraw yourself by then.

39
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,323
Don't push me.

40
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,139
Jen-yao, how come you're so thin?

41
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,974
Have you not been eating enough?

42
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,644
Are you getting three meals a day
and eating well?

43
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,188
-Mom, have a seat.
-Okay.

44
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:39,941
Hey, Jen-yao, listen,
this is chicken soup.

45
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:42,110
I made it with fresh free-range chicken

46
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,903
and Chinese medicinal herbs.

47
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:45,947
It'll help you recharge. It's best hot.

48
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:47,573
Just leave it here.

49
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:48,699
I'll have it later.

50
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,034
Okay.

51
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,079
Why the sudden visit?

52
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:56,040
You haven't called in a long time.

53
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,709
I thought I'd come by
to see how you are doing.

54
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:00,586
How are you?

55
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,631
I'm doing great.

56
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,174
And you?

57
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,884
Me too.

58
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,720
Don't worry about
sending me money every month.

59
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,139
I am working.

60
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,682
Save it for yourself.

61
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,393
Okay.

62
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:21,232
You're on your own in Taipei.
Are you dating anyone?

63
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:24,068
If a girl were here to keep you company

64
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,528
and take care of you,

65
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,155
I wouldn't worry as much.

66
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,282
If there is,

67
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:30,450
please tell me.

68
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,536
We're not looking for
someone from a great family.

69
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,831
All that matters is
that she's decent and treats you well.

70
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:39,750
Mom,

71
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,670
you came all the way to Taipei
just to say that?

72
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:53,556
Well, your dad came to see me
a few days ago.

73
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:02,440
It feels like he has changed a lot lately.

74
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,317
He's been going to work.

75
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,610
His income is steady.

76
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,862
And he doesn't gamble anymore.

77
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,075
I have work later.

78
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,705
Do you want to stay here,
or shall I take you to the bus?

79
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,546
Go do your thing.
It's okay. I can leave on my own.

80
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,127
Jen-yao.

81
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,673
I'm really happy I saw you today

82
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,968
and got to see
that you are starting fresh.

83
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,054
I know it's difficult…

84
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,767
but I'm proud

85
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,811
to see you move on.

86
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,985
Okay, no need to see me off. I'll be fine.

87
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:30,778
Take care.

88
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:54,844
Good morning.

89
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:56,470
Good morning, sir.

90
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,351
Good morning.

91
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,569
-Morning, Ms. Kao.
-Mr. Chuang.

92
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,904
The principal wants to see you now.

93
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,075
Ma'am.

94
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:24,999
Jung-tai.

95
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,460
Have you seen that leak online?

96
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:28,961
What?

97
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,884
<i>Your grades suck. Your family is a mess.</i>

98
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,594
<i>You're trash.</i>

99
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,430
<i>You won't be able to find a good job.</i>

100
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,932
<i>Why bother staying in school?</i>

101
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,601
<i>You just give me so much trouble.</i>

102
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,353
<i>Fuck. What's with the look?</i>

103
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:46,687
<i>What's with the pretense?</i>

104
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,524
This video was posted yesterday.

105
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,610
More revelations came out later.

106
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:56,781
Kuo Hsuan-jung reported us to
the Education Ministry, but was ignored.

107
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,242
The higher-ups now know about this

108
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,661
and are investigating.

109
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,164
Ma'am.

110
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,500
This was clearly filmed in secret.

111
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,294
She set me up.

112
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,463
I can bring her here.

113
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:14,590
I can make her clear this up.

114
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,592
Are you out of your mind?

115
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,803
This thing has blown up.

116
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,388
If you went to Kuo Hsuan-jung,

117
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:23,724
people would think that we pressured her

118
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,101
into making us look good.

119
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,061
I did yell at Kuo Hsuan-jung,

120
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:29,355
but that was only because
she was problematic.

121
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,565
She has no desire to study

122
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,859
and is bringing down
class grades and morale.

123
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,237
As a responsible teacher,

124
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,447
I disciplined and guided her.

125
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:39,949
Was that wrong?

126
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,704
Whether you're a good teacher or not
is completely irrelevant.

127
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:50,334
What matters now is
that our school and I are in deep trouble!

128
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,963
The higher-ups
are reopening the investigation.

129
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:58,467
You've really hurt
our school's reputation,

130
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,760
future enrollment,

131
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:00,886
and subsidies.

132
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,471
Do you understand?

133
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,016
Please, ma'am. I can--

134
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,685
All right, enough.

135
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,021
I've already given you a chance.

136
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:12,898
When I first hired you,

137
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,775
I was under a lot of pressure.

138
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,111
Besides, seven years ago,

139
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:19,488
when you, Ouyang Ti,
and the others messed up,

140
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,990
who cleaned it up for you?

141
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:24,618
If these things were to get out,

142
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,705
I doubt any school would hire you.

143
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:24,178
You deserve to rot
more than anyone else, you know?

144
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,680
If it hadn't been for you,

145
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,351
Hsiao-tung wouldn't have been raped
by those scumbags.

146
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,520
She suffered so much because of you.

147
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:33,687
And you?

148
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:36,607
What did you do?

149
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,567
Nothing at all!

150
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,444
Nothing at all.

151
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,421
<i>It's all your fault.</i>

152
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,510
<i>If they hadn't met you,</i>
<i>they wouldn't have suffered.</i>

153
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:06,470
<i>It's all your fault.</i>

154
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,805
It's all your fault.

155
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,517
If they hadn't met you,

156
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,687
they wouldn't have suffered.

157
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,316
It's all your fault.

158
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,027
It's all your fault.

159
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,907
<i>It's all your fault.</i>

160
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,368
<i>Everything is your fault.</i>

161
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,580
<i>It's all your fault.</i>

162
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,999
<i>She suffered so much because of you.</i>

163
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:36,292
<i>Why don't you rot in hell?</i>

164
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,459
<i>And you?</i>

165
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:38,961
<i>It's all your fault.</i>

166
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,297
<i>What did you do? Everything is your fault.</i>

167
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,717
<i>Nothing at all. It's your fault.</i>

168
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,553
<i>You deserve to rot more than anyone else.</i>

169
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:49,388
<i>It's all your fault.</i>

170
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,223
<i>It's all your fault.</i>

171
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,143
<i>What did you do? You deserve to rot.</i>

172
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,769
<i>If it hadn't been for you…</i>

173
00:14:55,853 --> 00:15:00,357
<i>You deserve to rot more than anyone else.</i>

174
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:01,442
<i>It's all your fault.</i>

175
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:02,818
<i>Everything is your fault.</i>

176
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,111
<i>It's all your fault.</i>

177
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,030
<i>Have you ever wondered</i>

178
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,034
why I ended up like this?

179
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:16,457
How can all of you go on living

180
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:18,584
like nothing ever happened?

181
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,630
You can all move on.

182
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,008
How come I'm the only one

183
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,261
who's stuck in that day forever?

184
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,858
<i>I got to see that you are starting fresh.</i>

185
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,694
I'm proud

186
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,197
to see you move on.

187
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:52,368
<i>To see you move on.</i>

188
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,494
TOGETHER WE MOVE FORWARD

189
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,246
<i>To see you move on.</i>

190
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,290
<i>Move on.</i>

191
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,335
<i>Move on.</i>

192
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:03,796
You can all move on.

193
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,216
How come I'm the only one

194
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,219
who's stuck in that day forever?

195
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:19,621
HONEY

196
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,263
<i>How can someone so lousy become a teacher?</i>

197
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,599
ANONYMOUS:
SHOULD A SCUMBAG LIKE THIS BE A TEACHER?

198
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:39,808
-Fuck.
<i>-You're scared?</i>

199
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,852
I was wondering
how she could screw me over.

200
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:43,729
Apparently, someone helped her.

201
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,189
<i>…pin a few things on you.</i>

202
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,859
<i>When the school asks your grandma</i>
<i>to withdraw you from school,</i>

203
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:50,569
<i>we'll see who's cocky.</i>

204
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,784
-Hello?
<i>-You piece of trash.</i>

205
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:58,994
<i>You like bullying women</i>
<i>and older folks, huh?</i>

206
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,329
<i>You better not run into me.</i>

207
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:01,872
Who are you--

208
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:05,542
What the fuck?

209
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,881
Fuck. What the hell?

210
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,384
CHUANG JUNG-TAI, DOXED
EVEN TEACHERS HATE HIM

211
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:15,594
Fuck.

212
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:32,236
Again.

213
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,320
-Blow him up.
-Come on.

214
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:34,780
-Hurry up!
-It won't light.

215
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:35,697
One more.

216
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,241
-Here.
-Again! One more!

217
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,034
Fuck! What the hell are you doing?

218
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,536
Come down!

219
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,620
I dare you!

220
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:42,746
-Coward!
-Come down.

221
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,914
-Hurry.
-Don't you run!

222
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,375
-Stay!
-He's here!

223
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,086
What are you doing?
Which class are you in?

224
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,004
Fuck!

225
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:00,722
DISGUSTING, SCUMBAG, SON OF A BITCH

226
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,724
GO TO HELL, SCUMBAG, TRASH

227
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,605
FUCK, ASSHOLE,
LOWLIFE, BASTARD, ROT IN HELL

228
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:26,456
Let me go!

229
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,710
Let me go!

230
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:31,503
Let me go!

231
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,448
Li Jen-yao!

232
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:02,117
Let me go!

233
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,078
Li Jen-yao!

234
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,664
Let me go!

235
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,551
Li Jen-yao!

236
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,262
What do you want?

237
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,098
Didn't I tell you already?

238
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:28,185
I only did those things
because Ouyang and the others forced me!

239
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,896
What do you want?

240
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:33,315
I swear I won't go to
Chiang Hsiao-tung again!

241
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:35,525
Li Jen-yao!

242
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,194
Don't do this.

243
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,070
PARAQUAT

244
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,364
Wait, don't do this.

245
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:41,698
Li Jen-yao.

246
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:43,742
Li Jen-yao, wait.

247
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:45,786
I swear.

248
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:47,746
I swear.

249
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,915
I'll never show my face around her again.

250
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,959
Li Jen-yao, let me go.

251
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,378
My daughter will be born soon.

252
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,088
Wait.

253
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,465
Let me go.

254
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,761
No!

255
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,862
Give me another chance.

256
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,282
Give me another chance.

257
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:27,452
When Chiang Hsiao-tung
begged you guys to stop,

258
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,747
did you give her a chance?!

259
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:25,844
I don't want this.

260
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,847
I don't want to die. I can't die yet.

261
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,223
I can't die.

262
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,066
Li Jen-yao.

263
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:40,901
Li Jen-yao.

264
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,029
Save me.

265
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,864
Fuck, it hurts.

266
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,574
It hurts.

267
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,451
Li Jen-yao.

268
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,703
Li Jen-yao.

DEBUSSY, CLAIR DE LUNE

271
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,884
I wasn't the one who did anything wrong.

272
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:08,929
Why am I being killed?

273
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,059
I'm sorry.

274
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:18,480

275
00:26:58,533 --> 00:26:59,451
MESSAGES, HSUAN

276
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:03,622
<i>My teacher told me today that the school</i>
<i>had decided to fire Chuang Jung-tai.</i>

277
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:06,041
<i>They told me to stay in school</i>
<i>and not worry.</i>

278
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:07,917
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

279
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,502
<i>Without your help,</i>

280
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:11,671
<i>I wouldn't have had a chance to graduate.</i>

281
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,174
YOU CAN DO IT

282
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:21,598
HSUAN: CAN WE MEET?

283
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:47,791
Jen-yao, you're here.

284
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:06,309
You took him back?

285
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:08,687
No.

286
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,021
How could I?

287
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:13,316
I won't take him back
until you forgive him.

288
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,277
Come in and have a seat, yeah?

289
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:17,696
Come.

290
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,957
I bought this cake on my way here.

291
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,835
I heard the shop is famous. Take it.

292
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,757
I've got something to do. Gotta go.

293
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,301
I'll come see you another time.

294
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:51,229
You're really making it tough for me.

295
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:55,316
I hid from debt collectors,
and now I hide from my son.

296
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:03,450
Do you have to put it like that?

297
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:06,578
He just can't accept you right now.

298
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,289
One day,

299
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:12,542
he will believe

300
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,627
that you've changed.

301
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,088
When that happens,

302
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:19,632
I'm sure

303
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:22,302
our family can be together again

304
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,095
like we used to be.

305
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:04,719
Hsuan.

306
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,265
Hsuan.

307
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:23,947
Where is Hsuan?

308
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:27,242
Wait a minute.

309
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:29,953
I'm not wrong, am I?

310
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:32,372
Weren't you our class leader,
Lai Yun-chen?

311
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,253
Answer me first.

312
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,255
Where is Hsuan?

313
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,884
She's fine. She couldn't be better.

314
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,262
That brat isn't worth all your care.

315
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,014
After everything you did for her,

316
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:51,933
I just made a few threats,

317
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,185
and she sold you out.

318
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,396
We were just partners.

319
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,023
As long as we ruined you,

320
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:02,068
who cares who betrayed whom.

321
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,654
Why did you do this?

322
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:06,739
What did I ever do to you?

323
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:10,034
You know very well
what you guys did to Hsiao-tung.

324
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,120
Fucking hell, what's wrong with you all?

325
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,205
That was so long ago.

326
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:15,999
Why can't you let me be?

327
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:18,084
Plus, we fucked
Chiang Hsiao-tung, not you.

328
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:19,919
Why are you messing with me?

329
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:26,384
Fuck.

330
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:53,536
Li Jen-yao!

331
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,413
Motherfucker! What are you doing?

332
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:15,350
Fuck.

333
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:16,517
What do you want?

334
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,269
What do you want? You're nuts!

335
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:21,981
Fuck!

336
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,986
Motherfucker, what are you doing?

337
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:27,946
What the hell?

338
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:29,447
You're nuts!

339
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,115
Go away!

340
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:37,664
Fuck!

341
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,208
Wait.

342
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,125
Li Jen-yao.

343
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,878
I'm sorry.

344
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,464
I was wrong.

345
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,008
Spare me, okay?

346
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:50,802
I beg you.

347
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,139
No!

348
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:10,071
I'm sorry. Spare me.

349
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,114
Are you okay?

350
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,167
Aren't we going to see Hsiao-tung?

351
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,165
Mr. Chiang.

352
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,334
It's been a while.

353
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,088
Hello, Mrs. Chiang.

354
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,048
I am Yun-chen.

355
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:35,550
Do you remember me?

356
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:40,304
Come in here and talk.

357
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,537
<i>Is she Hsiao-tung?</i>

358
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:30,938
Hsiao-tung.

359
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,077
I'm sorry.

360
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:30,957
I wasn't there for you back then.

361
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:12,957
Fan Wei-ting,

362
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:14,709
you killed him, right?

363
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,594
Which kill was Jung-tai?

364
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:29,598
Third.

365
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:34,145
If I'm right,

366
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:38,107
Chen Che-li must have been second
after he went to Hsiao-tung.

367
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:45,990
Do me a favor.

368
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:48,284
Don't call the cops.

369
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,537
Pretend that you know nothing.

370
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:56,500
After everything has been taken care of…

371
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,338
I'll turn myself in.

372
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:06,344
No.

373
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:09,972
I can't pretend I know nothing.

374
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,475
Whatever you need later on,

375
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:15,811
as long as it can help you
locate those bastards,

376
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:18,064
I will find a way to get it for you.

377
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,608
Don't worry about Hsiao-tung.

378
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:22,818
I'll handle everything for her.

379
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,908
But, starting today,

380
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,577
you can't contact Hsiao-tung in any way

381
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,246
because I can't let anyone find out

382
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:37,249
everything you're doing now
is connected to her.

383
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,045
You know what I mean, right?

384
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:44,632
Don't worry.

385
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:47,968
What I'm doing now

386
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:51,972
is to make everyone who might remind
Hsiao-tung of that incident

387
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:54,892
vanish from the world.

388
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:01,565
Does that

389
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:03,651
include you?

390
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:41,730
Tien-ching,

391
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:43,566
I am Wang.

392
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:45,359
Do you remember me?

393
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,653
Can you hear me?

394
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:11,260
Tien-ching, it's me, Joy.

395
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:13,471
I heard from Wang

396
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:16,390
that you'd always wished the best
for me and my wife.

397
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:19,602
Thank you.

398
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:23,564
My wife is a big fan of yours.

399
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:26,817
We both hope that you will get better soon

400
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:28,694
and return to the radio.

401
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:41,207
Thanks for coming today.

402
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:44,084
I'll make sure to let you know
when she gets better.

403
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:45,878
It's nothing.

404
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:48,088
If anything happens to Tien-ching,

405
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,298
just let us know.

406
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:50,883
Don't be shy.

407
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,261
She's not just a coworker to us.
She's a friend.

408
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,347
So tell us if you need anything.

409
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,264
Thank you.

410
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,948
You envy her, don't you?

411
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:16,951
You think she's brave.

412
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,828
She goes for what she wants

413
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:21,872
and isn't afraid of judgment.

414
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:26,085
You want that courage, don't you?

415
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:28,546
You want to be like her, don't you?

416
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,383
Chi-chi can help you.

417
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:39,598
We're good friends, after all, aren't we?

418
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:42,851
Bye.

419
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:59,890
