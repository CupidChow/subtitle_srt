1
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:34,375
Are you not going to study?

2
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:40,083
We have to memorize
all these by next week.

3
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:43,958
I’m doing it.

4
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:47,833
No, you are not.

5
00:00:49,167 --> 00:00:50,000
You...

6
00:00:50,292 --> 00:00:52,792
You have been staring at me
like this for the past 10 minutes.

7
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:55,458
Isn’t your arm numb?

8
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:18,208
You did not transfer...

9
00:01:21,542 --> 00:01:24,417
from China, did you?

10
00:01:30,042 --> 00:01:30,917
Hey.

11
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:47,167
Aren’t you curious?

12
00:01:47,417 --> 00:01:48,417
About what?

13
00:01:50,167 --> 00:01:51,083
Well...

14
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:55,750
The entire school knows me as a lesbian.

15
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,208
You may be curious if that’s true or not.

16
00:02:06,792 --> 00:02:10,958
That being true or not
doesn’t matter to me.

17
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:21,125
You don’t have to be discouraged
because of such rumor.

18
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:38,083
Let’s change our textbooks.

19
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:42,667
I’ve written pronunciations here,
so you can study looking at it.

20
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:08,458
DON'T SAY SORRY

21
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,333
Regardless.

22
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:58,333
Did you let them go without cleaning?

23
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:01,625
I can’t help it,
since everyone said they’re busy.

24
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:06,625
But you are helping me

25
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,542
It's all wet.

26
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:37,542
I have to go dry them.

27
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:06,708
What are you looking at?

28
00:05:29,792 --> 00:05:31,917
I helped you clean.

29
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,208
so you carry this up.

30
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,875
I...

31
00:05:57,875 --> 00:06:00,083
I memorized all the Chinese lines.

32
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:06,375
It didn’t take me long,
thanks for your help.

33
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:17,750
Ha Kyeong.

34
00:06:17,917 --> 00:06:20,000
It’s late. We should go home.

35
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,208
So...

36
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,750
I kinda like you.

37
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:02,833
Hello?

38
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:04,667
Yeah.

39
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:07,542
I didn’t forget.

40
00:07:09,042 --> 00:07:10,917
I’ll get off work soon.

41
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:13,292
Yes.

42
00:07:14,042 --> 00:07:17,708
This is my last time
going on blind dates.

43
00:07:19,542 --> 00:07:20,625
Okay.

44
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,833
Bye.

45
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,583
I’m sorry.

46
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:51,333
Hello.

47
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,000
My name is Jae Hyun Kim.

48
00:07:53,542 --> 00:07:56,333
And you are Ha Kyeong Sung,
whom I have talked on the phone before?

49
00:07:57,167 --> 00:07:58,167
Huh?

50
00:08:36,042 --> 00:08:39,000
What a coincidence
we met again like this.

51
00:08:41,792 --> 00:08:42,792
Um...

52
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:44,500
Yeah.

53
00:09:21,792 --> 00:09:22,708
This...

54
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,875
This is my business card.

55
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,375
Come visit once.

56
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,208
I work nearby.

57
00:09:31,042 --> 00:09:33,000
If I have time, I will.

58
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,083
You don't have to come if you are busy.

59
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,958
What are you doing?

60
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,333
Hey, Yeon Choi.

61
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:01,583
Are you a lesbian?

62
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:06,125
You transferred because everyone
in your old school thought you are a lesbian.

63
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:07,708
Is that true?

64
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,083
Do you really like girls?

65
00:10:15,542 --> 00:10:18,542
Did you transfer to all girls’ school
because you like girls?

66
00:10:18,542 --> 00:10:20,375
Oh god, really?

67
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:22,625
Hey.

68
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,333
No.

69
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:28,792
I don’t like girls, so stop asking.

70
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:33,042
Woah...

71
00:10:52,917 --> 00:10:56,542
It’s cool at night.

72
00:10:57,542 --> 00:10:58,625
Right?

73
00:10:58,875 --> 00:10:59,667
Yeah.

74
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,792
Let’s go.

75
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:28,667
Do you want to do
the literature homework at my house?

76
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:30,375
I did it already.

77
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,917
Yeah, so you can teach me.

78
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:35,083
What?

79
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,000
Wait.

80
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:12,958
This is a little...

81
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,417
I...

82
00:12:49,917 --> 00:12:51,792
I understand.

83
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:04,458
Ha Kyeong.

84
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,083
I am...

85
00:13:08,042 --> 00:13:11,833
it is fun to be with you.

86
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,167
But...

87
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:20,208
I don’t know if it’s right
to be like this with you.

88
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:29,083
Thinking that I am dating a girl...

89
00:13:29,917 --> 00:13:31,875
makes me feel uncomfortable.

90
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:35,917
What?

91
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:38,583
What if people around us...

92
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,542
look at us all weird?

93
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,583
What is so weird about us?

94
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:49,875
Well...

95
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:54,333
I am worried about
what people would think about us.

96
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,458
And I am...

97
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:00,958
I am afraid to be different
from other people.

98
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,833
We're not in such a normal relationship.

99
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,833
So,

100
00:14:15,042 --> 00:14:17,875
you’ve been seeing me thinking that?

101
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,958
What if they look at us weird,

102
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:27,875
and what would they think about us?

103
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:30,917
No, that’s not what I meant.

104
00:14:49,542 --> 00:14:51,542
I won’t ever be sorry

105
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:56,833
that I was angry with you.

106
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:04,250
Bye.

107
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:29,292
Ha Kyeong.

108
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:48,875
Ha Kyeong.

109
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,708
We need to talk.

110
00:16:02,917 --> 00:16:06,917
I think I made a mistake yesterday.

111
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,708
I actually have something to tell you.

112
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:12,292
I am...
Hey, Yeon Choi.

113
00:16:14,292 --> 00:16:16,667
I think we are done.

114
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,625
Stop.

115
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,792
I don’t want to hear from you.

116
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:09,708
Is someone coming?

117
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:10,750
Huh?

118
00:18:11,417 --> 00:18:13,792
No, you have been staring at that door.

119
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,583
No, it’s nothing...

120
00:18:17,667 --> 00:18:18,667
Okay.

121
00:18:51,792 --> 00:18:56,125
Hey, I’m going home.
I don’t feel well.

122
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,292
Okay, bye.

123
00:18:58,792 --> 00:18:59,875
Okay.

124
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,667
I’m sorry.

125
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:22,708
Hello, sis?

126
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:48,083
What were you going to tell me
the other day?

127
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:50,750
Ah...

128
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:51,917
That day?

129
00:21:52,917 --> 00:21:54,000
Well.

130
00:21:54,917 --> 00:21:59,292
I want to be the someone special
to you too.
