(Saving the memories with regretful feelings)

4
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:33,070
Seon Woo: At the barbeque party, the photo I took with Seong Ho was great.

5
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:37,120
Seon Woo: Next to it, there's also a photo of Jun Seong and Seong Ho.

6
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,990
Seon Woo: They're both symbolic photos in every aspect.

7
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:46,930
(Yung Hee, Class President Kim; Hyeong Jin, Villain; Seon Woo, Cheep cheep)

(Seon Woo slowly recalls the precious eight days)

9
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:12,570
(He's neatly accumulating the memories of the eight men)

10
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,440
(Seong Ho starts packing up)

11
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,740
Seong Ho: My heart hurts.

12
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,970
Seong Ho: It's really over now.

13
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,539
Seong Ho: "It's really time to leave." It felt real then.

14
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:45,630
(The more baggage he packs, the lonelier he feels)

15
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,340
Seong Ho: I'm very depressed.

16
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:57,400
(Chung-ook goes to the second floor with coffee in his hands)

17
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,720
(Yung Hee is still sleeping)

18
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,090
Chung-ook: It's really over today.

19
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,190
Chung-ook: I felt like it was the last time for everything.

20
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:19,760
Chung-ook: Get up.

21
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,050
Get up.

22
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,710
Chung-ook: It's nine o'clock.

23
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,150
Chung-ook: Have some coffee.

24
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:30,760
(Till the end, Chung-ook expresses himself in his own way)

25
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,300
Your face is a little swollen.
(Till the end, Chung-ook expresses himself in his own way)

26
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,300
(Till the end, Chung-ook expresses himself in his own way)

27
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:38,690
Chung-ook: I was thinking, "This is the last time to express myself."

28
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,150
Chung-ook: I was sad and regretful.

29
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:48,270
Chung-ook: If only I had taken care of Yung Hee more from the beginning.

30
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,700
Right.

31
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,440
(The last day, the last regret)

32
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,550
Yes.
(The last day, the last regret)

33
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,410
(The last day, the last regret)

34
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:10,000
Hyeong Jin: Because it's the last day, I was confused, and I felt it was complicated.

35
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:23,040
(Another man who also has a complicated expression)

36
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:38,740
(There's no conversation between the two)

37
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,140
(Leave first)

38
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:59,140
(On the last day, Men's House is surrounded by a heavy atmosphere)

39
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,320
Min Seong: Because it's the last day,

40
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,750
Min Seong: and we need to make the final choice,

41
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,310
Min Seong: it did feel a bit heavy compared to the usual feelings of ease.

42
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,690
Yung Hee: It's the day when the result comes.

43
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:27,480
Yung Hee: I have a feeling that I'll face a regrettable result.

44
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:35,350
"Did I do well?" That was all my thought.

45
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,800
I felt that it was complicated.

46
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:41,770
(The eight men are ready to leave with a lot of thoughts)

47
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,520
Hyeong Joon: It's all memories.

48
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,270
(Hyeong Joon carefully wraps up the cookies given by Min Seong again)

49
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,180

(Men's House)

52
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,320
The final selection will begin.

53
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,400
Please go to the phone booth and check the messages you received yesterday.

54
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,200
(Frowning)

55
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,510
No.
(Frowning)

56
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,130
(Frowning)

57
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:30,990
OK!

58
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,750
Hyeong Joon: What will come has finally come.

59
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:37,060
Min Seong: It's really the end. It's time to make a decision.

60
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:44,300
(The last mission for the men, "The Final Choice")

61
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,590
What?

62
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:48,590
Seong Ho: I'm happy.

63
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,820
Seong Ho: Nice to meet you all.

64
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,070
Min Seong: What's wrong? We can still see each other again.

65
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,440
Min Seong: It's just that it's over here.

66
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,720
Seong Ho: Stop. Don't say it's over.

67
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:07,650
(Yung Hee, please go to the phone booth and make your final choice after checking the messages)

68
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,210
Yung Hee: Nice to meet you all.

69
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:18,120
(The youngest one, Yung Hee, eventually leaves Men's House)

70
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,380
Yung Hee: I'm leaving. I really have to leave now.

71
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,790
(Really?)

72
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,320
-Do you want to meet later?
-Yes.

73
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,690
Hyeong Joon: I was a little tearful.

74
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,420
Hyeong Joon: He just left like that.

75
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,430
Jun Seong: I wanted to cry when I heard the last words.

76
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,800
Seong Ho: Why do I feel like I'm going to cry?

77
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,409
Seong Ho: I felt like we'll never see each other again.

78
00:06:58,409 --> 00:06:59,890
Seong Ho: My heart hurt a little.

79
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,010
Seong Ho: I felt like I was about to cry.

80
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:11,920
(And Chung-ook memorizes Yung Hee's last looks with his eyes)

81
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,480
Alright.

82
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:30,090
(The last time at the phone booth, the last choice)

83
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,200
Yung Hee: I've been sure about it all along.

84
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,420
Yung Hee: I indeed didn't agonize over it.

85
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:40,320
Yung Hee: I was thinking that I would just go straight over there and express my feelings.

86
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,630
You have two new messages.

87
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:53,770
Message No. 1.

88
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,340
Hi, Yung Hee.

89
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:09,780
Chung-ook: I'm sure you know who this is by now.

90
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,410
Chung-ook: I just wanted to give you one last message in my native tongue.

91
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,730
Chung-ook: And I just wanted to let you know

92
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:19,450
Chung-ook: that I meant everything I said at the cafe.

93
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:21,030
(Smiling)
Chung-ook: that I meant everything I said at the cafe.

94
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:21,980
(Smiling)

95
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,820
Yung Hee: Chung-ook said his words in English, which I don't understand.

96
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:31,880
Chung-ook: I genuinely think you're an amazing person and…

97
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:39,220
Chung-ook: I'm positive that you will succeed in everything that you do.

98
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:45,100
Chung-ook: I really don't think I would have been able to make it through without you here.

99
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:52,180
Chung-ook: I just hope that I will be able to see you through your journey as well.

100
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,340
Chung-ook: So I'm excited to see where you go and…

101
00:08:55,340 --> 00:09:01,760
Chung-ook: I'm excited to see you outside of this house as well.

102
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,790
Chung-ook: Have fun deciphering this message.

103
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,260
Chung-ook: See you later. Bye.

104
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:19,230
Yung Hee: Because it's the last greeting,

105
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:22,650
Yung Hee: "Because of you, I felt grateful, happy, and blissful.

106
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:25,090
Yung Hee: It would be nice if we can also meet after we leave."

107
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,430
Yung Hee: I think that's what he said.

108
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,940
Chung-ook: I put my heart into saying those words.

109
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:35,380
Chung-ook: Even if Yung Hee didn't understand,

110
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:35,470
(Chung-ook: he might still be able to know my feelings more or less.)
Chung-ook: Even if Yung Hee didn't understand,

111
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,160
he might still be able to know more or less.
(Chung-ook: he might still be able to know my feelings more or less.)

112
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:39,930
Message No. 2.

113
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,680
(There's another message for Yung Hee)
Message No. 2.

114
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,660
(There's another message for Yung Hee)

115
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:46,390
Yung Hee: Is the second one from Jun Seong?

116
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,720
Yung Hee, this is Seon Woo.

117
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,010
Seon Woo: It's already the last evening.

118
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,820
Seon Woo: Thanks to your support,

119
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:11,370
Seon Woo: I've been able to come this far healthily.

120
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:16,620
Seon Woo: So I want to say "Thank you" again. That's why I sent you the message.

121
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:22,220
Seon Woo: To me, you're very cool.

122
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,580
Seon Woo: I want to say you're cool.

123
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:30,290
Seon Woo: I'll also remember that you're that kind of person to me.

124
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:33,660
Seon Woo: I want to say this to you too.

125
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,670
No matter when, I'll be there to support you too.

126
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,670
Thank you very much.

127
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,120
Yung Hee: I was smiling, but I shed tears too.

128
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:50,440
Yung Hee: Of course I was happy.

129
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:55,610
Yung Hee: It wasn't the answer I was looking for, but I still got a message.

130
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:56,760
Yung Hee: I was happy.

131
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:07,240
(And the last mission for the men)

132
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,310
Please write down the name of the man who makes your heart flutter the most

133
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:16,510
during your time in Men's House and put it in the mailbox.

134
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:23,840
Yung Hee: I've already decided

135
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,640
Yung Hee: who I'm going to give this last mission card to.

136
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:35,770
Yung Hee: I felt more in tune with that person when we talked together.

137
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:39,880
Yung Hee: I had no regrets about focusing on only one person.

138
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:52,100
Yung Hee: I feel like I was taking an exam. It's like I handed in the exam paper before finishing answering the questions.

139
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:02,300
(Then, Yung Hee left Men's House)
(Men's House)

140
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,800
(The second person who walks out of Men's House is Chung-ook)

141
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,780
Chung-ook.

142
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:15,140
-Chung-ook: I'm really leaving.
-Seon Woo: I'll look forward to your songs.

143
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,550
Seon Woo: Don't cry.

144
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,340
Chung-ook: I won't cry.

145
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:30,930
(Chung-ook walks to the phone booth with heavy steps)

146
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,360
Chung-ook: I wasn't expecting much, but there's still a 1% chance.

147
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,550
You didn't receive any messages.

148
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:03,750
Chung-ook: As expected, there were no other messages.

149
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:08,750
Chung-ook: I feel like I've thought about a lot.

150
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,100
Chung-ook: And there were a lot of regrets.

151
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:19,290
Chung-ook: I also thought, "What could I have done more actively?"

152
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:34,610
Chung-ook: I don't think I was troubled.

153
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,890
Chung-ook: My heart hasn't fluttered like this for a long time.

154
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:48,700
Chung-ook: Being able to spend a day thinking about that person first,

155
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:52,520
Chung-ook: I think that's meaningful.

156
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:06,860
Chung-ook: "I can only leave it to fate." I was thinking about that, and I felt comfortable.

157
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:20,820
Chung-ook: I still thought it was right to express myself in this way till the end.

158
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:30,170
(To Yung Hee. Drawing of a dog. From David Chung-ook Kim)
(Chung-ook left his last feelings of love to Yung Hee)

159
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:42,930
(Seon Woo is lost in thought before leaving Men's House)

160
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:50,330
Seon Woo: I'm leaving.

161
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:58,610
(Feeling complicated when it's really time to leave)

162
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,840
Bye.

163
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:03,960
(Take care. Take care)
Bye.

164
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,400
(Take care. Take care)

165
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:16,690
(Right after that, Jun Seong walks out of Men's House)

166
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,280
(Grinning)

167
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,870
-Hyeong Jin: Don't cry.
-Jun Seong: I won't cry.

168
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,080
-Hyeong Jin: It seems like you would cry.
-Jun Seong: I don't know. I'm just…

169
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,500
Emotional?

170
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,820
Jun Seong: My feelings are a little weird.

171
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,240
Jun Seong: I held it in well originally.

172
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,720
Jun Seong: It's kind of bad to cry today, right?

173
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,330
Jun Seong: I'm leaving.

174
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:36,010
Hyeong Jin: Don't cry.

175
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,570
Seong Ho: I feel like I'm going to cry my way down the stairs.

176
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,800
Seong Ho: Don't come out.

177
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,030
Hyeong Jin: I don't know how to express my feelings.

178
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,270
(Take care)

179
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:18,990
Seong Ho: It felt like we'll never see each other again.

180
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:22,710
Seong Ho: "I really don't want to leave." I left with such a thought.

181
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,920
Seon Woo: I made the final choice with determination.

182
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,850
Seon Woo: I want to end it well.

183
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:49,500
Seon Woo: "Would Yung Hee leave a message?" I was pretty sure about it.

184
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:54,880
You have two new messages.

185
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,410
Message No. 1.

186
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,800
Yung Hee: This is Yung Hee.

187
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:09,900
Yung Hee: I'm happy to be with you.

188
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:15,480
Yung Hee: Thanks to you, I learned a lot. I accumulated beautiful memories too.

189
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,859
Yung Hee: Thank you very much.

190
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:20,640
Yung Hee: We won't end here in this house.

191
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,940
Yung Hee: Once we get out, it'll be a new beginning. That's what I think.

192
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,660
Yung Hee: I'll visit you occasionally.

193
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,520
Seon Woo: Yung Hee really stays the same from beginning to end. So cool.

194
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:38,600
Message No. 2.

195
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,840
(The second voice message that Seon Woo receives)
Message No. 2.

196
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,170
(The second voice message that Seon Woo receives)

197
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,190
Hello, Seon Woo.

198
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,200
Seon Woo: The second one is from Seong Ho.

199
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:57,930
Seong Ho: I'm really happy

200
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,700
Seong Ho: that we could talk in the cafe today.

201
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:09,560
Seong Ho: Since a few days ago, I've thought a lot about you.

202
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:18,570
Seong Ho: The kind of warm and amiable look in your eyes when you look at me,

203
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:22,200
Seong Ho: I wouldn't even see it from my family or loved ones.

204
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:27,640
Seong Ho: I want to cry every time I see it.

205
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:33,170
Seon Woo: I felt reluctant to leave.

206
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:36,130
Seon Woo: I got emotional suddenly.

207
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,540
(Somehow, he wants to cry)

208
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,250
Oh my!
(Somehow, he wants to cry)

209
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,710
(Somehow, he wants to cry)

210
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:08,700
Seon Woo: I'm fickle, and I can't give others certainty.

211
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,840
Seon Woo: Although I hurt some people,

212
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,950
Seon Woo: I felt how great courage is.

213
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:22,420
Seon Woo: I want to express my feelings with all my heart.

214
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:38,820
(To whom will Seon Woo send his letter?)

215
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:47,790
Jun Seong: I'm nervous because it's the result.

216
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:55,920
Jun Seong: I hope I can get a good result. Especially for today.

217
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:08,330
You didn't receive any messages.

218
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:16,860
(Jun Seong freezes like an ice cube)

219
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,050
Jun Seong: Will he…

220
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:28,140
Jun Seong: Will he really not choose me?

221
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:37,410
Jun Seong: I was expecting too much.

222
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:43,830
Jun Seong: I was thinking that I had high expectations, so I felt disappointed.

223
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:56,040
Jun Seong: Then I shouldn't expect the final choice.

224
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:01,040
Jun Seong: I'll just do what I should do.

225
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,340
Seong Ho: I'm 99% sure in believing it, and I'm 1% doubtful.

226
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:22,380
Seong Ho: Will Jun Seong choose me?

227
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,380
Seong Ho: Will he change his mind at the last moment?

228
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:32,650
Seong Ho: Would the behavior during this week be fake?

229
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,260
I had thought about those.

230
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:41,820
You have one new message.

231
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,460
Message No. 1.

232
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:46,240
Hello, Seong Ho.

233
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:57,100
Jun Seong: It's been a week since we first met.

234
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,990
Jun Seong: How do you feel?

235
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:07,900
Jun Seong: I think it's quite novel.

236
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:12,950
Jun Seong: It's a feeling that I haven't had for a long time.

237
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,400
I was excited and happy.

238
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:22,380
I wish you felt the same.

239
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:28,940
Jun Seong: Tomorrow is the last day.

240
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:38,730
Can I look forward to it now?

241
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:50,950
Jun Seong: I'll look forward to it. Bye.

242
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,950
Seong Ho: I really had mixed feelings.

243
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:02,990
Seong Ho: I shed a lot of tears too.

244
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:06,570
Seong Ho: I felt there're still feelings that I haven't organized.

245
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:09,520
Seong Ho: I felt so depressed and kept sighing.

246
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:19,640
(What is Seong Ho's last choice?)

247
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:26,910
(Sniffing)

248
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:34,080
Seong Ho: I wrote down my feelings of love honestly.

249
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:47,750
(Where will Seong Ho's heart turn to in the end?)

250
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,720
Min Seong: I had a lot of thoughts.

251
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,150
Min Seong: I agonized over it for a long time.

252
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:03,310
-Min Seong: Bye.
-Hyeong Joon: Oh, goodbye.

253
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:18,930
(After Min Seong left, Hyeong Joon's mind gets complicated)

254
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,220
(Let's go for it!)

255
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,730
(Take care)

256
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:44,350
(Hyeong Jin leaves first, and Hyeong Joon is left alone)

257
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:46,980
I'm the only one left.

258
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:56,210
Hyeong Joon: I was sitting on the seat where I often sat and drinking water alone.

259
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:59,200
Hyeong Joon: I was the last one.

260
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:02,020
Hyeong Joon: I was just looking at this place like this.

261
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,570
I'll definitely miss it.

262
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:18,150
(After everyone left, he feels more empty inside his heart)

263
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:23,520
Hyeong Joon: There were even tears in my eyes.

264
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,530
I think I'll miss it a lot.

265
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:52,730
(Takes a look at Men's House again)

266
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:05,900
(Hyeong Joon is the last one to come here and the last one to leave)

267
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,630
Min Seong: I seem to have let it all go.

268
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,920
Min Seong: I've organized my thoughts.

269
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:19,620
Min Seong: What decision will the person I have feelings for make?

270
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:22,770
Min Seong: I'm going to accept it now.

271
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:34,160
You've got a new message.

272
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,350
The first message reads...

273
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:44,130
(Min Seong looks strange)

274
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:49,090
(Who sent this message?)

275
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:53,850
(Min Seong: To be honest, I was hoping both Hyeong Joon and Hyeong Jin would send a voice message to me)

276
00:26:53,850 --> 00:27:00,060
To be honest, I was hoping both Hyeong Joon and Hyeong Jin would send a voice message to me.
(Min Seong: To be honest, I was hoping both Hyeong Joon and Hyeong Jin would send a voice message to me)

277
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:08,010
The man I have the strongest feelings for here...

278
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,780
Min Seong: Many things came to my mind.

279
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:25,140
(Who is the man Min Seong has the strongest feelings for?)

280
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:57,440
(Which man will win Min Seong's love?)

281
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,770
You've got a new message.

282
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:11,620
Hyeong Joon.

283
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,810
(The last message Min Seong left to Hyeong Joon)

284
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:22,490
Hyeong Joon.
(The last message Min Seong left to Hyeong Joon)

285
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:23,570
(The last message Min Seong left to Hyeong Joon)

286
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:28,320
You haven't got any new messages.

287
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:43,470
(Hyeong Jin is writing a letter silently)

288
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:49,750
Hyeong Jin: Will I ever have this kind of feelings again?

289
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:54,300
Hyeong Joon: I hesitated for a long time.

290
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,530
Hyeong Joon: Having heard that message, I made up my mind.

291
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:26,150
(What kind of feelings are shown in Hyeong Joon's letter?)

292
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:33,390
(It's time for the eight men to make the final choice)

293
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:42,480
(Only those who will become a couple will see each other)

294
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,500
Jun Seong: I was staring at that road.

295
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,850
Jun Seong: I was thinking if he hadn't come,

296
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:54,840
Jun Seong: I would have been waiting there forever.

297
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:58,170
Jun Seong: I was a little nervous.

298
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:03,000
Jun Seong: The weather was not good that day.

299
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:08,010
Jun Seong: I thought maybe I should blame the weather.

300
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,640
Jun Seong: Would he come? Would he come?

301
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:23,680
Jun Seong: Would he come?

302
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,350
Jun Seong: Would he come or not?

303
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:37,570
Seong Ho: I looked over there to see if someone was there.

304
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:40,300
Seong Ho: Because Jun Seong was wearing orange clothes today,

305
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,970
Seong Ho: I saw him clearly.

306
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:46,040
Seong Ho: Jun Seong was there so I wanted to go there quickly.

307
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:51,740
Seong Ho: Normally, I wouldn't have a smile on my face when walking.

308
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,650
Seong Ho: But I couldn't help smiling when walking towards him.

309
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:08,600
(The two men are getting closer to each other)

310
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,460
Seong Ho: Hi.

311
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:15,380
Hi.

312
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:21,510
-What's up? -I missed you.

313
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,590
I hid myself just now.

314
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,050
Just now.

315
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:33,120
(The moment when they feel connected with each other)

316
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,490
Aren't you cold?
(The moment when they feel connected with each other)

317
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:34,430
Aren't you cold?

318
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,740
Seong Ho: I'm fine. Aren't you cold?

319
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,720
-Jun Seong: Hey. -What?

320
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,000
Jun Seong: You didn't leave me a voice message.

321
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,850
Jun Seong: I felt a little unhappy about it.

322
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:43,020
Seong Ho: Sorry.

323
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,310
Why didn't you leave me a message?

324
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:46,990
What?

325
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,240
Seong Ho: Are you feeling sad?

326
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,060
Are you feeling sad?

327
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,270
Are you cold?

328
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:55,880
Jun Seong: No. I'm feeling very happy.

329
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,870
-Seong Ho: Should we meet this weekend? -Jun Seong: Sure.

330
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,000
-Seong Ho: Should we buy some ice cream? -Jun Seong: Sure.

331
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:06,750
Jun Seong: I'm off on Sunday.

332
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,790
Seong Ho: I'm not.

333
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:10,110
-You said you work at night. -Yes. -I work at night too.

334
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:12,750
(The two men are planning what to do after they leave the Men's House)
-You said you work at night. -Yes. -I work at night too.

335
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:15,210
(The two men are planning what to do after they leave the Men's House)

336
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,140
Jun Seong: Kiss?

337
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:20,200
(Nodding)
Jun Seong: Kiss?

338
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,020
(Nodding)

339
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,710
(Feeling shy)

340
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:27,360
-Jun Seong: I want to go home right now. -Seong Ho: Me too.

341
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,340
Jun Seong: Are you cold?

342
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:36,210
-Seong Ho: My ears are cold. -Jun Seong: Really? Do you want to use heating pads?

343
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:37,510
Seong Ho: On my ears?

344
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,540
-Seong Ho: It's not warm. -Really?

345
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,220
(Panic)
-Seong Ho: It's not warm. -Really?

346
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:46,380
Seong Ho: It's not warm. Really.

347
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:49,270
Jun Seong: What to do then? Use it to cover your ear.

348
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:51,840
Seong Ho: It can protect my ear from wind.

349
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,540
-Seong Ho: Is this fun? -Jun Seong: Of course.

350
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:05,120
Seong Ho: I want to know more about Jun Seong.

351
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,920
Seong Ho: That was the first time that I had thought

352
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,140
Seong Ho: maybe after we leave the Men's House, we can be together.

353
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,770
Jun Seong: Very good.

354
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:18,440
Jun Seong: It's very good. I can't find any better words to describe it.

355
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,260
Everything is very good and I'm very happy.

356
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:28,240
(Jun Seong and Seong Ho are the first couple on His Man Season 2)

357
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:33,510
(Another man comes to check the final result)

358
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:39,350
Hyeong Jin: First of all, I was very nervous for sure.

359
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,450
I was hoping Min Seong would come.

360
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:48,280
Did Min Seong write my name?

361
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,530
Min Seong: It was very confusing.

362
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:54,250
Min Seong: To some extent, it’s the day to make the final decision.

363
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,370
But everything is changeable before it comes to an end.

364
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:26,590
Hyeong Joon: Ah, no.

365
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:30,580
Hyeong Joon: I still thought there might be some hope for me.

366
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,620
(Smiling)

367
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:43,139
(Who is Min Seong's final choice?)

368
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:43,520
I thought you'd come that way.
(Who is Min Seong's final choice?)

369
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:43,570
I thought you'd come that way.

370
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:45,070
(Min Seong picked Hyeong Jin in the end)
I thought you'd come that way.

371
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:48,860
(Min Seong picked Hyeong Jin in the end)

372
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:51,650
Min Seong: Of course I felt happy.

373
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:56,070
Min Seong: I felt happy because the man I love and I became a couple.

374
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,530
Min Seong: We are successfully matched.

375
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:03,250
Hyeong Jin: Can we go now? It's pretty cold here.

376
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:04,940
(Holding hands tightly)

377
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,430
-Are you cold? -Yes.
(Holding hands tightly)

378
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:07,240
(Holding hands tightly)

379
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:09,740
-Min Seong: Are my hands warm? -Hyeong Jin: Yes.

380
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,780
Hyeong Jin: Let me think.

381
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:15,930
Hyeong Jin: From which moment did it start?

382
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:17,700
Hyeong Jin: I think I began to have that feeling from that moment.

383
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:21,090
-Min Seong: What moment? -Hyeong Jin: From the first time you called me.

384
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:24,020
It was at that moment I began to have feelings for you.

385
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:27,000
Hyeong Jin: To be honest, I think...

386
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,340
Hyeong Jin: You know that voice message.

387
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,960
Hyeong Jin: I thought Hyeong Joon had sent a voice message to you too.

388
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,700
-So I was a little bit... -Min Seong: I thought that way.

389
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,210
Hyeong Jin: You've never changed your mind from the beginning to the end?

390
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:39,580
Min Seong: After a long period of careful consideration,

391
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:42,490
Min Seong: I make a choice firmly.

392
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:45,210
Min Seong: After I make that choice, I won't regret it.

393
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,630
Min Seong: So I picked you.

394
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,650
Hyeong Jin: That seemed to be my happiest moment.

395
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:55,600
Hyeong Jin: Your aren't wearing many clothes. Let's leave here and have a meal.

396
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:58,120
Min Seong: If we go this way, will we find a restaurant?

397
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,980
-Hyeong Jin: I don't know. Let's escape now. -You don't know?

398
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:04,050
(Min Seong and Hyeong Jin)

399
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,190
(Min Seong and Hyeong Jin are the second couple on His Man Season 2)

400
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:07,540
-Are you cold? -It's okay.
(Min Seong and Hyeong Jin are the second couple on His Man Season 2)

401
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,000
(Min Seong and Hyeong Jin are the second couple on His Man Season 2)

402
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:13,890
Min Seong: We’ve finally become a couple after going through so many things.

403
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:15,710
Min Seong: I feel very happy.

404
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:18,460
It should be our happiest time when we are sure of each other's love.

405
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:30,870
(The moment when Min Seong was sure he would pick Hyeong Jin)

406
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:36,330
You've got a new message.

407
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:44,410
You may feel troubled when making the choice.

408
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:47,590
Hyeong Jin: But I hope you won't be too tired.

409
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:55,730
Hyeong Jin: I will respect any choice you will make.

410
00:36:55,730 --> 00:37:02,460
I just hope you won't be too tired.

411
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:21,330
(Then it was Hyeong Joon's turn to leave a voice message)

412
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:47,920
Hyeong Joon: I don't want to leave a message to anybody today.

413
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:57,660
(Hyeong Joon didn't leave a message to anybody)

414
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:14,980
(Seon Woo comes to see Hyeong Joon)

415
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,830
What's going on? Why are you here?
(Seon Woo comes to see Hyeong Joon)

416
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,900
Hyeong Joon: I don't know it either.

417
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:22,330
Seon Woo: That can't be. Why are you here?

418
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:24,060
Hyeong Joon: I don't know it either.

419
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,840
Seon Woo: You don't know? What are you doing?

420
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,010
Hyeong Joon: I'm just staying here.

421
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,200
Hyeong Joon: Oh, well.

422
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:37,510
Seon Woo: Did he pick me?

423
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:41,800
Seon Woo: Was this the last chance we could get from His Man Season 2's crew?

424
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,140
Hyeong Joon: I know what will happen to me.

425
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,620
Hyeong Joon: So I think I know what is going on here.

426
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:49,350
Seon Woo: Because you already know the final result?

427
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:50,540
Seon Woo: I know it too.

428
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,200
Hyeong Joon: It's funny.

429
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,940
Hyeong Joon: Actually, I realized it at that time.

430
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,730
Hyeong Joon: Those who failed to form a couple would gather there.

431
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:05,180
Did you write it? Did you write it?

432
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:08,080
(Seon Woo: Did you write the letter? Did you write it?)
Did you write it? Did you write it?

433
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:09,240
Hyeong Joon: I did.

434
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,170
Seon Woo: You did? Did you write everything you want to say?

435
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:13,470
Hyeong Joon: What?

436
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:14,780
Seon Woo: Didn't you write to him?

437
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:26,740
(Hyeong Joon's expression is confusing)

438
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:36,430
(Hyeong Joon checked the voice message he received before making the final choice)

439
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:40,940
You've got a new message.

440
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:44,960
Hyeong Joon.

441
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:47,930
(Who left the voice message to Hyeong Joon?)

442
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:52,870
First, I don't know what to say.
(Who left the voice message to Hyeong Joon?)

443
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:57,030
(Who left the voice message to Hyeong Joon?)

444
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:59,600
After a deep conversation today,
(It was Min Seong who had left a voice message to Hyeong Joon)

445
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,560
After a deep conversation today,

446
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,330
Min Seong: I realized that I was in a too good position.

447
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:10,490
Min Seong: I've also known what I didn’t know before.

448
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:16,780
Min Seong: I've made my choice.

449
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:23,680
Min Seong: Because of this choice, I won't be able to go fishing.

450
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,970
Min Seong: But I hope we can still smile and feel easy

451
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:28,060
Min Seong: when we see other at other places.

452
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:34,390
Min Seong: I just want to express my gratitude and feelings of guilt to you.

453
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,570
Min Seong: Thank you.

454
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:40,530
Me too.

455
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,940
Hyeong Joon: Write down the name of the man who you have the strongest feelings for

456
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:05,410
Hyeong Joon: during your stay in the Men's House and put it in the mailbox.

457
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,140
It is Min Seong, of course.

458
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,860
I have the strongest feelings for Min Seong.

459
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:23,020
(Hyeong Joon wrote his last letter)

460
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:33,090
Hyeong Joon: I sincerely hope Min Seong can be happy. That's what I wrote.

461
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:39,700
(No)

462
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:39,710
Hyeong Joon: To be honest, I wasn't expecting anything.
(No)

463
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:40,730
Hyeong Joon: To be honest, I wasn't expecting anything.

464
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,990
Hyeong Joon: I thought he wouldn't leave me a message.

465
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:45,000
(Hyeong Joon: The first thought that came to my mind after hearing the message was, "He got over me eventually.")
Hyeong Joon: I thought he wouldn't leave me a message.

466
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,380
The first thought that came to my mind after hearing the message was, "He got over me eventually."
(Hyeong Joon: The first thought that came to my mind after hearing the message was, "He got over me eventually.")

467
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:53,380
Hyeong Joon: It actually made it easier for me to make the final choice.

468
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,550
But...

469
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:55,570
Hyeong Joon: Yeah that's it.

470
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:07,260
(The letter written to Hyeong Joon the night before)

471
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:17,920
(I'm done. Thank you. Min Seong should always be happy.
Don't call me Hyeong Joon next time we meet. Call me DAENYEOL. From: Hyeong Joon)

472
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:22,120
(Words that were not said to Min Seong in person)

473
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:26,150
I hope Min Seong will always be happy.

474
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:30,740
Hyeong Joon: I’m glad

475
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:34,080
Hyeong Joon: that Min Seong didn’t give me more hope.

476
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:35,570
Hyeong Joon: This

477
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:37,400
Hyeong Joon: makes me feel much easier.

478
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,140
Hyeong Joon: It helps me get over this quickly.

479
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,930
Seon Woo: Now I know why we meet here.

480
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:44,680
Seon Woo: We helped them become two couples.

481
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:52,940
We should be happy since we let them go.

482
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:56,500
Hyeong Joon: From the bottom of my heart, I think I did the right thing.

483
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:58,970
Hyeong Joon: Now when I think about it...

484
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:03,260
Hyeong Joon: If I hadn't called Seon Woo back then,

485
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:03,330
(Hyeong Joon: If I had gone on a date with Min Seong...)
Hyeong Joon: If I hadn't called Seon Woo back then,

486
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,580
If we had gone on a date,
(Hyeong Joon: If I had gone on a date with Min Seong...)

487
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:08,460
those things wouldn't have happened.

488
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:11,740
Seon Woo: We will find our happiness too.

489
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:19,740
Seon Woo: Will all of us gather here in the end?

490
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,090
Hyeong Joon: I think so.

491
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:23,630
Seon Woo: What should we do if all of us gather here?

492
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:25,560
Hyeong Joon: Isn't it fun?

493
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:29,700
It’s funny since this is a different room.

494
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,530
Yung Hee: Oh, what's going on?

495
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:38,550
Yung Hee: The moment I opened the door, I only saw Seon Woo.

496
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:39,260
Yung Hee: I thought,

497
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:43,260
Yung Hee: "Oh, really? The 1% miracle happened?"

498
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:46,550
Yung Hee: Then I turned around and found another man sitting there.

499
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:50,240
Yung Hee: And I realized it didn't happen.

500
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,880
Yung Hee: That was a party for those who failed to form a couple.

501
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,740
Yung Hee: So I took a seat.

502
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,220
Yung Hee: Am I the third man to come here?

503
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:58,370
Seon Woo: Do you want to sit there?

504
00:43:58,370 --> 00:43:58,420
Yung Hee: I'll sit here.

505
00:43:58,420 --> 00:43:59,320
(Immediately)
Yung Hee: I'll sit here.

506
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,060
(Immediately)

507
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:03,540
Seon Woo: See? All of us gather here.

508
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:06,230
-Yes. -Seon Woo: It's cold. Come closer.

509
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,570
(Hugging)

510
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:09,720
-Seon Woo: So cold. -Yung Hee: So cold.

511
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:12,010
Yung Hee: How long have you been here?

512
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:12,590
Seon Woo: Me?

513
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:14,350
-Just a little while. -Seon Woo: I don't know.

514
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:14,990
-Really? -Yes.

515
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:15,430
(Panic)
-Really? -Yes.

516
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:16,520
I've just got here.
(Panic)

517
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,450
Yung Hee: What was he doing?

518
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:19,970
Yung Hee: Why was he still flirting with me

519
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:21,660
Yung Hee: when I was about to get over him?

520
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:23,850
Yung Hee: He’s really good at playing hard to get.

521
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:26,890
Yung Hee: We looked like a good couple to the outsiders, right?

522
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:28,970
Yung Hee: To be honest, I think we can make a good couple.

523
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:29,980
Yung Hee: Right?

524
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:31,010
(Sobbing)

525
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:34,730
Seon Woo: Ah, wait. There are eight of us, right?

526
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:35,230
Yes.

527
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:37,480
Seon Woo: We will wait here for some more time.

528
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,390
(The bread and drinks ordered are served)

529
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:44,790
-Thank you. -Thank you.
(The bread and drinks ordered are served)

530
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,690
(Taking a huge bite)

531
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:53,730
(Try it now)

532
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:54,750
Is it good?
(Try it now)

533
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:55,390
(Try it now)

534
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:57,480
Hyeong Joon: Its sweetness is just right. It tastes very good.

535
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:01,690
Seon Woo: Which guys do you think will be a couple?

536
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:02,960
Yung Hee: Are you asking me?

537
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:04,630
Seon Woo: If you can't guess right, it’s your problem.

538
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:06,320
Yung Hee: Well, I have a feeling that...

539
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,900
-Seon Woo: Not just a feeling. -Which guys will be a couple?

540
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:08,530
(Yung Hee: Jun Seong and Seong Ho will be a couple, right?)
-Seon Woo: Not just a feeling. -Which guys will be a couple?

541
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:11,260
Jun Seong and Seong Ho will be a couple, right?
(Yung Hee: Jun Seong and Seong Ho will be a couple, right?)

542
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:13,260
-Really? -Yung Hee: I think there’s a 99% chance.

543
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:15,730
Yung Hee: If there’s another couple,

544
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:19,600
Yung Hee: I think it will be Min Seong and Hyeong Jin.

545
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,550
Seon Woo: He’s doing well in the dorm.

546
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:23,210
Yung Hee: I wasn't bullied.

547
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:29,490
Yung Hee: Who of them do you think will be a couple?

548
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:31,550
-Hyeong Joon: I think you're right. -Seon Woo: I agree.

549
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:36,620
(-Seon Woo: It would be strange if they don't become a couple. -Hyeong Joon: Yes)

554
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,130
Seon Woo: Don't feel sad. Don't feel sad.

555
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:48,340
Yung Hee: Will we three choose each other to form a couple in the end?

556
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:50,360
Yung Hee: In the end, we three will be together?

557
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,800
Hyeong Joon: who else do you think will come?

558
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,730
Yung Hee: I don't know who will come next.

559

572
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,730

(Hyeong Jin and Min Seong received letters too)

653
00:49:53,420 --> 00:50:01,240
(To Min Seong: You look cute when you are asleep. You're also competitive. When I was looking at you in the bathroom, my heart beat so fast.)
(To Hyeong Jin: Hello! I don't know what to write. After I joined this show, I met so many good people. I don't regret it at all. I'm really happy. But in the Men's House, it seems you're the man that I have the strongest feelings for. Many things have happened. I also had other good choices. But you're the man that I have the strongest feelings for. I have so many thoughts in my head, so I wrote a long paragraph. We'll talk about other things when we go back. From: Min Seong.)

654
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,290

(Hyeong: To Min Seong: You must have been very tired.)

659
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:14,280
You must have been very tired.
(Hyeong: To Min Seong: You must have been very tired.)

660

Hyeong Jin: Thank you for coming to me.

See you out there.

662
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:26,010
Min Seong: We'll start by going out together to have a meal or drink coffee.

663
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:28,130
Min Seong: It's okay that it'll just be normal.

667
00:50:44,870 --> 00:50:46,630
Chung-ook: In the past few days,

668
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:49,250
Chung-ook: I've expressed what I wanted to.

669
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:50,990
Chung-ook: I feel very good and comfortable.

670
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:52,900
Chung-ook: So I have no regrets at all.

671
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:55,430
Chung-ook: I have nothing more to say now.

672
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:56,910
I didn't expect that I would have such complicated feelings

673
00:50:56,910 --> 00:50:58,440
Hyeong Joon: after I joined His Man Season 2.

674
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,110

675
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:07,300

676
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,920
Hyeong Jin: This is a very good memory.

677
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,200
Hyeong Jin: But from a different point of view,

678
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,770
Hyeong Jin: I don't want to have another experience like this again.

679
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:17,150
Hyeong Jin: One time is enough.

680
00:51:17,230 --> 00:51:22,950
Yung Hee: The Men's House has made me become a cooler guy.

681
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:25,350
Yung Hee: It has also made me stronger.

682
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:28,670
Seon Woo: Even after I go back to my daily life,

683
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:32,830
Seon Woo: I still consider this experience a chance for me to feel better about myself.

684
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:34,330
Seon Woo: So I feel happy.

685
00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:38,170
Min Seong: Well, I didn't expect I would cry so much.

686
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:40,310
Min Seong: Usually, I don't cry.

687
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:42,490
Min Seong: I think I’ve shed all the tears that I would have for one year.

688
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:44,630
Min Seong: Not just one year. Maybe two years.

689
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:48,590
Jun Seong: It's a very special experience for me in the beginning of this year.

690
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:52,760
Jun Seong: It makes me feel good. It is a very interesting and happy experience.

691
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:56,330
Very good.

695
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:08,690
Seong Ho: I'll try to make it happen.

696
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:12,820
I'm going to meet him today. Please finish the interview quickly.

(Jun Seong and Seong Ho love each other more)

699
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:34,560
Because the face is small...

700
00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:40,000
Hyeong Joon: Camera 1. Camera 2. Camera 3.

701
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,240
Because the face is small...

702
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:41,660
