00:15:58,950 --> 00:15:59,560
(Min Seong: Yes. He just said hi and watched us chat. That's all)

316
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,790
-Seon Woo: He didn't join your chat?
-Min Seong: No.

317
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,160
Min Seong: I still feel

(Min Seong: I still feel a bit disappointed that Hyeong Joon didn't join the chat)

320
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:16,650
Min Seong: At moments like this, Hyeong Joon was never around.

321
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:22,790
Min Seong: But this time, Hyeong Jin showed up.

322
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,310
Min Seong: Am I a little strange?

323
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:32,040
Min Seong: I feel a little tired.

324
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,270
Min Seong: I'm depressed. I feel bad about myself.

325
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:51,360
Min Seong: I think I'm comparing them.

326
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,380
Min Seong: I feel sorry about that.

327
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:12,960
(It's hard to decide who to choose. His feelings are mixed)

328
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,270
(The 7th morning at Men's House)

329
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:46,220
(They all woke up after hearing the alarm)

330
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:50,730
(Seong Ho goes to the room for four right after he got up)

331
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,510
Seong Ho: It's time to wake up.

332
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:00,170
Seong Ho: It's time to wake up.

333
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,270
(Chung-ook is preparing quietly beside them)

334
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:12,010
Chung-ook: I don't think they can see me.

335
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:14,630
Chung-ook: It's good, actually.

336
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:17,490
Chung-ook: I'm happy for them and wish they can be together.

337
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:21,290
Chung-ook: I mean it. I'm glad to see them so close.

338
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:26,000
Chung-ook: But I hope they can restrain themselves a little bit.

339
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,040
Chung-ook: Just kidding. It's fine. Great.

340
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:33,180
Chung-ook: They look so cute. I'm just a little jealous.

341
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,760
Hyeong Joon: What are you doing?

342
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,150
Hyeong Joon: Guys, hey!

343
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,600
Hyeong Joon: Get out!

344
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,310
Hyeong Joon: Get out!

345
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:46,450
You don't even care to say please.

346
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,560
(Compared to the lively second floor, the first floor is very quiet)

347
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,420
(Hyeong Jin is still asleep)

348
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,750
(In the room for two, Seon Woo is getting prepared quietly)

349

(Laughing)

352
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:15,590
(The noise was made by Hyeong Joon who is making breakfast)

353
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,090
-Seon Woo: Do you have time for dressing up after making breakfast?
-Hyeong Joon: What time is it?

354
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,270
Seon Woo: 9:30.

355
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:29,070
Seon Woo: They may come down at around 11:00.

356
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,980
Hyeong Joon: Should I prepare breakfast later?

357
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,950
Seon Woo: Yes. It's too early now. It won't take long. Go wash up.

358
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,890
-Hyeong Joon: I can go wash up?
-Seon Woo: I'll help you.

359
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,160

Seong Ho: Hey.

363
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:48,030
Seong Ho: Hyeong Jin, wake up.

364
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,540
Seong Ho: It's 9:40 now.

365
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:56,390
Seong Ho: The bathroom upstairs is unoccupied. My bathroom.

366
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:58,170
Hyeong Jin: Really? I'll go wash up there.

367
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:59,400
Bye.

368
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:05,190
(Min Seong is sleeping too)

369
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:11,470
Seon Woo: I found it quite interesting.

370
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:13,100
Seong Ho: What?

371
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,860
Seon Woo: Their love triangle.

372
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,450
-Seong Ho: There's a love triangle going on?
-Seon Woo: You don't know?

373
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:20,840
-Seon Woo: Tsk, you've been busy falling in love.
-Seong Ho: Wait. Love triangle?

374
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,840
-Seong Ho: Who? Min Seong?
-Seon Woo: Yes, Min Seong and the other two guys.

(Hyeong Jin, Hyeong Joon, Min Seong)
(Hyeong Jin, Hyeong Joon, Min Seong)
-Seong Ho: Who? Min Seong?
-Seon Woo: Yes, Min Seong and the other two guys.

376

Hyeong, Hyeong, and Min.
(Hyeong Jin, Hyeong Joon, Min Seong)
(Hyeong Jin, Hyeong Joon, Min Seong)

377

Jin, Joon, and Min.
(Hyeong Jin, Hyeong Joon, Min Seong)
(Hyeong Jin, Hyeong Joon, Min Seong)

378
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:28,610
Seong Ho: The three of them?

379
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:31,230
Seon Woo: Yes. He's a fox and seduced both of them.

380
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,400
-Seong Ho: Oh, fox? He's quick.
-You don't know?

381
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,170
He's fast.

382
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,500
How did this happen?

383
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:37,550
(Seon Woo: The group date. You went out yesterday, so you don't know)
How did this happen?

384
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:40,680
You went out yesterday, so you don't know.
(Seon Woo: The group date. You went out yesterday, so you don't know)

Hyeong Jin: Wake up.

386
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:55,230
Hyeong Jin: It's almost 10.

387
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,760
-Min Seong: What time is it now?
-Hyeong Jin: About 10.

388
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,100
(Whoosh)

389
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:09,200
-Seon Woo: Can I have something to eat?
-What? Yes.

390
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,820
-Seon Woo: You didn't get changed.
-Hyeong Joon: Oh, I'm tired.

391
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,930
-Seon Woo: Didn't you get changed?
-Seong Ho: Will you stay at home today?

392
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:17,020
Seong Ho: How long will it take? Do you need help?

393
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,370
Should I open the package of the mushrooms?

394
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,380
Seon Woo: If you start now, it won't take long. But you haven't changed.

395
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,740
Seon Woo: I told him to get changed but he didn't.

396
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,420
-No. I can change…
-He wasted that time.

397
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,340
Hyeong Joon: I can get changed very quickly.

398
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:28,110
Hyeong Joon: I can leave halfway through breakfast

399
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,010
Hyeong Joon: to change.

400
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:31,400
Seon Woo: It seems that someone is still in bed.

401
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,820
Seong Ho: Let's do the prep first.

402
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,930
-Okay. Take out the ingredients first.
-You can go get changed.

403
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:36,110
Seon Woo: Yes, French toast is easy to make.

404
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:39,640
Hyeong Joon: I always want to wear an apron.

405
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,220
Hyeong Joon: How to wear this?

406
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,900
-Like this?
-Put your head in.

407
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:52,900
Then your hands.

408

(The wish of wearing the apron is finally fulfilled on the 7th day)
Then your hands.

Seong Ho: Do we need to fry a lot of bacon?

411
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,360
Hyeong Joon: Bacon? Fry all we have.

412
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,930
Seong Ho: Okay. I like sumptuous breakfasts.

413
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,350
(Crack eggs)

414
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,020
Hyeong Joon: If I beat the eggs now,

415
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,690
Hyeong Joon: will the yolks and whites separate later?

416
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:12,290
Seong Ho: Yolks and whites don't separate themselves.

417
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,020
Seong Ho: Even if they did, just beat them again.

418
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,340
Seong Ho: It doesn't take long to beat eggs.

419
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,580
(Embarrassed)
Seong Ho: It doesn't take long to beat eggs.

Seon Woo: Are you sure you've done this before?

422
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,000
Hyeong Joon: Yes, a long time ago.

423
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,710
-Hyeong Joon: How much do we need?
-Seong Ho: You mean sugar?

424
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,760
Hyeong Joon: Should I add honey to it?

425
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,560
-Seon Woo: Maple sugar is also delicious.
-Hyeong Joon: Yeah? Should we use maple syrup?

426
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,970
Seon Woo: But there's not much left.

427
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:34,550
Seon Woo: We can either put it on the bread

428
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,170
Seon Woo: or mix it with the eggs.

429
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:36,240
(Hyeong Joon: We need to use lots of sugar but a little syrup can be very sweet.)

00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:09,620
So much. Are we having bacon or toast?

This is crazy.

468

Start eating.

471
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,490
Seon Woo: Min Seong, breakfast is ready.

472
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,910
Yung Hee: Let's eat.

473
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:21,540
Min Seong: What is this? Banana?

474
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,900
Seon Woo: Banana. Roasted banana.

475
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,460
Seong Ho: It must be delicious.

476
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:28,230
I'm a little angry.

477
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,350
(A big bite)
I'm a little angry.

478
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,370
(Great)

479
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,650
French toast is delicious.

480
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:38,910
And…

481
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:40,490
Min Seong: It's delicious.

482
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:43,020
Seon Woo: Right? Joon made it.

483
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:45,900
Min Seong: Where is Joon?

484
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,560
Seon Woo: He came down to make breakfast before getting changed.

485
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,570
Seon Woo: He didn't get changed.

486
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:52,290
-He came downstairs right after getting up.
-He went to wash up after making breakfast.

487
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,790
He made it in a hurry.

488
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:58,180
Jun Seong: The toast is great.

489
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,310
Seon Woo: It's delicious.

490
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,370
Seon Woo: I didn't expect you to like it.

491
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:03,870
Jun Seong: It's really delicious.

492
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:08,010
Seon Woo: You've almost become a morning person on the 7th day.

493
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:09,730
Jun Seong: Because someone woke me up.

494
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:11,330
Jun Seong: Or I may sleep till noon.

495
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:13,830
Seon Woo: You used to skip breakfast too.

496
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,920
Yung Hee: Most of us can get up in the morning now.

497
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,140
-Yeah.
-Right?

498
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,620
Min Seong: I got up for breakfast too.

499
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:21,680
Seon Woo: You never changed.

500
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,870
Jun Seong: You should make some improvements too.

501
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:25,440
-Jun Seong: Like me.
-Chung-ook: Yes. The most relaxed one.

502
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,900
-You look very relaxed.
-That's right.

503
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,270
Jun Seong: Get up early like me.

504
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:32,010
Min Seong: To be honest, I opened my eyes early but closed them again.

505
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:33,180
Yes.

506
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:36,060
Jun Seong: I couldn't even open my eyes.

507
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:42,420
Jun Seong: Please give me a piece of the salted butter bread.

508
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,850
Salted butter bread.

509
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,430
Seon Woo: Are you done? It's delicious.

510
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:48,350
-What?
-Seon Woo: It's very delicious.

511
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:51,560
Seon Woo: Sorry that we started eating without you.

512
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,260
Seon Woo: It's really delicious. Go eat.

513
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,780
Hyeong Joon: Okay. But I can't go down like this.

514
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,210
Look at me.

515
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,730
Seon Woo: I see. I'll wait for you.

516
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:00,970
Seon Woo: I'll put your share on a plate first.

517
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:01,730
Thank you. Okay.

518
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,140
Seon Woo: Everyone is eating fast because it's delicious.

519
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,310
Hyeong Joon: Really? That's good.

520
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:06,300
Seon Woo: I'll reserve yours for you. Take your time.

521
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,440
Hyeong Joon: OK.

522
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,470
Seon Woo: He won't be down any time soon.

523
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,010
Jun Seong: Hyeong Joon?

524
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:20,350
Seon Woo: Yes. I'm not kidding. He's still what he looks like in the morning.

525
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:22,180
Jun Seong: Give him a piece of the salted butter bread. It's delicious.

526
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,290
Seon Woo: Okay. I'll put it in the middle.

527
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:26,080
Seon Woo: Four pieces are enough, right? Even if he eats a lot.

528
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,380
-Four pieces?
-Yes.

529
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,920
Min Seong: Bacon and mushrooms.

530
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,030
It's almost 11, right?

531
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,000
Four minutes to 11.

532
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,050
Min Seong: What will we do today?

533
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,240
Yung Hee: Everyone turned to look at the table.

534
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,390
Min Seong: Is anything there?

535
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:40,890
We're all looking at the table for the mission card.

536
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,950
Min Seong: Is there anything on the table?

537
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,740
-Seon Woo: Who will do the dishes?
-I will.

538
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,900
Min Seong: Maid? Maid will do the dishes?

539
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,250
Min Seong: Maid and I.

540
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,180
-Hyeong Jin: Are you full?
-Min Seong: Yes.

541
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:53,720
-Yung Hee: Are you full?
-Seong Ho: Yes.

542
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,450
I'll put this plate here just in case.

543
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:58,240
-He might eat them.
-Yeah.

544
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,220
Jun Seong: Smoke?

545
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,550
Min Seong: I'll smoke after I do the dishes.

546
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:04,390
Jun Seong: Then I'll go smoking.

547
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:05,510
Hyeong Jin: Go ahead.

548
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:06,670
Min Seong: I'll come after I'm done here.

549
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:14,240
(Hyeong Joon is finally done preparing)

550
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:23,410
Hyeong Joon: After I got changed, I went out

551
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:28,620
Hyeong Joon: and saw Min Seong's room.

552
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,180
Hyeong Joon: Every time I came here,

553
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,550
Hyeong Joon: I greeted him face to face.

554
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:40,720
Hyeong Joon: When he was sleeping, I'd knock on the glass to wake him up.

555
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:44,750
Hyeong Joon: This place left me with memories of small things.

556
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:49,960
Hyeong Joon: I just stood there and stared.

557
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:03,340
(The closer the ending is, the more complicated the feelings are)

558
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,800
-Min Seong: Did you sleep well last night?
-Hyeong Joon: Hello.

559
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:11,950
(They met for the first time today)

560
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:13,450
Have you eaten?
(They met for the first time today)

561
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:15,290
Yes. I ate a lot.
(They met for the first time today)

562
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:15,880
(They met for the first time today)

563
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:18,540
-Go eat.
-Hyeong Joon: Hello. What's wrong with your hair?

564
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,840
Hyeong Jin: It's my hairstyle today.

565
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:24,530
Hyeong Joon: Wet hair?

566
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,420
Hyeong Jin: Hair that isn't dried completely.

567
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,480
Hair that isn't dried completely.

568
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,840
Hyeong Joon: Are you kidding me? What's going on?

569
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,140
Hyeong Joon: I can't finish them all.

570
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,910
Seon Woo: No. These are for you.

571
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:33,860
Seon Woo: These are leftovers.

572
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,510
Hyeong Joon: I was surprised.

573
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:39,160
Seon Woo: But you can eat from this plate too.

574
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:39,190
(Glance)
Seon Woo: But you can eat from this plate too.

575
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,160
Really?
(Glance)

576
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,440
Nothing.

577
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,360
Min Seong: He's a bit different when he's around me today.

578
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,970
-Min Seong: Eat.
-Hyeong Joon: Thank you.

579
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:51,490
-Hyeong Jin: Enjoy the food.
-Hyeong Joon: OK. Thank you.

580
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:05,590
Hyeong Jin: What should I do with my hair? Should I change my hairstyle?

581
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,450
Min Seong: Why? It looks nice.

582
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:08,510
Hyeong Jin: It's okay that I put it down?

583
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:09,530
Min Seong: Yes.

584
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:11,490
Hyeong Jin: As long as you like it.

585
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:19,170
Hyeong Jin: What? Do you want to do your hair?

586
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:25,060
Hyeong Jin: Comb it back.

587
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:29,410
(Staring)

588
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,060
Hyeong Jin: Don't stare at me like that.

589
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,970
Min Seong: Why? Why?

590
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:36,980
Hyeong Jin: Nothing.

591
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:44,100
Hyeong Jin: You look good when your hair is combed back. You look good no matter your hairstyle.

592
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,740
Hyeong Jin: The host looks good no matter how he dresses up.

593
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,450
Min Seong: I recruited a good maid.

594
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,740
Hyeong Jin: Here. Come here.

595
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,100
Let me see.

596
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:02,280
(Hyeong Jin does Min Seong's hair)

597
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:06,150
Hyeong Jin: The host has the same hairstyle as mine.

598
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,410
Hyeong Jin: I also have a hair whorl here.

599
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:08,420
Min Seong: Me too.

600
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,180
Hyeong Jin: Mine also starts from here.

601
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,100
Min Seong: So when I made curly hair, I would press down here firmly.

602
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,550
Hyeong Jin: Me too.

603
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:13,810
(Lovey-dovey)

604
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:15,520
You'll know if you touch it. This is a bone.
(Lovey-dovey)

605
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,110
Yes.
(Lovey-dovey)

606
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:16,870
This is concave.
(Lovey-dovey)

607
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,160
This is concave.

608
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,610
Min Seong: Mine is also concave here.

609
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,140
Hyeong Jin: So keep your bangs longer.

610
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,870
Because you want to accentuate the curve here.

611
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:29,120
Hyeong Jin: In front of the bathroom mirror, I helped Min Seong with his hair.

612
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,750
Hyeong Jin: There were moments when we looked at each other. That made my heart flutter.

613
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:37,740
(Hyeong Joon saw this scene)

614
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:40,230
Hyeong Joon: To be honest, I didn't know what they were doing.

615
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:41,860
Hyeong Joon: I just saw them together.

616
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:44,330
Hyeong Joon: I tried not to care.

617
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,530
(The last day they spent together before the final choice)

618
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:04,350
(Seon Woo comes to some place alone)

619
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:20,340
Seon Woo: It's about the end. I hope to have the time to sit down

620
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,440
Seon Woo: and have a conversation with the person I want to talk to,

621
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,770
Seon Woo: to say the things I haven't been able to express.

622
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:34,300
(Jun Seong comes to talk to Seon Woo)

623
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:36,810
Seon Woo: Why are you here?

624
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,360
Seon Woo: Who are you expecting?

625
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,930
Jun Seong: What expectations?

626
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:45,550
Jun Seong: I didn't have expectations. I didn't care who would come.

627
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:48,420
Jun Seong: It's finally time. That's how it feels.

628
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,510
Seon Woo: It's good to meet me. Right?

629
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,730
Jun Seong: Kind of.

630
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:55,130
Is it good?

631
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,990
Jun Seong: What's going on? This awkwardness.

632
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:01,280
Seon Woo: We used to be awkward.

633
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,720
Jun Seong: Awkward atmosphere.

634
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:11,180
Seon Woo: I do want to talk to you. But I hope it's not you who comes.

635
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,310
Jun Seong: Why?

636
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:20,400
Seon Woo: I think both of us will do our best to make the ending well.

637
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:25,190
Seon Woo: We'll also say goodbye in our own way.

638
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:27,970
Seon Woo: I have nothing to say.

639
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:32,140
Seon Woo: But if I have to meet someone one last time,

640
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:35,580
Seon Woo: I hope it's you.

641
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,520
Jun Seong: Isn't it Seong Ho?

642
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,600
Seon Woo: No, why?

643
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,270
Seon Woo: I told Seong Ho all I wanted to tell him.

644
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,560
-Really?
-Yes.

645
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,870
Seon Woo: Goodness. You said you couldn't slack off until the end.

646
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,030
Jun Seong: You never know.

647
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:48,940
-Jun Seong: I have a question.
-What?

648
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:52,650
Jun Seong: We chatted anonymously yesterday. How did you know it was me?

649
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:53,960
-Seon Woo: Man 2?
-Jun Seong: Yes.

650
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,010
-Seon Woo: You...Man 2?
-Yes.

651
00:32:56,810 --> 00:33:00,370
Seon Woo: I was in Seong Ho's chat group. Maid 2.

652
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:01,920
Seon Woo: Can you tell? When you read "Maid 2"?

653
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,980
-Jun Seong: I didn't know at first.
-Right?

654
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:05,870
Jun Seong: To be honest, at first, I didn't care who came in.

655
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:09,700
Jun Seong: I just thought someone came in.

656
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:14,210
Jun Seong: When I saw the last words, "I'll leave after I'm done." I could tell right away.

657
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:17,490
Jun Seong: It's Seon Woo.

658
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:18,080
I thought about it for a long time. How did you know it was me?

659
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,510
(Joon-sung: I thought about it for a long time. How did you know the Man 2 was me?)
I thought about it for a long time. How did you know it was me?

660
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,380
-Seon Woo: What are you talking about?
-How did you know it was me?

661
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,430
Seon Woo: You two are showing affection so frequently.

662
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:24,860
No, I...

663
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,030
Seon Woo: Do you think no one knows?

664
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:28,820
Jun Seong: No, I sent some conversations

665
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:32,770
Jun Seong: pretending they weren't mine in Seong Ho's chat group.

666
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:33,800
-Jun Seong: Did I get caught?
-Don't be ridiculous.

667
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,610
Seon Woo: No matter what a couple does, it's easy to get caught.

668
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:37,000
Seon Woo: Others kept asking.

669
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,160
Seon Woo: You guys had only been together for one day. How come it became like this?

670
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,540
They also said...

671
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:47,510
Jun Seong: I saw the last sentence yesterday and choked up for a long time.

672
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:49,010
Seon Woo: Oh, you?

673
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,890
Seon Woo: In fact, I didn't need to understand

674
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:56,340
Seon Woo: the anonymous chat mission yesterday at all.

675
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:00,760
Seon Woo: Because I've said what I wanted to say.

676
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,640
We have also...had a one-on-one showdown.

677
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,550
(Seon Woo: A one-on-one showdown)
We have also...had a one-on-one showdown.

678
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,490
Joon-sung: We had a one-on-one showdown.

679
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:07,500
Seon Woo: Yes, we did everything we could.

680
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,030
My last worry is

681
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:14,889
Seon Woo: when you two were together, when Seong Ho saw me beside you two,

682
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:18,850
Seon Woo: I think I felt guilty from his eyes.

683
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:26,340
Seon Woo: I want to tell him I hope he won't feel that way anymore.

684
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:30,130
Jun Seong: Although we should hear what Seong Ho wants to say,

685
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:36,020
Jun Seong: I think even if he can't see you, he won't forget you.

686
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:39,860
Jun Seong: Because you are a very important person...

687
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,760
-Of course.
-Jun Seong: In our relationship.

688
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,699
Jun Seong: I know Seong Ho is observing.

689
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:47,969
Jun Seong: But he has to bear it. There's no other way.

690
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:49,210
Seon Woo: Yes. What else can he do?

691
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:51,929
Jun Seong: The one who makes the choice has no choice. He can only bear it himself.

692
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:53,530
Seon Woo: Yes. What else can he do?

693
00:34:55,580 --> 00:35:00,930
Seon Woo: Now that I think about it, We three were the first ones to meet in person.

694
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:02,310
-That's right.
-Seon Woo: There was also a wooden table, right?

695
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:03,190
Jun Seong: Yes.

696
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:06,140
Seon Woo: Seong Ho came first. I was the second.

697
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:08,190
-You.
-Jun Seong: I was the last.

698
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:12,100
Seon Woo: Was that a symbol?

699
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,840
Jun Seong: Was it a foreshadowing? It aligns so well with the current situation.

700
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,390
Seon Woo: Have you been sure since then?

701
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:16,510
-Jun Seong: Me?
-Yes.

702
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:17,970
-Jun Seong: No, not at that time.
-Right?

703
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:22,750
Jun Seong: When the three of us met at the cafe, I didn't think much.

704
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:28,420
Jun Seong: I just thought Seong Ho was good at dressing up and his makeup was pretty.

705
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,650
Jun Seong: I thought you looked very dignified, just based on your appearance.

706
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:33,310
Jun Seong: That's what I thought.

707
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:35,190
Seon Woo: It's exactly what you said back then.

708
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:37,200
-Jun Seong: Yes, that's right. That's about it.
-Yes.

709
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,030
-Jun Seong: Regardless of the past or the present, I am still the same.
-I'm sorry.

710
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:44,010
Jun Seong: But I didn't know it would turn out like this.

711
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:46,050
Seon Woo: I didn't know it would turn out like this, either.

712
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:51,280
I think you're cool.

713
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:54,610
-You're cool.
-What do you mean?

714
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,890
Seon Woo: Very cool.

715
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:59,440
Seon Woo: Can my little bit of affection compare to yours?

716
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,660
Seon Woo: To be honest, I have had such thoughts.

717
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:06,720
Jun Seong: No. At first, Seong Ho's chose you. It was true.

718
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,170
Jun Seong: Yes. Was it the second day or the night before?

719
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:12,440
Jun Seong: I asked him

720
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,920
Jun Seong: why you applied to date Seon Woo.

721
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,330
Jun Seong: He said without hesitation that it was because he liked you.

722
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:26,600
Jun Seong: But how to act after hearing that sentence

723
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,340
Jun Seong: was actually up to the listener.

724
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:36,470
-Jun Seong: What else can I do?
-Right. What can I do?

725
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:38,170
Jun Seong: Since he said he likes you.

726
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:41,670
Jun Seong: That's it. That's the only way.

727
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:45,950
Seon Woo: Now that I think about it, Seong Ho was so straightforward.

728
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:51,240
Seon Woo: He came to me and said, "I think timing is the most important.

729
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:56,260
Seon Woo: I hope you realize it through this opportunity."

730
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,110
Seon Woo: Hearing that,

731
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:59,760
Seon Woo: I understood it right away.

732
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,000
(Seon Woo: If Hyeong Jin chose someone else instead of to go out with me)
Seon Woo: I understood it right away.

733
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,620
If Hyeong Jin chose someone else to go out
(Seon Woo: If Hyeong Jin chose someone else instead of to go out with me)

734
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:04,300
on the first day,
(Seon Woo: If Hyeong Jin chose someone else instead of to go out with me)

735
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,390
Seon Woo: would it be different?

736
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,880
Seon Woo: I'm just saying.

737
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:11,890
Seon Woo: After thinking, I think he was right.

738
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:16,380
Seon Woo: We should try our best when we have a chance.

739
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:19,090
Seon Woo: We should try our best now and after.

740
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,940
Jun Seong: Yes, everything happened.

741
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,430
Jun Seong: There are so many things I don't know.

742
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:29,900
-Jun Seong: To be honest, I want to hear them all.
-You really don't know anything.

743
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,850
Seon Woo: As to what's happending in this house...

744
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,540
-Jun Seong: I really don't know anything.
-In your eyes...

745
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:37,180
Jun Seong: I kind of understand now. The atmosphere is a little cold recently.

746
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,470
Jun Seong: But I don't know why it's cold.

747
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:38,880
-Goodness.
-I don't know why the atmosphere is cold.

748
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,440
(Shaking head)
-Goodness.
-I don't know why the atmosphere is cold.

749
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,430
-Goodness.
-I don't know why the atmosphere is cold.

750
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:43,700
Jun Seong: I should have cared about those around me as well.

751
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:47,030
-Seon Woo: But I don't think you plan to do so.
-Jun Seong: Yes, that's right.

752
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,610
-Seon Woo: Yes, you're like this.
-Jun Seong: I don't care about the surroundings.

753
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:51,810
Jun Seong: Yes, we're two extremes.

754
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:57,550
Jun Seong: Really. You have everything Seong Ho likes.

755
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:03,940
Kind impression. Elegant clothes. Simple style.

756
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:07,080
Jun Seong: I mean it. You have everything Seong Ho likes.

757
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:10,740
Jun Seong: So I have to be be cautious about you.

758
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:14,080
Jun Seong: Because the person I need to be cautious about

759
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,800
Jun Seong: possesses all the qualities he likes.

760
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,020
Jun Seong: So, you are someone I need to be cautious about at all times.

761
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:23,210
Jun Seong: You're a mountain.

762
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:25,910
Jun Seong: Because compared to you, I'm completely different.

763
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:27,330
-Yes.
-Jun Seong: Be it the style of clothes.

764
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:30,060
-Yes.
-Jun Seong: The impression I gave Seong Ho is also not what he likes.

765
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:33,900
Jun Seong: Even in terms of music preferences and other things, there are many extreme opposite aspects of mine.

766
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:40,300
Jun Seong: I'm not good at resonating with what he said.

767
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,720
Jun Seong: So you were like a huge mountain for me.

768
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,450
Jun Seong: But in the end, a slow turtle can win over a rabbit.

769
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:48,590
Jun Seong: It kept walking with its head down, and unexpectedly, it also surpassed

770
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:50,980
-Seon Woo: To hear this from you...
-It surpassed.

771
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,140
Seon Woo: It's a bit annoying,

772
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,880
Seon Woo: but I admit.

773
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:57,860
Seon Woo: Seeing the photos of you two, you have the same style.

774
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:01,540
-Yes.
-Seon Woo: You two are really well-matched.

775
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,520
Jun Seong: I'm glad.

776
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,670
Seon Woo: I mean it. I cannot harbor any ill intentions towards you both because you are too good-looking.

777
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,030
-Really?
-Really.

778
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,640
(Shy)
-Really?
-Really.

779
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,100
-Really?
-Really.

780
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,780
-Jun Seong: I was happy then.
-Seon Woo: You looked happy.

781
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,330
Jun Seong: We're in sync.

782
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:17,130
Jun Seong: Thank you so much. I'm grateful and happy.

783
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:22,610
Seon Woo: I wanted to say thank you to Jun Seong.

784
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,140
Seon Woo: At that time, both of us felt the same way

785
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:29,040
Seon Woo: so that we said the same thing at the same time.

786
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:33,840
I'm grateful, joyful, and happy.

787
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,390
Jun Seong: In the future, I can eat Italian gelato for free.

788
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:38,180
Seon Woo: Free for you.

789
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:45,700
Jun Seong: "Thank you" seems to be the most extreme expression I can convey.

790
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,490
Thank you so much.

791
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:49,550
Seon Woo: I understand.

792
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,020
Joon-sung: I feel like I'm going to cry. Don't look at me.

793
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:59,640
(Tearful)

794
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:02,760
I'm really...

795
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:07,920
I'm happy to have you guys. I'm glad it's you.

796
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:12,160
Jun Seong: I'm feeling a bit choked up, and my emotions are quite complex.

797
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,610
Jun Seong: He gives me the most motivation.

798
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:20,230
Jun Seong: Thanks to him, I can work harder.

799
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:23,360
Jun Seong: I'm happy to express my feelings.

800
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,160
Seon Woo: The famous Jun Seong almost cried

801
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,660
Seon Woo: in the end.

802
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:35,030
Seon Woo: At that moment, I felt that he deserves it while also feeling a bit relieved in my heart.

803
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:36,680
Seon Woo: I was happy.

804
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:43,360
Seon Woo: I feel happy that Jun Seong really

805
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,590
Seon Woo: becomes sincere to me.

806
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,880
-Jun Seong: I'm leaving.
-Seon Woo: Go.

807
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,790
Seon Woo: You go first.

808
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:51,100
Jun Seong: I should go.

809
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:53,720
-Jun Seong: See you later.
-Seon Woo See you later.

810
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:59,860
Jun Seong: It's so heavy. The chair is so heavy.

811
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:10,900
(A refreshing and bitter mood)

812
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:24,340
(Another man came to see Seon Woo)

813
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,570
(Another man, Seong Ho, came to see Seon Woo)

814
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:26,830
What?
(Another man, Seong Ho, came to see Seon Woo)

815
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,700
Seon Woo: What did you say?

816
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,510
Seong Ho: So annoying.

817
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,740
Seong Ho: You are here.

818
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,490
Seon Woo: Why are you here?

819
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,690
Seong Ho: I thought there was another man.

820
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:41,920
-Seon Woo: You dressed well. So...
-It's embarrassing.

821
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,610
Seon Woo: Then why are you here?

822
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,130
Seong Ho: I came because I wanted to see you. It's true.

823
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:49,870
-Seon Woo: Good timing.
-Don't...

824
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:54,040
Seong Ho: Someone came before I came.

825
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:57,080
Seong Ho: I thought Jun Seong is the only one

826
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:01,100
Seong Ho: to make him look like that.

827
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:05,080
-Seong Ho: But it's good.
-Seon Woo: Yes. Good.

828
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:06,970
Seon Woo: Do you want this?

829
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:08,430
Seong Ho: I want it too.

830
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:10,980
Seong Ho: Don't you have a cup for me?

831
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:13,820
Seon Woo: Oh, you're leaving soon. Drink it with this.

832
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,690
Seong Ho: Is it a cup that erases memories?

833
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:17,460
Seon Woo: Drink it and forget it.

834
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:21,670
Seong Ho: What did Jun Seong say?

835
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:25,490
-Seon Woo: Jun Seong? Jun Seong cried.
-Seong Ho: Did he cry?

836
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:27,000
Seon Woo: No, it's just...

837
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,820
Seon Woo: He said he felt like crying.

838
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:35,150
Seon Woo: It's also my first time I had a conversation with Jun Seong for so long.

839
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:38,160
Seon Woo: We talked a lot.

840
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:43,030
Seon Woo: But we only said thank you all the time.

841
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:45,300
Seon Woo: We kept saying thank you to each other.

842
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:52,690
Seong Ho: I feel so uncomfortable. I feel like sitting on pins and needles.

843
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:55,960
Seong Ho: I'm grateful to you, too.

844
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:58,230
Seon Woo: For what?

845
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,480
Seong Ho: If it's someone else,

846
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:06,980
Seong Ho: I would feel uncomfortable

847
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:08,780
Seong Ho: before I determine my feelings for Jun Seong.

848
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:12,900
Seong Ho: If it weren't for your words of comfort

849
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:16,420
Seong Ho: and your advice to keep our relationship from becoming complicated,

850
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:20,430
Seong Ho: I might have been unable to focus on Jun Seong due to my uneasiness.

851
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:22,530
Seong Ho: I also feel that way.

852
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:28,150
Seong Ho: On the other hand, I'm actually worried about you.

853
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:31,540
Seong Ho: To be honest, I feel like I'm being selfish by choosing between the two of you.

854
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:33,490
No.

855
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:41,500
Seong Ho: Compared to you, I said a lot of hurtful things to Jun Seong.

856
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:41,870
(Seong Ho: I told him I wanted to know more about you)Seon Woo
Seong Ho: Compared to you, I said a lot of hurtful things to Jun Seong.

857
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:46,630
I told him I wanted to know more about you.
(Seong Ho: I told him I wanted to know more about you)Seon Woo

858
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:51,510
Seong Ho: I asked him to wait for me for many times.

859
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:54,230
Seong Ho: In order not to burden me, both of you

860
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:55,860
Chenghao: said it's OK.

861
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:58,340
Seong Ho: I thought it was OK.

862
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:03,460
Seong Ho: I was worried

863
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:08,970
Seong Ho: if you would miss others who match you because of me.

864
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:12,500
Seon Woo: It seems like he also feels self-blame, just like me.

865
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:15,180
Seon Woo: For what happened now,

866
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:18,140
Seon Woo: I didn't think in that way.

867
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:20,700
Seon Woo: I still think

868
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:25,290
Seon Woo: it was because I didn't give him confidence.

869
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:31,600
Seon Woo: No, I realized later when I expressed my feelings.

870
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:37,840
Seon Woo: I realized that you are really brave.

871
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:43,140
Seon Woo: You came to tell me

872
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:48,240
Seon Woo: your feelings for Jun Seong, didn't you? So I'm grateful.

873
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:52,600
Seon Woo: And I think the new reason is cool

874
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:56,780
Seon Woo: because of the timing thing you mentioned to me.

875
00:44:56,780 --> 00:45:04,370
Seon Woo: You tell me when there is still time left,

876
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:08,430
Seon Woo: for the three of us, this is very necessary

877
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:11,420
Seon Woo: and brave. So I think

878
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:13,230
you're more amazing.

879
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,910
(Choking)

880
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:19,260
Seon Woo: No shedding tears allowed.

881
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:20,530
Seong Ho: I'm not crying.

882
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:22,650
-Seong Ho: There's no tear.
-Really?

883
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:24,550
Seong Ho: Because I've cried for a week.

884
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:26,950
Seong Ho: I can't cry anymore.

885
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:29,830
Seon Woo: Right? How is it? Are you feeling better?

886
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:32,250
Seong Ho: Of course.

887
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:35,030
Seon Woo: You feel better so soon? How about I say a little more?

888
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:35,720
Should I say a little more?

889
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,390
Seong Ho: Can't you be sad?

890
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:39,290
Chenghao: I was very happy.

891
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:46,110
Chenghao: I feel a little sorry to choose between the two of you.

892
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:51,620
Seong Ho: You might have a chance to know more and better people.

893
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:56,430
Seon Woo: I have no regrets for you.

894
00:45:56,430 --> 00:46:04,820
Seon Woo: It's my fault for not assuring you, and I understood it too late.

895
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,710
Seon Woo: I didn't have confidence in front of Jun Seong.

896
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:11,370
Seon Woo: So I have no regrets.

897
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:13,490
-Not at all?
-Seong Ho: Not even a bit now?

898
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:14,730
Seong Ho: What a pity.

899
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:17,660
In the end...

900
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:25,140
I think I liked you.

901
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:27,790
It's amazing.

902
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:33,050
-Seong Ho: I didn't expect I'd fall in love with you.
-Exactly.

903
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:42,530
Seong Ho: What? This atmosphere is weird. I think I'm looking at my first love.

904
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:46,810
-First love. It's like seeing first love.
-This feeling is annoying.

905
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:52,120
Seon Woo: I think I remember it like that.
-Seong Ho: Me too.

906
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:56,210
Really.

907
00:46:56,210 --> 00:47:02,610
Seon Woo: Dating is fun. We drew together. There's the painting.

908
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:03,900
-Seong Ho: You won't throw it away, right?
-No.

909
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:08,030
Seon Woo: I'll keep your painting for long.

910
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:10,750
Seon Woo: Can I throw it away? I might not want to throw it away.

911
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:13,570
Seong Ho: Can I hang it up?

912
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:16,650
Seong Ho: Can I hang it up?

913
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,940
Seong Ho: To be honest, I saw your anonymous chat yesterday.

914
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:22,790
-Seon Woo: Yes, Neutral Witch?
-Yes.

915
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:25,540
Seong Ho: You're a Maid 2, right?

916
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:32,130
Seong Ho: I can feel your feelings

917
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:34,460
Seong Ho: when I look at you and chat with you.

918
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:37,900
-Right?
-Seong Ho: That's really strange.

919
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:41,290
Seon Woo: I think so too.

920
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:46,540
Seon Woo: It feels like that.

921
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:48,240
Seong Ho: I think so.

922
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:53,540
(I want to hold it back, but I still shed tears)

923
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:55,820
My eyes get swollen easily.
(I want to hold it back, but I still shed tears)

924
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:57,110
It's bad for you.
(I want to hold it back, but I still shed tears)

925
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:02,390
Seon Woo: Call us whenever you're sad.

926
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:07,140
Seon Woo: Call me anytime after getting Jun Seong's permission.

927
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:09,780
Call us if you're tired.

928
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:12,120
(Want to keep in touch)
Call us if you're tired.

929
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:12,630
Seong Ho: I can't say I love you and I care about you,
(Want to keep in touch)

930
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:16,670
Seong Ho: I can't say I love you and I care about you,

931
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:19,640
Chenghao: but I'll continue to cheer for you. That's good.

932
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:27,410
I will continue to cheer for you.

933
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:32,090
-Seong Ho: Let's not look at each other.
-Right.

934
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:34,560
-Look elsewhere.
-Seong Ho: Look at the void and chat.

935
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:37,360
Seong Ho: I feel tears when I look into your eyes.

936
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:43,620
Seong Ho: It's weird. Why from the first time do I feel like...

937
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:44,820
That's right.

938
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:47,120
Seong Ho: We were somehow entangled.

939
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,270
Seon Woo: Don't worry about me.

940
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:51,670
Seong Ho: I'm not.

941
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,140
-Seon Woo: You're worried.
-I'm not.

942
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:54,140
Seon Woo: You're worried about me.

943
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:54,970
Seong Ho: I won't.

944
00:48:54,970 --> 00:48:57,080
-Seon Woo: Don't do this again.
-I won't.

945
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:00,620
-Seong Ho: I'll call you from time to time.
-Seon Woo: Okay.

946
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:06,330
(I tried my best. That's why I can smile at this moment)

947
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,520
-Seong Ho: I'm leaving.
-Okay.

948
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,170
Seong Ho: I can't stay here anymore.

949
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,910
Thank you.

950
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:17,530
Thank you for your consideration.

951
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:24,610
Seong Ho: I'm leaving.

952
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:25,280
Seon Woo: Goodbye.

953
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,200
I can't stay here anymore.

954
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:30,920
Seong Ho: See you later.

955
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,460
Seon Woo: See you later.

956
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:35,620
Seong Ho: I feel so heavy inside.

957
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:37,590
Seong Ho: See you later.

958
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:41,320
Seong Ho: I'm leaving.

959
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:42,760
Seon Woo: Bye.

960
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:59,070
Seon Woo: We can't say anything more. We ended the conversation in satisfaction.

961
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:06,150
(Seon Woo and Seong Ho said goodbye sincerely)

962
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:18,630
(The protagonist of the next conversation is Chung-ook)

963
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:23,570
Chung-ook: I'm so nervous.

964
00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:27,520
Chung-ook: More nervous than ever.

965
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:41,960
(Yung Hee is waiting for someone in a nervous mood)

966
00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:44,310
(Yung Hee: Will Seon Woo be there?)

967
00:50:44,310 --> 00:50:47,510
Yung Hee: Because I have a lot to say to Seon Woo.

968
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:56,930
Yung Hee: Sorry to keep you waiting.

969
00:50:56,930 --> 00:50:58,240
Chung-ook: Well, no.

970
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:04,230
Chung-ook: His expression was quite gloomy.

971
00:51:05,610 --> 00:51:06,960
Yung Hee: Half and half.

972
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,580
Yung Hee: Half of it was feeling disappointed because Seon Woo wasn't here,

973
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:13,360
Yung Hee: and the other half was feeling happy because Chung-ook was here.

974
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:17,350
Yung Hee: Actually, I wanted to chat with you more.

975
00:51:17,350 --> 00:51:19,370
Yung Hee: From the first day...

976
00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:20,800
Chung-ook: Me too.

977
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:27,790
(Two men who can't speak easily)

978
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:37,830
Chung-ook: Except for the first day, I called you every day.

979
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:42,660
Chung-ook: But when we were on the phone, I always said

980
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:48,230
Chung-ook: something like "thank you".

981
00:51:49,650 --> 00:51:58,700
Chung-ook: I feel like I've never expressed my feelings properly.

982
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:04,040
Chung-ook: So I want to talk to you.

983
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:09,800
Yung Hee: Seeing him nervous, I felt sad and sorry.

984
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,860
Yung Hee: I felt bad.

985
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:14,990
Ever since I first met you,

986
00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:17,680
(Chung-ook carefully expresses his true feelings)
Ever since I first met you,

987
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,370
Chung-ook: I think you're really cool
(Chung-ook carefully expresses his true feelings)

988
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:24,190
Chung-ook: I think you're really cool

989
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:28,390
Chung-ook: and charming.

990
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:31,940
Chung-ook: As we chatted and spent time together,

991
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:38,610
Chung-ook: I couldn't help falling in love with you.

992
00:52:38,610 --> 00:52:41,920
Chung-ook: I just want to be with you.

993
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:48,310
Chung-ook: I can see your cordial love for Seon Woo.

994
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:53,020
Chung-ook: So I was more careful.

995
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:56,110
Chung-ook: I don't know when

996
00:52:56,110 --> 00:53:03,060
Chung-ook: I started to kind of hate Seon Woo

997
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:10,120
Chung-ook: when I saw you suffer because of him.

998
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:17,340
Chung-ook: I wanted to express my feelings more.

999
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:21,780
-Chung-ook: But I don't want you to suffer more.
-Yeah.

1000
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:28,050
Yung Hee: Me too. I've been with you all the time.

1001
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:32,180
Yung Hee: You called me every night and showed your affection to me.

1002
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:34,340
Yung Hee: From the first day,

1003
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:37,050
Yung Hee: I fell for Seon Woo.

1004
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:39,030
Yung Hee: I feel that

1005
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:42,580
Yung Hee: you are in the same situation.

1006
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:46,130
Yung Hee: But I know how I feel.

1007
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:49,190
Yung Hee: I know you and I share the same thought.

1008
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:54,850
Yung Hee: So I really don't know how to comfort you.

1009
00:53:54,850 --> 00:53:57,160
But...So...

1010
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:03,440
(Yung Hee can't keep talking)

1011
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,940
I'm sorry. I...

1012
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:14,740
-I...
-Chung-ook: It's okay.

1013
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,670
Chung-ook: I saw the boundary he drew.

1014
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:21,920
Chung-ook: I can see that he's a brave man.

1015
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:26,520
Chung-ook: I like him because he's like that.

1016
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:31,980
Yung Hee: I want to tell him that my feelings won't change.

1017
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:34,160
Yung Hee: I clearly rejected him.

1018
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,810
Chung-ook: No, you don't need to feel sorry.

1019
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:44,440
Chung-ook: I won't feel sorry for my feelings for you.

1020
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:47,560
Chung-ook: I can't control my feelings.

1021
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:51,970
Chung-ook: Our actions with emotions

1022
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:53,020
Chung-ook: will be different.

1023
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:56,780
Chung-ook: But what you did is right.

1024
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:01,310
Chung-ook: On one hand,

1025
00:55:01,310 --> 00:55:04,260
Zhenghong: I'm telling you this

1026
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:06,490
Chung-ook: for myself.

1027
00:55:06,490 --> 00:55:09,850
Chung-ook: I want to make my heart feel better.

1028
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:14,890
Chung-ook: But thanks to you, anyway,

1029
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:19,660
I didn't feel lonely here all this time.

1030
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:25,420
Yung Hee: You've become my strength.

1031
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:31,640
Yung Hee: Because you've been supporting me and staying by my side,

1032
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:35,800
Yung Hee: I can last until the end.

1033
00:55:37,010 --> 00:55:38,500
(Smile)

1034
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:41,650
-Chung-ook: Well, I have something to confirm.
-Yung Hee: What?

1035
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:48,420
Chung-ook: Are you Dinosaur? Aren't you? No?

1036
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:49,320
Yung Hee: I'm Dinosaur.

1037
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:50,740
-Chung-ook: You're Dinosaur, right?
-I'm Dinosaur.

1038
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:53,680
Chung-ook: OK. I thought maybe, although I think it must be you.

1039
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:54,860
Yung Hee: How did you know?

1040
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:55,850
Chung-ook: What do you mean?

1041
00:55:55,850 --> 00:55:59,680
Chung-ook: You said you look like a dinosaur.

1042
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:00,660
-Chung-ook: Of course I know.
-Yung Hee: You remember that?

1043
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:01,550
(Amazing)
-Chung-ook: Of course I know.
-Yung Hee: You remember that?

1044
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:04,060
-Of course.
-Yung Hee: Yes. I think I just said it once.
(Amazing)

1045
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:05,600
Yung Hee: To be honest, I was quite surprised.

1046
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:08,580
Yung Hee: How did he know Dinosaur is me?

1047
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:10,910
Yung Hee: He really loves me.

1048
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:12,520
Yung Hee: I'm really touched.

1049
00:56:13,350 --> 00:56:16,080
Yung Hee: You knew I was in the group from the beginning.

1050
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:18,140
Yung Hee: So you said you suffer because of Yung Hee Kim?

1051
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:18,220
Chung-ook: Yes, I said that on purpose.

1052
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:19,620
(Chung-ook: Yeah. I said that on purpose)
Chung-ook: Yes, I said that on purpose.

1053
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:19,750
(Chung-ook: I said it on purpose because I thought maybe you didn't know how I felt)

1054
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:25,160
I said it on purpose because I thought maybe you didn't know how I felt.
(Chung-ook: I said it on purpose because I thought maybe you didn't know how I felt)

1055
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:25,290
(Chung-ook: I wanted to express it as much as I can)
I said it on purpose because I thought maybe you didn't know how I felt.
(Chung-ook: I said it on purpose because I thought maybe you didn't know how I felt)

1056
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:27,970
I wanted to express it as much as I can
(Chung-ook: I wanted to express it as much as I can)

1057
00:56:27,970 --> 00:56:28,690
(Chung-ook: I wanted to express it as much as I can)

1058
00:56:28,770 --> 00:56:31,010
Chung-ook: But you were good at responding.

1059
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:33,800
Chung-ook: You said you should teach Yung Hee a lesson.

1060
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,090
Chung-ook: It was cute.

1061
00:56:35,330 --> 00:56:36,580
Yung Hee: I pretended not to be me...

1062
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:38,180
-Yung Hee: Because I didn't want you to find out.
-Really?

1063
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:40,040
Yung Hee: Yes, because I didn't want you to find out.

1064
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:44,380
Yung Hee: I wanted to say thank you and sorry to you.

1065
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:47,860
Yung Hee: But I didn't have the courage. I didn't know how to tell you.

1066
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:49,360
That's why I had the chance to say it.

1067
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:52,180
(They shared what they couldn't say before)
That's why I had the chance to say it.

1068
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:52,770
(They shared what they couldn't say before)

1069
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:56,020
Chung-ook: If Yung Hee doesn't come to me, he should be happy.

1070
00:56:56,570 --> 00:57:01,590
Chung-ook: Yung Hee was hurt because of Seon Woo,

1071
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:04,630
Chung-ook: but he still comforted me. When I saw him like this,

1072
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:06,760
Chung-ook: I felt even more heartbroken.

1073
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:11,960
Chung-ook: Seon Woo knows how to be cold to Yung Hee.

1074
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:17,330
Chung-ook: I kind of hate Seon Woo.

1075
00:57:17,330 --> 00:57:19,530
Chung-ook: I want to teach him a lesson.

1076
00:57:19,530 --> 00:57:21,360
To hit his forehead.

1077
00:57:22,950 --> 00:57:24,610
Yung Hee: You didn't forget our promise, did you?

1078
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:26,680
Yung Hee: We agreed to go bungee jumping and take more challenges.

1079
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,020
Yeah.

1080
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:29,160
Yung Hee: Even if I leave here,

1081
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:33,060
Yung Hee: I'll keep in touch with you.

1082
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:34,420
Yung Hee: Thank you.

1083
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:37,420
Chung-ook: Thank you.

1084
00:57:39,310 --> 00:57:41,510
Chung-ook: I feel much relieved.

1085
00:57:41,510 --> 00:57:47,740
Zhenghong: In the last few days, it was really hard and annoyed.

1086
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:51,920
Chung-ook: I felt so relieved as I was troubled before.

1087
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:54,510
Yung Hee: I said what I wanted to say there today

1088
00:57:54,510 --> 00:57:56,280
Yung Hee: and heard what I wanted to hear.

1089
00:57:58,390 --> 00:58:03,900
(After the honest conversation, they two are closer)

1090
00:58:11,010 --> 00:58:16,190
(Hyeong Jin is waiting for someone to talk to)

1091
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:22,890
Hyeong Jin: About what I care about, I only care about Min Seong.

1092
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:32,670
(At that time, a man approaches Hyeong Jin)

1093
00:58:39,030 --> 00:58:40,570
(Burst into laughing)

1094
00:58:41,570 --> 00:58:47,550
(Hyeong Joon is coming to Hyeong Jin)

1095
00:58:50,670 --> 00:58:53,150
Hyeong Joon: Why are you standing up? Why are you suddenly standing up?

1096
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:56,270
Hyeong Jin: I don't know. I'm a little embarrassed.

1097
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:00,510
Hyeong Joon: Why?

1098
00:59:00,510 --> 00:59:02,490
Hyeong Joon: It's normal.

1099
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:07,770
Hyeong Jin: Do you know the situation before coming here?

1100
00:59:07,770 --> 00:59:09,490
-Hyeong Joon: No, I don't know.
-Me either.

1101
00:59:09,490 --> 00:59:11,300
Hyeong Joon: But I thought you would be here.

1102
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:12,540
Hyeong Jin: Me too.

1103
00:59:14,210 --> 00:59:21,840
(How would the conversation be with a subtle atmosphere lingering around them?)
