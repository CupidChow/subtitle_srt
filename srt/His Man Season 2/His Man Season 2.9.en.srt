-Hyeong Joon: Unbelievable. -Then call me brother.

41
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,030
Hyeong Joon: But you don't call me brother.

63
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,540

65
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,380
(Ah...)

66
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,990

67
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,710
Min Seong: People whose lifestyles are different from mine?

68
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,329
Min Seong: Well, it's a very common thing.

69
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:24,829
Hyeong Joon: Can you understand?

70
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,820
Min Seong: Of course. What else can I do?

71
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,470
Min Seong: They have their own work to do.

72

73
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,360
Min Seong: You have your own job.

74
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,090
Min Seong: Am I wrong?

75
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,090
Hyeong Joon: No, no. That's right.

76
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:40,050
Min Seong: Because I have my job. He has his job.

77
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,620
Hyeong Joon: Because lifestyle is difficult to coordinate.

78
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,320
Min Seong: Lifestyle?

79
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,630
Hyeong Joon: Because I've been running the bar for a long time.

80
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:53,300
Min Seong: So do you usually choose someone who matches your lifestyle?

81
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,680
-Hyeong Joon: No, not really. -No?

82
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,430
Hyeong Joon: I will fit into his lifestyle. I get up early to contact him.

83
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:06,800
Hyeong Joon: I sleep less to get up and contact him.

84
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,030
Hyeong Joon: Then I'll be sleepy.

85
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:13,180
Hyeong Joon: But I think contacting him is more important.

86
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:18,640
Min Seong: Well, he and I have different ways of working.

87
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,079
Min Seong: I'm a little worried about that.

88
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,720
Min Seong: But I think he'll be a very considerate boyfriend.

89
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,070
Hyeong Joon: Let's talk about the first impression.

90
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,280

Min Seong: I don't know what attracted me,

99
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,390
Min Seong: but I had feelings for you. I think feelings are important.

100
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,870
Hyeong Joon: Because you said you think feelings are important...

101
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:09,950
Hyeong Joon: As you know, we didn't talk much.

102
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,840
Hyeong Joon: We went to bed on the first day.

103
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,460
Hyeong Joon: After the first call...

104
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,350
Min Seong: You avoided me, didn't you?

105
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:18,850
Hyeong Joon: No, I'm just shy.

106
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,690

-Hyeong Joon: Oh, me.

107
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,350

108
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,730
Hyeong Joon: I didn't mean to avoid you.

109
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:26,480
Min Seong: If you felt shy, you could have said that.

110
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,280
Min Seong: What did that make me look like?

111
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,680
-Min Seong: You couldn't do that. -Hyeong Joon: Indeed.

112
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,330
Hyeong Joon: Anyway, I didn't mean to avoid you.

113
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,730
Hyeong Joon: It's because I'm shy.

114
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,470
-Hyeong Joon: OK? -Min Seong: OK.

115
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:39,900
Hyeong Joon: Especially when others are around, I really can't

116
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,010

117
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:45,560

Hyeong Joon: You didn't give the cookies to others, right?

126
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,040

127
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,420

128
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:08,640

158
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,530
It's cold.

159
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,300
Min Seong: Then I'll show you the techniques of the fishing master

160
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,260
Min Seong: by catching pond smelt.

161
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:42,740
Hyeong Joon: So you put the fish here?

162
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,140
Min Seong: I'm afraid of the bait.

163
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,890
Hyeong Joon: Let me help you.

164
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,659
Uh.

165
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,110
Min Seong: How should I tear it?

166
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,090
Min Seong: What should I do?

167
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,590
Hyeong Joon: Try to untie it.

168
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:15,800
Min Seong: You have to untie it like this.

169
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,570
Hyeong Joon: But what should we give them? This?

170
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:19,660
Min Seong: Give it to me.

171
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,460
Put this on the hook.

172
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,640
(Uh...)
Put this on the hook.

173
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,320
(Uh...)

174
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:22,970
(Focused)

175
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,200
So cold.
(Focused)

176
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:26,910
Hyeong Joon: What should I do?

177
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,350
Min Seong: I'm too cold.

178
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,650
Min Seong: I'll go get our down jackets.

179
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:33,710
Hyeong Joon: OK. OK.

180
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:37,120
Min Seong: I'll get our jackets. It's too cold.

181
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,870
-Min Seong: Wait for me. -Hyeong Joon: OK.

182
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,380
Hyeong Joon: Don't get lured by strangers with candies.

183
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,830
Min Seong: That's what I should say.

184
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,320
So cold.

185
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,470
(Humph)

186
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,410
(It's not easy to fish as expected)

187
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,670
Hyeong Joon: What should I do?

188
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,490
(Uneasy)

189
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,660
(Struggling with threads)

190
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,400
(Embarrassed)

191
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,190
Min Seong: Ah, it's cold.

192
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,200
Min Seong: I brought your down jacket. You should put it on.

193
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,870
Hyeong Joon: Yes, just put it on my shoulders for me.

194
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,560
-Min Seong: You want me to put it on your shoulders? -Hyeong Joon: Yes.

195
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:37,840
-OK? -This.

196
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,710
(Patting)
-OK? -This.

197
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,130
-Min Seong: How is it? -Hyeong Joon: OK. OK.

198
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,950
Hyeong Joon: Let's buy another one and open it.

199
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:50,040
-Min Seong: Why? -Hyeong Joon: No. It's entangled here.

200
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,140
(Hanging)
-Min Seong: Why? -Hyeong Joon: No. It's entangled here.

201
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,210
What?
(Hanging)

202
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:51,750
What are you doing?
(Hanging)

203
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,570
What are you doing?

204
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:54,880
Hyeong Joon: It's entangled with my gloves.

205
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,420
Min Seong: I'll do it again.

206
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,480
Min Seong: Look.

207
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,390
Min Seong: Hold the edge for me.

208
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,130
Hyeong Joon: Like this?

209
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:05,510
No, no. Grab here.

210
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,140
(Snap)

211
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,380
Min Seong: No.

212
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,620
Hyeong Joon: No gloves then.

213
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:18,090
Min Seong: We should do it one by one. Take them off one by one.

214
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:22,170
(Eventually, Hyeong Joon chooses to hang the bait with bare hands)

215
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:28,780
Min Seong: Hyeong Joon didn't like hanging bait either.

216
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,010
Min Seong: Because I said I didn't like it.

217
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:34,870
Min Seong: I think he did it to take care of me.

218
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,650
Min Seong: And looking at him fidgeting with the bait,

219
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:39,250
Min Seong: I thought it was good.

220
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,440
Hyeong Joon: You can put it in now.

221
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,620
Hyeong Joon: Please take this.

222
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,310
Min Seong: OK, thank you.

223
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,510
Hyeong Joon: I'll take a photo for you.

224
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,290
(Hesitating)

225
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,140
My hand is cold.

226
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:55,490
(Make a heart carefully)
My hand is cold.

227
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:56,700
(Make a heart carefully)

228
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:04,010
(Min Seong's face is blocked by the hand)

229
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,020
We make a deal that whoever catches a fish first,

230
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,780
(Finally, fishing starts)
We make a deal that whoever catches a fish first,

231
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,540
the other one needs to pick it up with a net.
(Finally, fishing starts)

232
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,730
OK.
(Finally, fishing starts)

233
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,850
Min Seong: It's time to endure.

234
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,790
(Sniffing)

235
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,040
(Pass)

236
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:22,160
-Min Seong: This is warm. -Hyeong Joon: Thank you.

237
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,390
Hyeong Joon: My hands are freezing.

238
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,180
(Smile)

239
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:28,400
(Min Seong: Why haven't we caught any fish yet?)
(Hyeong Joon: Yeah, why?)

240
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,400
-Why haven't we caught any fish yet? -Yeah, why?
(Min Seong: Why haven't we caught any fish yet?)
(Hyeong Joon: Yeah, why?)

241
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:30,720
(Min Seong: Why haven't we caught any fish yet?)
(Hyeong Joon: Yeah, why?)

242
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,340
Min Seong: Can we really catch it?
(Min Seong: Why haven't we caught any fish yet?)
(Hyeong Joon: Yeah, why?)

243
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,880
Min Seong: Can we really catch it?

244
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:37,220
Min Seong: It's a bit suspicious. There may be no fish at all.

245
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:41,080
Min Seong: We just need to catch a fish and take a photo.

246
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,480
Hyeong Joon: Let's wait.

247
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:47,460
-Hyeong Joon: I heard that we should do this -Min Seong: Who said that?

248
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,700
Hyeong Joon: I saw it in a comic book.

249
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:53,260
Hyeong Joon: Do you want to sprinkle some bait? This is bait, right?

250
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,330
Right?

251
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,500
No?

252
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,580
Put this...

253
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,650
(Sprinkle gently)

254
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:02,260
Min Seong: I'll look forward to it.

255
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,250
(Please)

256
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,150
(Empty hook)

257
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,100
Hyeong Joon: Disappointed.

258
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:19,750
Min Seong: But there must be a reason why people are over there.

259
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,020
There should be more fish there.

260
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,570
(Min Seong comforts Hyeong Joon instead)
There should be more fish there.

261
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,620
It should be easier to fish over there.
(Min Seong comforts Hyeong Joon instead)

262
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,890
-Hyeong Joon: Really? -Yeah.

263
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:27,480
Min Seong: No one is around here.

264
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,280
Min Seong: It means there is no fish here.

265
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,540
Min Seong: It's not our fault.

266
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,850
-Hyeong Joon: Really? -Yeah.

267
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,480
Hyeong Joon: OK.

268
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,410
Min Seong: It's not that we are not good at fishing.

269
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:36,690
Hyeong Joon: We didn't catch a single one.

270
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:41,360
Hyeong Joon: We didn't catch any fish. So, I'm a little sad.

271
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,970
Hyeong Joon: It'd be good even if we could only catch one.

272
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,680
Min Seong: Yes. But I don't think it's our problem.

273
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:53,400
Min Seong: We've tried our best. There must be something wrong.

274
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,400
Min Seong: It's so cold.

275
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,610
So cold.

276
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:05,830
Hyeong Joon: What do you want to eat the most now?

277
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:07,100
Min Seong: Hot soup.

278
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,200
-Soup? -Min Seong: Yes. Soup, soup.

279
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,100
Min Seong: What do you want to eat the most now?

280
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,380
Hyeong Joon: Now? Instant noodles.

281
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,530
Min Seong: Instant noodles. Instant noodles are good.

282
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:19,920
Hyeong Joon: I feel hungry. Shall we eat first?

283
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,040
-Shall we eat? -Yes.

284
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,830
-Hyeong Joon: Do you want to go to the snack bar?
-Min Seong: Sure.

285
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,280
Hyeong Joon: Let's clean it up before we go.

286
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,480
I'll take this.

287
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,660
I'll take that.

288
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,670
I'm so happy.

289
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,580
-I'm going to eat something warm. -OK.

290
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,580
Let's eat something warm.

291
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,460
It looks delicious.

292
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,510
Hyeong Joon: It's good to eat here. The vibe is good.

293
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,800
Min Seong: Instant noodles are supposed to

294
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,570
-Min Seong: be eaten outdoors.
-That's right.

295
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,520
Hyeong Joon: Are the noodles done?

296
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,740
(Touched)

297
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,740
How is it?
(Touched)

298
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,600
(Touched)

299
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,120
Really delicious.

300
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,620
Hyeong Joon: The fish seem busy.

301
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,360
-Yeah -Hyeong Joon: They seem busy today.

302
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,810
Min Seong: Yes, there must be a reason.

303
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,720
Min Seong: It's not that we can't catch the fish.

304
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,840
-Today -Min Seong: Is there cucumber in it?

305
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,000
Hyeong Joon: You don't like cucumbers?

306
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,600
Hyeong Joon: No, no cucumber.

307
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,040
No cucumber. No cucumber.

308
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,250
Min Seong: I can't eat cucumbers.

309
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,050
-Hyeong Joon: You can't eat cucumbers? -Yeah.

310
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,540
-Hyeong Joon: Have a bite. Do you want a bite?
-Min Seong: You can eat it.

311
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,480
(Wow)

312
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:31,370
Min Seong: How is it? Is it not good?

313
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,020
-Hyeong Joon: It's good. -Is it good?

314
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,530
Min Seong: Just one bite.

315
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,240
(Cute)

316
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,000
Yummy.
(Cute)

317
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,490
Yummy.

318
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,590
(Hyeong Joon gives up the last bun)

319
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,410
-You eat it. -You eat it.
(Hyeong Joon gives up the last bun)

320
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:55,870
Hyeong Joon: I'm full.

321
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:58,160
Min Seong: Stop lying.

322
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:58,330
(Whoosh) (Hyeong Joon: I'm really full)
Min Seong: Stop lying.

323
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,160
I'm really full.
(Whoosh) (Hyeong Joon: I'm really full)

324
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,150
Min Seong: This one is also left.

325
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,450
This one too.

326
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,020
Min Seong: You said you were hungry.

327
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,710
-Hyeong Joon: It's so delicious
-Min Seong: I think so, too.

328
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:24,070
Hyeong Joon: I can forgive the coldness and the fact that we didn't catch any fish now.

329
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,730
Min Seong: I can't.

330
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,490
Min Seong: Pond smelt. You brats.

331
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:32,400
You brats. I'll get it.

332
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:32,490
(After the date of fishing without catching any fish)
You brats. I'll get it.

333
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:38,370
(After the date of fishing without catching any fish)

334
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,450
Min Seong: Guess what I prepared.

335
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:46,380
What?

336
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,860
Min Seong: Our…

337
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,440
What?

338
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,680
Ta-da.

339
00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:00,510
Hyeong Joon: Min Seong bought a big ring at the store.

340
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,800
Hyeong Joon: Couple's rings.

341
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,250
Hyeong Joon: Min Seong wore one. He also put one on for me.

342
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,160
That part touched me a lot.

343
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,730
Min Seong: You don't like gummies, do you?

344
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:13,770
-Hyeong Joon: gummies? -Yes.

345
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:16,750
Hyeong Joon: I want some to gargle.

346
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,250
(Bite)

347
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,080
It's chewy.

348
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,650
-Min Seong: This is a bit hard. -Hyeong Joon: Yes.

349
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:29,720
-Hyeong Joon: Is the sea next to us? -Yeah.

350
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:30,630
-What a beautiful view. -So beautiful.

351
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,590
(The vast sea in front of them)
-What a beautiful view. -So beautiful.

352
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,370
(The vast sea in front of them)

353
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,590
Breathtaking.
(The vast sea in front of them)

354
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,990
-Min Seong: Isn't it beautiful?
-Hyeong Joon: Yes. It's very beautiful.

355
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,870
Hyeong Joon: So you can't eat cucumbers.

356
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,530
-Cucumbers. -Hyeong Joon: You don't like them or...

357
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:43,660
Min Seong: I hate cucumbers. I can't eat them.

358
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,960
Hyeong Joon: I used to like cucumber perfume.

359
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,020
-Cucumber perfume?
-Hyeong Joon: I don't remember whether it's cold or warm.

360
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,520
Hyeong Joon: There was a cucumber perfume.

361
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:51,140
(Min Seong: I like the perfume you're wearing now very much)
(Hyeong Joon: What?)

362
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,820
I like the perfume you're wearing now very much.
(Min Seong: I like the perfume you're wearing now very much)
(Hyeong Joon: What?)

363
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,350
-What? -Min Seong: Nonfiction.

364
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,890
-Hyeong Joon: Ah, mine? -Yes.

365
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,260
Hyeong Joon: But I like yours too. Is it Jo Malone?

366
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,480
Min Seong: It's not Jo Malone.

367
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,720
-Min Seong: Who uses Jo Malone?
-Hyeong Joon: Who uses Jo Malone?

368
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,570
-Min Seong: Who uses Jo Malone?
-Hyeong Joon: Yeah, who is it?

369
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:05,160
-Min Seong: I'm asking who it is.
-Hyeong Joon: I don't know.

370
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:05,910
Min Seong: Stop the car.

371
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,750
-Hyeong Joon: Give me a moment.
-Min Seong: Ah. Stop the car.

372
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,880
Hyeong Joon: Diptyque.

373
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,359
-What? -Hyeong Joon: What is it?

374
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:12,079
-Min Seong: Diptyque? -What is it?

375
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,130
Hyeong Joon: Sorry. What is it?

376
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:14,790
-Min Seong: Ah, stop the car. -No, I...

377
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,130
Hyeong Joon: I'm going to press it. I'll press it if you don't tell me.

378
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:18,060
Min Seong: What do you want to press? What do you want to press?

379
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,750
-Hyeong Joon: The accelerator. -Min Seong: Press it. Go ahead.

380
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,210
-Min Seong: We can die together. -Is it fun?

381
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:23,490
Is it fun?

382
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:24,700
Hyeong Joon: What is it? Your perfume.

383
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,380
-Min Seong: Tom Ford. -Right. Tom Fort.

384
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,900
I just remembered.

385
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,480
Who uses Diptyque and who uses Jo Malone? Confess.

386
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,530
(Jealous)
Who uses Diptyque and who uses Jo Malone? Confess.

387
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:31,550
Who uses Diptyque and who uses Jo Malone? Confess.

388
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,510
Min Seong: But I once said I like Diptyque.

389
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,600
Min Seong: Indeed I told you I usually use Diptyque.

390
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,520
I like Diptyque.

391
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,160
-That... -The one with hibiscus fragrance.

392
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,520
(They arrive at the date place)

393
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,160
Stop in the middle.
(They arrive at the date place)

394
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,530
Hyeong Joon: Let's go. Did you leave anything behind?

395
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:48,180
Min Seong: No. I brought my phone.

396
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,940
Min Sung: Thank you.

397
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,010
Hello.

398
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,530
Hyeong Joon: Iced Americano.

399
00:17:58,530 --> 00:17:59,960
Min Seong: Would you like a vanilla latte?

400
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,990
Vanilla latte?

401
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:03,780
Min Seong: How about Americano?

402
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:03,870
I want a vanilla latte. Iced.

403
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,290
(Cute)
I want a vanilla latte. Iced.

404
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:08,470
Hyeong Joon: Iced vanilla latte. And what do you want to eat?

405
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:10,290
Min Seong: It says sweet potato bread here.

406
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:13,120
-Hyeong Joon: Do you want some?
-Can I? Sweet potato bread.

407
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:13,230
Please give me one.

408
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,290
(Hyeong Joon: Please give me a piece of sweet potato bread)
Please give me one.

409
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:17,700
-Thank you. -Thank you.

410
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,110
Min Seong: I want to sit here.

411
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,400
-Hyeong Joon: Why here? -What?

412
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,380
Hyeong Joon: Do you know that people who sit on that side need to get coffee?

413
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,910
Min Seong: Okay, I'll get it.

414
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:33,610
(Hyeong Joon is checking the list secretly)

415
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,200
Hyeong Joon: How was today?

416
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,190
-Min Seong: You asked me how today was? -Yes.

417
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,850
Min Seong: I feel very happy. I mean it.

418
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:49,140
Hyeong Joon: I think today we created a special memory.

419
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,170
Hyeong Joon: If someone asks,

420
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:54,560
Hyeong Joon: I can tell them this is one of the unique dates.

421
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,300
-Min Seong: Me too.
-Hyeong Joon: Right?

422
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,710
I'm really happy.

423
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:01,410
-Hyeong Joon: It's cold but fun. -Because it's cold...

424
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,410
Min Seong: Is it fun because it's cold?

425
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:07,700
Hyeong Joon: Of course not. Everything I did with you was fun.

426
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,770
Hyeong Joon: But it's a bit mixed.

427
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:12,170
Hyeong Joon: Look at your expression.

428
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,700
Then...

429
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,690
-Min Seong: How many dates did you have? This is the third time, right?
-Hyeong Joon: Yes.

430
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:22,400
Min Seong: What's the ranking of this one out of the three dates?

431
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,460
Hyeong Joon: In the order of how happy I am?

432
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,560
Hyeong Joon: No.1.

433
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,750
-No. 1? -Yes.

434
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,310
-Min Seong: Really? -Hyeong Joon: Yes.

435
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:34,780
Hyeong Joon: It was fun with others.

436
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,090
Hyeong Joon: But this one feels a little different.

437
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,740
(He checks the list again)

438
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,870
-Hyeong Joon: How long did your longest relationship last?
-Min Seong: One year.

439
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,390
-One year? -Yeah.

440
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:57,890
Hyeong Joon: Do you have any ideal type in terms of appearance?

441
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:59,310
Hyeong Joon: What is your type?

442
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:03,030
-Min Seong: Appearance...
-Hyeong Joon: From appearance.

443
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:07,340
Min Seong: I like wide eyes.

444
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,500
Min Seong: I don't like narrow eyes.

445
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,030
Wide eyes like this.

446
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,340
(Eyes wide open)
Wide eyes like this.

447
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:11,820
Wide eyes like this.

448
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,410
Hyeong Joon: Like this? Then I'll be like this from now on.

449
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:14,510
-What? -I'll be like this from now on.

450
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:16,790
Min Seong: Bro, you have narrow eyes. Obviously.

451
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:21,790
Min Seong: I hope he has sharp features. I don't know how to describe it.

452
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:26,390
Min Seong: Not the gorgeous type. But...

453
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:31,010
Min Seong: You know you can hit me at once. There is a reason for that.

454
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,400
Hyeong Joon: I see.

455
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,480
Yeah.

456
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:37,010
Hyeong Joon: He said his type is simple and rustic.

457
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:40,050
Hyeong Joon: Then I thought, "That's indeed my style."

458
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:42,440
Maybe he likes that part of me.
(Hyeong Joon: Maybe he likes that part of me: being rustic and simple)

459
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,390
Hyeong Joon: Maybe I'm imagining it.

460
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:46,930
Ta-da.

461
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:51,060
Hyeong Joon: Wow, so cute.

462
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,970
-Min Seong: What do you think? -Hyeong Joon: It's cute.

463
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:56,180
-Min Seong: I want to take a picture. -It looks good.

464
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:03,240
Min Seong: It smells good.

465
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,380
Min Seong: It looks delicious. There are sweet potatoes inside.

466
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,670
Hyeong Joon: All sweet potatoes?

467
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:10,100
Min Seong: Yes, there's a whole sweet potato inside.

468
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,780
(Give Min Seong delicious food first)

469
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,550
Hyeong Joon: This isn't a sweet potato cake, is it?

470
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,770
Min Seong: I don't know. It's sweet potato bread.

471
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:27,050
Hyeong Joon: Sweet potato bread. It is more like bread.

472
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:32,530
Hyeong Joon: We didn't do anything yesterday but felt very busy.

473
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,030
Yeah.

474
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,310
(Hesitating)

475
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,380
-Can I ask? -Yes.
(Hesitating)

476
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,090
-Can I ask? -Yes.

477
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:42,400
-Hyeong Joon: Who did you give the letter to?
-Min Seong: What letter?

478
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,770
Hyeong Joon: The letter for roommates.

479
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:49,690
Hyeong Joon: To be honest, I...

480
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:52,600
Hyeong Joon: When I didn't receive your letter, I felt betrayed.

481
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,670
Min Seong: Who do you think I wrote to?

482
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:57,620
Hyeong Joon: I thought it was Seon Woo at first.

483
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:01,370
Hyeong Joon: But I heard you gave it to Chung-ook. Right?

484
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,200
-Hyeong Joon: Really? -Min Seong: Yes.

485
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,770
Why?

486
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:08,710
Min Seong: Actually, instead of living with someone I like,

487
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:11,400
Min Seong: I prefer to share a room with people who I can get along with.

488
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,840
Min Seong: You know, so we can chat comfortably.

489
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,440
Min Seong: But if I share a room with someone I like,

490
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,180
Min Seong: I may need to look pretty even when I'm asleep.

491
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:25,010
Hyeong Joon: But we've seen it all.

492
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:28,200
Hyeong Joon: We've seen each other sleeping in a Y shape.

493
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,150
Hyeong Joon: Or even an X shape.

494
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:31,050
-Min Seong: You saw it wrong. -No.

495
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,300
Hyeong Joon: No, I saw it right.

496
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,150
Min Seong: No, I never slept like that.

497
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,870
Hyeong Joon: Anyway...

498
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:39,750
Min Seong: I actually quite like Seon Woo.

499
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,810
Hyeong Joon: So what?

500
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:43,660
Hyeong Joon: I actually quite like Seon Woo.

501
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,460
Hyeong Joon: But I was a little irritated then.

502
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,490
Seon Woo...

503
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:50,450
Hyeong Joon: When you shared a room with Seon Woo,

504
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:52,300
Hyeong Joon: you know Seon Woo was cheering, right?

505
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,680
-Cheering? -Yes.

506
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,660
Hyeong Joon: I hated it.

507
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:59,560
Min Seong: I always chat with Seon Woo. It's really comfortable.

508
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,960
Min Seong: I feel comfortable and I get all kinds of advice.

509
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,230
Min Seong: I listened to stories about you. That made me comfortable.

510
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:13,200
Min Seong: I think this might be the last date.

511
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,420
Min Seong: So I chose you.

512
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,220
-Hyeong Joon: Really? -Yeah.

513
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,110
Hyeong Joon: I think...

514
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:24,070
Hyeong Joon: "Maybe it's because of the push from others." I had that thought.

515
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:28,500
Hyeong Joon: Why did he change all of a sudden? I can't help reading others' expressions.

516
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,350
-Min Seong: For me, there is no push.
-Hyeong Joon: Really?

517
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,590
Min Seong: What will things be like if I choose that?

518
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:37,230
Min Seong: It's right to respect my choice.

519
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:39,850
-Hyeong Joon: Thank you. -Min Seong: There is no push.

520
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:44,070
If there is a chance, if this is the last date,

521
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:48,210
Min Seong: I want to go on a date with you.

522
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,150
-Hyeong Joon: Thank you. -Min Seong: For what?

523
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:53,520
-Thank you. -For what?

524
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,710
Min Seong: This ring is very expensive. It has a big diamond on it.

525
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,340
Who else will give you such a big diamond?

526
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,060
(Joking)
Who else will give you such a big diamond?

527
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,340
Hyeong Joon: Only you.

528
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:08,050
Hyeong Joon: I was really touched.

529
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:10,130
Hyeong Joon: I was very happy.

530
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:16,090
Hyeong Joon: I'm curious about this. Up to now,

531
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:19,330
Hyeong Joon: have I ever got a minus?

532
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:22,230
-Min Seong: Minus? -Hyeong Joon: I think I have.

533
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:25,040
-Min Seong: Minus on how much I like you?
-Because I don't know how to express my feelings.

534
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:29,160
Min Seong: I'm not happy about your expression of feelings. That's it.

535
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,470
Min Seong: So, minus, yes.

536
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:32,630
(Bitter)
Min Seong: So, minus, yes.

537
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:33,780
(Bitter)

538
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,900
Indeed.
(Bitter) (Hyeong Joon: Indeed?)

539
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,640
Min Seong: Yes. But it can't be helped.

540
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:41,440
Hyeong Joon: I have minuses. Then how about plus?

541
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,880
-Plus? -Do I have any?

542
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,160
Min Seong: Yes.

543
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,230
-Min Seong: And it is a big plus for me. -Hyeong Joon: What is it?

544
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,310
-What? -What is it?

545
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:52,810
Min Seong: You have never shown your care for me.

546
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:56,720
Min Seong: But from yesterday or maybe three days ago,

547
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,960
Min Seong: I can see your concern for me.

548
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,450
Min Seong: It's really a plus.

549
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:02,510
Min Seong: He can express his feelings.

550
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:04,680
Min Seong: He wants to change. From a certain point of view,

551
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:08,800
Min Seong: the person who didn't do that is now doing it.

552
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,530
-Hyeong Joon: Then you gave me the cookies but went somewhere else.
-Min Seong: Who?

553
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:13,500
Hyeong Joon: It's you.

554
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:17,370
-Min Seong: What are you talking about?
-Hyeong Joon: No, I heard it anyway.

555
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,110
-Min Seong: You still hold grudges. -Hyeong Joon: No.

556
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:27,180
-Hyeong Joon: Maybe. I'm human too. -Yes, you're human.

557
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,270
Min Seong: But...

558
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:37,110
Min Seong: The person I like likes someone else.

559
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,730
Min Seong: Under that situation, I think some people will change their minds.

560
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:42,810
Min Seong: Have you ever thought of that?

561
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:44,100
-Hyeong Joon: Me? -Yes.

562
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,340
Min Seong: "I can try to approach others." That kind of thought.

563
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,110
Hyeong Joon: No.

564
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,650
No?

565
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,450
Hyeong Joon: Well...

566
00:25:56,670 --> 00:26:00,440
Hyeong Joon: Even if I'm not chosen in the end,

567
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,310
Hyeong Joon: I think I should respect it.

568
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,200
Min Seong: I was moved. It touched my heart. That's why it was a plus.

569
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,520
Min Seong: He didn't express his feelings at first. But he has changed.

570
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:18,690
Min Seong: Now he wants to express his feelings actively.

571
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:24,560
-Hyeong Joon: I know more about you today.
-Min Seong: Yes.

572
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,590
Hyeong Joon: This is really the first time. We'll get to know each other more in the future.

573
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:31,460
-Hyeong Joon: We have a few days left. -Min Seong: Yes.

574
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:34,010
-Min Seong: Today is a rich day. -Yeah.

575
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,900
-Hyeong Joon: Should we take a photo and go back? -OK.

576
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:39,270
(Min Seong: Take the camera farther because I want the ring to be in the picture)

577
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:43,450
Take the camera farther because I want the ring to be in the picture.
(Min Seong: Take the camera farther because I want the ring to be in the picture)

578
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:44,680
(Min Seong: Take the camera farther because I want the ring to be in the picture)

579
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:47,630
One, two, three.

580
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,720
Min Seong: Where am I looking at?

581
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:00,030
Min Seong: Why didn't you tell me to adjust my hair?

582
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:02,810
Hyeong Joon: Again.

583
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:04,020
Min Seong: Why didn't you tell me to adjust my hair?

584
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,630
Let's do it again.

585
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:08,440
-Min Seong: Are you laughing? -Hyeong Joon: This is really funny.

586
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,210
Min Seong: Are you laughing?

587
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:14,980
Hyeong Joon: I want to keep it.

588
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:18,280
Hyeong Joon: I'm so happy.

589
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,440
Hyeong Joon: We misunderstood each other.

590
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,030
Hyeong Joon: Because we didn't express our feelings.

591
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:28,140
Hyeong Joon: So although we have feelings for each other, we are distant.

592
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:33,370
Hyeong Joon: But now I can confirm.

593
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,940
After bitterness comes happiness.

594
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:41,220
Min Seong: He's more and more like

595
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,070
Min Seong: the type I usually date.

596
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,230
Min Seong: It's quite comfortable.

597
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:47,840
Min Seong: We are like friends, but it's still sweet.

598
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,010
It was a nice date.

599
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:52,120
(Men's House)

600
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,770
Let's go.
(Men's House)

601
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:54,660
(Men's House)

602
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:57,720
(Chung-ook and Hyeong Jin go out on a date)

603
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,910
This way.
(Chung-ook and Hyeong Jin go out on a date)

604
00:27:59,540 --> 00:27:59,620
(Chung-ook: Take my car today)

605
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,110
Take my car today.
(Chung-ook: Take my car today)

606
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:01,970
(Chung-ook: Take my car today)

607
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:05,950
Hyeong Jin: Why are you being so sweet?

608
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:10,760
Chung-ook: To be honest,

609
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,390
Chung-ook: I really want to go on today's date with Yung Hee.

610
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:13,650
(The date Chung-ook prepared?)
Chung-ook: I really want to go on today's date with Yung Hee.

611
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:16,770
(The date Chung-ook prepared?)

612
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,480
Chung-ook: Okay, seat belt.

613
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,740
Hyeong Jin: Are you nervous?

614
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,180
Chung-ook: Yes.

615
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,520
Hyeong Jin: I'm nervous in other ways.

616
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,730
Hyeong Jin: Because I know nothing about it.

617
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:31,930
Chung-ook: Yes, you don't know anything.

618
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:39,670
Chung-ook: But I feel much better.

619
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:42,660
Chung-ook: that I'm going to that place with you.

620
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,470
Hyeong Jin: That's great.

621
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:45,900
Chung-ook: Have you ever...

622
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,540
Chung-ook: When we first met...

623
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,030
Hyeong Jin: When I first showed up...

624
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:53,310
Chung-ook: When you showed up,

625
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:57,470
Chung-ook: he took a look at each of us, right?

626
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:00,580
Hyeong Jin: I really don't remember anything.

627
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:03,100
Hyeong Jin: I was shocked. I was suppressed by the situation and atmosphere.

628
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:06,110
-Hyeong Jin: Have you calmed down?
-Hyeong Jin: I can get used to it now.

629
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,970
Hyeong Jin: There are unexpected changes.

630
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:11,800
Hyeong Jin: There are too many things like that.

631
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:15,760
Hyeong Jin: Breakdown, breakdown, and breakdown.
-Chung-ook: Yes, yes.

632
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,610
Chung-ook: Breakdown, breakdown, then twist, and breakdown, and then twist again.
-Yes.

633
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:23,010
Hyeong Jin: That's why my thoughts changed a lot.

634
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:25,740
Chung-ook: This is a war of love, right?

635
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:30,540
-Chung-ook: Ah, I feel...
-Hyeong Jin: Are you nervous?

636
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:33,070
-Chung-ook: Instead of being nervous...
-Hyeong Jin: Happy?

637
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:33,110
(Happy) (Chung-ook: I'm a little happy)
-Chung-ook: Instead of being nervous...
-Hyeong Jin: Happy?

638
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:36,550
I'm a little happy.
(Happy) (Chung-ook: I'm a little happy)

639
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:38,720
Hyeong Jin: Do you think I'm special

640
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,190
Hyeong Jin: as your date today?

641
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:42,990
Chung-ook: You are really special.

642
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,530
Hyeong Jin: But I'll still be careful.

643
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:47,720
Hyeong Jin: You wanted to go on the date with the people you like.

644
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:47,840
(Hyeong Jin: It would be better if you could date the people you like)
Hyeong Jin: You wanted to go on the date with the people you like.

645
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,280
Wouldn't it be better for you to date them?
(Hyeong Jin: It would be better if you could date the people you like)

646
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,910
Hyeong Jin: I feel burdened.

647
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:58,620
Chung-ook: To be honest, it's really strange.

648
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:01,230
Chung-ook: I think I'm more comfortable with you.

649
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:05,360
Chung-ook: I'm grateful to him for thinking like that.

650

651
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:11,300
Chung-ook: Instead, I would have felt complicated if I had been with Yung Hee.

652
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:15,720
Chung-ook: I felt comfortable when I was with Hyeong Jin.

653
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,940
Chung-ook: Maybe it's because I shared a lot of emotions with him.

654
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:22,050
Chung-ook: It's my first time enjoying it.

655

Chung-ook: Well, I want to show a more approachable side of me on our date today.

672
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:02,880

673

00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:59,900
(Chung-ook is in a mixed mood and speechless)

816
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:15,450
Chung-ook: I had no confidence for a while.

817
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:19,240
Chung-ook: So in order to overcome it...

818
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:29,230
Chung-ook: I didn't express it to Hyeong Jin,

819
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,020
Chung-ook: but his words are very meaningful to me.

820
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,380
(Hyeong Jin's support comforted Chung-ook a lot)

821
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,540
Yes.
(Hyeong Jin's support comforted Chung-ook a lot)

822
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:42,540
(Hyeong Jin's support comforted Chung-ook a lot)

823
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:55,310
(Chung-ook and Hyeong Jin went home after their date)

824
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:57,790
Chung-ook: We're home.

825
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:58,340
Yes.

826
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,280
Chung-ook: Finally.

827
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,600
-Hyeong Jin: It feels like it's been a long time.
-Yeah.

828
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,560
Hyeong Jin: Is nobody here? Are we the first to arrive?

829
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,160
Chung-ook: Do they come back early and sleep?

830
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,510
I don't know.

831
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:09,820
Are we the first to come back?

832
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:10,440
(Chung-ook and Hyeong Jin came home first)
Are we the first to come back?

833
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,940
We came back first.
(Chung-ook and Hyeong Jin came home first)

834
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,150
I see.
(Chung-ook and Hyeong Jin came home first)

835
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,350
(Yung Hee and Seon Woo arrive soon)

836
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:15,970
Let's go.
(Yung Hee and Seon Woo arrive soon)

837
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:16,920
Thank you.

838
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,180
Seon Woo: We're back.

839
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,800
Yung Hee: We're back.

840
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:23,550
Hyeong Jin: You're back. Have you eaten?

841
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:24,610
Yung Hee: Yes, we have.

842
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:25,570
Hyeong Jin: What did you eat?

843
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:28,590
Yung Hee: Steak and rinyo.

844
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,290
Yung Hee: Do you know rinyo? It's my first time eating it too.

845
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:31,960
Hyeong Jin: Not gnocchi, but rinyo?

846
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,340
What?

847
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,200
Hyeong Jin: Rinyo?

848
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:35,540
OK.

849
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,830
Yung Hee: Wait.

850
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:39,520
At that moment...

851
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,990
Hyeong Joon: Eh, are we the first to come back?

852
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:44,220
Hyeong Joon: Hello.

853
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,300
Min Seong: Hello.

854
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:46,520
(There're people. Hyeong Jin: Did your date go well?)

855
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,370
Did your date go well?
(There're people. Hyeong Jin: Did your date go well?)

856
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:47,940
So many people.
(There're people. Hyeong Jin: Did your date go well?)

857
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:48,560
There're people.
(There're people. Hyeong Jin: Did your date go well?)

858
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,310
-There're people.
-Hyeong Jin: Where did you go?

859
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:52,050
-Hello. You're back.
-Hello.

860
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:53,380
Hyeong Jin: Where did you go?

861
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:53,820
What?

862
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:54,960
Where did you go?

863
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,670
Min Seong: Today, I had

864
00:38:56,670 --> 00:39:00,410
Min Seong: a hard day today.

865
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:03,650
Min Seong: It was really cold.

866
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:05,030
Hyeong Jin: Where did you go?

867
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:07,070
Min Seong: Fishing farm.

868
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:08,640
Hyeong Jin: Awesome.

869
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,670
Min Seong: It was too cold.

870
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:16,450
(Hyeong Jin seems to be in deep thoughts)

871
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:21,510
(Yung Hee: What's going on, Daniel?)

872
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:23,890
-Yung Hee: Did your date go well?
-Hyeong Joon: Yes.

873
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:26,040
Hyeong Joon: Do you know what we went doing?

874
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,250
Hyeong Joon: Fishing.

875
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:28,570
Really?

876
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:29,780
Where?

877
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:32,510
Hyeong Joon: I was joking when I said if we go fishing, it would be awesome.

878
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:34,260
Hyeong Joon: We really went fishing.

879
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,560
Really?

880
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,450
But...

881
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:36,970
Yung Hee: Did you catch any?

882
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:38,450
Hyeong Joon: Not a single one.

883
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:39,620
Hyeong Joon: None of them came out.

884
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,570
Yung Hee: I'm good at fishing.

885
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:43,210
Hyeong Joon: Really?

886
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:45,050
So tired.

887
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:47,770
Yung Hee: You're back.

888
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,050
(Peeping)

889
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,890
Min Seong: What did you do on your date today?

890
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:55,520
Min Seong: Indoor or outdoor?

891
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,630
Yung Hee: It's indoor.

892
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,200
Yung Hee: Car should be considered indoor.

893
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,200
Min Seong: It was really enjoyable.

894
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,800
Hyeong Joon: We're so jealous. We were really...

895
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,500
Very interesting.

896
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,580
Hyeong Joon: We were trembling outside.

897
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:06,940
Hyeong Joon: And we couldn't catch the fish.

898
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:10,510
Hyeong Joon: The fishing hook even got caught on the glove.

899
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:13,210
Hyeong Joon: I couldn't hang the bait.

900
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,380
Every time I used a hook...

901
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,250
Gosh.

902
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:18,470
Hyeong Joon: It was really embarrassing. Did you say you like fishing?

903
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:19,220
Yung Hee: Yes.

904
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,830
Min Seong: We went to the wrong place.

905
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:21,990
Hyeong Joon: No, it's okay.

906
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:23,310
-We met outside.
-Hyeong Joon: We were so happy.

907
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:24,880
-We were so happy.
-Min Seong: Yes, we were.

908
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,650
Min Seong: We were happy, but it was too cold.

909
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:29,090
Hyeong Joon: We had instant noodles there. It was good.

910
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:30,800
Min Seong: We bought couple rings.

911
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,640
Hyeong Joon: Mine is here.

912
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,060
Min Seong: What do you think of this couple ring?

913
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:36,880
Min Seong: Mine has a big diamond on it.

914
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,700
Min Seong: What a mess.

915
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,080
Hyeong Joon: Why do you say that?

916
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,550
(Seong Ho and Jun Seong come home last)

917
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:43,400
It's cold.
(Seong Ho and Jun Seong come home last)

918
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:43,940
It's cold.

919
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,020
-You're home.
-Seong Ho: Have you eaten?

920
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:45,800

921
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,310
-Yung Hee: We haven't…
-Seong Ho: Not yet, right?

922
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:50,180
Jun Seong: Why didn't you eat? Why didn't you cook?

923
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,180
-Yung Hee: Did you come back after dinner?
-No.

924
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:51,220
(Chung-ook: How can we eat with Chef Seong Ho here?)
-Yung Hee: Did you come back after dinner?
-No.

925
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,980
-How can we eat with the chef here?
-Yeah.
(Chung-ook: How can we eat with Chef Seong Ho here?)

926
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:54,410
I have to do it now.

927
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,250

Jun Seong: Okay.

932
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:03,850
Jun Seong: I don't know how to peel shrimps.

933
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:04,790
Jun Seong: Who can peel shrimps?

934
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:06,190
I've never peeled shrimps in my life.

935
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:07,710
-Min Seong: Do we have shrimps?
-Really?

936
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,710
I don't know how to peel them.

937
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:11,430
-Jun Seong: I've never peeled shrimps before.
-Okay, let's go peel the shrimps.

938

-Min Seong: Let's go down to the first floor too.
-Chung-ook: Yes.

939
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:24,530
Jun Seong: I heard we'll use shrimp head, shrimp head and shrimp tail.

940
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:24,960
Really?

941
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,470
-Chung-ook: Shouldn't we remove the organs too?
-Yes.

942
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:28,310
-I need to peel this.
-Hello.

943
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:29,880
I'm sorry, Jun Seong. I don't know how to peel shrimps.

944
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,470
I called a service.

945

Seon Woo: Is it fun?

952
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:45,230
Seon Woo: I came back today being curious about your dates.

953
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,490
Seon Woo: Did you get confirmation today?

954
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,730

Okay.

958
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:59,180
Seon Woo: Isn't this the feeling now?

959
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:03,040
Seon Woo: It's just like that.

960
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,400
Seon Woo: I can't say no.

961
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,580

Jun Seong: Garlic shrimps?

964
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:10,950
Pasta and...

965
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:10,980
Should we just serve the garlic shrimps like this?

966
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,800
(Jun Seong and Seong Ho are working closely to prepare dinner)

But I think I've gone too far.

I used everything I wanted.

Hyeong Jin: I caused trouble.

1063
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:26,520

(Hyeong Jin: In the Morning Mission, there were some people left)

Hyeong Jin: If I didn't want to go out, I can refuse again.

1067
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:32,930
Hyeong Jin: Do you understand? No?

1068
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:33,530
Jun Seong: No.

1069
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:34,250
-No.
-No. I didn't understand.

1070
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:37,220
-That's right. This is...
-The right to refuse.

1071
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:40,160
Seong Ho: So you asked Min Seong to go on a date.

1072
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,680
Seong Ho: Didn't Min Seong refuse? But later...

00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,110
Jun Seong: Did you ask Min Seong?

1074
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:47,520
Hyeong Jin: I asked Min Seong for a date. But he refused.

1075
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,970
Hyeong Jin: He said OK at first, but he changed it later.

1076
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:53,550
Hyeong Jin: Min Seong was struggling between two people.

1077
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:54,320
Hyeong Jin: I understood.

1078
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:57,020
Hyeong Jin: I didn't get stressed out because of this.

1079
00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:01,430
Hyeong Jin: But I misunderstood the right to refuse.

1080
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:02,910
Jun Seong: Ah, I sort of understand.

1081
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:06,590
Hyeong Jin: I thought those who were not chosen...

1082
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:08,060
-Free date.
-Must we go on a date.

1083
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:08,110
Yes, I thought I had to go out for a date.

Hyeong Jin: I thought we have to go on a date.

1087
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:13,680
So I took the initiative to say, "Let's go on a date."

1088
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,740
(Hyeong Jin: I said to Chung-ook, "Let's go on a date.")

(Vague)

1092
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,310
"Do you want to come to my house?" Like that.
(Vague)

1093
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:22,370
-Really?
-Like that.
(Vague)

1094

Hyeong Jin: Anyway, we went on a date in his house.

1098

He sang a very personal song at his home. That song was very important...
(Hyeong Jin: He sang an important song he composed to me at his home)

1101
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:43,120
Seong Ho: Is there a problem?

1102
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:43,880
Hyeong Jin: Yes.

1103
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,860
Seong Ho: What? What's the problem?

1104
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:50,880
Hyeong Jin: I was interested in Chung-ook. So I asked him for a date.

1105
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,220
Seong Ho: Is Chung-ook misunderstanding?

1106
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:56,970
Hyeong Jin: It's a little vague. Because I also misunderstood.

1107
00:46:56,970 --> 00:46:59,170
Hyeong Jin: I didn't realize I had the right to refuse.

1108
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:01,580
-It's possible.
-Always.

1109
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:03,690
Seong Ho: Did you tell Chung-ook?

1110
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:04,960
Hyeong Jin: We haven't had a one-on-one conversation.

1111
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,940
Seong Ho: I don't think you should tell us. You should go to Chung-ook.

1112
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:09,240
-But I...
-It's good for you two to talk to each other.

1113
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:09,270
(Hyeong Jin: But I don't know how much Chung-ook understands)

(Hyeong Jin: But I don't know how much Chung-ook understands)

1115
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:17,980
Jun Seong: In other words, Chung-ook has a misunderstanding about you)

1116
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:19,540
Hyeong Jin: I don't know.

1117
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:22,820
Jun Seong: Could it be your guess?

1118
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:27,280
Seong Ho: If you feel guilty, if you want to make it clear,

1119
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,080
Seong Ho: you shouldn't be talking to us. You should go to Chung-ook.

1120
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:33,010
Hyeong Jin: I don't know the exact situation.

1121
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:35,070
Seong Ho: That's not important.

1122
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:38,760
Seong Ho: Regardless if Chung-ook knows it or not,

1123
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:42,500
Seong Ho: I think you should tell Chung-ook.

1124
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:42,820
There may be some misunderstandings. But what I did

1125
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:46,730
(Seong Ho: Although there may be some misunderstandings,
what I did during the date)
There may be some misunderstandings. But what I did

1126
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:49,310
Seong Ho: was all from the bottom of my heart.

1127
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:51,910
Seong Ho: I did it with all my heart.

1128
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:54,170
Seong Ho: You should tell him these.

1129
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:55,500
Seong Ho: Go. Go talk to him.

1130
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:58,600
Hyeong Jin: OK, I understand what you mean.

1131
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:00,140
Seong Ho: Come on.

1132
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:01,090
You can make it clear.

1133
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:02,530
Jun Seong: Go have a good talk with him.

1134
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:06,950

Hyeong Jin: First of all,

1140
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:38,040
Hyeong Jin: do you know why I want to talk to you?

1141
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:38,820
Chung-ook: No.

1142
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:39,880
Hyeong Jin: Not at all?

1143
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,120
Chung-ook: Yes.

1144
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:44,590
Hyeong Jin: Do you understand today's date?

1145
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:46,460
Hyeong Jin: About what was on the mission card.

1146
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:48,170
Chung-ook: Mission card?

1147
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:50,610
Chung-ook: First of all, what I heard was

1148
00:48:50,610 --> 00:48:55,180
Chung-ook: we could ask someone who we have feelings for to go on a date.

1149
00:48:55,180 --> 00:49:00,200
Chung-ook: But those who are requested have the right to refuse.

1150
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:03,420
That's all.

1151
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:10,040
Hyeong Jin: Well,

1152
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:13,060
Hyeong Jin: I'll cut to the chase.

1153
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:16,620
Hyeong Jin: My understanding of the mission card was wrong.

1154
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:20,230
Hyeong Jin: I asked Min Seong for a date at first.

1155
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:22,220
Hyeong Jin: He said OK at first.

1156
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:24,850
Hyeong Jin: He said OK. The request for date was successful.

1157
00:49:24,850 --> 00:49:32,740
Hyeong Jin: I was preparing. I thought Min Seong would come with me, but...

1158
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:32,900
He suddenly overturned it when we were eating.

1159
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:37,770
(Hyeong Jin: When we were eating, Min Seong suddenly overturned it)
He suddenly overturned it when we were eating.

1160
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:37,930
Chung-ook: Overturned it?
(Hyeong Jin: When we were eating, Min Seong suddenly overturned it)
He suddenly overturned it when we were eating.

1161
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:39,120
Chung-ook: Overturned it?

1162
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:43,590
Hyeong Jin: He changed the option from yes to no.

1163
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:44,300
Chung-ook: Suddenly?

1164
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:44,900
Yes, he told me he was going on a date with Hyeong Joon.

1165
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:49,620
(Hyeong Jin: Min Seong told me he was going on a date with Hyeong Joon)
Yes, he told me he was going on a date with Hyeong Joon.

1166
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:52,780
Hyeong Jin: He suddenly rejected me.

1167
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:55,530
Hyeong Jin: I accepted it.

1168
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:58,260
But I thought the mission card required...

1169
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:02,630
Hyeong Jin: I took it for granted that the rest of us should form into couples

1170
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:06,530
Hyeong Jin: and go on a date.

1171
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:07,890
Hyeong Jin: But...

1172
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:13,480
Hyeong Jin: I'll start with the conclusion.

1173
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:19,350
Hyeong Jin: In fact, other than Min Seong, I didn't have anyone I would like to date.

1174
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:25,060
Hyeong Jin: If I knew I had the right to refuse, I should have rested at home.

1175
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:29,030
Hyeong Jin: But I went on a date later.

1176
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:33,180
Hyeong Jin: Anyway, what you saw on the mission card

1177
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:38,050
Hyeong Jin: was that you can ask the one who you have feelings for to go on a date.

1178
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:40,670
Hyeong Jin: In summary, you must think

1179
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:45,940
Hyeong Jin: that I went on a date with you because I had feelings for you, right?

1180
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:48,980
Chung-ook: Not necessarily. I didn't think so.

1181
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:51,400
Hyeong Jin: Well, so...

1182
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,650
Hyeong Jin: Now I realize that situation at that time.

1183
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:55,260
Hyeong Jin: There might be misunderstandings back then.

1184
00:50:55,690 --> 00:50:57,490
Hyeong Jin: All of this...

1185
00:50:57,490 --> 00:50:59,840
When I applied for a date,

1186
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:05,010
Hyeong Jin: I didn't know if you like me.

1187
00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:07,700
Hyeong Jin: It doesn't matter. Anyway...

1188
00:51:09,490 --> 00:51:14,140
Chung-ook: So what are you trying to say?

1189
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:18,930
Chung-ook: After hearing what you said, I think what you want to say is,

1190
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:24,820
Chung-ook: "If I knew I had the right to choose, I wouldn't have gone on a date with you today."

1191
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:26,530
Chung-ook: That's what I think.

1192
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:33,970
Hyeong Jin: If I knew I could choose today,

1193
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:39,490
Hyeong Jin: I wouldn't date today.

1194
00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:40,680
Chung-ook: Is that what you want to say?

1195
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:41,530
Hyeong Jin: Yes.

1196
00:51:41,530 --> 00:51:46,340
Hyeong Jin: Anyway, during today's date, what I did

1197
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:49,360
Hyeong Jin: may have caused some misunderstandings.

1198
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:56,780
Hyeong Jin: But I didn't pretend to do anything.

1199
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,110
Hyeong Jin: For me, it was a time

1200
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:01,940
Hyeong Jin: to get to know someone I didn't know before.

1201
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:03,890
Hyeong Jin: That's what I think.

1202
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:06,660
Chung-ook: I think so too.

1203
00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:12,250
Hyeong Jin: I was afraid you would be in a bad mood,

1204
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:19,050
Hyeong Jin: thinking, "this person wanted to be nice to me so he asked me out."

1205
00:52:19,530 --> 00:52:25,550
Hyeong Jin: Well, I went on the date only because I misunderstood the content on the mission card,

1206
00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:28,020
Hyeong Jin: not because of my own choice.

1207
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:36,050
Hyeong Jin: I think it was the misunderstanding that caused the whole situation.

1208
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:46,540
Chung-ook: I went out with you today

1209
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:50,280
Chung-ook: just to know more about you.

1210
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:52,640
Chung-ook: Instead of saying I like you,

1211
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:57,560
Chung-ook: I want to have one-on-one conversation with everyone else here.

1212
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:03,620
Chung-ook: So when I went on a date,

1213
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:04,900
Chung-ook: I didn't feel dissatisfied.

1214
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:07,030
Chung-ook: Everything you did...

1215
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:09,710
Chung-ook: Taking you to my home,

1216
00:53:09,710 --> 00:53:14,930
Chung-ook: Showing you the dog and letting you listen to my music...

1217
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:15,920
Chung-ook: In a way,

1218
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:19,500
Chung-ook: I was touched by you. You played with my dog well.

1219
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:23,460
Chung-ook: You also talked about my music with me.

1220
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:28,640
Chung-ook: So I'm very grateful to you.

1221
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:35,190
Chung-ook: I was under great mental pressure.

1222
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:39,400
Chung-ook: But you said a lot of helpful words to me.

1223
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,530
Chung-ook: To some extent, I was touched by you.

1224
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:44,660
Chung-ook: But you didn't say those because you had feelings for me.

1225
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:50,430
Chung-ook: You didn't do anything that made me misunderstand.

1226
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:51,830
Chung-ook: I just feel grateful to you.

1227
00:53:51,830 --> 00:53:57,180
(While dating Hyeong Jin,
Chung-ook is grateful to him)
Chung-ook: I just feel grateful to you.

1228
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:58,380
I don't know how you feel about me...
(While dating Hyeong Jin,
Chung-ook is grateful to him)

1229
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:00,460
I don't know how you feel about me...

1230
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:00,810
(On the contrary, Hyeong Jin is worried that his behavior will cause Chung-ook to misunderstand.
I don't know how you feel about me...

1231
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:03,600
-It's not that I feel something.
-Okay.
(On the contrary, Hyeong Jin is worried that his behavior will cause Chung-ook to misunderstand.

1232
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,190
-I didn't feel anything.
-Okay.
(On the contrary, Hyeong Jin is worried that his behavior will cause Chung-ook to misunderstand.

1233
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:08,790
I misunderstood what was on the mission card.
(On the contrary, Hyeong Jin is worried that his behavior will cause Chung-ook to misunderstand.

1234
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:10,370
But I want to say...

1235
00:54:10,370 --> 00:54:16,130
Chung-ook: That I think the situation is...

1236
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:20,260
Chung-ook: I understand what you mean.

1237
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:22,040
Chung-ook: But it made me feel...

1238
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:25,950
Chung-ook: Today, everything just happened naturally.

1239
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:32,940
Chung-ook: We said good things to each other.

1240
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:35,830
Chung-ook: I think we had a meaningful time.

1241
00:54:35,830 --> 00:54:37,660
Chung-ook: Even as friends.

1242
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:41,450
Chung-ook: But...

1243
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:44,030
Chung-ook: I really

1244
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:46,970
Chung-ook: don't understand why you have to bring this up.

1245
00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:51,110
-Well...
-Chung-ook: No. I just feel…

1246
00:54:51,110 --> 00:54:54,050
Chung-ook: Do you know what I'm talking about? The date is over.

1247
00:54:54,050 --> 00:54:56,620
Chung-ook: Both of us had a good time

1248
00:54:56,620 --> 00:55:00,100
Chung-ook: and got along well. If we don't feel for each other,

1249
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:02,920
Chung-ook: why did you have to tell me

1250
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:05,140
Chung-ook: that you actually didn't want to go on a date with me today after the date is over?

1251
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:06,780
Chung-ook: Why are you telling me this?

1252
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:09,210
Hyeong Jin: But if...

1253
00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:11,220
Hyeong Jin: If I didn't tell you,

1254
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:13,020
and if you didn't realize that,

1255
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:18,120
Hyeong Jin: you might think, "What? Does he like me?"

1256
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,850
Hyeong Jin: Something like that. I might misunderstand you.

1257
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:22,140
Hyeong Jin: If I don't say it now,

1258
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:26,290
Hyeong Jin: you might think I chose you because I had feelings for you.

1259
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:30,650
Chung-ook: You could've just asked me that.

1260
00:55:30,650 --> 00:55:30,750
(Chung-ook: "When I invited you on a date today, was that what you were thinking?")
Chung-ook: You could've just asked me that.

1261
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:33,640
Just ask if that's what I thought today.
(Chung-ook: "When I invited you on a date today, was that what you were thinking?")

1262
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:36,150
"When I invited you on a date, was that what you were thinking?"
(Chung-ook: "When I invited you on a date today, was that what you were thinking?")

1263
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:36,700
Chung-ook: Then I will say no. Then the misunderstanding will be cleared)
(Chung-ook: "When I invited you on a date today, was that what you were thinking?")

1264
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:39,660
Chung-ook: Then I will say no. Then the misunderstanding will be cleared)

1265
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:44,340
What do you mean?

1266
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:47,520
Well, what I understand is

1267
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:54,180
Chung-ook: that now you are like saying that today is a waste of time.

1268
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:57,800
Chung-ook: It sounded like that to me.

1269
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,680
Chung-ook: Do you feel that way?

1270
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,040
Chung-ook: You can be honest.

1271
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:10,810
Hyeong Jin: Of course it's not a waste of time.

1272
00:56:10,810 --> 00:56:13,690
Hyeong Jin: To be honest, today, anyway,

1273
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:15,870
Hyeong Jin: I wanted to date someone else.

1274
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:19,290
Hyeong Jin: You're not someone I must know. No.

1275
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:23,490
Hyeong Jin: If I didn't have to go on a date,

1276
00:56:23,490 --> 00:56:26,650
Hyeong Jin: I really didn't want to go out.

1277
00:56:26,870 --> 00:56:30,560
(Hyeong Jin is afraid that Chung-ook might misunderstand)

1278
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:36,740
(Chung-ook thinks Hyeong Jin's denying their good memories. He felt sad and disappointed)

1279
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,280
I didn't get a chance to know.

1280
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:38,810
(Conversation time starts from now)
I didn't get a chance to know.

1281
00:56:38,810 --> 00:56:39,930
(Conversation time starts from now)

1282
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:41,620
Wait. Let's go make the phone call.
(Conversation time starts from now)

1283
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:43,440
-No. Even if after seeing this...
-I'm going out.
(Conversation time starts from now)

1284
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:44,950
-No. Even if after seeing this...
-I'm going out.

1285
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:46,940
I still want to talk about us.

1286
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:48,170
Hyeong Jin: But I'm afraid I need some private time.

1287
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:50,250
Chung-ook: No, I think this is more important.

1288
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:51,720
Hyeong Jin: I'm sorry.

1289
00:56:54,550 --> 00:57:02,500
(Hyeong Jin left. Chung-ook's expression is very complex)

1290
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:08,640
Chung-ook: I think I was very satisfied today.

1291
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:11,170
Chung-ook: I seemed to have made a new friend.

1292
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:13,790
Chung-ook: Our relationship seemed to have become deeper.

1293
00:57:13,790 --> 00:57:15,760
Chung-ook: It was a great time.

1294
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,610
