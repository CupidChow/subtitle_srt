1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:04,310
(After having a hard time deciding, who would be the man Seong Ho calls?)

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,260
Seong Ho: Hello?

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,910
Seong Ho: I'll toast baguettes tomorrow morning. Can you come out earlier?

4
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,270
I'll see you at the time that we meet every day then.

5
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:18,020
Seong Ho: Got it.

6
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,210
Seon Woo: This is my first time matching successfully.

7
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:24,310
I see.

8
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:25,800
Seon Woo: Hurry and come back. It's cold outside.

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,060
Seong Ho: Okay.

10
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:37,040
Seong Ho: I called Seon Woo today.

11
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,420
Seong Ho: Because Jun Seong and I

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,860
Seong Ho: have never had a date. We've never had a deep conversation either.

13
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,640
Seong Ho: So I think it's a better decision to call Seon Woo,

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,440
Seong Ho: who I had a date with today and whom I've learned more about.

15
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,500
Seon Woo: I got a response. I got a call from Seong Ho.

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,330
Seon Woo: I felt that Seong Ho had already gone there,

17
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:02,210
Seon Woo: but my phone didn't ring.

18
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:05,050
Seon Woo: So I couldn't help but had a thought like "What should I do about it."

19
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:07,370
Seon Woo: I felt relieved after receiving the call.

20
00:01:11,289 --> 00:01:13,800
Seong Ho: Hello. Hello.

21
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,450
Jun Seong: It looks like he's done with the phone call.

22
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:20,340
Seong Ho: The weather is nice.

23
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:25,390
(The time for phone calls is over for today)

24
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,950
Jun Seong: I think he must like someone else, and that's why he didn't call me.

25
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:34,410
Jun Seong: I know he likes someone else, so he didn't call me.

26
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:40,920
Seong Ho: I felt the most complicated feelings in my life.

27
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,840
Seong Ho: I've always disliked people who measure others.

28
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,120
Seong Ho: But seeing myself doing so,

29
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,490
Seong Ho: I feel like I've become a bad person.

30
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:54,220
Seong Ho: I felt bad in my heart.

31
00:01:55,039 --> 00:02:00,810
(As time passes, the men's feelings are getting more complicated)

32
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,150
Seon Woo: Excuse me. I'd like to sit on this bed for a moment.

33
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,770
Min Seong: Okay, even though I'm not the owner of the bed.

34
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:13,940
Seon Woo: Why do you look a little unhappy? Is it just because you're too tired?

35
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,430
Min Seong: Me? I don't think I have any facial expressions.

36
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,280
Seon Woo: Oh, really?

37
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,040
-Min Seong: What's wrong? -Nothing.

38
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,850
Min Seong: Do I look a little unhappy?

39
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:22,380
Seon Woo: Oh, no. I just think it's similar to my facial expression.

40
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,150
Min Seong: Why would you look unhappy?

41
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,050
Min Seong: Did anything unpleasant happen today?

42
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,810
Seon Woo: To me? No. I'm more certain today.

43
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,020
Min Seong: So you have a person in mind to choose?

44
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,750
Seon Woo: Today was my first time matching. It was my first time matching today.

45
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,470
Min Seong: Matching?

46
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:40,610
Seon Woo: Matching means calling each other. It was my first time today.

47
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,370
Seon Woo: What about you? Didn't you say your matching was successful yesterday?

48
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,990
Min Seong: Yes, the matching was successful yesterday.

49
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:48,750
Min Seong: But we didn't call each other today.

50
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,030
Seon Woo: Really?

51
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,990
Min Seong: It was Hyeong Joon yesterday.

52
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,000
(Seon Woo: Yesterday? Didn't you call each other?)
Min Seong: It was Hyeong Joon yesterday.

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,829
-Yesterday? -Yes.
(Seon Woo: Yesterday? Didn't you call each other?)

54
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:54,110
Didn't you call each other?
(Seon Woo: Yesterday? Didn't you call each other?)

55
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,540
-Min Seong: That was my guess. -Ah, the voice.

56
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,720
-Min Seong: I guessed through the voice and feelings. -Yes.

57
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,340
Seon Woo: But he didn't call you today?

58
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,290
(Min Seong: Hyeong Joon didn't call me. I didn't call him either) (Seon Woo: Oh)
He didn't call me. I didn't call him either.

59
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,740
(Min Seong: Hyeong Joon didn't call me. I didn't call him either) (Seon Woo: Oh)

60
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:06,010
(Seon Woo: I called Seong Ho)

61
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,950
Seong Ho and I.
(Seon Woo: I called Seong Ho)

62
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:09,780
I called Seong Ho.

63
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,140
Seon Woo: Seong Ho, who I dated with today.

64
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,030
(Min Seong: Oh?)

65
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,570
Seon Woo: Did you match someone's phone today? Today,

66
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:23,680
Seon Woo: We both called each other.

67
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,300
Min Seong: Today?

68
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,150
Seon Woo: Yes. Today. Seong Ho and I.

69
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,880
-Oh. -What's wrong?

70
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,600
Min Seong: Whose call did I receive then?

71
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,910
Seon Woo: Did you think it was Seong Ho?

72
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:35,690
Min Seong: The voice I heard was strange to me.

73
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:38,520
Seon Woo: If you're confused… Really?

74
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,220
Min Seong: In that case,

75
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:40,329
(Seon Woo: It could be Hyeong Joon too?) (Min Seong: Right?)
Min Seong: In that case,

76
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:41,400
it could be him too.
(Seon Woo: It could be Hyeong Joon too?) (Min Seong: Right?)

77
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,000
Min Seong: Right? I'm so flustered now.
(Seon Woo: It could be Hyeong Joon too?) (Min Seong: Right?)

78
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,900
Min Seong: Right? I'm so flustered now.

79
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,260
Seon Woo: Right. Right.

80
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:45,280
(Min Seong: Right? No one else could call)
Seon Woo: Right. Right.

81
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,500
Right? There could be no one else.
(Min Seong: Right? No one else could call)

82
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:46,550
Their voices do sound a bit similar.

83
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:47,560
(Seon Woo: The voices of the two are a bit similar)
Their voices do sound a bit similar.

84
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:51,310
Min Seong: At first, I thought Seong Ho called me.

85
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:51,360
But in fact, he seemed to call someone else.

86
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,310
(Min Seong: In fact, Seong Ho seemed to call someone else)
But in fact, he seemed to call someone else.

87
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,870
Min Seong: So I thought it over.

88
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:03,660
Min Seong: If it wasn't Seong Ho, it's very likely that Hyeong Joon called me.

89
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:08,490
Min Seong: I didn't expect it. But today,

90
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:12,300
Min Seong: I was with Hyeong Jin.

91
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:16,120
Min Seong: So when I went out to make a call, I called Hyeong Jin.

92
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,240
Seon Woo: Really? You called Hyeong Jin?

93
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,230
-Min Seong: Yes. -Seon Woo: That's amazing.

94
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,089
Min Seong: I just made the call openly.

95
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,770
Seon Woo: But I think the person who called you today

96
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:25,810
(Seon Woo: It must be Hyeong Joon, right?)
Seon Woo: But I think the person who called you today

97
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,760
must be him, right?
(Seon Woo: It must be Hyeong Joon, right?)

98
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:31,150
Min Seong: The reason why my good feelings for Hyeong Joon diminish

99
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:35,970
Min Seong: is that he doesn't seem to want to talk to me.

100
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,280
Seon Woo: So, some…

101
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,840
Min Seong: He seems to be avoiding me.

102
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,680
(Min Seong: So I guess Hyeong Joon called me yesterday)
Min Seong: He seems to be avoiding me.

103
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,370
So I guess he called me yesterday
(Min Seong: So I guess Hyeong Joon called me yesterday)

104
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:41,890
So I guess he called me yesterday

105
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,180
Min Seong: because he became roommates with me.

106
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:47,870
Min Seong: After all, we live in the same room, so let's call each other.

107
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:47,900
This is interesting. This is interesting.

108
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,490
(Full of interest)
This is interesting. This is interesting.

109
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:55,390
Min Seong: But after he called me, we had no more communication.

110
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:58,630
Min Seong: I could always tell that he doesn't seem to want to talk to me.

111
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:02,280
Min Seong: I can't help thinking that he's probably not interested in me.

112
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,120
-Seon Woo: Hey. Catfish are catfish for a reason. -Why?

113
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,260
Seon Woo: Catfish are really catfish.

114
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,140
Why?

115
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:12,180
Seon Woo: It's not that they muddied the waters thoroughly but that they changed this…

116
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,460
Min Seong: Right, they changed the whole situation.

117
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,700
Seon Woo: That's right.

118
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,410
Where are you going?

119
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:18,890
-Are you going out? -Catfish.

120
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,180
-What? -No.

121
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:27,840
Min Seong: But to be honest,

122
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,910
Min Seong: I have good feelings for Hyeong Jin,

123
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:32,810
-but… -For him

124
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:36,890
(Min Seong: But… Seon Woo: For Hyeong Joon?)
-but… -For him

125
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:41,500
-Min Seong: But I still cares about him. -Yes, yes.

126
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:46,210
Min Seong: Hyeong Jin is the person who made me change my mind through conversations.

127
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:51,470
Min Seong: But Hyeong Joon is the person who made me have good feelings at first sight.

128
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:51,500
(Min Seong: I think my good feelings for them are fifty-fifty)
Min Seong: But Hyeong Joon is the person who made me have good feelings at first sight.

129
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,620
Now, my good feelings for them are fifty-fifty.
(Min Seong: I think my good feelings for them are fifty-fifty)

130
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,540
Min Seong: I'm wavering between them. There doesn't even seem to be a 1% difference.

131
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:01,730
It's torturing.

132
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,520
Seong Ho: Would you have drunk too much?

133
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,890
Seong Ho: You look kind of drunk.

134
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:12,870
Jun Seong: No.

135
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,840
Seong Ho: You're blushing now.

136
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,560
Right?

137
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,300
Seong Ho: It's the first time I've seen you blush so much.

138
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,510
Seong Ho: Are you going to drink to death today?

139
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:23,870
Jun Seong: Who did you date with today? It was Seon Woo, right?

140
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,900
Jun Seong: It must have been fun, right?

141
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:32,530
Seong Ho: We agreed to draw for each other. We went to the seaside.

142
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,290
Jun Seong: It must have been fun.

143
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,320
Seong Ho: Let's go together next time.

144
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:47,650
Jun Seong: I'm thinking whether I should become a clown starting tomorrow.

145
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,280
-Seong Ho: A clown? Why? -Um…

146
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,010
Jun Seong: Well...

147
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,670
Seong Ho: What's a clown?

148
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:56,110
Jun Seong: It's… to make others laugh.

149
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:58,150
Jun Seong: It's probably the feeling of giving up struggling and thinking no more about it.

150
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,550
Seong Ho: Already?

151
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,650
Jun Seong: It feels harder.

152
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:08,780
Jun Seong: Because we're now in a state of staying with all kinds of people.

153
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,600
Jun Seong: He might be curious about people of different kinds.

154
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:11,680
(Jun Seong: It's also likely that because Seong Ho has talked a lot with me)
Jun Seong: He might be curious about people of different kinds.

155
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,690
It's also likely that because he has talked a lot with me,
(Jun Seong: It's also likely that because Seong Ho has talked a lot with me)

156
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:15,170
It's also likely that because he has talked a lot with me,

157
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:18,470
Jun Seong: he isn't curious about me anymore.

158
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:23,100
Jun Seong: That's why I would often think that it's getting harder.

159
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,100
Hyeong Jin: Going in now?

160
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,570
Seon Woo: Are you asking me if I'm going in now?

161
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,430
Hyeong Jin: Yes. Going to the room.

162
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,190
Seon Woo: What's wrong?

163
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,710
May I come in and play?

164
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,510
Of course. Come and play together.

165
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,930
Hyeong Jin: What did you do for your date today?

166
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,030
Seon Woo: We were drawing today.

167
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:53,600
Seon Woo: Did you see the pictures?

168
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,450
Hyeong Jin: Did you draw it for each other?

169
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,800
Seon Woo: Yes. We both drew well, right?

170
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,180
Seon Woo: I think, since yesterday, this is the first time

171
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:05,670
Seon Woo: that we use non-honorifics after revealing our ages.

172
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,190
Hyeong Jin: No, we did this morning too.

173
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:11,040
Seon Woo: But that was only to the extent of saying things like "the hairstyle is not bad" or so.

174
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,330
Seon Woo: But I have something that I want to say.

175
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:17,340
Seon Woo: Until this morning, I thought the reason why you were a little cold

176
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,830
Seon Woo: was you were tired. And that is normal.

177
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:23,330
Seon Woo: But I still felt that way in the evening.

178
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:27,660
Seon Woo: So in the evening, I also thought you were a bit annoying.

179
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,520
Hyeong Jin: Me?

180
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,490
Seon Woo: I was sitting next to you when we were eating spicy chicken stew.

181
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:31,840
Seon Woo: I really concentrated on eating spicy chicken stew.

182
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,830
What?

183
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,510
Seon Woo: In order not to talk to you,

184
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,570
-Seon Woo: I really concentrated on eating spicy chicken stew. -Hyeong Jin: Today?

185
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:39,360
Seon Woo: Yes. But it was actually quite delicious too.

186
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:44,059
Hyeong Jin: No. I really didn't have the courage.

187
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:45,660
Seon Woo: You mean when?

188
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,690
-Seon Woo: When we were eating? -Hyeong Jin: In the morning.

189
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:47,830
-Seon Woo: Morning? -Yes.

190
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,710
Hyeong Jin: Anyway, the primary situation is…

191
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,380
Hyeong Jin: In short, it's what I told you yesterday,

192
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,630
Hyeong Jin: if we only look at the conclusion.

193
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,740
Hyeong Jin: So in the morning, I…

194
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,860
Hyeong Jin: Anyway, you came to my room first, when I was sleeping.

195
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,880
Hyeong Jin: You asked me to help you style your hair.

196
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,710
Hyeong Jin: I said, "Not bad, it looks good." And then I left.

197
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:10,800
(This morning, Seon Woo went to wake up Hyeong Jin)

198
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,790
Seon Woo: You're sleeping very well, aren't you?

199
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,060
Seon Woo: Everyone's up.

200
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:27,000
(Hyeong Jin leaves without saying a word)

201
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,030
Seon Woo: Can you take a look at my hairstyle?

202
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,740
Seon Woo: I haven't applied hair gel yet. Will I regret if I just leave it like this?

203
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,860
-Hyeong Jin: No, it's not bad. -Seon Woo: Not bad?

204
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,830
I was waiting for you to get up.

205
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:37,960
(Hyeong Jin subtly became indifferent to Seon Woo)
I was waiting for you to get up.

206
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,450
(Hyeong Jin subtly became indifferent to Seon Woo)

207
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,330
Seon Woo: Listen to me first,

208
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,940
Seon Woo: although it's not any important part.

209
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,990
Seon Woo: I'm good at styling my own hair.

210
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,500
Seon Woo: I was really just asking you if that was okay.

211
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,920
Seon Woo: It was already a situation about whether to apply hair gel.

212
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,520
Seon Woo: I really didn't mean to ask you to style my hair.

213
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,810
Hyeong Jin: Anyway, maybe each of us didn't know about the other's situation.

214
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,260
Hyeong Jin: For example, from my standpoint,

215
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,100
Hyeong Jin: it's "You asked me to take a look at your hairstyle. Are you asking me to help you change it?"

216
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,750
Hyeong Jin: That was what I thought.

217
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,850
Hyeong Jin: But when I finished washing up… After I finished washing up,

218
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:11,750
I learned about the situation that you chose Seong Ho.

219
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:16,740
(Mission card; Hyeong Jin: I learned about the situation that you chose Seong Ho)
I learned about the situation that you chose Seong Ho.

220
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,240
Hyeong Jin: So, from the beginning, it was I who took you away from the other person,
(Mission card; Hyeong Jin: I learned about the situation that you chose Seong Ho)

221
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,360
Hyeong Jin: So, from the beginning, it was I who took you away from the other person,

222
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,320
Hyeong Jin: but then you chose that other person.

223
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,850
Hyeong Jin: Anyway, it's someone who I have good feelings for

224
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:29,130
Hyeong Jin: went on a date with someone else

225
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,670
Hyeong Jin: and then came to me

226
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:33,070
Hyeong Jin: and made such a request without thinking?

227
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:36,690
Seon Woo: It's not that I want to leave some leeway, it's just…

228
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:40,470
Seon Woo: We met in the morning. As a person living under the same roof as me,

229
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,970
Seon Woo: you can be considered one who has talked with me the most.

230
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:46,430
Seon Woo: When I opened my eyes in the morning, I thought I'd better talk to you first.

231
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:49,810
Seon Woo: That's it. My original intention was simple.

232
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:55,680
Seon Woo: Me too. I probably only considered my own position too.

233
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,110
Seon Woo: It was most unbearable from yesterday to this morning.

234
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:03,070
Hyeong Jin: But I really respect your personality.

235
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:06,100
Hyeong Jin: But I hate it that way.

236
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,590
(Sigh)

237
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,230
Hyeong Jin: I see you as an amiable person. That's the image.
(Sigh)

238
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:11,200
Hyeong Jin: I see you as an amiable person. That's the image.

239
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,670
Hyeong Jin: But after today,

240
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:18,300
Hyeong Jin: my thought became something like "So that's his personality."

241
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,360
Seon Woo: But this is me. I want to like myself.

242
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,710
Seon Woo: That's it. That's what I'm like.

243
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:29,730
Hyeong Jin: The image of Seon Woo is itself one

244
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:33,560
Hyeong Jin: that is kind and amiable to everyone.

245
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,280
Hyeong Jin: He's the kind of person who would take care of others. But Seon Woo and I

246
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,040
Hyeong Jin: didn't start dating only after chatting a lot.

247
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,510
Hyeong Jin: So I misunderstood him a little.

248
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,320
Hyeong Jin: I wanted to talk to you, but somehow…

249
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,990
Hyeong Jin: Somehow I could just never

250
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,760
Hyeong Jin: get the words straight out.

251
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,120
Seon Woo: No, not to mention anything else, thank you for coming to my room first.

252
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,340
Seon Woo: Hearing what he said instead

253
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,440
Seon Woo: made me feel sorry for thinking of him that way.

254
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,780
-Min Seong: Are you going to smoke? -Hyeong Joon: Yes, do you want to?

255
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,000
Min Seong: Hey. Hey, hey.

256
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,130
(Tock)

257
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,910
Min Seong: Look at the bedside.

258
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,480
Hyeong Joon: What did you say?

259
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,280
Min Seong: Look at your bedside.

260
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:44,920
Min Seong: The cookies were my gift for the person who I have good feelings for.

261
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,060
Min Seong: I gave it to Hyeong Joon after distressing myself.

262
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,000
Min Seong: I used cookies to show my good feelings for him.

263
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:55,730
Min Seong: I was having a hard time choosing between two men,

264
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:00,690
so I called Hyeong Jin and gave Hyeong Joon the cookies.

265
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:10,500
(Hyeong Joon checks the gift left by Min Seong)

266
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,290
Hyeong Joon: I saw there're cookies.

267
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:27,180
Hyeong Joon: "Is he signaling me in this way?" Or,

268
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:30,510
Hyeong Joon: "Did he give it to me because he felt sorry?" That's what I thought.

269
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,880
Hyeong Joon: He never called me, so…

270
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:38,060
Hyeong Joon: Is this a gift of apology or a gift of signaling me?

271
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,800
Hyeong Joon: Should I say I'm confused?

272
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,940
Hyeong Joon: What's this? Can I eat it?

273
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,010
(Yum)

274
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,130
(Nervous for no reason)

275
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,200
(Satisfied)

276
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:10,920
(Where does Min Seong's heart actually turn to?)

277
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:17,580
(Men's House)

278
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:29,700
(Gets up)

279
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:34,810
(Hyeong Jin wakes up without an alarm)

280
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:39,770
(He makes the bed as soon as he wakes up)

281
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:48,310
(As usual, Seon Woo is the first one to get ready today)

282
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,640
(Knock, knock)

283
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,450
Seon Woo: Did you go to work out?

284
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:08,380
Hyeong Jin: Will you be making breakfast later?

285
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:12,730
Seon Woo: Actually, yesterday, I just took out the original ones.

286
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,850
Seon Woo: For today's breakfast, I plan to do what I prepared before.

287
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,470
Seon Woo: What's wrong?

288
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,270
Hyeong Jin: Well, I want to help you.

289
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,300
Seon Woo: Help me. Help me.

290
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,980
-Seon Woo: Are you going to the bathroom downstairs? -Hyeong Jin: Yes.

291
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,340
Hyeong Jin: I'll come back when I'm ready.

292
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:43,670
(For the first time, Jun Seong went to bed with an alarm set in Men's House)

293
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:47,420
(Seong Ho is still sleeping)

294
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:55,520
(Wanted to wake up Seong Ho; turns around)

295
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:03,570
(In order to cover the swollen face, Jun Seong wears a hat and goes to the adjacent bed)

296
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,190
(Fondling)

297
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,110
Jun Seong: Get up.

298
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,260
Seong Ho: What? Why are you up?

299
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:29,540
Jun Seong: I opened my eyes.

300
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:30,410
What?

301
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:31,440
I opened my eyes.

302
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,220
Seong Ho: You look different from usual.

303
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:39,820
Jun Seong: What's the difference? There are such times for me too.

304
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:44,830
Jun Seong: Though I am indeed a lazy person who sleeps in every day.

305
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:47,640
Seong Ho: You feel wronged, don't you? Although it is true.

306
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:51,100
Seong Ho: Because Jun Seong woke me up,

307
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,680
Seong Ho: it was a happy morning.

308
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:57,220
Seong Ho: I often joke and say, "We need to get up early."

309
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:02,720
Seong Ho: "You need to get up early in order to go on a date, right?"

310
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,300
Seong Ho: Seeing the way he looked when he woke me up,

311
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,349
Seong Ho: I was surprised.

312
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,599
Seong Ho: Did you sleep well?

313
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,410
-Seon Woo: You're asking me if I slept well? -Yes.

314
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,970
Seon Woo: I think I slept well today.

315
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,190
Seon Woo: How are we going to eat the yogurt?

316
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:22,329
Seon Woo: Is it okay to put some of each of the two flavors in the small bowl

317
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:24,690
Seon Woo: and add some granola to it?

318
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:26,990
Seong Ho: What troubles me is…

319
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,800
-Seon Woo: Don't you want to try every flavor? -No, not that.

320
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,870
Seong Ho: It's to divide the baguette

321
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:34,520
Seong Ho: and then fill it with Greek yogurt as if it's sauce.

322
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,980
Seon Woo: One of the pieces will be an egg baguette that I want to make.

323
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,290
Seon Woo: And for the other piece, we'll do as you say.

324
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,320
-Seon Woo: I think that should work. -Okay.

325
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,730
Seong Ho: I treat Greek yogurt as a meal.

326
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:46,150
Seong Ho: But others don't seem to think so.

327
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:48,380
Seon Woo: Because they don't eat breakfast.

328
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:51,630
Seong Ho: I'll go get ready and then come back.

329
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,500
Seon Woo: I'll just have fun leisurely.

330
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,580
Seong Ho: I'm always the only busy one.

331
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:07,100
(The loud alarm resounds through the Men's House)

332
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:15,520
(The alarm comes from Min Seong and Hyeong Joon's room)

333
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:23,450
(Min Seong's alarm rings again)

334
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:34,270
(As the sound of the alarm reaches the second floor, Chung-ook gets up)

335
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,470
(The person who actually set the alarm can't hear it…)

336
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:45,660
(Knock, knock)

337
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,830
Seong Ho: Aren't you going to get up?

338
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,030
Seong Ho: Aren't you going to get washed up?

339
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,250
Hyeong Joon: What time is it?

340
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,400
Min Seong: What time is it?

341
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,940
Seong Ho: Mr. Sung, hurry and wake up.

342
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,520
Seong Ho: It's 9:30 now, I think.

343
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,970
Jun Seong: Sir, could you please help me with my hair? Make it more natural.

344
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,350
Hyeong Jin: What if you don't like it?

345
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,570
Jun Seong: Then I'll just wash it again.

346
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,840
Jun Seong: Am I too honest?

347
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,970
Hyeong Jin: Sir, I'm too scared to make it.

348
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:16,480
Jun Seong: Just make it more natural for me. Is that okay?

349
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,290
Hyeong Jin: Make it a bit like this.

350
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,530
-Hyeong Jin: Make it like air bangs? -Jun Seong: Yes.

351
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,960
This is better.

352
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,300
Hyeong Jin: We don't use a hair roller.

353
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,380
Hyeong Jin: If it isn't curled later, I'll help you make it again.

354
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,460
Jun Seong: Thank you, Sir.

355
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,800
Hyeong Jin: Time to show your charm.

356
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:38,500
Hyeong Jin: When this is done, walk around and show it to everyone.

357
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,830
Hyeong Jin: Roll it for now. Come here if you're bored.

358
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,950
Hyeong Jin: When you come here later, bring the hair roller with you.

359
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,970
Jun Seong: Okay. Thank you.

360
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,210
(Looking around)

361
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:01,810
(Satisfied with his own appearance for no reason)

362
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,650
(Stops suddenly)

363
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,720
(Turns around)

364
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,030
Seon Woo: How should I react?

365
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,660
Seon Woo: Why do I feel so bad?

366
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,250
-Jun Seong: You? -Yes.

367
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,810
Jun Seong: Is that something you should say in front of me?

368
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:26,690
Seon Woo: What's wrong? What do you mean?

369
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:30,160
Jun Seong: Me? I couldn't even go on a date.

370
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,380
Seon Woo: No, it's just

371
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:34,620
Seon Woo: that there's someone who makes me feel uncomfortable. I'm a little tired.

372
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,000
-Jun Seong: There's someone who makes you feel uncomfortable? -Seon Woo: Yes.

373
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:39,580
Jun Seong: That's what makes it interesting.

374
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,610
(The two have nothing to talk about)

375
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:50,010
-Jun Seong: You went on a date yesterday, didn't you? -Seon Woo: Yes.

376
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,230
Jun Seong: Was it helpful for deciding who to call?

377
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,320
Seon Woo: Anyway, I've got a direction.

378
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:04,120
Jun Seong: Was it helpful for you to decide your direction?

379
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,890
Seon Woo: But strangely, the date on the day before yesterday wasn't able to start.

380
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:10,330
Seon Woo: I cared about it, and I felt sorry too.

381
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,800
Seon Woo: I have to be certain about what this feeling is

382
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,440
Seon Woo: before doing anything else.

383
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,180
Seon Woo: In terms of that, it can be said that I'm certain now.

384
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,520
Jun Seong: So who did you call yesterday?

385
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,020
Seon Woo: Me?

386
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:31,650
Seon Woo: I think I called the same person as you did. Wasn't it?

387
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:40,440
Seon Woo: I originally thought it was the hardest to figure out your mind.

388
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:44,530
Seon Woo: When I took a look yesterday, "Is it Seong Ho?"

389
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:48,090
-Yes. -Jun Seong: How could you tell?

390
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:49,800
-What? -Jun Seong: From which part could you tell?

391
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,490
Seon Woo: When we played Jenga.

392
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:55,320
Jun Seong: Sir, how long do I have to wear the hair roller?

393
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,380
Hyeong Jin: You are the most handsome person today.

394
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:59,010
Wait a minute. Oh, it's here.

395
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,420
Seon Woo: He's not answering me?

396
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:11,060
(When playing Jenga; Jun Seong: When have I ever answered OX? I don't remember)

397
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,550
When have I ever answered OX? I don't remember.
(When playing Jenga; Jun Seong: When have I ever answered OX? I don't remember)

398
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:15,330
Seon Woo: I'm asking you right now.

399
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:15,340
(Seon Woo: Was the person you chose yesterday Seong Ho?)
Seon Woo: I'm asking you right now.

400
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:18,030
Was he the person you chose yesterday?
(Seon Woo: Was the person you chose yesterday Seong Ho?)

401
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:18,490
(Seon Woo: Was the person you chose yesterday Seong Ho?)

402
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:23,170
Jun Seong: Of course it was one of them.

403
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,900
Seon Woo: I think I know who it was.

404
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,770
Jun Seong: If you know, please quit yourself.

405
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,270
I really hate it when others touch my man.

406
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,990
Seon Woo: He said he hates it when others touch his man.

407
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,790
Seon Woo: Jun Seong suddenly showed his fangs.

408
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:50,250
Seon Woo: When I came back to my senses and took a look,

409
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,900
Seon Woo: the person who I expressed my good feelings for on the first day has become my competitor.

410
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,900
Seon Woo: I was shocked.

411
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:01,440
Jun Seong: If you guessed right, then…

412
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,040
Jun Seong: I probably won't change.

413
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,170
-Seon Woo: Then you must be very angry yesterday. -Jun Seong: Hm?

414
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:13,970
Seon Woo: No?

415
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:16,450
-I wasn't angry. -Really?

416
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:17,990
I wouldn't be angry about that kind of thing.

417
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:19,890
He's not your man yet.

418
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:24,040
Jun Seong: Of course not yet.

419
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:27,680
Jun Seong: An unexpected answer came up.

420
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:31,250
Jun Seong: I was wondering what that means.

421
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,120
Jun Seong: But he's right too.

422
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,060
Jun Seong: Because he's indeed not my man yet.

423
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,350
Jun Seong: I can't have a love relationship based on good feelings.

424
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:44,090
Jun Seong: What I'm sure is that it's not good feelings that I have for him.

425
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,720
-Seon Woo: Oh? -Jun Seong: It's not good feelings that I have for him.

426
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,290
-It's not? -It's more than that.

427
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,570
Jun Seong: Sir, when will my hair roller be taken off?

428
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:58,720
Hyeong Jin: Go get changed. I'll finish it for you.

429
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,800
I know. I know.

430
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,050
-Hyeong Jin: Call me when you're done. -Jun Seong: Okay.

431
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:15,470
Seon Woo: I don't like love triangles.

432
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:20,330
Seon Woo: I don't like people who make me fall into a love triangle, either.

433
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,880
Seon Woo: I can only treat Seong Ho the best I can.

434
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,990
Seon Woo: But if Seong Ho wavers,

435
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:27,460
Seon Woo: and I have to hold on to him and don't allow him to waver…

436
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,270
Seon Woo: I actually don't want to do useless things in this aspect.

437
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:33,140
Jun Seong: I don't think this is a love triangle.

438
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,310
Jun Seong: Just like what I have been doing

439
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:38,860
Jun Seong: since the second day up until today,

440
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:42,010
Jun Seong: I will stay by his side as always.

441
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,230
-Seong Ho: Did you bring a spoon? -Seon Woo: Of course.

442
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,830
-What is he doing in his room? -He said he will come here soon.

443
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:56,220
-When is he coming? -He said he will come.

444
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:56,820
Hyeong Jin: The color of the T-shirt is so nice.

445
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:00,120
-I'm hungry. Don't you want to start eating? -Min Seong: Really? Thank you.

446
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,190
Why isn't he coming?

447
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:04,210
-Hurry and give him a call. -I'm calling him.

448
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:06,010
(Without people noticing it, Seon Woo's egg baguettes are ready)
-Hurry and give him a call. -I'm calling him.

449
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:06,230
(Without people noticing it, Seon Woo's egg baguettes are ready)

450
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,380
-Please take the plates. -Okay.
(Without people noticing it, Seon Woo's egg baguettes are ready)

451
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,990
-Please take the plates. -Okay.

452
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,980
Seong Ho: Wow, this really looks delicious.

453
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,750
Seon Woo: Please enjoy it.

454
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,870
Seon Woo: It's simple, but it's delicious.

455
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:19,120
Jun Seong: But it looks good. It's pleasing to the eye.

456
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,500
Jun Seong: I need to take a photo of it.

457
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:24,730
Seon Woo: Seong Ho.

458
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,250
Seon Woo: Have you washed the spoon?

459
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,770
Seon Woo: Did you wash it? -Seong Ho: No, I just used it to eat right away.

460
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:33,350
(Seon Woo personally washes it for him)

461
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,470
Chung-ook: Wow, it looks so nice.

462
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,390
Seon Woo: It must be delicious.

463
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:47,490
(In a subtle ambience, everyone starts eating breakfast)
Seon Woo: It must be delicious.

464
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:48,660
-I'll enjoy it. -I'll enjoy it.
(In a subtle ambience, everyone starts eating breakfast)

465
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,110
I'll enjoy it.
(In a subtle ambience, everyone starts eating breakfast)

466
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:54,740
-Min Seong: It's so tasty. -It's really good.

467
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,370
-Min Seong: The yogurt tastes really good. -Yes. Greek yogurt.

468
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:58,050
-Yung Hee: Yes, it's good. -What a blessing.

469
00:25:58,050 --> 00:25:59,320
Really. Because this…

470
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,190
Hyeong Jin: You chose this, right?

471
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:02,540
Hyeong Jin: Didn't you choose the Greek yogurt?

472
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:06,340
Seon Woo: Seong Ho loves Greek yogurt.

473
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:06,630
(Nodding; Hyeong Jin: Ah. Did Seong Ho choose it?)
Seon Woo: Seong Ho loves Greek yogurt.

474
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:08,650
-Ah. Did Seong Ho choose it? -Yes.
(Nodding; Hyeong Jin: Ah. Did Seong Ho choose it?)

475
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:12,880
Hyeong Jin: Is this part of the dating route? Or did you go shopping?

476
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,540
Seon Woo: It was during our date.

477
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,530
Seon Woo: He didn't eat much since he came here.

478
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:20,120
Seon Woo: So I was thinking that if there was Greek yogurt, maybe he could have eaten something.

479
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,420
Seon Woo: So I told him on the spur of the moment that let's go buy some.

480
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:35,700
Hyeong Jin: The ambience during breakfast this morning was very stifling.

481
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,870
Hyeong Jin: Maybe it's my own feeling.

482
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:39,790
Min Seong: I should say it's a feeling of tension.

483
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:42,410
Min Seong: It seems that everyone is sorting out their thoughts.

484
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:45,110
Min Seong: It's like the feeling has become a little heavier.

485
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:49,090
Hyeong Joon: It's delicious.

486
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:51,060
Hyeong Joon: Because I love food sincerely.

487
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,460
Hyeong Joon: Something special? I'm not sure.

488
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:00,640
Hyeong Joon: Was there? Was there? Well, um… I'm not sure either.

489
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:04,000
-I need to drink one more cup of coffee. -I think we should hurry.

490
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,670
(Jun Seong finished breakfast first)
-I need to drink one more cup of coffee. -I think we should hurry.

491
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:05,300
(Jun Seong finished breakfast first)

492
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,100
Please order quickly. Please.
(Jun Seong finished breakfast first)

493
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,490
-Seong Ho: Are you all done eating? -Seon Woo: Yes.

494
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:11,960
Should we clean up first?

495
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,440
-Seong Ho: Should we put away the dishes now? -Yung Hee: Let's start.

496
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,040
Wow, I'm really satisfied with the meal.

497
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,240
-I enjoyed it. -I enjoyed it.

498
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,760
I enjoyed it.

499
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,340
I'll do the dishes.

500
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:31,230
(Jun Seong is thinking about something alone in the room)

501
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:49,050
(Yung Hee was called away; he's a little flustered)

502
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,690
-Yung Hee: What's wrong? -Jun Seong: Sit down first.

503
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:03,030
-What's wrong? -Jun Seong: I'm curious about one thing.

504
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,780
Jun Seong: Who did you call yesterday?

505
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,270
Yung Hee: Seon Woo.

506
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:10,340
-Jun Seong: Are you sure you called Seon Woo? -Yung Hee: Yes.

507
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:12,820
Jun Seong: You called me yesterday.

508
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:15,260
-Yung Hee: Really? -Yes.

509
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:18,110
Yung Hee: Did I call you yesterday?

510
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:22,970
-Jun Seong: So… You went to make the call first, right? -Yes.

511
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:25,120
Jun Seong: Then I received your call.

512
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,520
Will the person I'm going to call overlap with the one you're going to call?

513
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,080
(Last night)
Will the person I'm going to call overlap with the one you're going to call?

514
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,090
(Last night)

515
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:29,680
Maybe.
(Last night)

516
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,280
Maybe.

517
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,340
I'll be right back.

518
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:32,490
(Yung Hee called Jun Seong)
I'll be right back.

519
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:32,710
(Yung Hee called Jun Seong)

520
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:35,000
Now, you can tell it's me just from the voice, right?
(Yung Hee called Jun Seong)

521
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,030
Because I called you too many times.
(Yung Hee called Jun Seong)

522
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:37,770
Because I called you too many times.

523
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:39,500
Yung Hee: I must've been crazy.

524
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,200
Are you sure?

525
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,770
-Jun Seong: You dialed the wrong number, right? -Right.

526
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:44,860
-Jun Seong: When I answered the call, I was flustered. -Really?

527
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:48,640
-Jun Seong: To be honest, we had a nice chat for the first time yesterday. -Yes.

528
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,230
Jun Seong: So I was wondering what was going on. Did you dialed the wrong number?

529
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:55,190
Yung Hee: Oh, what was wrong with me at that time?

530
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:58,000
Jun Seong: OK. That’s fine.

531
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:06,100
Yung Hee: Why did I do that? Gosh.

532
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:11,000
Yung Hee: I was thinking whether I should jump from the second floor.

533
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,400
Yung Hee: Why did I make such a mistake?

534
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,310
Yung Hee: Am I a big fool?

535
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:19,530
Yung Hee: That day, I discovered many new things about Jun Seong.

536
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:21,770
Yung Hee: I was thinking about him all the time that day.

537
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:23,670
Yung Hee: That’s why I would confuse him with Seon Woo.

538
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:34,030
Gosh.

539
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,850
Why was I so stupid?

540
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:50,640
(Yung Hee missed the chance to express his feelings because of this mistake)

541
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:12,390
Yung Hee: Can we talk for a moment? -Seon Woo: Yes.

542
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,810
Yung Hee: Actually, I was going to call you yesterday.

543
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:28,140
-What? -Yung Hee: I thought I called you, but I dialed the wrong number.

544
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:31,070
Yung Hee: I've just been told that I made the mistake.

545
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:33,880
Yung Hee: I mistakenly called Jun Seong because his number was up there.

546
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,830
Jun Seong, alright.

547
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:38,200
Yung Hee: I dialed the wrong number. I think I should tell you this.

548
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,960
Yung Hee: So I came here to tell you this.

549
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,410
Seon Woo: If Yung Hee is not interested in me anymore,

550
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:45,090
Seon Woo: I will feel a little sad.

551
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:47,060
Seon Woo: I know this sounds a little bit selfish.

552
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:49,220
Seon Woo: Yung Hee told me he still wants to choose me.

553
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:55,170
To me, this is a big encouragement.

554
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,760
Seong Ho: I wish all of us could hang out together.

555
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:02,850
Seong Ho: Jun Seong, what are you wearing today?

556
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:05,110
Jun Seong: Down jacket. I only have down jackets.

557
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:08,370
Seong Ho: Really? You look great in a down jacket because you're tall.

558
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:14,720
(These men start preparing for today's date)

559
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:17,430
Hyeong Joon: What will we do today?

560
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:18,890
Min Seong: Is it okay that I dress like this?

561
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,880
(Nodding)

562
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,400
Hyeong Joon: Your coat is the same as one of mine.

563
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,810
-Min Seong: What? -Hyeong Joon: Your coat.

564
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:25,880
-This coat? -Yes.

565
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:32,360
Min Seong: I think we will have a group date today.

566
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:39,980
(Seong Ho is the first one to find the mission card)

567
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:47,510
-What is that? -The mission card.

568
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:54,310
Chung-ook: Today is the date when we will switch rooms.

569
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,270
Today is the date when we will switch rooms.

570
00:31:56,490 --> 00:32:00,170
Please put your love letter into the mailbox

571
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:01,840
that belongs to the man you want to share a room with.

572
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:04,510
The mail boxes are beside the phone booth.

573
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,260
Hyeong Jin: What is it? Seong Ho: I think it's our mission.

574
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:11,930
It's the mission.

575
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:12,580
(The men are reading the mission card)
It's the mission.

576
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:16,070
(The men are reading the mission card)

577
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:20,650
(Shocked)

578
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:21,880
(Chung-ook: It looks like you can only have roommates if you can match)

579
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,550
It looks like you can only have roommates if you can match.
(Chung-ook: It looks like you can only have roommates if you can match)

580
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,810
Chung-ook: What will happen if a guy is not matched with another?

581
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:25,910
(Hyeong Joon: Then that guy will have to sleep in the living room)
Chung-ook: What will happen if a guy is not matched with another?

582
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,470
Then that guy will have to sleep in the living room.
(Hyeong Joon: Then that guy will have to sleep in the living room)

583
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:30,830
Min Seong: Those who are not matched with anyone else will sleep in the triple room?

584
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:38,560
Jun Seong: I thought what will come has come. Now we really have to switch rooms.

585
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,040
Jun Seong: If I can't share a room with Seong Ho,

586
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,590
Seong Ho will share a room with someone else.

587
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:46,700
Jun Seong: What should I do if he has feelings for someone else?

588
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:50,530
Jun Seong: I felt uneasy when I was thinking about it.

589
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,420
Chung-ook: I felt more anxious than I thought.

590
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,310
Chung-ook: Should I choose the man who is likely to choose me?

591
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:59,690
Chung-ook: Or should I choose the man I wish to know more?

592
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:02,700
Hyeong Joon: I have confidence in myself

593
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,960
Hyeong Joon: because of those cookies.

594
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,050
Hyeong Joon: I will share a room with Min Seong again.

595
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,700
Seong Ho: Everyone was good at controlling their emotions.

596
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,330
Seong Ho: I had no idea what was on their mind.

597
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:13,620
Seong Ho: Only I had a complicated expression on my face.

598
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:14,950
(Seon Woo and Yung Hee are chatting in the room)

599
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:16,240
Everyone knows
(Seon Woo and Yung Hee are chatting in the room)

600
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,810
a man looks more attractive when he keeps silent.
(Seon Woo and Yung Hee are chatting in the room)

601
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:19,620
(Seon Woo and Yung Hee are chatting in the room)

602
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,860
If he keeps quiet, he'll...
(Seon Woo and Yung Hee are chatting in the room)

603
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:21,630
If he keeps quiet, he'll...

604
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,090
Hyeong Joon: Amazing mission.

605
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:28,450
Hyeong Joon: Amazing mission.

606
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:29,380
-What's the matter? -Seon Woo: Mission?

607
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:32,040
-Hyeong Joon: They're downstairs. -Seon Woo: Are we late?

608
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,450
Let's go. Be quick.

609
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,420
Today we will switch rooms.

610
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:42,100
Put your letter into the mailbox that belongs to the man you want to share a room with.

611
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:44,300
(Sighing)

612
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:44,470
Seon Woo: My room is the place where I can gain energy and get myself organized,
(Sighing)

613
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:48,850
Seon Woo: My room is the place where I can gain energy and get myself organized,

614
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:51,580
Seon Woo: so I don't want to switch rooms.

615
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:55,050
Seon Woo: Because I've said that I don't even want to share my room with someone I love,

616
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:56,650
Seon Woo: I don't feel pressured.

617
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,380
Yung Hee: Some of us look very happy.

618
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,570
Yung Hee: Some of us don't.

619
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:04,410
Seon Woo: I think the guy you want to share a room with

620
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:07,760
Seon Woo: can be different from the guy you want to date.

621
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,920
-Chung-ook: I think so. -Seon Woo: I think the two can be different.

622
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:13,830
Jun Seong: I don't want to switch rooms.

623
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,940
Hyeong Jin: Don't you think you shouldn't say it aloud?

624
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:16,440
Really?

625
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,670
Hyeong Jin: You said it aloud.

626
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,060
Jun Seong: It's okay if only you heard it.

627
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:22,790
(Yung Hee: Should we write our letter right now? One by one?)
Should we write our letter right now?

628
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,360
Hyeong Jin: I'll go first.

629
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:28,250
We don't know what will happen later.

630
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,210
Should we clean our rooms first?

631
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:38,100
(Mailboxes through which you can express your feelings to your future roommate)

632
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:52,480
(Who will Hyeong Jin choose as his roommate?)

633
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:55,590
Hyeong Jin: Min Seong

634
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:59,520
Hyeong Jin: called me the other day to express his interest in me.

635
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,990
Hyeong Jin: So I thought he would probably choose me as his roommate.

636
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:04,740
Hyeong Jin: That's what I thought.

637
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,910
Yung Hee: Today’s mission is simple.

638
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,330
Yung Hee: From beginning to end, the man I want to choose never changes.

639
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:31,420
(This is a letter to the man in your heart)

640
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,850
Yung Hee: I haven't gone on a date with him yet.

641
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:36,420
Yung Hee: I don't know whether we will have a date in the future.

642
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:39,800
Yung Hee: I thought he and I would be closer if we are roommates so I chose him.

643
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,380
Chung-ook: Overthinking?

644
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:51,400
Chung-ook: I think I was overthinking but I don't know why.

645
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,420
Chung-ook: I thought it's my chance to pick a different man.

646
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,660
Chung-ook: The man whom I can get close to.

647
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:00,410
Chung-ook: This is what was on my mind.

648
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:07,380
(Who does Chung-ook want to be closer to?)

649
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:12,350
(Min Seong and Hyeong Joon are packing)

650
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,540
Min Seong: What should I do?

651
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:19,000
Hyeong Joon: What should I do?

652
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,200
I can only walk around.

653
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:22,980
(Hyeong Joon: I wonder who Hyeong Jin will write to)

654
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:26,240
-I wonder who Hyeong Jin will write to. -What?
(Hyeong Joon: I wonder who Hyeong Jin will write to)

655
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,640
I wonder who Hyeong Jin will write to.
(Hyeong Joon: I wonder who Hyeong Jin will write to)

656
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,090
I wonder who Hyeong Jin will write to.

657
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:29,430
Hyeong Joon: I wonder who he will write to.

658
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:32,390
Min Seong: Oh. But it's difficult for you to guess right.

659
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:36,720
Hyeong Joon: I'll write to someone who called me.

660
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:39,120
Min Seong: To someone who called you?

661
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,360
Min Seong: You mean the letter?

662
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,280
Hyeong Joon: Is this how you make the bed?

663
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:45,680
(Taking a break after cleaning up)

664
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,770
I'm hungry.
(Taking a break after cleaning up)

665
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:47,880
You're hungry now?
(Taking a break after cleaning up)

666
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,580
(Taking a break after cleaning up)

667
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:48,780
Are you crazy?
(Taking a break after cleaning up)

668
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:49,550
Are you crazy?

669
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:49,870
I made this yesterday.

670
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:50,980
(A photo of spicy rice cakes)
I made this yesterday.

671
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:51,210
(A photo of spicy rice cakes)

672
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:52,490
Jun Seong.
(A photo of spicy rice cakes)

673
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:53,060
They look delicious.
(A photo of spicy rice cakes)

674
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:53,860
They look delicious.

675
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,590
Hyeong Joon: Anything special about this ring?

676
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,340
Min Seong: Just an ordinary ring.

677
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,580
Hyeong Joon: Is there anything special about it?

678
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:00,650
Min Seong: Nothing special. You can try it on.

679
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:04,640
Hyeong Joon: Did you wear it here?

680
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,750
Hyeong Joon: Oh, your fingers are so slender.

681
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:08,250
Min Seong: My hands are small and my fingers are slender.

682
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,560
Hyeong Joon: Gosh, your hands are really small.

683
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,770
I know.

684
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:11,390
They are really small.

685
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:12,470
(Being intimate)
They are really small.

686
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:13,680
Very small.
(Being intimate)

687
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,910
Compare the other hand of yours with mine.
(Being intimate)

688
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,650
-Min Seong: My hands are very small, right? -Yes.

689
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:26,470
I also watch many fantasy movies.

690
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:27,160
Fantasy movies?

691
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,070
I like them.

692
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:29,170
-Fantasy movies? -Yes.

693
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:29,350
(Hyeong Jin comes to Hyeong Joon and Min Seong's room)
-Fantasy movies? -Yes.

694
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:29,630
(Hyeong Jin comes to Hyeong Joon and Min Seong's room)

695
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:31,190
What kind of movies do you like?
(Hyeong Jin comes to Hyeong Joon and Min Seong's room)

696
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,150
-Hyeong Jin: Movies? -Yes.
(Hyeong Jin comes to Hyeong Joon and Min Seong's room)

697
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:32,840
Hyeong Jin: Comedies.

698
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,110
-Comedies. -Comedies.

699
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,660
Hyeong Jin: I dare not watch horror movies.

700
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,830
Hyeong Joon: I like horror movies.

701
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:40,790
Hyeong Joon: I like those horror movies that are about fighting demons.

702
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:41,430
Hyeong Jin: You really dare to watch horror movies?

703
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,740
Min Seong: I like horror movies, but I dare not watch them.

704
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,690
There is a Crayon Shin-chan movie,

705
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:48,340
which is about some adults going to the amusement park.

706
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,300
Do you know it?

707
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:54,030
Min Seong: The two men who I was considering to choose between

708
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,920
Min Seong: as my roommate were in my room at the same time.

709
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,760
Min Seong: It was a little strange.

710
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,330
Seon Woo: I wanted to have a single room

711
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,930
Seon Woo: so I planned to write to myself.

712
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,310
Seon Woo: What should I do?

713
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:24,170
(Who will Seon Woo choose as his roommate?)

714
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:37,350
Jun Seong: I felt the most anxious.

715
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,940
Jun Seong: It's normal to be curious about what others are thinking.

716
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:42,860
Jun Seong: I’m a little nervous now.

717
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:45,190
Jun Seong: What should I do if I'm even more anxious?

718
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,000
Jun Seong: That's what worries me the most.

719
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,260
(Nervous)

720
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:09,330
Hyeong Joon: Actually, I want to continue to share a room with Min Seong.

721
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:11,120
Hyeong Joon: It’s hard to say if it’s a signal of love.

722
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:14,150
Hyeong Joon: But I've become more interested in him

723
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:16,720
Hyeong Joon: because he took good care of me.

724
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,980
Seong Ho: Hyeong Jin, can I ask you a question?

725
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:33,660
Who?

726
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,150
Seong Ho: Do you have feelings for anybody?

727
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:35,660
What?

728
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,970
Do you have feelings for anybody?

729
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:39,310
Hyeong Jin: To be honest,

730
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:43,040
Hyeong Jin: I wrote to the man I want to date.

731
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,230
Hyeong Jin: I am considering two men. But I'm still hesitating.

732
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:49,650
Hyeong Jin: I don't know. I'm tired of thinking.

733
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:52,690
Seong Ho: Do you think things will go well with them?

734
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,550
Hyeong Jin: No, I have no idea.

735
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:57,050
Seong Ho: I'm deciding between two men.

736
00:39:57,050 --> 00:40:00,140
-Hyeong Jin: You also don't know who to choose. -I don't know.

737
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:02,770
Hyeong Jin: Is it a problem for you from the very beginning?

738
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:06,170
Seong Ho: No. At first, I was considering only one guy.

739
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,400
-Hyeong Jin: Who was the first guy? -Seong Ho: Seon Woo.

740
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:13,990
Hyeong Jin: Anyway, Seon Woo was a candidate for me yesterday.

741
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:16,920
Hyeong Jin: Considering his appearance and my overall impression of him,

742
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:20,280
Hyeong Jin: I think Seon Woo is the perfect man for me.

743
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:25,140
Hyeong Jin: Although it was hard to get along with him on our first date,

744
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:28,710
Hyeong Jin: I still believe Seon Woo is a man who is kind to everyone.

745
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:33,290
Hyeong Jin: I know he has feelings for some other guy.

746
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:37,550
Hyeong Jin: So I'm not sure what I should do.

747
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:41,920
Hyeong Jin: You always called Seon Woo.

748
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,680
Seong Ho: I called him on the first, second, and third day.

749
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,950
Seong Ho: He didn't call me on the first and second day.

750
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:47,490
What?

751
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:50,880
Seong Ho: He didn't call me on the first and second day.

752
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:53,250
Hyeong Jin: Really? I don't know.

753
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:56,930
Seong Ho: After the date on the third day,

754
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:58,950
Seong Ho: I called Seon Woo.

755
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:01,370
Seong Ho: Before that, he showed no interest in me.

756
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:04,550
Seong Ho: When we were dating, Seon Woo and I had some discussion.

757
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:06,850
Seong Ho: Seon Woo and I both agreed

758
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:08,450
Seong Ho: that we are not each other's type.

759
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:09,890
Then how did you meet?

760
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:12,560
Hyeong Jin: In fact, if I only take one's appearance and personality into account,

761
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,530
Hyeong Jin: I may fall in love with

762
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:17,220
Hyeong Jin: someone as strong as me.

763
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,900
Hyeong Jin: In my opinion,

764
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,810
Hyeong Jin: compared with Seon Woo,

765
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:24,180
Hyeong Jin: chasing Jun Seong is more difficult.

766
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,600
Hyeong Jin: Seon Woo didn't call me.

767
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:30,090
Seong Ho: I don't know what Seon Woo was thinking either.

768
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:32,330
Seong Ho: I got the Arrow Card on the second day.

769
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:33,780
Seong Ho: Seon Woo got the Heart Card.

770
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,490
Seong Ho: At first, I asked him to have a date with me.

771
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:38,330
Seong Ho: Then you came so he and I didn't have the date.

772
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:40,070
Seong Ho: But later I called Seon Woo

773
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:43,990
Seong Ho: and told him that I hoped he could go on a date with me next time.

774
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:46,710
Seong Ho: Seon Woo replied, "Okay, I got it. Next time we'll have another chance to date."

775
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:48,330
Seong Ho: He added, "Deal. We'll have a date next time."

776
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:53,600
Seong Ho: The next day, I went on a date with Seon Woo.

777
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:57,930
Seong Ho: We had a conversation on the phone after the date.

778
00:41:57,930 --> 00:42:01,230
Seong Ho: You know Seon Woo's personality. He is a very nice guy.

779
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:04,520
Seong Ho: He called me because he really had feelings for me.

780
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:09,460
Seong Ho: But I don't know if he was just being nice to me. -Because of what happened yesterday.

781
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,120
Seong Ho: I think he decided to have a date with me

782
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:14,630
Seong Ho: because I had a deal with him.

783
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:17,770
-Hyeong Jin: Yes. Seon Woo is kind as you said. -Yes.

784
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:22,880
-Hyeong Jin: I think he just wanted me to get used to it. -Right.

785
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,170
Hyeong Jin: That was not a good date.

786
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:29,280
Hyeong Jin: It seems he dated me not because he had feelings for me. He was just being nice to everyone.

787
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,910
-Seong Ho: He just wanted to -Yeah

788
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:35,050
-Seong Ho: make every moment not that embarrassing. -Right.

789
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:37,340
Seong Ho: I don’t know if he meant it.

790
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,440
Yung Hee: Where is Seong Ho?

791
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,410
Seong Ho: I’m here.

792
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:42,130
-Yung Hee: You can go now. -OK.

793
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:54,410
Seong Ho: I thought about it for a long time.

794
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:58,610
Seong Ho: I was being a little bit selfish when writing the letter.

795
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:04,590
Seong Ho: I thought about it for a while. Then I decided to be honest in writing the letter.

796
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:08,040
Seong Ho: No fancy words. I just wrote it.

797
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:20,260
(Min Seong is the last man to write the letter)

798
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:31,260
(Who will Min Seong choose as his roommate?)

799
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:34,030

00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,190
What is it?

942
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:19,060
Yung Hee: Why do you all look unhappy?

943
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:22,770
Yung Hee: What's going on? What's going on?

944
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:26,020
(The layout of the house has been changed)
(single room, single room, double room, quadruple room)

945
00:51:26,210 --> 00:51:27,520

The rooms are arranged so quickly.

954
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,130
Jun Seong: I felt like tricked.

955
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:47,190
Jun Seong: Seong Ho chose me,

956
00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:52,630
Jun Seong: but there is only one double room in the house.

957
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:55,210
Jun Seong: It happened again. My expectation was too high.

958
00:51:55,210 --> 00:51:56,870
Jun Seong: So I felt annoyed.

959
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:58,650
Min Seong: Should I make my choices immediately?

960
00:51:58,650 --> 00:51:59,640
-Okay. -Okay.

961
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:00,670
Seon Woo: It's possible that he'll choose the single room.

962
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:02,420
Min Seong: Yes. It's possible that he'll choose the single room.

963
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:04,380
You've already thought about it, right?

964
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:04,570
(Min Seong, who received three letters, is the first man to choose a room)
You've already thought about it, right?

(Min Seong, who received three letters, is the first man to choose a room)

966
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:09,730
Min Seong: But I choose the double room.

967
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:14,090
Jun Seong: Then pick your roommate.

968
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:16,230
Seon Woo: Yes, after you make your choice. The rest can choose.

969
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,170
Min Seong: I choose...

970
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:21,450
Min Seong: Although living together sounds nice,

971
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:24,410
Min Seong: it’s hard for me to choose between two people.

972
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:26,530
Min Seong: Anyway, I have to choose one.

973
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:29,690
Min Seong: I choose…

974
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:30,610
Min Seong: Seon Woo.

975
00:52:35,270 --> 00:52:37,190
Hyeong Joon: I was a little nervous at that time.

976
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:39,650
Hyeong Joon: Seon Woo and I were competitors.

977
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:41,870
Hyeong Joon: I didn't feel good about it.

978
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:45,860
Yung Hee: Why did he choose Seon Woo as his roommate?

979
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:48,060
Hyeong Jin: Ah, it started to be tricky again.

980
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:51,040
Hyeong Jin: Min Seong expressed his interest in me yesterday.

981
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:55,700
Hyeong Jin: I also have feelings for him.

982
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:59,140
Hyeong Jin: I also had vague feelings for Seon Woo.

983
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:03,070
Hyeong Jin: But those feelings are more like regrets.

984
00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:07,630
Hyeong Jin: So I was a little bit troubled after knowing that they would become roommates.

985
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:12,040
Seong Ho: I was so angry and my face showed it.

986
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,940
Seong Ho: Why? Why did they two have to... Since when?

987
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,780
Seong Ho: I had a feeling

988
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:19,460
Seong Ho: that someone just came to my way

989
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:21,060
Seong Ho: and spoiled my plan.

990
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:22,890
Seong Ho: What made me the most angry

991
00:53:22,890 --> 00:53:25,190
Seong Ho: was his poker face.

992
00:53:25,190 --> 00:53:28,470
Seong Ho: He always wears a smile. He won’t show his feelings.

993
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:30,490
Seong Ho: No matter what you say,

994
00:53:30,490 --> 00:53:33,120
Seong Ho: he always looks optimistic.

995
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:35,030
Seong Ho: This makes me angry.

996
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:39,960
Seon Woo: I was happy at that time, but I suddenly realized it might not be proper to show my happiness on that occasion.

997
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:45,510
(How will the feelings of these men change?)

998
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:49,310
(That night, Men's House)

999
00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:49,700
Didn't you say it was impossible for you and Seong Ho to be together the other day?

1000
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:54,980
(It is very late now. Seon Woo and Jun Seong are still chatting.)
Didn't you say it was impossible for you and Seong Ho to be together the other day?

1001
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:56,940
I thought you'd never fall in love with Seong Ho.

1002
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:57,090
(Seon Woo: But the next day the date between I and Seong Ho didn't work out.)
I thought you'd never fall in love with Seong Ho.

1003
00:53:57,090 --> 00:54:02,820
Seon Woo: But the next day the date between I and Seong Ho didn't work out.
(Seon Woo: But the next day the date between I and Seong Ho didn't work out.)

1004
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:05,510
Seon Woo: When I was dating Hyeong Jin,

1005
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:07,310
Seon Woo: I thought of Seong Ho all the time.

1006
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:11,660
Seon Woo: I just couldn't get him out of my head. I think it started from that time.

1007
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:16,420
Seon Woo: But when we were playing Jenga

1008
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:17,700
Seon Woo: and someone asked you who you had feelings for,

1009
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:19,740
Seon Woo: you pointed to the left of Seong Ho.

1010
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:24,950
Seon Woo: Suddenly, the man I showed my feelings for

1011
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:27,890
Seon Woo: is now my biggest competitor.

1012
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:31,070
Seon Woo: I was really surprised. Really.

1013
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:33,380
Seon Woo: When I heard people shouldn't date each other when they only have feelings,

1014
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:35,610
Seon Woo: I was really surprised.

1015
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:38,430
Jun Seong: Now

1016
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,340
Jun Seong: I'm not interested anybody else.

1017
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:50,170
Jun Seong: I’m only interested in him.

1018
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:55,600
Jun Seong: I can see everything that happened surrounding him.

1019
00:54:56,450 --> 00:54:59,920
Jun Seong: Though I look indifferent to those things,

1020
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,650
Jun Seong: I have been paying attention to them.

1021
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,600
Jun Seong: So I want to ask you

1022
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:11,360
Jun Seong: what kind of feelings you have.

1023
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:14,060
Jun Seong: It's not about how strong my feelings are.

1024
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:16,590
Jun Seong: Or how strong your feelings are.

1025
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:22,160
Jun Seong: Now I only hope you can try your best.

1026
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,410
Seon Woo: It is so cool that you can say this.

1027
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:29,710
Seon Woo: Compared with my feelings for Seong Ho,

1028
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:36,640
Seon Woo: your feelings for him are stronger and more complete.

1029
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,490
Seon Woo: You are more determined. Knowing this

1030
00:55:39,490 --> 00:55:42,820
Seon Woo: makes my thoughts more complicated.

1031
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:48,370
Seon Woo: I felt frustrated when I saw Jun Seong being reckless.

1032
00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:52,230
Seon Woo: I thought I was not that handsome so I felt upset.

1033
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:52,550
I won't let my guard down while I'm here.

1034
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:56,010
(The continuous conversation between the two men)
I won't let my guard down while I'm here.

1035
00:55:56,010 --> 00:55:57,680
Because I don't want to let my guard down,
(The continuous conversation between the two men)

1036
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,180
Because I don't want to let my guard down,

1037
00:55:59,180 --> 00:55:59,690
I won't expect anything before the end.

1038
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:04,170
(Seong Ho is listening to their conversation)
I won't expect anything before the end.

1039
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:05,640
(Seong Ho is listening to their conversation)

1040
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:09,930
Seon Woo: When I'm looking at you, I start to doubt myself.

1041
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:12,280
Seon Woo: But today I managed to get things straight.

1042
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:13,940
Seon Woo: I not only care about your thoughts.

1043
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:15,990
Seon Woo: I care a lot how everyone else thinks of me.

1044
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:19,910
Seon Woo: I'm just like this. This is who I am.

1045
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:24,120
Seon Woo: There's a guy who has been calling me

1046
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:26,340
Seon Woo: since the very first day but I've never replied.

1047
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:28,160
Seon Woo: Thinking about how he would feel

1048
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,280
Seon Woo: makes me want to date him the next time if I get the chance.

1049
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:33,060
Seon Woo: If I really have that chance, I will date him, not Seong Ho.

1050
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:35,960
Seon Woo: That's the best I can do.

1051
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:38,920
Seon Woo: I think it's necessary

1052
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:41,390
Seon Woo: for me to have that date with him before everything's over.

1053
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:44,230
Seon Woo: If I miss Seong Ho because of this,

1054
00:56:44,230 --> 00:56:46,450
Seon Woo: I can accept that.

1055
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:48,370
For me, others' home is a place like this.

1056
00:56:48,370 --> 00:56:49,320
(Seong Ho leaves eventually)
For me, others' home is a place like this.

1057
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:51,230
This is my attitude from now on.
(Seong Ho leaves eventually)

1058
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:52,270
To know what I want to know.
(Seong Ho leaves eventually)

1059
00:56:52,270 --> 00:56:53,480
To know what I want to know.

1060
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:54,240
(Seong Ho missed a few words)
To know what I want to know.

1061
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:54,920
(Seong Ho missed a few words)

1062
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:57,050
Just consider one thing.
(Seong Ho missed a few words)

1063
00:56:57,050 --> 00:56:59,880
I'm sure that he's a special person to me.

1064
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:03,580
Seong Ho is special to me.

1065
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:05,450
He is a special person.

1066
00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:06,530
I don't believe that the stronger my feelings are,

1067
00:57:06,530 --> 00:57:10,470
(What kind of relationship will the three men have? Men's House)
I don't believe that the stronger my feelings are,

1068
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:11,660
the better results we will have in the end.
(What kind of relationship will the three men have? Men's House)

1069
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:13,000
the better results we will have in the end.
