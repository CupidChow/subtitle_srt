00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:07,790
Jun Seong: I didn't expect Seon Woo to call me.

1150
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:10,390
Jun Seong: What? Why? What do you mean?

1151
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:12,600
Is he interested in me or thankful to me?

1152
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:18,380
Jun Seong: I think It's a bit complicated.

1153
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:26,910
Seon Woo: I didn't have a good first impression.

1154
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:30,100
Seon Woo: We did the dishes together and he came to help.

1155
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:34,140
Seon Woo: But I couldn't help complaining. But I felt

1156
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:36,000
I felt like my heart skipped a beat then.

1157
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,360
Seon Woo: It was like a dog.

1158
00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:43,830
I think he's cute.

1159
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:49,460
Seon Woo: Yes. It's Jun-seong who made me want to know more.

1160
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:57,350
Seong Ho: Can you guess who it is?

1161
00:46:58,870 --> 00:47:00,050
Jun Seong: It's a secret.

1162
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:02,470
(Curious)

1163
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:09,400
(Jun Seong becomes silent after receiving the call)

1164
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:12,840
(A glance)

1165
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:14,870
Seong Ho: Is it a bit complicated?

1166
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:20,610
Jun Seong: No. I told you I’m not the type who would overthink.

1167
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:23,860
Seong Ho: Amazing.

1168
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:27,710
Seong Ho: I always feel tired. Because I thought too much.

1169
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:29,670
For example, if I have a partner, but I was immersed that day.

1170
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:33,520
(Seong Ho’s delusion begins again)
For example, if I have a partner, but I was immersed that day.

1171
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,640
For example, if I have a partner, but I was immersed that day.

1172
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:37,880
(Seong Ho: Please go to the phone booth. Express your feelings to someone you like in 30 seconds)

1173
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:39,080
Bye.
(Seong Ho: Please go to the phone booth. Express your feelings to someone you like in 30 seconds)

1174
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,220
Jun Seong: You seem happy.

1175
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:43,100
Jun Seong: What? When will it be my turn?

1176
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:44,930
Seong Ho: I can be free.

1177
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:45,940
Seong Ho: Thank you.

1178
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:55,950
Seong Ho: I didn’t think much.

1179
00:47:57,410 --> 00:47:59,380
Seong Ho: I think I get along well with him.

1180
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:02,640
Seong Ho: I want to know more about him.

1181
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:06,560
Seong Ho: I want to talk to him more.

1182
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:11,920
I hope he feels the same way.

1183
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:28,100
Seong Ho: Hello? Yes.

1184
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:29,620
Seong Ho: Nice to meet you today.

1185
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:34,970
Seong Ho: We had a good chat today. So I called you.

1186
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:35,170
(Seong Ho called Seon Woo)
Seong Ho: We had a good chat today. So I called you.

1187
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:39,070
(Seong Ho called Seon Woo)

1188
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,300
Seon Woo: I'm Yoo Seon Woo.

1189
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:43,210
-Hello? -Yeah.

1190
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:48,950
Seong Ho: Nice to meet you. I had a good chat.

1191
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:50,130
Seong Ho: so I called you.

1192
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:52,260
Seong Ho: I hope I can know you more in the future.

1193
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:56,660
Seong Ho: and get closer to you. So I called.

1194
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:57,970
Seon Woo: Thank you.

1195
00:48:57,970 --> 00:48:59,530
You’re welcome.

1196
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:00,950
See you later.

1197
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:01,080
Okay.

1198
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:01,980
(Okay.)
Okay.

1199
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:12,290
Seong Ho: I thought Call Seon Woo.

1200
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:13,660
Seong Ho: Since I received the text,

1201
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:19,320
Seong Ho: others since I received the text.

1202
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:21,140
The hole on the socks is getting bigger.

1203
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:24,290
(After the call, Seong Ho came back in a good mood)
The hole on the socks is getting bigger.

1204
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:24,780
The hole on the socks is getting bigger.

1205
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:29,970
Joon-sung I thought he would call me. But he didn't call

1206
00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:35,310
I’m amazing. I’m great.

1207
00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:37,420
I wasn’t nervous at all. It’s great.

1208
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:39,920
Seong Ho: Have you decided?

1209
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,540
Jun Seong: Not yet.

1210
00:49:41,970 --> 00:49:44,210
Seong Ho: Will it be you next?

1211
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:45,390
Jun Seong: Who should I call?

1212
00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:47,670
What? Jun Seong: Who should I call?

1213
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:51,020
Seong Ho: Make it simple.

1214
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:52,970
Simple.

1215
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:56,880
You can’t find the answer if you think too much.

1216
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:03,650
(Yung Hee is waiting for the call order on the second floor)

1217
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:11,540
(Yung Hee: Please go to the phone booth. Express your feelings to someone you like in 30 seconds)

1218
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:13,010
Okay, it’s my turn.
(Yung Hee: Please go to the phone booth. Express your feelings to someone you like in 30 seconds)

1219
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:19,290
Yung Hee: I like to move forward bravely.

1220
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:21,300
Yung Hee: So I decided at first sight.

1221
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,860
Yung Hee: I’ll call him. I’ve thought about it long ago.

1222
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:34,320
I want to be closer with him or see something else about him.

1223
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:38,510
I don’t think my feelings have changed.

1224
00:50:53,070 --> 00:50:53,080
Hey.

1225
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,440
(Yung Hee’s target is...)
Hey.

1226
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,190
(Yung Hee’s target is...)

1227
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:56,340
(He’s going after Seon Woo)

1228
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:58,060
I’m Yung Hee.
(He’s going after Seon Woo)

1229
00:50:58,060 --> 00:50:59,990
(He’s going after Seon Woo)

1230
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:01,450
-Yung Hee. -Yes, yes.

1231
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:04,430
Chae-hee: Thanks to you today. It’s fun. Yes.

1232
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:06,550
Yung Hee: I look forward to working with you.

1233
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:09,670
Yung Hee: Thank you. I called you out of selfishness.

1234
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:11,040
Seon Woo: Just a little?

1235
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:14,560
Of course, it may become more in the future.

1236
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:20,190
Seon Woo: I had fun today, too. Nice to meet you.

1237
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,780
Yung Hee: Thank you. Did you eat well?

1238
00:51:22,970 --> 00:51:25,630
Seon Woo: Of course. Let's have another drink later.

1239
00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:27,160
Yung Hee: OK, I see.

1240
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,350
Have a good night.

1241
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:31,040
(He couldn’t finish what he wanted to say before it was hung up)

1242
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,730
It hung up.
(He couldn’t finish what he wanted to say before it was hung up)

1243
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:34,230
(He couldn’t finish what he wanted to say before it was hung up)

1244
00:51:36,270 --> 00:51:38,690
Yung Hee: I sat next to him and chatted with him.

1245
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:41,150
At my favorite place with the person I like the most.

1246
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:42,460
It’s the best today.

1247
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:44,220
(That moment felt the best)
It’s the best today.

1248
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:44,250
Yung Hee I'll keep going towards Seon Woo.
(That moment felt the best)
It’s the best today.

1249
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:48,550
Yung Hee I'll keep going towards Seon Woo.

1250
00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:50,000
Yung Hee: until the end.

1251
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:53,810
Seon Woo: So far,

1252
00:51:53,810 --> 00:52:00,000
Seon Woo: I have a good first impression of Yung Hee.

1253
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,340
Seon Woo but I don't think there's a chance

1254
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:10,740
(A double room on the second floor, Yung Hee & Jeong-wook’s room)

1255
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:13,890
(Jeong-wook seems to have thought a lot)

1256
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:25,740
(Jeong-wook: Please go to the phone booth. Express your feelings to someone you like in 30 seconds)

1257
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:31,910
(Who is Jeong-wook thinking of now?)

1258
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:39,750
(He comes to the phone booth with nervousness)

1259
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:43,980
Jung-wook: Confessing my feelings

1260
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:48,270
Jeong-wook: I was scared. I’m still a little nervous.

1261
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:04,200
Jeong-wook: I didn’t feel much at first.

1262
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:06,570
I’m not sure. I think I fell for his contrast.

1263
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:09,960
("I think I fell for his contrast")
I’m not sure. I think I fell for his contrast.

1264
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:10,940
("I think I fell for his contrast")

1265
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:19,690
Hello?

1266
00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:20,640
Jeong-wook: Hello.

1267
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:21,670
Hello?

1268
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:23,810
Jung-wook: Yes, do you know who I am?

1269
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:24,040
(Min Seong, Jeong-wook’s first call)
Jung-wook: Yes, do you know who I am?

1270
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:24,660
(Min Seong, Jeong-wook’s first call)

1271
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:28,190
I’m Jeong-wook.
(Min Seong, Jeong-wook’s first call)

1272
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:29,430
Yes. Min Seong: Thank you.
(Min Seong, Jeong-wook’s first call)

1273
00:53:29,430 --> 00:53:31,590
Yes. Min Seong: Thank you.

1274
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:35,360
Jung-wook: I want to be close to you. So I called.

1275
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:41,400
Jeong-wook: OK. Let’s have a good memory.

1276
00:53:45,310 --> 00:53:46,480
Jeong-wook: I see.

1277
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:47,940
Min Seong: Thank you.

1278
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:49,170
Jung-wook: See you later.

1279
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:56,060
(He hung up nervously)

1280
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:05,650
Jung-wook: When I call him,

1281
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:09,760
Jeong-wook: I I didn’t know if it was 15 seconds or 30 seconds.

1282
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,640
Jeong-wook: I couldn’t help but hang up.

1283
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,000
Jeong-wook: But it’s a pity.

1284
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,500
Jeong-wook: I thought I think I hung up after saying something casual.

1285
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:22,030
Jeong-wook: I thought I could

1286
00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:25,280
Min Seong: and I thought I couldn’t answer a phone call.

1287
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,930
Min Seong: I was a little surprised.

1288
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:30,550
Min Seong: But I still feel happy.

1289
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:35,420
(A double room on the first floor, Seong-ho & Jun Seong’s room)

1290
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:38,850
(Pouting)

1291
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:48,800
Seong Ho: You must be nervous.

1292
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:50,690
Jun Seong: Thinking.

1293
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:52,180
Seong Ho: You lied. You must be nervous.

1294
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:55,990
Jun Seong: Nervous? I don't think I'm nervous yet.

1295
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:58,260
Jun Seong: How should I call him?

1296
00:54:58,260 --> 00:54:59,810
Seong Ho: Are you worried? Yes.

1297
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:03,990
What should I say?

1298
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:05,330
You can do it.

1299
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:09,090
Seong Ho: Do I have to call someone I like?

1300
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:10,830
Jun Seong: Yes. You can call someone you’re grateful for today.

1301
00:55:10,830 --> 00:55:12,620
That’s right. If you’re not into anyone.

1302
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:13,000
(Seong Ho is trying hard to help Jun Seong.)
That’s right. If you’re not into anyone.

1303
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:13,880
Someone you’re grateful for…
(Seong Ho is trying hard to help Jun Seong.)

1304
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,870
-Or someone you want to know more. -Right.
(Seong Ho is trying hard to help Jun Seong.)

1305
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:17,140
-There are many excuses. -That’s right.
(Seong Ho is trying hard to help Jun Seong.)

1306
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:17,910
-There are many excuses. -That’s right.

1307
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:27,640
(Come on! Jun Seong, please go to the phone booth In 30 seconds)

1308
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:28,850
Good luck.
