1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:06,630
("First" date)

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,980
(The men quickly got used to the new rooms)

3
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:20,960
(Seon Woo is the first to get up today too)

4
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:24,510
(Min Seong is the last one to get up today too)

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,530
(Second floor, single room, Seong Ho's room)

6
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:36,000
(Seong Ho, an early riser, also gets up)

7
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,990
Seong Ho: Oh, it's really cold.

8
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:41,650
(Tock)

9
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:46,610
It's really cold.

10
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,650
(Half-awake)

11
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,430
Seong Ho: I'm tired.

12
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:04,239
(Collapses)

13
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,840
(Knock, knock, knock)

14
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:17,720
Seon Woo: What's going on? I don't have to wake you up.

15
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,170
Seong Ho: I just woke up.

16
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,900
Seong Ho: Did you just get up? Are you done getting ready?

17
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,360
Seon Woo: No. I came out after washing up.

18
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,640
Seong Ho: I'm going to get washed up now.

19
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,360
(Thanks to Seon Woo, Seong Ho gets up again)

20
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:44,020
(Humming)

21
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,360
Sign, sign, sign…
(Humming)

22
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,030
(What's the sound…)

23
00:01:54,229 --> 00:02:00,490
(Seong Ho's morning song is playing on the second floor)

24
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:09,820
Oh.

25
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,210
More.

26
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:17,020
(With Seong Ho's morning song, there's no more need for an alarm)

27
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,430
(Jun Seong will never get up)

28
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,700
(There's no morning song on the first floor, but there's sunshine)

29
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:33,480
(Doesn't move at all)

30
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,200
(Staring)

31
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:42,430
(Pushes)

32
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,600
Seon Woo: It's 8:04.

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,860
Seon Woo: I finished making the coffee.

34
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,510
Seon Woo: The bathrooms upstairs should all be empty.

35
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,120
Seon Woo: You should go now.

36
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:57,560
Seon Woo: Ah. You're going on a date today.

37
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:00,780
(Suddenly gets up after hearing about the date)

38
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,810
You have to hurry and go to the bathroom now.
(Suddenly gets up after hearing about the date)

39
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:03,450
(Suddenly gets up after hearing about the date)

40
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:11,300
(As soon as he wakes up, he checks if he got swollen from sleeping)

41
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,520
(Jun Seong is the last one to get up)

42
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,750
(Wobbling)

43
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:28,220
(He wears a cap as soon as he opens his eyes, and he's going to Seong Ho's room)

44
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,110
Seong Ho: Did you sleep well?

45
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,500
Seong Ho: Are you going to lie here?

46
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,590
Jun Seong: There're no more rooms where I can wash up.

47
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,650
Jun Seong: Get ready.

48
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,500
Seong Ho: Should I go over first?

49
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,540
Jun Seong: Yes, see you later.

50
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,510
Seong Ho: See you later.

51
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:57,220
(Hyeong Jin is in charge of today's breakfast)

52
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,930
Hyeong Jin: Is it okay if we only make six servings of rice?

53
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,150
Seon Woo: I don't think we can eat too much, indeed.

54
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,950
-Hyeong Jin: Five? Six?
-Six.

55
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,810
Hyeong Jin: I think five is enough?

56
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:08,880
Seon Woo: Alright.

57
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,930
(Have you looked at it?)
(Found the mission card)

58
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,450
-Good morning.
-Have you looked at it?
(Have you looked at it?)
(Found the mission card)

59
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,060
-Good morning.
-Have you looked at it?

60
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:19,700
(Flustered)

61
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,399
Why is this happening every day?
(Flustered)

62
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,310
Why is this happening every day?

63
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,170
Can you read it to me?

64
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:30,320
Today is the day for the first date, on which you can have new discoveries.

65
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,670
You can only invite a man

66
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,840
who you haven't dated yet to go on a date with you.

67
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,270
(Frozen)

68
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,600
Seong Ho: What should come has now come.

69
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,110
You can decline the date invitation.

70
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:53,250
Yung Hee: Oh? This is an opportunity.

71
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,840
Seon Woo: Do you want to go on a date with me?

72
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,430
-You? Yes?
-Yung Hee: Today? Sure.

73
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,890
Yung Hee: Are the two of us going on a date today?

74
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,190
Yung Hee: I wanted to say it to Seon Woo directly.

75
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:12,610
Yung Hee: But Seon Woo said it to me first.

76
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,810
Seon Woo: Because Yung Hee has been cheering for me since the first day,

77
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:20,110
Seon Woo: I was thinking that I must repay him.

78
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:23,810
Seon Woo: I was thinking that I have to go on a date with him before the show ends.

79
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:26,250
Seon Woo: So I asked him out on a date.

80
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:27,760
Is it over if it's okay here?

81
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,960
(And Chung-ook saw the process)
Is it over if it's okay here?

82
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,250
(And Chung-ook saw the process)

83
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,070
Do you need my help? I'll clean this up.
(And Chung-ook saw the process)

84
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:33,810
Do you need my help? I'll clean this up.

85
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:37,860
Chung-ook: I felt I was in a bad mood at that moment.

86
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:41,090
Hyeong Jin: I was right next to you, but you ignored me

87
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,350
Hyeong Jin: and just invited him right away?

88
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,420
Seon Woo: Didn't you see the conditions?

89
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:46,210
Seon Woo: Because we can only invite someone who we've never dated.

90
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,640
Hyeong Jin: Is it on a first come, first served basis?

91
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,010
Seon Woo: It could be on a first come, first served basis.

92
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:49,980
Hyeong Jin: Then I'll also go invite someone and come back.

93
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,290
Seon Woo: We can decline too.

94
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:58,960
-Hyeong Jin: Do you want to go on a date with me today?
-Min Seong: Today?

95
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,590
-Min Seong: Is it on a first come, first served basis?
-Hyeong Jin: It seems so.

96
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,750
Okay?

97
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,520
(OK)
Okay?

98
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,140
(OK)

99
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,230
-Yung Hee: Are you done with the invitation?
-Hyeong Jin: Yes.

100
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,500
-That's better.
-Did you pour in too much oil?

101
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,910
It looks like we're going to fry something.

102
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:15,950
(Runs away swiftly)
It looks like we're going to fry something.

103
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,150
(Runs away swiftly)

104
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,270
Hyeong Jin: Did you pour it in?

105
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,460
Min Seong: Are you here to ask me out on a date?

106
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,940
Seon Woo: What? You…

107
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:30,020
(Joking; Seong Ho: No! You and I had a date before)
Seon Woo: What? You…

108
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,200
No! You and I had a date before.
(Joking; Seong Ho: No! You and I had a date before)

109
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:37,020
Seon Woo: I wasn't curious about who Hyeong Jin will invite for a date,

110
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:41,220
Seon Woo: but I was curious about who invited Min Seong for a date.

111
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:45,330
Seon Woo: Then I found out that Hyeong Jin was the first person

112
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:50,570
Seon Woo: to invite Min Seong for a date.

113
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,290
Jun Seong: I don't know if it's right for me

114
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:54,710
Jun Seong: to invite someone for a date in a state like this.

115
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:58,470
Jun Seong: No. I would go too far if I invite someone for a date in a state like this, right?

116
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:03,150
Hyeong Joon: Let's try. I'm going to give it a try in such a state too.

117
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,240
(In a fluster)

118
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:11,980
Yung Hee: Hurry up. Hurry up.

119
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:12,330
(Date invitation; Yung Hee: I've already invited someone)

120
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,730
I've already invited someone.
(Date invitation; Yung Hee: I've already invited someone)

122
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,210
Jun Seong: Where are my clothes?

123
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:16,540
Jun Seong: Where are my clothes?

124
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,320
-Jun Seong: Ah, where are my clothes?
-What clothes?

125
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,130
Jun Seong: Where's my hoodie?

126
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,750
-Yung Hee: What color is it?
-Jun Seong: It's black.

127
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:24,760
-Where is it?
-No.

128
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,750
(Feeling anxious together)
-Where is it?
-No.

129
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,990
Jun Seong: Oops, I cursed.

130
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,450
Jun Seong: It's not here either?

131
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,350
Jun Seong: Where's my hoodie?

132
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,300
Yung Hee: Isn't it this one? Black hoodie?

133
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,200
Jun Seong: Which one? Which one?

134
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,330
-Jun Seong: It's not that one. It's not that one.
-Not this one?

135
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,250
Yung Hee: Not this one either, right? Jun Seong, it's not this one either, is it?

136
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,380
-Jun Seong: It is this one.
-It is this one?

137
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,120
Jun Seong: Why is it here? This hoodie.

138
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,500
Jun Seong: I was in a hurry.

139
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,550
Jun Seong: I had to hurry and invite someone for a date

140
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:00,060
Jun Seong: without even brushing my teeth or drying my hair.

141
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,700
Jun Seong: I had the experience of missing a person because I was too lazy.

142
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,240
Jun Seong: So I was very anxious.

143
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,990
Jun Seong: You're here!

144
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,050
What's wrong?

145
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:12,710
Go on a date with me.

146
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,990
Okay.

147
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,930
Jun Seong: Nice!

148
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:21,310
Jun Seong: I need to brush my teeth.

149
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,560
Seon Woo: You're in a good mood.

150
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,210
Jun Seong: I made it!

151
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,740
Jun Seong: They said they heard someone running down from upstairs with some clang sounds.

152
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:38,120
Jun Seong: They thought I fell down and broke something.

153
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,570
Jun Seong: It seemed I was in a hurry. Yes.

154
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,580
Seong Ho: I was wondering when he would come.

155
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:45,350
(The third day; Seong Ho: Last time when we invited a person for a date on a first come, first served basis)

157
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:54,250
Seong Ho: he thought the reason why he failed

158
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,150
Seong Ho: was he looked lazy.

159
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:56,330
(Seong Ho: So, in order to make Jun Seong succeed in his invitation this time)
Seong Ho: was he looked lazy.

162
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,660
(Strolling)

163
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,570
Min Seong: I'm putting on my make-up.

164
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:20,930
Hyeong Joon: Are you going out?

165
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,260
-What?
-Are you going out?

166
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:22,970
Min Seong: Are we going out together?

167
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,550
Hyeong Joon: No, just me. Because you're putting on your make-up.

168
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,490
Min Seong: No, it's okay.

169
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:34,020
(After walking around Min Seong for a bit, Hyeong Joon goes to check the mission card)

170
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,290
Ready.
(After walking around Min Seong for a bit, Hyeong Joon goes to check the mission card)

171
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,250
(After walking around Min Seong for a bit, Hyeong Joon goes to check the mission card)

172
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,220
(Focused)

173
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,490
Hurry up. Hurry up.

174
00:09:55,490 --> 00:10:00,180
(Hyeong Joon comes to Min Seong again)

175
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,610
Hyeong Joon: Do you want to go on a date?

176
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:06,160
-Min Seong: A date?
-Yes.

177
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,790
-Min Seong: A date?
-Hyeong Joon: Do you want to go?

178
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,090
Min Seong: I received an invitation this morning.

179
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,490
-Hyeong Joon: Really? You received that?
-What?

180
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:14,590
Hyeong Joon: So, are you going?

181
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,510
Min Seong: Yes. Because I never went on a date with that person.

182
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,710
Hyeong Joon: Really? I see.

183
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,540
-Min Seong: What?
-What's wrong?

184
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,410
Min Seong: Who are you going on a date with?

185
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:23,840
Hyeong Joon: Me? I don't know.

186
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,220
Hyeong Joon: Who should I go on a date with?

187
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,370
Min Seong: You should have come earlier.

188
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,860
Hyeong Joon: When did he come? When did he ask you?

189
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,070
Hyeong Joon: When did he come?

190
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,660
Min Seong: A few minutes ago.

191
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,210
Min Seong: You should have come earlier.

192
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:36,240
-Hyeong Joon: I see. Thank you.
-Okay.

193
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:41,500
(Pity)

194
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:48,040
Hyeong Joon: Date. "Is there anyone who you're dating today?"

195
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,830
Hyeong Joon: I should have asked him this way first.

196
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,540
Hyeong Joon: "Let's go on a date." I just asked him like this directly.

197
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,090
Hyeong Joon: So I felt a little

198
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:57,360
Hyeong Joon: embarrassed and flustered.

199
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,990
My heart was a mess.

200
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:09,670
You should feel grateful, right?

201
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:22,070
Seong Ho: Who are you going on a date with today?

202
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:25,860
-Hyeong Joon: I don't have a date.
-Seong Ho: You didn't invite anyone?

203
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,650
Hyeong Joon: I was rejected.

204
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,410
-What?
-Hyeong Joon: I was rejected.

205
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,290
-Seong Ho: By whom?
-Hyeong Joon: Well, not rejected.

206
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,940
-Seong Ho: Min Seong?
-Hyeong Joon: Someone else… Yes. Someone else invited him first.

207
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,130
Seong Ho: Five minutes before you came, Hyeong Jin came.

208
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,810
Seong Ho: You should have come earlier.

209
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,040
-Hyeong Joon: But are you going out with Jun Seong?
-Yes.

210
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,970
Hyeong Joon: So, he and Seon Woo are going out.

211
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,760
Seong Ho: Seon Woo and Yung Hee will go out together.

212
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,750
Seong Ho: Jun Seong and I.

213
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,680
Seong Ho: Min Seong and Hyeong Jin.

214
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,720
Hyeong Joon: It's me and Chung-ook.

215
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,640
Hyeong Joon: But I've already had a date with Chung-ook.

216
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,560
Seong Ho: Oh, really? Are you staying at home then?

217
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,030
Seong Ho: Staying at home?

218
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,680
Seong Ho: Are you a maid? Are you staying at home as a maid?

219
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:02,790
(Hyeong Joon: Since I'm staying at home, of course I'll have to be a maid)
Seong Ho: Are you a maid? Are you staying at home as a maid?

220
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,480
Of course a maid has to do the work of a maid.
(Hyeong Joon: Since I'm staying at home, of course I'll have to be a maid)

221
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,600
Seong Ho: Clean-up. You're going to do some clean-up at home.

222
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,940
(At this time, Hyeong Jin's kimchi fried rice is ready)

223
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,660
Jun Seong: May I take it now, Sir?

224
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:16,040
Hyeong Jin: Just take it directly to the person you want to give it to.

225
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,380
-Half-cooked?
-Seong Ho: I want it fully cooked.

226
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,210
Jun Seong: Me too.

227
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,660
Seong Ho: Thank you.

228
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,520
Chung-ook: I want it half-cooked.

229
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,570
Jun Seong: Only two are fully cooked. All the others are half-cooked.

230
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:31,270
Chung-ook: Oh, really? Thank you.

231
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,700
Hey, the spoon.

232
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,380
Seong Ho: Thank you. I'll enjoy it.

233
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,280
Wow, it's delicious.

234
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,060
Yes, it's delicious.

235
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,200
(Satisfied)
Yes, it's delicious.

236
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:50,650
-This is delicious.
-Seong Ho: Hyeong Jin, it's really delicious.

237
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:52,210
Seong Ho: Is it because I have no expectations at all?

238
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,500
Seong Ho: What's going on?

239
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,850
Jun Seong: It would be great if there's soybean paste stew.

240
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,230
(Joking)

241
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:04,780
(Meanwhile, Yung Hee is busy preparing for the date)

242
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:14,080
(And Min Seong is spending time alone)

243
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,790
Chung-ook: But, for today's date,

244
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,890
Chung-ook: are we the only two who are left?

245
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,670
Hyeong Joon: But haven't we already had a date before?

246
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,220
What?

247
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,130
But haven't we already had a date before?

248
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,160
Yes, we have.

249
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,940
-What should we do then?
-Hyeong Joon: Do you want to go to the arcade again?

250
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:26,610
(Smirks)

251
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:27,880
Do you want to go to the arcade again?
(Smirks)

252
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,800
Hyeong Joon: What should we do?

253
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,360
Hyeong Joon: Well, we two are going to stay at home anyway.

254
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,680
Chung-ook: Do you want to have a date at home?

255
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,660
That works too.

256
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:38,550
Hyeong Joon: Then shall we shoot a vlog at home today?

257
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:41,510
-At home?
-Hyeong Joon: Yes. After shooting the videos, I'll edit them.

258
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,830
Yung Hee: For fear that someone doesn't know you're a YouTuber.

259
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,440
Hyeong Jin: How is it? Is it tasty?

260
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,270
Hyeong Jin: Did I ask before you swallowed it?

261
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,690
Yung Hee: Whose is this? Anyone didn't eat?

262
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:58,400
Hyeong Jin: Min Seong hasn't come yet. I just checked.

263
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,430
-So, I feel…
-Maybe he's doing something.

264
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,360
Hyeong Jin: If I eat mine,

265
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,570
Hyeong Jin: he will be the only one left. I want to wait for him and eat together.

266
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,350
Yung Hee: Oh. You're a real gentleman.

267
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:10,410
Hyeong Joon: I didn't want to think about anything.

268
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,290
Hyeong Joon: I just pretended that nothing happened.

269
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,190
Hyeong Joon: I needed to adjust my mental state and control my expressions.

270
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:18,060
Hyeong Joon: I didn't want to disturb people around me because of this.

271
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,480
Hyeong Joon: So I adjusted my mental state.

272
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:19,920
(Nodding)
(Hyeong Jin: 9:30 means that we have to finish eating and go out before 9:30, right?)

273
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,720
9:30 means that we have to finish eating and go out before 9:30, right?
(Nodding)
(Hyeong Jin: 9:30 means that we have to finish eating and go out before 9:30, right?)

274
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,200
Yes, yes.
(Nodding)
(Hyeong Jin: 9:30 means that we have to finish eating and go out before 9:30, right?)

275
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,710
-First…
-Hyeong Joon: I really enjoyed the meal.

276
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:29,190
-It's delicious.
-Hyeong Jin: Put it in the sink.

277
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:31,690
-Hyeong Jin: Later, I'll wash the dishes before I go out.
-Okay, okay.

278
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:45,790
(Come here)

279
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,230
Min Seong: Have you decided who you're going on a date with?

280
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,800
-Hyeong Joon: Maybe with Chung-ook.
-Min Seong: Have you decided?

281
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,750
Hyeong Joon: But Chung-ook and I have already gone on a date once.

282
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,200
-Hyeong Joon: I might stay at home.
-Min Seong: Really? Then…

283
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,900
Min Seong: If I ask you to go on a date with me, will you go?

284
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,360
-So sudden?
-Yes.

285
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:05,460
What about him then?

286
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,420
(Hyeong Joon: What about Hyeong Jin then?)
What about him then?

287
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,950
-What?
-What about him?
(Hyeong Joon: What about Hyeong Jin then?)

288
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:11,940
Min Seong: What do you mean? We can decline the invitation. We can turn it down.

289
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,650
-Hyeong Joon: No, no.
-Min Seong: Why?

290
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:19,500
Hyeong Joon: If you promised to go on a date but then you said you're not going,

291
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,590
Hyeong Joon: wouldn't it be a little… You also…

292
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:24,280
Min Seong: Are you going or not? Just tell me about this.

293
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,000
Hyeong Joon: Yes.

294
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,120
Min Seong: You're going? Okay, I got it.

295
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,830
Okay, I got it.

296
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,090
Hyeong Joon: But is it okay? Will it be fine?

297
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:34,430
Because I feel a little… a little bad about it.

298
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,270
-Min Seong: I'll take care of it.
-Hyeong Joon: Got it.

299
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,700
OK. OK.

300
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,690
Hyeong Joon: When he accepted my date invitation again,

301
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:49,150
Hyeong Joon: I felt a little… a little sorry.

302
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,620
I felt that way.

303
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:58,340
Hyeong Joon: Happiness accounts for 90%? It's not 100% yet. Maybe about 95%?

304
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,080
Yung Hee: Thank you.

305
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,810
-Chung-ook: I enjoyed the food.
-Yung Hee: I enjoyed the food.

306
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,750
-Min Seong: What? Are you waiting for me?
-Yes.

307
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:12,160
-Hyeong Jin: But it feels better.
-Min Seong: Why?

308
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,720
Hyeong Jin: Because I can talk with you while eating.

309
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,670
Hyeong Jin: Does our dating course start now?

310
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,400
-Min Seong: I will enjoy the food.
-Hyeong Jin: Please enjoy.

311
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,580
Okay.

312
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:31,400
(Hyeong Jin and Min Seong start eating)

313
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:48,420
Hyeong Jin: There's someone you want to go out with.

314
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,510
Hyeong Jin: Did I invite you too soon?

315
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,950
Min Seong: Actually,

316
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,069
Min Seong: I'm planning to decline the date with you.

317
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:08,190
Min Seong: Because

318
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:13,089
Min Seong: this might be the last date.

319
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:15,329
Min Seong: But

320
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:20,869
Min Seong: there's someone who I want to get to know better.

321
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:26,650
Hyeong Jin: Did you tell him?

322
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,910
-Hyeong Jin: Are you going to tell him now?
-Min Seong: Yes.

323
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,860
Hyeong Jin: Go ahead and tell him.

324
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,330
Hyeong Jin: Because there's a person who you've been thinking about.

325
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,090
Hyeong Jin: I was totally frustrated.

326
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:42,550
Hyeong Jin: Well, have fun outside then.

327
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:47,790
Hyeong Jin: I was too focused on controlling my expressions.

328
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:51,900
Min Seong: In a sense, we don't have many days left.

329
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:56,950
Min Seong: It occurred to me that there might not be a one-to-one date in the future.

330
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,030
Min Seong: So I thought about it again.

331
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:05,280
Min Seong: In order to choose a person who I want to have a date with more based on the order of priority,

332
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,580
Min Seong: I chose Hyeong Joon.

333
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:15,030
(Meanwhile, Chung-ook doesn't know what's going on downstairs yet)

334
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:24,690
(He's choosing clothes for shooting a vlog with Hyeong Joon)

335
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,920
-Did you buy it before and put it here?
-Do you want some ice cream?

336
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,910
Min Seong: It's cute.

337
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,320
-What?
-It's cute.

338
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,570
Hyeong Jin: You're going out with me today, right?

339
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:47,210
-What?
-Hyeong Jin: Aren't you going on a date with me?

340
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,790
Hyeong Jin: Did you choose anyone just now?

341
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:51,470
Chung-ook: What? Where are we going?

342
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:54,550
Hyeong Jin: Did you invite anyone to go on a date with you later?

343
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,960
Chung-ook: I didn't choose anyone.

344
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,940
Hyeong Jin: Really? Then you can go with me today.

345
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,740
Huh? What's going on? No…

346
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,920
(Confused)
Huh? What's going on? No…

347
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,920
Huh? What's going on? No…

348
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,100
Chung-ook: I wasn't able to know what exactly was going on.

349
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,610
Chung-ook: Am I not staying at home then? Where should I go then?

350
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:11,670
Chung-ook: What's going on?

351
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:14,660
Chung-ook: I'm not ready to go on a date yet.

352
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,590
Chung-ook: So when I heard the news…

353
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:21,120
Chung-ook: "What?" That was my reaction. It was like, "Why?"

354
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:25,170
I can see the inner clothing this way.

355
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,580
Yung Hee: We're both wearing brown.

356
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,630
-Yes.
-Brown.

357
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:29,580
Seon Woo: Ah, there's a coat outside too. Did you see it just now?

358
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,030
Hyeong Joon: I'm wearing this pair of shoes. Can you wear this pair too?

359
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,410
Hyeong Joon: It matches your outfit.

360
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:38,160
-Min Seong: I'll go get changed then.
-Hyeong Joon: No need. No need.

361
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,680
Min Seong: Nike Killer Whale shoes? Then I'll wear Nike Killer Whale shoes.

362
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,040
Hyeong Joon: No need. No need. Really?

363
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,440
(Jun Seong and Seong Ho go on a date first)

364
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,730
No need. Wear what you want to wear.
(Jun Seong and Seong Ho go on a date first)

365
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:45,250
-Jun Seong: We'll be back soon.
-Min Seong: Have fun outside.

366
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,180
Bye.

367
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,480
-Come here.
-Okay.

368
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:58,310
(The location for Jun Seong and Seong Ho's "first" date)

369
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,800
(Oido Island with an endless sea)

370
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,280
-The weather is really nice, isn't it? -Yes.
(Oido Island with an endless sea)

371
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,280
-The weather is really nice, isn't it? -Yes.

372
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,560
-Seong Ho: The weather is really nice.
-Yes.

373
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,610
Seong Ho: But it's a little cold.

374
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,300
Jun Seong: Is it cold? Take this.

375
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,240
Jun Seong: I've heated it up in advance.

376
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,930
Seong Ho: That's why I said you're a hot-pack boy.

377
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:16,760
Seong Ho: No. Everyone became hot-pack boys.

378
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,290
Seong Ho: Because of you, everyone would give me hot packs.

379
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,460
Jun Seong: What's wrong with that? That's good. It's warm.

380
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,410
Seong Ho: So warm.

381
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:27,330
Seong Ho: In fact, I was worried about this date at first.

382
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,520
Seong Ho: Will I have the feelings I have in the Men's House

383
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,210
Seong Ho: during the date?

384
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:34,200
Seong Ho: Won't there be an uncomfortable ambience?

385
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,010
Seong Ho: These were rather the thoughts in my mind.

386
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,290
Jun Seong: I'm totally the opposite of the type of people you like.

387
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:43,070
Seong Ho: Yes. You're too street.

388
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,230
Jun Seong: How am I too street?

389
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,680
Seong Ho: Your dressing style is very street.

390
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,380
Jun Seong: Not at all.

391
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,920
Seong Ho: I don't have any clothes like that.

392
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,310
Jun Seong: Don't you have a hoodie?

393
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:53,750
Seong Ho: Yes, I do. But I don't have any gaudy hoodies.

394
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,880
Jun Seong: What do you mean by "gaudy?"

395
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,430
Seong Ho: It's just gaudy.

396
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:58,040
Jun Seong: No, it's not gaudy.

397
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,900
Seong Ho: It is gaudy.

398
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,850
Jun Seong: No.

399
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:00,300
-No, no.
-No, no.

400
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,730
(Quarreling)
-No, no.
-No, no.

401
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:02,620
-It clearly is.
-It's not.
(Quarreling)

402
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,450
-It clearly is.
-It's not.

403
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:05,840
-Seong Ho: I can't eat in a coat.
-Really?

404
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,300
Seong Ho: Don't you feel inconvenient?

405
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,630
Jun Seong: I really haven't worn a coat for a long time.

406
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:15,140
Seong Ho: I really want to live in a place where there's only spring and fall.

407
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,090
Jun Seong: Let's go and live in such a place together.

408
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:17,690
Seong Ho: We only need to wear light coats.

409
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,720
Jun Seong: I actually want to wear a hoodie every day.

410
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,330
Jun Seong: Shorts and a hoodie.

411
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:22,730
Shorts and a hoodie? That's the worst, right?

412
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:24,210
(Seong Ho: That's the worst, right?)
Shorts and a hoodie? That's the worst, right?

413
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:24,880
Shorts and a hoodie? That's the worst, right?

414
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,480
Seong Ho: Just kidding. Just kidding.

415
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,660
Jun Seong: It's okay. It's okay even if it's the worst.

416
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:35,780
Jun Seong: In the morning, I finished washing up and came out. And I was in a trance.

417
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,940
Jun Seong: I heard that we're choosing our dates on a first come, first served basis,

418
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:40,230
Jun Seong: and we can't choose the ones we've dated.

419
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:42,310
Jun Seong: So I didn't even have time to dry my hair.

420
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:45,130
Jun Seong: My toothbrush was in the bathroom on the first floor.

421
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,990
Jun Seong: And I was washing up in your room on the second floor.

422
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:49,570
Jun Seong: I was thinking about going downstairs to brush my teeth.

423
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:53,780
Jun Seong: After hearing that, I ran downstairs right away.

424
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,650
Jun Seong: I said to you, "Let's go on a date."

425
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,000
-Let's go on a date.
-Jun Seong: I didn't even brush my teeth.

426
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,490
-Let's go on a date.
-Jun Seong: I didn't even dry my hair. "Let's go on a date."

427
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:02,730
Jun Seong: I was so tired this morning.

428
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:06,770
Seong Ho: How are my clothes today?

429
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:08,210
Seong Ho: I specially changed to this outfit in order to match yours.

430
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:09,670
Seong Ho: I've worn it on my first day here.

431
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:10,760
Jun Seong: It looks like it.

432
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,590
Jun Seong: You were wearing a green knitted sweater in the morning.

433
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:13,740
(Seong Ho: It feels so different. You and I)
Jun Seong: You were wearing a green knitted sweater in the morning.

434
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,010
It feels so different.
(Seong Ho: It feels so different. You and I)

435
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:21,350
Jun Seong: And I didn't bring green clothes either.

436
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:23,440
Jun Seong: There's at least a bit green here.

437
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:26,910
Jun Seong: There's a bit green here. I thought maybe it's okay.

438
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:27,550
But it was so awkward.

439
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,080
Seong Ho: It's like dating with six people now.

440
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,980
Seong Ho: Now, it's like dating with six people.

441
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,830
Seong Ho: They're looking at me with serious eyes.

442
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,510
Jun Seong: Isn't it good to have many men?

443
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:38,370
-Seong Ho: One is enough.
-Really?

444
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:40,140
Seong Ho: I don't need six. That's too many.

445
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,500
Jun Seong: There are others.

446
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,030
Seong Ho: That's too burdensome.

447
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,530
Seong Ho: And they're not looking elsewhere. They're all staring at me.

448
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,470
Jun Seong: I was happy to see you change your outfit.

449
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:52,100
Jun Seong: You specially wore it to match mine.

450
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:55,860
Jun Seong: Though I didn't show it.

451
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,270
(Shy)

452
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,400
Jun Seong: Because there were too many people there. I was too embarrassed to make it too obvious.

453
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,500
Seong Ho: But you've been obvious all along, even if there were people around.

454
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,740
-Jun Seong: Me?
-Seong Ho: Yes.

455
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,650
Jun Seong: How did I make it obvious?

456
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:09,150
Seong Ho: Everyone was looking at your meaningful glance.

457
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:12,130
Jun Seong: I've prepared everything behind the scenes.

458
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:13,470
Seong Ho: Did you ask others to look at your meaningful glance?

459
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:14,990
Jun Seong: All of you, be careful.

460
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:16,930
-Seong Ho: No wonder
-Call them out individually.

461
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,480
Seong Ho: nobody came near me.

462
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,440
-Come out with me for a moment.
-Nobody came near me.

463
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:23,610
Jun Seong: How did you feel when I asked you out on a date?

464
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,470
Seong Ho: I was happy.

465
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,700
Jun Seong: You expected it, right?

466
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,790
Seong Ho: Of course.

467
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,990
Seong Ho: There are only the two of us now.

468
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,820
Jun Seong: Why? Someone else might come to you too.

469
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:35,280
Seong Ho: I've already thought of it. I would surely go on a date with you.

470
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:37,790
Jun Seong: Me too.

471
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,960
Jun Seong: I think I have to ask you out on a date this time.

472
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,720
Jun Seong: I ran downstairs in a hurry.

473
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,500
Excuse me.

474
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,690
Thank you.

475
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,530
-Do you want some water?
-Yes.

476
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:53,430
Thank you.

477
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,770
-Seong Ho: I'll enjoy the food.
-Jun Seong: I'll enjoy the food.

478
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:57,810
Jun Seong: Do you like to eat meat?

479
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:59,650
-Jun Seong: You like to eat meat.
-Seong Ho: I love to eat meat so much.

480
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,020
Jun Seong: Do you like to eat meat or seafood better?

481
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,150
Seong Ho: Meat.

482
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,310
Jun Seong: Really? Me too.

483
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,260
Seong Ho: You would seldom actively eat seafood, right?

484
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,830
Jun Seong: Right.

485
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,810
Jun Seong: And I don't really like to eat seafood.

486
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,020
Jun Seong: Then do you like beef, pork, chicken, or duck?

487
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,270
Seong Ho: Pork.

488
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,470
-Jun Seong: Pork?
-Yes.

489
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:20,430
Jun Seong: Oh, this is the same as me.

490
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,260
Seong Ho: Pork is the most delicious meat.

491
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,900
Jun Seong: Yes.

492
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,440
Seong Ho: How did you understand?

493
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,010
Jun Seong: Swallow it before you talk.

494
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:28,950
(Jun Seong: Some new facts about Seong Ho?)

495
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,750
I learned about some new facts.
(Jun Seong: Some new facts about Seong Ho?)

496
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,810
Jun Seong: But they are all fresh to me.

497
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:35,380
Jun Seong: The things I learn about every day are all fresh.

498
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,610
Jun Seong: Is it tasty to wrap it with that?

499
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:39,960
Seong Ho: Yes. I like to wrap it with the seaweed.

500
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,780
Seong Ho: Will it get stuck between my teeth?

501
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:45,290
Jun Seong: I'll tell you if it does. Let's make a deal.

502
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:49,150
Jun Seong: If we think the other needs to clean his teeth, then touch his ear.

503
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:51,420
Seong Ho: Got it. Should I touch your ear?

504
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,390
Jun Seong: Okay.

505
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:53,620
Seong Ho: No. No.

506
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,550
Jun Seong: Can I touch both ears?

507
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,130
No.

508
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:58,550
Seong Ho: No. That's annoying.

509
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:01,830
Jun Seong: I thought I would do some handcrafts with you today.

510
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,820
Seong Ho: I want to do something tiring.

511
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:04,600
Jun Seong: Something tiring?

512
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,550
-Seong Ho: I want to experience the mudflat.
-Jun Seong: What?

513
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:09,340
-Seong Ho: Experience the mudflat or something like that.
-Jun Seong: Why?

514
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,030
Seong Ho: I like to do things that I haven't done before.

515
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:13,630
Seong Ho: Usually, when I'm alone,

516
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:15,840
Seong Ho: I don't do anything, so…

517
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,950
Jun Seong: You also don't do or say anything

518
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,720
Jun Seong: when you're at home, right?

519
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,160
Jun Seong: But you raise a cat. You would talk to the cat, right?

520
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,620
Seong Ho: I don't talk to the cat either.

521
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,090
Seong Ho: When the cat comes, I push it away.

522
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:25,660
Seong Ho: Then my cat comes to me again.

523
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:28,950
Jun Seong: So poor. It's similar to me.

524
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,970
Jun Seong: When I'm at home, I don't talk either,

525
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,980
Jun Seong: though I talk without stopping when I meet others.

526
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:37,690
Jun Seong: Occasionally, I have two to three days off.

527
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:39,490
Jun Seong: I would stay at home for three consecutive days.

528
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:41,350
Jun Seong: There would be a smell in my mouth because I wouldn't say anything.

529
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:41,570
(Seong Ho: Brush your teeth often; flustered)
Jun Seong: There would be a smell in my mouth because I wouldn't say anything.

530
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:43,670
Brush your teeth often when you're at home.
(Seong Ho: Brush your teeth often; flustered)

531
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:44,990
No.
(Seong Ho: Brush your teeth often; flustered)

532
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:47,030
Seong Ho: Don't just sit about when you're at home.

533
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,970
Seong Ho: Brush your teeth often, then there won't be a smell.

534
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:51,580
Seong Ho: Eat on time too.

535
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:56,860
-Jun Seong: Do you want to fight?
-No.

536
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:59,140
Seong Ho: We are on a date.

537
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,130
Jun Seong: It's going to be a bad ending today.

538
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,010
Jun Seong: Ah, it's so funny.

539
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:07,320
Jun Seong: It's like I'm lying in bed with you and talking.

540
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:10,230
Seong Ho: I was thinking

541
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,880
Seong Ho: that what if it feels different outside?

542
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,410
-Me too.
-Seong Ho: I was afraid I would feel uncomfortable.

543
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:16,310
Jun Seong: Actually, on my way here, I was worrying about that too.

544
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,500
Jun Seong: So I didn't sleep on the way here.

545
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,680
Jun Seong: How do you feel about these four days?

546
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,590
Seong Ho: Actually, I've been tired.

547
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:28,390
Seong Ho: But I don't want to leave now.

548
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,700
Jun Seong: Ah. Don't you want to go back to your real life?

549
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,370
Seong Ho: Not that. I'm a little reluctant to leave. I already feel reluctant to leave.

550
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:35,590
Jun Seong: Really?

551
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:37,460
Seong Ho: Now I'm talking and laughing with everyone.

552
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:41,250
Seong Ho: But once I think of the fact that we'll leave in a few days,

553
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:43,000
Seong Ho: I would be in a melancholy mood.

554
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,720
Jun Seong: I want to leave quickly.

555
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,950
Seong Ho: Why? Do you want to work?

556
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:48,000
-Jun Seong: No.
-I don't want to work.

557
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,350
Jun Seong: I want to know your phone number.

558
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:51,030
Seong Ho: Ah, my phone number?

559
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,360
Seong Ho: I'm not telling you.

560
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,990
Seong Ho: He gets to 100 from 0 immediately.

561
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,210
Seong Ho: There's no intermediate value. He really launched an attack suddenly.

562
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:06,460
Seong Ho: So I don't think it should be easy.

563
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:12,250
Jun Seong: He felt shy too. He couldn't help but closed his mouth.

564
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:15,380
Jun Seong: Looking at him being shy, I thought it was kind of cute.

565
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,720
Jun Seong: Shall we go to a cafe and have dessert?

566
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,230
-Dessert.
-Jun Seong: Don't you like dessert?

567
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:21,490
Yes, I do.

568
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:25,030
Seong Ho: The seaside is so beautiful just by looking at it.

569
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:27,040
-It's so beautiful.
-Really.

570
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,500
Jun Seong: Let's take a photo with the sea as the background.

571
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,930
Okay.

572
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:32,400
Like this.

573
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,690
One, two, three.

574
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,280
Jun Seong: Let's go. It's cold. Let's go to the cafe.

575
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,740
Seong Ho: My hands are freezing. Really.

576
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,970
Hurry and go order.

577
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:50,170
-Hello.
-Hello.

578
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,140
Seong Ho: What would you like to drink?

579
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,420
Jun Seong: I want an Iced Americano.

580
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,990
Seong Ho: I want something hot.

581
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:57,330
Jun Seong: What about the dessert?

582
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:58,530
Seong Ho: Brie cheese.

583
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:00,070
Jun Seong: What's Brie cheese?

584
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:03,030
Seong Ho: I don't know either. But this one looks delicious.

585
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:08,550
Jun Seong: We would like a hot Americano and an Iced Americano.

586
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:11,710
Jun Seong: And a serving of Brie cheese.

587
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:13,460
-Jun Seong: Thank you.
-Thank you.

588
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,870
Jun Seong: To be honest, what exactly is Brie cheese?

589
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:18,720
Seong Ho: I don't know either.

590
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,750
Seong Ho: Let's look at the photos we took just now. The ones we took by the sea.

591
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,830
Is it this one?

592
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,080
Seong Ho: It's pretty good.

593
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:26,780
Jun Seong: So cute.

594
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,700
-Seong Ho: This photo is really good.
-It's a little…

595
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,680
Seong Ho: You don't look good in photos, do you?

596
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,670
Jun Seong: I don't.

597
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:35,620
Seong Ho: It also looks a bit like a photo with an uncle.

598
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:36,070
(Gets angry)

599
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,420
-I'm not playing anymore.
-No.
(Gets angry)

600
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,000
-Get out.
-No.
(Gets angry)

601
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,890
-Get out.
-No.

602
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:40,260
Seong Ho: I was just saying it feels similar.

603
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,040
Seong Ho: Let's make a photo album later.

604
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,440
Seong Ho: I like that kind of stuff.

605
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,790
Jun Seong: Then let's use up all the films we brought today.

606
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,270
That's it for now.

607
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,680
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

608
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,920
Give me this, please.

609
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,890
Seong Ho: Why did you comb your hair up today?

610
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:04,290
Jun Seong: You said it looks nice.

611
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,000
Seong Ho: It suits you well.

612
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:10,170
Jun Seong: I'm afraid I will look too bossy if I comb them all up.

613
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:12,430
Seong Ho: I like that. The bossy image.

614
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,150
Jun Seong: Really? Be bossy to you?

615
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:17,310
-What?
-Do you really want me to be bossy to you?

616
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,330
Tomorrow.

617
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:19,800
Seong Ho: Let's talk about it tomorrow.

618
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,560
Thank you.

619
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,970
(The dessert ordered according to Seong Ho's taste)

620
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,100
Thank you.

621
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,480
Seong Ho: It looks like… It looks like Greek yogurt very much.

622
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,100
Jun Seong: Oh, really. It smells like the one yesterday.

623
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,900
-It smells like the one yesterday.
-Right?

624
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,950
Jun Seong: Is it delicious?

625
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,110
Seong Ho: Yes, it is.

626
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,400
Jun Seong: How was that day?

627
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,850
Jun Seong: The day when we decided to change rooms.

628
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:53,430
Jun Seong: You chose me, right?

629
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:57,520
Jun Seong: But when you went in, you found out that we can't sleep together with that room structure.

630
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,750
Jun Seong: How did you feel then?

631
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,690
Seong Ho: In fact, I had been thinking

632
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:04,800
Seong Ho: that I wanted to continue to share a room with you.

633
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,470
Seong Ho: It would be a minus if I said that.

634
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,550
Seong Ho: I was so angry

635
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:13,450
Seong Ho: when I knew Min Seong and Seon Woo would share one room.

636
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:16,160
Seong Ho: At that moment, I was a little angry.

637
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:20,070
Seong Ho: I was thinking about it all time. I was really angry.

638
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,880
Jun Seong: It’s understandable.

639
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,540
Seong Ho: I was really angry at that time.

640
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,920
Jun Seong: What about now?

641
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:34,390
Jun Seong: How do you feel about Seon Woo now?

642
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,180
Seong Ho: Let's see it tonight.

643
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,080
Jun Seong: What?

644
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,670
Seong Ho: There will be voice messages tonight, right?

645
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:51,170
Jun Seong: What? You are making me curious about it.

646
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:55,070
Jun Seong: I'm most worried about one thing.

647
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:58,840
Jun Seong: That is, when Seong Ho seems to have feelings for me,

648
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,150
Jun Seong: I'll have the wrong idea that I succeed.

649
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:01,310
(Jun Seong: Seong Ho's letter may show that his feelings will change all of a sudden. It's hard to say)
Jun Seong: I'll have the wrong idea that I succeed.

650
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:05,210
Seong Ho's letter may show that his feelings will change all of a sudden. It's hard to say.

651
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,180
Jun Seong: But today's date with you

652
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:12,450
Jun Seong: is something I’ve been waiting for for a long time.

653
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:14,460
Jun Seong: Over the past few days,

654
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:19,770
Jun Seong: the dates I've had have made me happy and excited.

655
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:20,900
Jun Seong: They were all good.

656
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,990
Jun Seong: But suddenly I feel very uneasy.

657
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:25,660
Seong Ho: Why?

658
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:29,030
Jun Seong: During the eight days when we're here,

659
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,770
Jun Seong: we don't need to do anything else.

660
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:33,760
-Jun Seong: We can just concentrate all our attention -Right.

661
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,030
Jun Seong: on each other.

662
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:39,630
Jun Seong: But when this is all over

663
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:41,180
Jun Seong: and we continue to live our own life,

664
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:45,160
Jun Seong: I won't be able to concentrate all my attention on you.

665
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:51,650
What will happen if you find that I'm different

666
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:56,800
from the person you see here?

667
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,390
This is what makes me uneasy.

668
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,720
Seong Ho: I feel the same way.

669
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,990
Seong Ho: I wouldn’t be so well-dressed when I'm not here.

670
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:08,570
Seong Ho: I'm more like a messy man with a casual manner.

671
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:11,330
Seong Ho: Others will sometimes see my tired face.

672
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:15,040
Seong Ho: I'm probably not a guy you expected me to be after seeing me here.

673
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,390
Seong Ho: I’m also worried about that.

674
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:18,940
Jun Seong: But I think you look better without makeup.

675
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,180
Seong Ho: Thank you.

676
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,670
Jun Seong: You look simple in that way.

677
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:23,810
Seong Ho: Didn’t you say you like guys who look like a punk?

678
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:24,550
Simplicity it is.

679
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,170
Seong Ho: Get yourself a new ideal partner.

680
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,350
Jun Seong: What should it be like? A young man in the countryside.

681
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:30,770
Jun Seong: To be honest, I would for sure imagine I'll be successfully matched

682
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:35,190
Jun Seong: with someone I love here and we leave the Men's House together.

683
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:40,130
Jun Seong: I said those things under that assumption.

684
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,700
Jun Seong: That's great.

685
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,940
Really.

686
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:46,340
Jun Seong: I cannot even feel that the time elapses when we are chatting.

687
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,390
Jun Seong: Ah, it's fun. I feel comfortable.

688
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:50,530
-Seong Ho: Let's go. -Let's go.

689
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:51,090
Let's go buy some chocolate.

690
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:52,350
(Seong Ho: Let's go buy some chocolate.
We need to buy some fillings for the semi-finished carp bread later)

692
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:57,790
Jun Seong: Do you want to try the carp bread sold on the streets?

693
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:58,590
Seong Ho: Ah, but I’m full.

694
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:01,960
Jun Seong: But only after we eat it can we learn how to make it.

695
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,250
Seong Ho: No, I’m full.

696
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,000
Jun Seong: What?

697
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,320
Seong Ho: I'm really full. You're not full?

698
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,730
Jun Seong: But fish cakes are also sold there.

699
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:08,350
Seong Ho: Fish cakes? I'm full. Really.

700
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,770
-Thank you. -Bye.

701
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:10,650
They look delicious.

702
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,160
Just take out yours.

703
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,410
How can you do that?

704
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:16,740
You should eat them too. Very delicious.

705
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:20,000
Seong Ho: The weather suddenly becomes better. It’s great.

706
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,080
Jun Seong: Yes. After I applied for a date with you today,

707
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,100
Jun Seong: the weather became so lovely

708
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,390
Jun Seong: that I cheered for it.

709
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:28,810
-Seong Ho: Really? -Jun Seong: Yes.

710
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:29,590
Seong Ho: You were cheering in your heart, right?

711
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,760
Jun Seong: Yes. I was cheering in my heart.

712
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,400
Jun Seong: I didn't cheer aloud and say "Wow".

713
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,090
Jun Seong: I didn't scream like you did when you were scared.

714
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:35,220
Seong Ho: What?

715
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,490
Jun Seong: I didn't scream like you did when you were scared.

716
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:39,600
Jun Seong: You screamed in the air that day.

717
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,650
Seong Ho: I showed many sides of myself.

718
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:42,430
Jun Seong: Very good.

719
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:43,700
Jun Seong: What I like the best about you

720
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,990
is that you screamed aloud that day.

721
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,960
Seong Ho: I will often scream.

722
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:52,120
Seong Ho: Wow, it's really beautiful.

723
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:52,840
(The picturesque scenery presented in front of the two)

724
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,200
It's the first time I've seen a beach like this.
(The picturesque scenery presented in front of the two)

725
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,450
-Really? -Yes.

729
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:02,210
-Jun Seong: Me too. -Seong Ho: I think I've made the right decision to come here.

730
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:04,710
Seong Ho: I actually regretted it a little bit on the third day.

731
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:05,670
Jun Seong: Why?

732
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:08,679
Seong Ho: I was wondering why I should come.

733
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,199
Seong Ho: I was afraid I couldn't find my happiness.

734
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:14,090
Seong Ho: But I’m very happy now.

735
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,920
-Jun Seong: Great. -Seong Ho: What about you?

736
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,500
Jun Seong: I've always been happy.

737
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:22,610
It's nice to appreciate the scenery with you.

738
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:24,290
(Seong Ho: It's like Jun Seong is at home)

739
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:27,280
It's like Jun Seong is at home.
(Seong Ho: It's like Jun Seong is at home)

740
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,739
Seong Ho: It's interesting. We can just focus on our conversation.

741
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:34,840
Jun Seong: I'm still attracted by what I like about him

742
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:38,230
Jun Seong: when we are seeing each other alone. That's great.

743
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:48,389
(Chung-ook comes downstairs to do the dishes)

744
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,790
-Hyeong Jin: Please have a seat there. Chung-ook: No. I'll do the dishes.

745
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:51,679
Hyeong Jin: No, no, no.

746
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,070
Hyeong Jin: No. I cooked.

747
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:55,730
Hyeong Jin: How about you make me a cup of coffee?

748
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:57,730
-Chung-ook: Coffee? -Hyeong Jin: Yes.

749
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,150
Hyeong Jin: Are you flustered?

750
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:01,730
How should I make the coffee?

751
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:03,560
Chung-ook: The current situation makes me...

752
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,010
-Hyeong Jin: I'll tell you what's happening while doing the dishes.-Okay.

753
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:07,900
-Hyeong Jin: Let me tell you what's going on. -Okay.

754
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:11,790
Hyeong Jin: You are flustered about the current situation,

755
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:12,920
Hyeong Jin: but you don't hate it, right?

756
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,500
Chung-ook: Definitely not.

757
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,950
-Chung-ook: Actually, I think it’s better now. -Better?

758
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:18,140
Dating a new guy is better.

759
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:22,200
Chung-ook: I thought I would go on a date with the same person.

760
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,990
Chung-ook: Now I feel completely relaxed.

761
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:29,830
Hyeong Jin: I can discover new things through this date.

762
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:30,930
Chung-ook: Yes.

763
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:33,990
Hyeong Jin: It’s totally unexpected.

764
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:38,070
Chung-ook: I want to have a close look at every one of us.

765
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:41,320
Chung-ook: As long as it’s not Yung Hee, I'm okay with it.

766
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:45,660
Chung-ook: As long as it's not the same person, it's fine.

767
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,980
Chung-ook: I felt comfortable to get along with Hyeong Jin.

768
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:52,280
Chung-ook: I do expect to have deep conversations with him.

769
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,120
Thank you.

770
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,070
What a nice day!

771
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:59,270
Seon Woo: Are you driving?

772
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:00,380
Yung Hee: I'll drive.

773
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:02,510
Yung Hee: Let me show my charm.

774
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,590
Get in.

775
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,650
Seon Woo: It's my first time to have a date in a car.

776
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:11,830
Seon Woo: How should I put it?

777
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:13,950
Seon Woo: It's also my first time to date someone who will drive for me.

778
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:15,460
Yung Hee: As the youngest of us all, I'll show you a contrast and my charm.

779
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,640
Seon Woo: Well, I don't know about it.

780
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,050
Seon Woo: I don't have to be nervous, right.

781
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:21,360
Yung Hee: Of course you don't need to be nervous. It's a different world from the world yesterday.

782
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:26,640
Yung Hee: You work in Yeonnam-dong, right?

783
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,090
Seon Woo: What a coincidence! Yes.

784
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:30,510
Yung Hee: OK, let's go.

785
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,700
Seon Woo: Really.

786
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:39,360
Seon Woo: There're only two of us. I feel different.

787
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,690
Yung Hee: Yes.

788
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:42,140
Yung Hee: It's a new experience.

789
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,400
Seon Woo: It's like we are dating.

790
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,050
Yung Hee: I feel great.

791
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:48,740
-Seon Woo: It feels like -With you...

792
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,170
Seon Woo: we are going on a date.

793
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:54,310
Yung Hee: I thought there was no chance for me. I didn't expect this to happen in this way.

794
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:55,970
Yung Hee: We created the chance, right?

795
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:56,900
Seon Woo: I created it.

796
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:57,900
Yung Hee: You created it.

797
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:02,810
-Seon Woo: No, you created it. -You created it.

798
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,230
You're a good driver.

799
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:07,850
I'm left-handed, which makes it easy for me to spun the steering wheel.

803
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:12,610
Seon Woo: I didn't know that.

804
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:14,610
Yung Hee: So I sit on the far left when I eat.

805
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:18,360
Seon Woo: In that case, you'll feel closer to me?

806
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:22,520
Yung Hee: I’ve driven cars with a manual gear many times.

807
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,790
Seon Woo: Ah. You look like a soldier driver now.

808
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:25,050
Really?

809
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:25,880
(Shy)
Really?

810
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,570
How is it?
(Shy)

811
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:27,500
Comparing you to a soldier driver.

812
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,000
Yung Hee: So I'm a different person from your imagination, right?

813
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,950
Yung Hee: I am more than a person with many flaws.

814
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:32,720
Really?

815
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:35,890
Seon Woo: I don't think you have many flaws.

816
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:38,080
Yung Hee: Really? Great.

817
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:44,340
Seon Woo: What came to your mind first

818
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,060
Seon Woo: when you saw that mission card?

819
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,640
Seon Woo: When you were reading that mission card.

820
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,280
Yung Hee: I wanted to go on a date with you for sure.

821
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:54,100
Yung Hee: But when I was thinking about it,

822
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:54,220
(Yung Hee: you just invited me to a date first)
Yung Hee: But when I was thinking about it,

823
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:56,460
You invited me to a date first.
(Yung Hee: you just invited me to a date first)

824
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,640
Yung Hee: I felt very grateful for that.

825
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:01,850
Seon Woo: At that moment, I didn’t expect that you would initiate a date with me.

826
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:06,110
Yung Hee: Seong Ho and Jun Seong are going on a date today.

827
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:06,880
Yung Hee: You don't you mind it?

828
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,140
Seon Woo: Me? I don't mind it.

829
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,490
-Yung Hee: Really? -Yes.

830
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:13,550
Seon Woo: I couldn't go on a date with Seong Ho because of the mission.

831
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:16,010
Seon Woo: But even if the mission enabled me to date him,

832
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:18,620
Seon Woo: I would still choose Yung Hee.

833
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,740
Seon Woo: So I just focused on my date with Yung Hee.

834
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:22,040
(Yung Hee: I know I shouldn't think that way but I still hope things can go well between Seong Ho and Jun Seong)

835
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:26,060
I know I shouldn't think that way but I still hope things can go well between Seong Ho and Jun Seong.
(Yung Hee: I know I shouldn't think that way but I still hope things can go well between Seong Ho and Jun Seong)

836
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:29,240
Yung Hee: In that case, I’ll have a chance to intervene.

837
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:33,710
Yung Hee: I did think that way for some time.

838
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:37,100
Seon Woo: Fortunately, the sunshine is warm.

839
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,770
Yung Hee: I haven't been to Yeonnam-dong many times.

840
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:41,570
Yung Hee: I’m in a good mood today.

841
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,650
Yung Hee: I feel happy for no reason.

842
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:45,300
Seon Woo: For no reason?

843
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,720
Yung Hee: Why are you laughing? You know it.

844
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,450
-You know it. -Seon Woo: No reason?

845
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:50,730
Yung Hee: I'm shy.

846
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:56,510
Seon Woo: There is a really good food shop nearby.

847
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:57,910
-Really? -Seon Woo: Let's go there.

848
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,820
-Seon Woo: Are you feeling cold? -Yung Hee: No.

849
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,100
A food shop in Yeonnam-dong.

850
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:06,070
Seon Woo: That shop is the best and my favorite shop in Yeonnam-dong.

851
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,060
Here?

852
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:07,950
-Yes, it's here. -Here?

853
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:08,480
(Where is Seon Woo bringing Yung Hee?)
-Yes, it's here. -Here?

854
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,280
(Where is Seon Woo bringing Yung Hee?)

855
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,280
-The food shop in Yeonnam-dong. -Yes.
(Where is Seon Woo bringing Yung Hee?)

856
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:11,910
(Where is Seon Woo bringing Yung Hee?)

857
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,830
-Yung Hee: Wow. -Seon Woo: You didn't know we were coming here?

858
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,640
-Yung Hee: I didn't know. Is this your shop? -Seon Woo: You didn't know?

859
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,360
-Yung Hee: Is this your shop? -Seon Woo: Of course. Welcome.

860
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,470
So this is your shop.

861
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:26,320
Yung Hee: It's so beautifully decorated.

862
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,450
Yung Hee: So I’m the first one to come here.

863
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:32,400
Yung Hee: Awesome. I’m the first one to come here.

864
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,640
Yung Hee: It's an unexpected place.

865
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,300
Yung Hee: It's his gelato shop.

866
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,920
Yung Hee: It was amazing and I felt very happy.

867
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,780
Yung Hee: I was looking at everything carefully.

868
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,240
Yung Hee: So that was the place.

869
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,770
Seon Woo: Actually, today's date is something I've been preparing and waiting for for a long time.

870
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:48,670
Seon Woo: I thought that day, we could spend some time in my shop,

871
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:54,990
Seon Woo: or go for a walk around and have a meal or something.

872
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,410
Seon Woo: Well, I thought you would know we were coming here

873
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:59,340
Seon Woo: when I said we were going to Yeonnam-dong.

874
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,670
-Yung Hee: Oh, really? -Seon Woo: Yes.

875
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:01,910
Yung Hee: I didn't expect that.

876
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:02,900
Seon Woo: Have a gelato first.

877
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,830
Yung Hee: OK.

878
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,770
Seon Woo: How about a chocolate gelato?

879
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:06,700
Yung Hee: Chocolate is OK.

880
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,090
Chocolate. Chocolate. OK.

881
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:09,990
Yung Hee: A chocolate gelato with sweet and sour flavor.

882
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:12,210
-Seon Woo: You just need to sit there and wait for a few moments.

883
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:14,180
-I just sit there? -Seon Woo: Don't touch anything. There.

884
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,780
Yung Hee: Your shop is really beautiful.

885
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,270
Seon Woo: You think it is beautiful?

886
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:19,620
Yung Hee: It's so well decorated. Did you decorate it yourself?

887
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:23,430
Seon Woo: Well, I designed it. I didn’t do all the decorations myself.

888
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:24,740
Yung Hee: Of course.

889
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,110
Seon Woo: But actually,

890
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:30,210
Seon Woo: I can't imagine...

891
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:32,810
-Seon Woo: I just cannot imagine who I will bring here. -Yung Hee: Right.

892
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:37,160
Seon Woo: This is the place where I spend most of my time.

893
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,300
Seon Woo: Who I should bring here to have a date with is important to me.

894
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,350
Seon Woo: However, since I need to have a date with you,

895
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:44,720
Seon Woo: I think I should bring you here.

896
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,190
Seon Woo: So I bring you here without hesitation.

897
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:48,910
Yung Hee: I’m happy.

898
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:50,360
Seon Woo: OK. I’ll try it.

899
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,350
Yung Hee: You must be happy that I came.

900
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:53,920
-Seon Woo: Not bad. -Not bad?

901
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:57,410
People nowadays will say this is so silly.

902
00:40:58,210 --> 00:40:59,940
-Oh my. -Yung Hee: That’s a gelato?

903
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,370
Yung Hee: I've never had a gelato before.

904
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:03,540
-I remember I said it. -Seon Woo: You’ve never had a gelato before?

905
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,510
-How is that possible? -Yung Hee: I've never had it before.

906
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:07,760
Seon Woo: Wait. So the first gelato in your life

907
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,550
Seon Woo: is the one I'm making for you?

908
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,930
Yung Hee: Yes, after I taste your gelato,

909
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:13,240
Yung Hee: I'll have a deep impression of what a gelato is like.

910
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,440
Seon Woo: This is too good.

911
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,380
Yung Hee: Will I have to come here for it every day?

912
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:21,120
Seon Woo: You have to work here.

913
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:23,880
Yung Hee: Tell me when you need an assistant.

914
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,520
Seon Woo: I don't have any assistant. I've been running this shop all by myself.

915
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:30,540
Yung Hee: When I saw him standing there, I felt he was so handsome.

916
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:33,690
Yung Hee: At that time, I realized that people are the most handsome when they're doing their own job.

917
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:35,760
Yung Hee: What is that?

918
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,890
Seon Woo: These pistachio nuts

919
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:42,040
Seon Woo: are the kind that I love the best and eat the most.

920
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,500
-Pistachio? -Pistachio.

921
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,670
It's expensive nuts.

922
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,720
-Seon Woo: I'm not nervous. I'm confident. -Yung Hee: Don’t you want to have some?

923
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,080
Yung Hee: Can we share this?

924
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:52,690
Seon Woo: I haven't eaten it for a long time. I want to try it.

925
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:54,740
Seon Woo: Let's sit. We can eat them while chatting.

926
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:57,660
Seon Woo: Let's prepare some ice creams for other friends. -Should we?

927
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,500
-Seon Woo: You pack them. -Okay.

928
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,440
Seon Woo: It's like I'm doing a part-time job.

929
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,130
Yung Hee: OK. OK.

930
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:03,770
Seon Woo: Let me be a boss for once.

931
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:05,670
This part-time job is easy. Very easy.

932
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:07,860
Seon Woo: OK. Please have a try.

933
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,390
Yung Hee: Thank you.

934
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:11,620
-Seon Woo: Please enjoy. - Yung Hee: It looks delicious.

935
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:12,670
Seon Woo: Taste it first.

936
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:13,760
Yung Hee: Let me try it.

937
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,710
I want to eat this first.

938
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,990
-Yes. -Seon Woo: Swallow it first. Swallow it first.

939
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:25,710
Yung Hee: Normally I don't like sweet food,

940
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,900
Yung Hee: but this is so good.

941
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,750
-Really -Yeah, really.

942
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:32,320
(Click)

943
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,210
-What's this again? Seon Woo: It's pistachio.

944
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:35,600
Yung Hee: Are they pistachio nuts?

945
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:38,070
Yung Hee: Taste the pistachio nuts.

946
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:42,890
(Curious)

947
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:48,110
Yung Hee: They smell good.

948
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,620
Seon Woo: Of course. They're nuts.

949
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:52,220
-Yung Hee: Oh, they're nuts. -Yes.

950
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:53,490
Yung Hee: Wait. I’ll try it again.

951
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,500
Yung Hee: It’s really delicious. It’s a bit chewy.

952
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,340
Yung Hee: I’m not good at showing reactions.

953
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:02,980
Yung Hee: But I think it's the best ice cream I've ever had.

954
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:07,200
Seon Woo: When I was making ice cream and standing there,

955
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,610
Seon Woo: I felt

956
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:12,750
Seon Woo: a little sad, actually.

957
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:20,570
Seon Woo: It feels like I’m going to wake up from my dream. The feeling of waking up from a dream.

958
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:24,440
Yung Hee: Your words make me feel the same way.

959
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:27,280
Yung Hee: I tried not to think about it.

960
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:31,970
Seon Woo: It’s like waking up from a dream.

961
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:34,030
Yung Hee: I feel the same way.

962
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:38,180
Yung Hee: I’m afraid I’ll be sad. So I didn't think about it.

963
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:41,250
Seon Woo: I thought I would be happy.

964
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:44,110
Seon Woo: It's been a long time since I came here last time.

965
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:46,660
Seon Woo: I thought I would be happy to come with someone I met in the Men's House.

966
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:48,530
Seon Woo: But why am I feeling so...

967
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:54,850
Seon Woo: So we all tried our best with our sincerity.

968
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:58,840
Seon Woo: I feel sorry for every day. We have already been...

969
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:02,850
Yung Hee: So we have close connections now.

970
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:05,100
Seon Woo: This is a little interesting.

971
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:09,550
Yung Hee: Have some chocolate.

972
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:16,680
Yung Hee: Yes, time flies.

973
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:20,490
Seon Woo: Do you think you will ever regret it?

974
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:25,580
Yung Hee: Regret? A little bit. Much.

975
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:26,950
Seon Woo: Why?

976
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:32,750
Yung Hee: I don't know.

977
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:39,820
Yung Hee: I feel I might regret it for no reason.

978
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:41,790
Yung Hee: I feel I’ll regret it.

979
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:47,710
Yung Hee: If I had been more selfish...

980
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:54,290
Yung Hee: If I had been better...

981
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:57,430
Yung Hee: But all is good.

982
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:02,900
(Nodding)

983
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,440
Seon Woo:You can come here to eat the gelato in the future.

984
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,040
Yung Hee: I will come here often.

985
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,470
Seon Woo: This is a place we can come to often.

986
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:14,390
Yung Hee: It's not far from my place. Seon Woo: It's not far.

987
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:17,020
Seon Woo: I used to think that I must come to my shop

988
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:18,060
Seon Woo: with someone I love.

989
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:22,790
Seon Woo: But after this date in the shop,

990
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:26,320
Seon Woo: I realized it has nothing to do with those things.

991
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:29,700
Seon Woo: At that moment, the days spent in the Men's House

992
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:35,630
Seon Woo: are like a dream to us.

993
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:38,790
Seon Woo: I think Yung Hee felt the same way.

994
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:43,860
Seon Woo: The conversation we had that resonated with each other was very memorable

995
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:48,280
Seon Woo: I've always stayed in the shop alone since I began to run this shop.

996
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,630
Seon Woo: Then I went to the Men's House. I feel like I'm happy.

997
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:53,710
Seon Woo: Because everyone is so nice.

998
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:55,230
Seon Woo: We are all nice people. That's why it'll be like that.

999
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:57,780
Yung Hee: It should be interesting if all of us can come here together.

1000
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:58,870
Yung Hee: We can come together in the future.

1001
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,310
-Seon Woo: We should come together. - Yung Hee: OK.

1002
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,890
Yung Hee: I didn't expect to come here at all.

1003
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:09,590
Seon Woo: I didn't expect to come with you.

1004
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:13,320
Yung Hee: To be honest, today's date in his shop

1005
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:19,310
Yung Hee: should be something Seon Woo has been looking forward to the most.

1006
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:21,930
Yung Hee: It's obvious who he wants to have that date with.

1007
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:25,700
Yung Hee: I’m sure he wants to have that date with the one he loves the most.

1008
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:29,220
I was wondering if it is because of my selfishness

1009
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:32,980
that he couldn't date with the guy he loves.

1010
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:34,410
Yung Hee: So I feel a little sorry for him.

1011
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,900
-Yung Hee: Time to work. -Seon Woo: Let's get to work.

1012
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:41,790
Yung Hee: I have to pay for your ice creams.

1013
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:43,220
Of course.

1014
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:45,960
Here.

1015
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:49,460
-Let me try. -Put your coat there.

1016
00:46:50,410 --> 00:46:51,480
Do some work.

1017
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:57,530
Seon Woo: I don't even let my friends enter my kitchen.

1018
00:46:57,530 --> 00:46:58,170
Yung Hee: Really?

1019
00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:00,860
-Seon Woo: I've never let them in. Yung Hee: Am I the first one to come into the kitchen?

1020
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,380
-Okay, then. -Seon Woo: You should be.

1021
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:03,710
Let me see.

1022
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:04,710
Seon Woo: Put the gelato here.

1023
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:05,370
-Is this it? -Yes.

1024
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:08,880
-Seon Woo: Put an equal amount of the ice cream of the four flavors into it. -Okay.

1025
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:09,400
Seon Woo: Can you do it?

1026
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,580
Yung Hee: Got it.

1027
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:12,390
This will be very chewy.

1028
00:47:13,610 --> 00:47:15,240
What's going on?

1029
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,920
-It's more difficult than I expected. -It's not that easy, right?

1030
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,470
Yung Hee: Yeah, it's very chewy.

1031
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:20,190
Yung Hee: It requires some strength.

1032
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,180
Put the pistachio nuts.

1033
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:24,680
Seon Woo: Scrape it.

1034
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:26,050
-Scrape it. -OK.

1035
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:28,730
Seon Woo: You look like a good part-timer.

1036
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:30,020
Yung Hee: Really?

1037
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:31,980
-Seon Woo: I think I can get off work now. -At least,

1038
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:33,900
Yung Hee: I can be a part-timer for a day or so in your shop sometimes.

1039
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:37,260
Yung Hee: Tell me when you want to have a rest. I’ll help you run the shop.

1040
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:40,540
Put some meringue on the chocolate. It'll be good.

1041
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:40,820
(Skillfully decorating the ice cream)
Put some meringue on the chocolate. It'll be good.

1042
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:42,850
Sprinkle some.

1044
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:47,540
(Taking a glance)

1045
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,520
Seon Woo: You look like a lively part-timer.

1046
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,900
Yung Hee: I know. I’m the ace.

1047
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,280
Yung Hee: Please raise my salary, boss.

1048
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,810
-Okay. -Okay.

1049
00:47:57,810 --> 00:48:00,080
Let's finish the follow-up work.

1050
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:02,340
Press the lid.

1051
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:06,580
Seon Woo: You work hard no matter what you do.

1052
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:10,330
Yung Hee: Yes. I was educated to work hard in life

1053
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:12,310
Yung Hee: no matter what I am doing.

1054
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,750
Yung Hee: Are you done? -Seon Woo: Yes.

1055
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:19,360
-Yung Hee: Shall we go eat? -Yes.

1056
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,440
Seon Woo: We. -Yes.

1057
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,770
Seon Woo: Wait. Let's take a picture together.

1058
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:24,050
Okay.

1059
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:31,480
Seon Woo: If there's a photo taken in my shop,

1060
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,210
Seon Woo: it won't feel like it's just a dream.

1061
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,240
Is my focus right?

1062
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,330
Okay.

1063
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,580
Let's go.

1064
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:45,940
Seon Woo: I'm hungry.

1065
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:49,450
Seon Woo: Well. I just let you have the gelato on an empty stomach.

1066
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:51,670
Yung Hee: I think the gelato is delicious.

1067
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:53,270
Yung Hee: I don't know who made it.

1068
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:54,490
Seon Woo: Who else?

1069
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,110
It's good.

1070
00:48:57,930 --> 00:48:59,500
It looks delicious.

1071
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:01,240
What? The food isn't served yet. How do you know it'll be delicious?

1072
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,750
Well. It smells good.

1073
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:08,730
Yung Hee: Come on. Let's order. I'm hungry.

1074
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:13,960
-I want... -Seon Woo: What did you eat when you were dating others?

1075
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,670
Yung Hee: When I was having a date with others,

1076
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:18,050
Yung Hee: I only had desserts on the first day.

1077
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:21,290
Yung Hee: I had steak and pasta on the second day.

1078
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:23,350
Seon Woo: We haven't eaten meat for a long time Let's eat meat.

1079
00:49:23,350 --> 00:49:24,970
Yung Hee: OK, let's eat meat.

1080
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:26,620
-Yung Hee: Do you want cheese dumplings? -Seon Woo: OK.

1081
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:27,560
This one. The first one.

1082
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:28,240
OK.

1083
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,340
Okay.

1084
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:34,740
-Seon Woo: From the beginning... -Well.

1085
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:36,810
Seon Woo: Did I leave you a good first impression?

1086
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:38,410
Seon Woo: Do you have feelings for me from the beginning?

1087
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:40,820
Yung Hee: From the beginning, I've had feelings for you.

1088
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:43,940
Yung Hee: We three came first and we were sitting there.

1089
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:48,680
Yung Hee: Then three people came in. I saw you at first sight.

1090
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:50,900
Yung Hee: Then two others came in.

1091
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:55,280
Yung Hee: But I wasn't looking at them. I could only see you.

1092
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:57,550
Seon Woo: I guess you like elder guys.

1093
00:49:57,550 --> 00:50:00,040
Yung Hee: What? What are you talking about?

1094
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:01,290
Age.

1095
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:04,350
Seon Woo: Weren't you surprised when you knew my age?

1096
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:06,420
Yung Hee: To be honest, I was a little surprised.

1097
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:09,020
Yung Hee: Because you looked so young.

1098
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:10,750
Really?

1099
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:13,140
Seon Woo: How old do you want me to be?

1100
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:14,700
How old do I want you to be?

1101
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:19,140
Yung Hee: I don’t have that kind of thoughts

1102
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:21,960
Yung Hee: Because I like you.

1103
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:25,430
Yung Hee: I don't care much about your age.

1104
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:28,670
Seon Woo: But some people will think the difference between our age is too big.

1105
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:29,550
(Seon Woo: Because we are in the Men's House)
Seon Woo: But some people will think the difference between our age is too big.

1106
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:32,130
Because we are in the Men's House,
(Seon Woo: Because we are in the Men's House)

1107
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:35,120
Seon Woo: we only show the best side of ourselves.

1108
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,110
Yung Hee: Maybe.

1109
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:41,850
Yung Hee: I can feel your sincerity from whatever you did.

1110
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:44,680
Yung Hee: I can also feel your kindness.

1111
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:47,970
Yung Hee: I didn’t try to look at your good side only.

1112
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:50,440
Yung Hee: I like the way you are.

1113
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:52,860
Seon Woo: When everyone is confused,

1114
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:56,110
Seon Woo: and our feelings are intertwined,

1115
00:50:56,110 --> 00:51:01,410
Seon Woo: Yung Hee has brought a lot of support for me.

1116
00:51:01,410 --> 00:51:04,120
Seon Woo: In this aspect,

1117
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:06,640
Seon Woo: I didn't feel sensitive.

1118
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,930
Seon Woo: Yung Hee has become more important to me.

1119
00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:13,560
Seon Woo: But I am much older than him.

1120
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:19,370
Seon Woo: I doubt if we can overcome this.

1121
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:22,670
Yung Hee: But..

1122
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:25,240
I don’t know how I should ask the question.

1123
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,170
(Hesitating)
I don’t know how I should ask the question.

1124
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:34,510
Can I ask if you have any feelings for me?

1125
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:39,050
Seon Woo: How should I put it? -Well.

1126
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:41,970
Yung Hee: Just tell me yes or no.

1127
00:51:42,270 --> 00:51:47,170
Yung Hee: I’m very satisfied now. I want to know the answer.

1128
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:50,030
Okay.

1129
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:50,450
(Well...)
Okay.

1130
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:51,760
(Well...)

1131
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,970
Seon Woo: You'll be okay with whatever I say.

1132
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:59,410
Yung Hee: Yes. I've made up my mind.

1133
00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:02,350
Then I'll just...

1134
00:52:02,350 --> 00:52:05,770
Seon Woo: I’ll say whatever I want to say.

1135
00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:09,430
Seon Woo: Because today's date isn't over yet.

1136
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:15,010
Seon Woo: If you ask me who have left me the best first impressions, you are one of them.

1137
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:16,730
Seon Woo: Because

1138
00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:20,090
Seon Woo: I think you and I live in the Men's House

1139
00:52:20,090 --> 00:52:23,020
Seon Woo: with the most similar mentality.

1140
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:25,240
Seon Woo: I said this.

1141
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:28,940
Seon Woo: In my heart, you are like this.

1142
00:52:29,410 --> 00:52:31,950
Seon Woo: That's it.

1143
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:32,490
Okay.

1144
00:52:32,490 --> 00:52:33,950
-That’s it. -OK.

1145
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:37,880
Yung Hee: I didn't get a clear answer.

1146
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:42,200
Yung Hee: He avoided directly answering my question.

1147
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:46,710
Yung Hee: On the one hand, I felt it's a pity.

1148
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:49,600
The food is ready.

1149
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:53,950
Yes.

1150
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:55,860
Yes.

1151
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:57,160
Thank you.

1152
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:58,900
We ordered a lot.

1153
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:01,000
Yung Hee: How to cut this?

1154
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,510
Seon Woo: Use your hand.

1155
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:04,370
(Hesitating)

1156
00:53:04,370 --> 00:53:07,020
You also...
(Hesitating)

1157
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:08,250
You also...

1158
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:12,430
Seon Woo: I think I roughly know who has called you.

1159
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:15,190
Seon Woo: They also contacted you, right?

1160
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:16,790
Seon Woo: Not just by calling. -Yung Hee: Yes.

1161
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:20,060
Seon Woo: In this aspect,

1162
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:23,310
Seon Woo: I didn't try to be close to you.

1163
00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:28,110
Seon Woo: How come you still chose me on the fifth day?

1164
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:33,330
Yung Hee: I like you because you're lively.

1165
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:34,630
Seon Woo: Lively? Am I?

1166
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:36,490
Yung Hee: Very lively. -Lively.

1167
00:53:36,490 --> 00:53:38,490
Yung Hee: I like you when you're being lively.

1168
00:53:38,490 --> 00:53:41,180
Yung Hee: And you look handsome when you smile.

1169
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:43,830
Yung Hee: The first time I saw you,

1170
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:47,380
Yung Hee: I was attracted by your appearance.

1171
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:48,840
Seon Woo: So you liked me because of my appearance.

1172
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:49,850
Yung Hee: Of course not.

1173
00:53:49,850 --> 00:53:51,900
Yung Hee: I told you. I also like your liveliness.

1174
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:54,300
-Liveliness. -Yung Hee: And you have a good personality.

1175
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:58,990
Yung Hee: We had a chat last night.

1176
00:53:58,990 --> 00:54:00,930
Yung Hee: From that conversation,

1177
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:02,960
Yung Hee: I confirmed

1178
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,700
Yung Hee: who the person in your heart is.

1179
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:11,870
Yung Hee: So I was thinking, should I gradually give up?

1180
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:17,350
Yung Hee: Should I be happy for you and for your love?

1181
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:19,780
Yung Hee: But after today's date, I changed my mind.

1182
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:26,010
I don't want to give up.

1183
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:31,090
Yung Hee: My choice will remain the same.

1184
00:54:31,090 --> 00:54:33,470
Yung Hee: Thank you for what you did today.

1185
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:37,000
Yung Hee: You should have come to your shop

1186
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,580
Yung Hee: with the guy you have the biggest crush on.

1187
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:43,020
Yung Hee: But you sent me a date invitation today.

1188
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:46,730
Yung Hee: Thank you for having the date with me.

1189
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,650
Yung Hee: Let's eat first. -Seon Woo: Let's eat.

1190
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:54,610
-Seon Woo: You don't know what will happen, do you? -Oh?

1191
00:54:54,610 --> 00:54:55,460
I don't know.

1192
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:57,490
Seon Woo: Because things always happen.

1193
00:54:57,490 --> 00:54:59,890
Seon Woo: Do you know I've been feeling more comfortable going out recently?

1194
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:00,770
Yung Hee: Yes.

1195
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:06,550
Yung Hee: But

1196
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,650
Yung Hee: I can be so relaxed.

1197
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:11,030
Yung Hee: This is the first time.

1198
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:12,100
Seon Woo: Why?

1199
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,330
Seon Woo: You can always go out.

1200
00:55:14,330 --> 00:55:16,130
Yung Hee: Yes, but today after I went out,

1201
00:55:16,130 --> 00:55:18,520
Yung Hee: I can feel so relaxed. This is the first time.

1202
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:23,420
Yung Hee: It happened on the morning of the second day.

1203
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:25,330
Yung Hee: I like you.

1204
00:55:25,330 --> 00:55:27,780
Seon Woo: Just say it now.

1205
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:29,630
Yung Hee: Because I think I need to say it.

1206
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:31,630
Yung Hee: I don’t want to hide my feelings.

1207
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:33,100
Yung Hee: I want to show it.

1208
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:35,260
Yung Hee: On the second morning,

1209
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:38,930
Yung Hee: I wanted to go on a date with you.

1210
00:55:38,930 --> 00:55:41,230
Yung Hee: But Seong Ho invited you.

1211
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:42,900
Yung Hee: I was a little jealous.

1212
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:45,970
Yung Hee: Hyeong Jin then came

1213
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:47,040
Yung Hee: and took you away.

1214
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,270
Yung Hee: I was very jealous at that time.

1215
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:50,300
Yung Hee: Why were you so popular?

1216
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:53,390
Yung Hee: So I’m relaxed today.

1217
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:56,000
Seon Woo: Because you can't see any competitors now? -Yung Hee: Yes.

1218
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,640
-Seon Woo: It's nothing. -Yung Hee: That's right.

1219
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:59,140
Yes.

1220
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:01,680
Seon Woo: Why do I always want to make a joke when I see you?

1221
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:04,940
Yung Hee: Then make a joke about me, as usual.

1222
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:09,060
Yung Hee: Do you have any questions about me?

1223
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:14,700
Seon Woo: What can I tell you?

1224
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:18,570
Seon Woo: Ask me more questions.

1225
00:56:18,570 --> 00:56:19,980
Yung Hee: Okay, I'll ask you more questions.

1226
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:23,640
Yung Hee: Because I’m curious about you.

1227
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:24,370
Then...

1228
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:25,590
(Thinking)
Then...

1229
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:27,090
(Thinking)

1230
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:31,500
I have a lot of questions.

1231
00:56:32,570 --> 00:56:34,110
Seon Woo: Then ask one more question.

1232
00:56:35,890 --> 00:56:38,150
Yung Hee: Will you really answer it?

1233
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:43,390
Seon Woo: Of course.

1234
00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:44,540
-Yung Hee: Really? -Seon Woo: Yes.

1235
00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:46,360
Yung Hee: Well.

1236
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:49,860
Yung Hee: Forget it. I can’t ask that.

1237
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:52,530
-Why? -Because I’m feeling uneasy.

1238
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,420
What you’re curious about?

1239
00:56:58,490 --> 00:57:01,580
Yung Hee: I didn't want to get him too much pressure.

1240
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:04,670
Yung Hee: But today may be the last chance.

1241
00:57:04,670 --> 00:57:06,770
Yung Hee: So I asked him many questions

1242
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:09,530
Yung Hee: which are about things I'm curious about.

1243
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:11,420
Yung Hee: I asked him all of the questions.

1244
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:17,910
Yung Hee: Have you ever dated someone like me?

1245
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:20,820
-Seon Woo: Yes. -Yung Hee: Oh, really?

1246
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:23,440
Yung Hee: Because I don't know your type is like.

1247
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,670
Yung Hee: So I want to know if I'm like your type.

1248
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:33,460
Seon Woo: The people I've dated

1249
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:41,590
Seon Woo: are like Yung Hee or Hyeong Jin.

1250
00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:43,530
Seon Woo: I also think it’s amazing.

1251
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:45,460
Seon Woo: I told Min Seong about this.

1252
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,650
Yung Hee: Today's date? How should I describe it?

1253
00:57:49,650 --> 00:57:51,450
Yung Hee: I can’t described it in one sentence.

1254
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:54,630
Yung Hee: There are many things that made me happy. There are also many things that made me sad.

1255
00:57:54,630 --> 00:58:00,740
Yung Hee: Today's date is more about our feelings and emotions.

1256
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:03,480
Yung Hee: So it’s hard to describe it in one sentence.

1257
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:11,130
Seon Woo: Yung Hee expressed his feelings for me.

1258
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:15,040
Seon Woo: It makes me feel more grateful to him.

1259
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:17,510
Seon Woo: Knowing that his feelings have never changed,

1260
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:20,570
Seon Woo: I kind of want to rely on him.

1261
00:58:20,570 --> 00:58:22,880
Seon Woo: It seems that I want to rely on him a little bit.

1262
00:58:24,790 --> 00:58:27,020
(Min Seong and Hyeong Joon are having a rest before they go on a date)

1263
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:28,570
Will us not be able to have the meal?
(Min Seong and Hyeong Joon are having a rest before they go on a date)

1264
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:30,080
Min Seong: Are you hungry?

1265
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:32,030
Hyeong Joon: Not really. I’m just curious.

1266
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:35,400
Min Seong: I hope we can eat something delicious.

1267
00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:40,600
Hyeong Joon: Pasta is also good.

1268
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:44,460
Min Seong: But I like Korean food the most.

1269
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:46,160
Hyeong Joon: Me too.

1270
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,090
Hyeong Joon: I prefer Korean food.

1271
00:58:48,470 --> 00:58:50,320
Hyeong Joon: Why am I suddenly sleepy?

1272
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,810
-Min Seong: Sleepy. -Hyeong Joon: Yeah.

1273
00:58:51,810 --> 00:58:53,480
Hyeong Joon: It's so comfortable to lie down like this.

1274
00:58:56,940 --> 00:59:00,510
(Hyeong Joon and Min Seong are in dream)

1275
00:59:01,150 --> 00:59:02,820
Hyeong Joon: I kind of feel it.

1276
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:06,300
Hyeong Joon: I do have a feeling that is being closer and distant.

1277
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:09,280
That's great. I can't describe it in words.

1278
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:15,000
I've had some feelings.

1279
00:59:17,530 --> 00:59:22,720
(What will the date between two men like?)

1280
00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:24,410
Guess what I prepared.

1281
00:59:24,410 --> 00:59:27,010
(Two men's "first date")
Guess what I prepared.

1282
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:30,370
What?

1283
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:31,390
He prepared a pair of rings that is for the couple. I'm so excited.

1284
00:59:31,390 --> 00:59:33,950
(Min Seong took out the couple rings prepared for Hyeong Joon)
He prepared a pair of rings that is for the couple. I'm so excited.

1285
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,280
Hyeong Joon: In the past, I said I just wanted to have a try.

1286
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,880
Now I've decided to try my best to leave no regrets

1287
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:44,160
Min Seong: I seem to be more positive now.

1288
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,510
My feelings have become stronger now.

1289
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:47,420
Hello.

1290
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:48,590
(After Min Seong rejected the date)
Hello.

1291
00:59:48,590 --> 00:59:48,990
(After Min Seong rejected the date)

1292
00:59:48,990 --> 00:59:50,340
Where did he go?
(After Min Seong rejected the date)

1293
00:59:51,270 --> 00:59:55,870
(He can only pay attention to one man)

1294
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:57,290
-It seems to be falling down. -No

1295
00:59:57,290 --> 00:59:58,960
(Another man who is just looking)
-It seems to be falling down. -No

1296
00:59:58,960 --> 00:59:59,640
What?
