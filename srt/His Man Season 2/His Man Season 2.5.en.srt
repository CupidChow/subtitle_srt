(Seong Ho wrote a note to Jun Seong)

8
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:47,580
How should I put it? I just want to comfort Jun Seong.

(Seong Ho: How should I put it? I just wanted to comfort Jun Seong)

11

(Staring)

18
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,700
Jun Seong: I couldn't help smiling when I saw the note.

19
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,460
Jun Seong: Because it's something beyond my expectation.

20
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,770
Jun Seong: I didn't think he cared about me at all.

21
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,570
Jun Seong: "Even if he doesn't like me,

22
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:37,220
he still cares about me."

23
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,700
Jun Seong: I sensed his intentions.

24
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,650
Jun Seong: That's why I kept smiling.

25
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,979
(Jun Seong looks at the note infatuately)

26
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,990
Jun Seong: I suddenly felt refreshed.

27
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,060
(Keeping the note in the blanket to keep the initial touch of emotion)

28
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,780
Jun Seong: I'm suddenly in a good mood.

29
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:43,380
(Taking out the note again and thinking about how to reply)

30
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,180
(Before writing a reply)

31
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,460
(Take a picture to conmemorize)

32
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,100
(Taking a picture to keep the initial touch of emotion when finding it)

33
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,340
(Expressing feelings in the same way)

34
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,710
OK.

Min Seong: get the meal ready quickly.

39
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:53,520
Jun Seong: Prepare in advance. What are you going to do for dinner?

40
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:53,660
I prepared spicy chicken stew.

41
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,630
(Min Seong and Jun Seong are preparing spicy chicken stew)
I prepared spicy chicken stew.

42

44

46
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,670
Jun Seong: What can I help?

47
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:05,280
Min Seong: Cut potatoes.

48
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,500
Jun Seong: How to cut potatoes?

49
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,190
Randomly...

50
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,530
Jun Seong: I need to peel potatoes first, right?

51
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,380
Min Seong: Yes, peel them first.

52
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,399
Jun Seong: This knife is too blunt.

53
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,029
Min Seong: Just shave it with a spoon.

54
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,150
Jun Seong: You're a genius, right?

55
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:25,550
(Min Seong: What's wrong?)

56

Why? Does it work?
(Min Seong: What's wrong?)

57
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,540
Why? Does it work?

58
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,970
Jun Seong: I didn't know there was such a method.

59
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,310
-Min Seong: Is it good?
-Jun Seong: Yes.

60
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,440
Min Seong: I wonder if they will like the spicy chicken stew.

61
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,070
Jun Seong: They will.

62
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,710
Jun Seong: Even if they don't like it, I'll ask them to pretend that they like it.

63
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,270
Min Seong: Right? After all, we made it with sincerity.

64
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,290
Jun Seong: Or we can say, "Do it yourselves."

168
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,540
Seong Ho: If you have woken up earlier, you could have gone a date with me.

169
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,950
Seong Ho: Am I wrong? Should I say it first?

170
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:05,100

-Me.

203
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,110
-I knew it.
-Seon Woo: It seems that the makeup skills were utilised.

204

What's scary?

Jun Seong: Well. That painting is really scary.

213
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,810
Jun Seong: I don't want to see that either.

214
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:12,670
Jun Seong: Why do I want to see the outcome when someone I like went on a date with someone else?

215
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,180
Go in.

216

-Try it first.
-I think we need to cook it more.

Thank you.

254

Seong Ho: I feel reluctant to have chicken drumsticks.

255
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,880
#NAME?

256

Jun Seong: I tried to sit in front of Seong Ho.

263
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,220
Jun Seong: If I sit next to him, I need to turn around to see him.

264
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:43,020
Jun Seong: Sitting in front of him, I can see him when I look up.

265
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,670
Jun Seong: So I always sit in front of him.

266

-It's delicious.
-Jun Seong: Looks like everyone is tired.

280

Seon Woo: I felt uncomfortable having dinner tonight.

291
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:57,480
Seon Woo: Especially, Hyeong Jin became so cold.

292
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,160
Seon Woo: It's like Frozen.

293
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:04,930
Seon Woo: I was thinking, "I would not talk today. I'll just eat."

294
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,500
Seon Woo: Are you done?

295

302
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:22,770
Yung Hee: Where have you been?

303
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:24,340
Seon Woo: I want to rest after brushing my teeth.

304
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,630
You'll rest after brushing your teeth?

305
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,850

-Seon Woo: Yes.

306

Seon Woo: Yesterday, because Hyeong Jin just came,

310

Seon Woo: I wanted to take good care of him.

311
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,820
Seon Woo: But it was only the second day for me, so I wasn't familiar, either.

312
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,930
Seon Woo: Since I wanted to do well, I felt uncomfortable.

313
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:53,010

-Yes.

314
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:55,020
Seon Woo: It was obviously more comfortable.

315
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,380
Yung Hee: Seon Woo was lying in the next bed.

316
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,260
Yung Hee: I suddenly blushed. My face was super red.

317
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:05,220
Yung Hee: I was wondering what happened.

318
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,830
Yung Hee: I was sweating.

319
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:11,220
Seon Woo: But it's the third day.

320
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,400
Yung Hee: It's not half yet.

321
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,180
Seon Woo: Compared to that...

322
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:17,140
Seon Woo: "Three days have passed so quickly." I feel like this.

323
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:17,820
Yung Hee: Really?

324
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,200
-At first...
-Seon Woo: Because...

325
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:23,710
-Seon Woo: Because there are many people who haven't had a date.
-Yes.

326
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:26,770
Seon Woo: There are many people who haven't been able to talk one-on-one.

327
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:29,880
Seon Woo: I said many times that during these seven to eight days,

328
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,750
Seon Woo: the only chance when we can see every side of someone

329
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,090
-Here.-Seon Woo: lies in this house.

330
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:35,510
Yes.

331
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:38,830
Seon Woo: I want to use all up these opportunities.

332
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:42,000
Seon Woo: But I always think "Am I selfish?"

333
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,980
Yung Hee: Why?

334
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:48,910
Seon Woo: Because there are people I can't respond to.

335
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:51,930
-Yes.
-Seon Woo: Because I haven't figured out how I feel yet.

336
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:55,000
Seon Woo: I didn't feel good from last night

337
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,760
Seon Woo: until this morning.

338
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,820
Yung Hee: Really?

339
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,110
Seon Woo: I'm so tired because of this.

340
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,840
Seon Woo: How are you today?

341
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,460
Yung Hee: I just chatted with you.

342
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,070
Yung Hee: Instead of feeling that it's been just three days, I feel like it's already been three days.

343
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,180
Yung Hee: It's already been three days.

344
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,780
-Seon Woo: That's right.
-Right?

345
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,640
-Yes.
-Isn't it true?

346
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,320
Yung Hee: But when I called you yesterday, you must be flustered.

347
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,160
Yung Hee: I felt like I was just talking to myself. I got hung up.

348
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,640
Seon Woo: Thank you so much for calling me.

349
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,620
Seon Woo: Thank you so much.

350
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:30,900
Seon Woo: You must have thought a lot and gathered a lot of courage.

351
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:37,110
Seon Woo: Thank you so much. I should say thank you to you.

352
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,240
Yung Hee: Thank you.

353
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:43,850
Seon Woo: If I had a chance, I would want to go on a date with you.

354
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,210
Yung Hee: Me too.

355
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:48,270
Seon Woo: But I

356
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:53,880
Seon Woo: think I'm only good at first impression.

357
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:58,560
Seon Woo: And First impression doesn't involve charm or talent.

358
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,490
Seon Woo: It's something we can work on.

359
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:04,250
Seon Woo: If you have feelings for me

360
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:08,750
Seon Woo: without getting along with me,

361
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,480
Seon Woo: I'm grateful. But I don't believe in myself.

362
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,910
Seon Woo: "Will he still like me when he sees the real me?"

363
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:18,560
Seon Woo: Actually, I have a sad side. There are many things I'm not good at.

364
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,630
Seon Woo: I'm old, so I want to go on a date.

365
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:24,810
Seon Woo: I want to show myself more.

366
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:26,700
Seon Woo: That's what I thought.

367
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,080
Yung Hee: Can I ask you one more thing?

368
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,020
Seon Woo: Yes.

369
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:33,000
Yung Hee: How many calls have you received on the first day and the second day?

370
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,190
Seon Woo: I don't want to talk about that.

371
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,190
Yung Hee: You don't? Okay.

372
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,840
Seon Woo: You are all so straightforward.

373
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,150
Seon Woo: Seong Ho asked me today who I called.

374
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,740
Yung Hee: Really?

375
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,770
Seon Woo: "What?" I was shocked. I didn't answer him.

376
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,960
Yung Hee: What shocked me was something else.

377
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,420
Seon Woo: What?

378
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,840
Yung Hee: I thought you called Seong Ho.

379
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,950
-Seon Woo: Really?
-Yes.

380
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:54,110
Yung Hee: Of course.

381
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,300
Seon Woo: Of course?

382
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,840
Yung Hee: But you didn't.

383
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,870
Seon Woo: But saying these to you,

384
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:04,250
Seon Woo: I feel myself a little despicable.

385
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,180
Seon Woo: I shouldn't have explained.

386
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:10,920
Seon Woo: I should've let you think based on what you saw.

387
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,930
Yung Hee: It's nice to talk like this.

388
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,829
Yung Hee: I hope we can go on a date.

389
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:20,810
Yung Hee: I want to talk to you more one-on-one.

390
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:24,430
Yung Hee: On the day we told each other what we do, Seon Woo asked me

391
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,310
Yung Hee: if I knew he and I have the same zodiac sign.

392
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:30,010
Yung Hee: I didn't know if he was joking or

393
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:35,160
Yung Hee: he said it intentionally. I can't tell.

394
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,620
Yung Hee: But

395
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:42,490
Yung Hee: I don't think we can't date if he's 12 years older.

396
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,950
Yung Hee: As long as neither of us is a minor,

397
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:46,920
Yung Hee: I think it's OK.

Hyeong Joon: Wipe one eyeliner before you come back.
(Whoa)

488
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,510
Hyeong Joon: Wipe one eyeliner before you come back.

489
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,450
Question.

490
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,410
Seon Woo: The scale of questioning doesn't matter, right?

491
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:23,810
Min Seong: It doesn't matter.

492
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:25,120
Seon Woo: Let me ask first.

493
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,380
Who are the three people you have feelings for here?

494
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,360
-Three?
-Regardless of ranking.

495
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,460
What about me?

496
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:31,960
(Jun Seong, Min Seong, Seon Woo)
What about me?

497
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,300
(Jun Seong, Min Seong, Seon Woo)

498
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:39,100
Is it because they're all on your right?

499
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,900
(Shaking head)
(Jun Seong: Is it because they're all on your right?)
Is it because they're all on your right?

500
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,370
-No.
-Turn around like this.
(Shaking head)
(Jun Seong: Is it because they're all on your right?)

501
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:44,630
-Jun Seong: That's good.
-No. It's not like that.

502
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:46,970
Jun Seong: I didn't expect to be in his list.

503
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:49,650
Jun Seong: Because he never called me.

504
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:52,930
Jun Seong: No signal or date.

505
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:55,680
Jun Seong: He seemed completely uninterested in choosing me.

506
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,580
Jun Seong: Of course I'm happy.

507
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,670
Jun Seong: What's the reason?

508
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,120
Seong Ho: The reason?

509
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:04,090
Seong Ho: From the first time we met, I felt relaxed.

510
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:07,580
Seong Ho: You had a lot of fun talking, and we had a lot to talk about.

511
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:10,620
Seong Ho: Min Seong is the only one who's at my age.

512
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,750
Seong Ho: So I want to be close to him.

513
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,510
Seong Ho: As to my roommate, although he and I don't get along well,

514
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:21,730
Seong Ho: it's refreshing for us to be together.

515
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:22,830
-It seems so.
-Jun Seong: It's true that we don't get along well.

516
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:23,920
It's fun.

517
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:28,220
Do you want to go on another date with your date today? Yes or no.

518
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,450
Yes.

519
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,540
It's over now. Next one.

520
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:37,770
(Next is Yung Hee)
It's over now. Next one.

521
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:40,220
(Next is Yung Hee)

522
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:44,900
What? What?

523
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,760
-Seon Woo: What is it?
-I'm going crazy.

524
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,080
There's someone whom I want to have physical contact with.

525
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,070
-Yes or no.
-That's yes or no.

526
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,440
It's yes or no.

527
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,010
Yung Hee: Do I just need to answer yes or no?

528
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:55,200
Jun Seong: It's better to tell us who it is.

529
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:56,760
Seong Ho: We will applaud for you.

530
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,520
Hyeong Joon: After you saying it, that person and you should stand up and go upstairs.

531
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,670
Yung Hee: Then I'll stay by myself.

532
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:02,800
What?

533
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,160
Yung Hee: Yes.

534
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:07,080
Yung Hee: My answer is yes.

535
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,820
(Nodding)

536
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:12,460
Let's start.

537
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,450
(Seon Woo is next)
Let's start.

538
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:14,860
(Seon Woo is next)

539
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:22,550
(Break up due to silent treatment or being cheated on?)

540
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,480
Yung Hee: Both are the worst.

541
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,710
Seon Woo: Which one is worse?

542
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:28,180
Hyeong Joon: I haven't experienced either. But just thinking about it makes me annoyed.

543
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,140
Seon Woo: Raise your hand if you choose the second one.

544
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:29,910
-The second one.
-The second one.

545
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:31,050
-Me too.
-Why?

546
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:33,290
Seong Ho: We should know why we break up. We can see it it's the second one.

547
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:33,460
And we can also know if the other party is with someone else.

548
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,700
(Min Seong: Is he with someone else?)
And we can also know if the other party is with someone else.

549
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,470
-Chung-ook: I choose silent treatment.
-Yung Hee: Me too.

550
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:39,220
Chung-ook: If someone cheated on you, then you two broke up for a reason.

551
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,620
-Yes, you already got the answer.
-Chung-ook: There is a reason.

552
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,060
Chung-ook: But if you break up due to silent treatment, you'll never know the reason.

553
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,850
-Hyeong Joon: He got to the point.
-That's true about the silent treatment.

554
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:46,190
I choose silent treatment.

555
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:48,170
Hyeong Joon: I also change to silent treatment.

556
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:49,830
Seon Woo: I would keep finding excuses on myself

557
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,930
Seon Woo: if I didn't hear the reasons from the other person.

558
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:53,150
Seon Woo: It seems more painful.

559
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:55,550
Jun Seong: I've experienced both.

560
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,540
Seon Woo: You have?

561
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,020
-Min Seong: You've been through a lot.
-I...

562
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,630
Hyeong Jin: Do you want to sit in the middle?

563
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,670
Min Seong: To hold a press conference.

564
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:04,030
Yung Hee: Do you have a poor judgment of people?

565
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:05,050
-Yung Hee: Why did that happen?
-Maybe.

566
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,740
Jun Seong: I wouldn't have known if I hadn't experienced it.

567
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,290
Really.

568
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,170
Jun Seong: Who's next?

569
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:11,630
Jun Seong: Ah, me?

570
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:14,480
The longest relationship you've ever had.

571
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,400
Seon Woo: Three years.

572
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,870
Jun Seong: May I ask why you broke up?

573
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:21,130
Seon Woo: After dating for three years, I couldn't go on.

574
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:25,340
Seon Woo: I was thinking whether we should live together or stay together.

575
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:29,250
Seon Woo: I couldn't go on. Instead of being willing to live together,

576
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:33,610
Seon Woo: I don't think there's any trigger for us

577
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:37,390
Seon Woo: to move on to the next stage after two to three years of dating.

578
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,220
Seon Woo: "What do I want to do next?"

579
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,200
Seon Woo: I would think of that.

580
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,430
Seon Woo: We must have the motivation to create our life together.

581
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:47,250
Seon Woo: I told my lover about that, but he had no idea at all.

582
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,950
Seon Woo: So if we couldn't make it,

583
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:51,990
I also want to open other boxes to have a look

584
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,640
and to have another relationship.

585
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,970
Chung-ook: I once had been dated for eight years. Eight years and a half.

586
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:01,250
Chung-ook: We thought about marriage.

587
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:05,860
Chung-ook: Because I'm an American citizen, so it's OK.

588
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,420
Chung-ook: We can also adopt kids

589
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:10,480
Chung-ook: and hold hands freely outside.

590
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,630
Chung-ook: We dreamed of a future like that.

591
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:16,410
Chung-ook: But we met when we were young.

592
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,460
Chung-ook: I wanted our relationship to last long.

593
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,840
Chung-ook: But we thought differently.

594
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,160
Chung-ook: So we broke up.

595
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:27,850
Seong Ho: After hearing the story of Chung-ook's eight-year relationship,

596
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:31,490
Seong Ho: I was thinking that it may happen to me one day.

597
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:33,120
Seong Ho: If I met someone,

598
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:38,020
Seong Ho: I would be willing to maintain a long-term relationship with him.

599
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,640
Seong Ho: But when it comes to break-up,

600
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:43,420
Seong Ho: could I be as calm as Chung-ook?

601
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:45,620
Min Seong: Mine was a long-distance relationship.

602
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,540
Min Seong: The distance got longer from a short one.

603
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,260
Seon Woo: It's really hard to have a long distance from a shortly distant one.

604
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,590
Jun Seong: I broke up because I took the relationship for granted.

605
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,590
Jun Seong: So I proposed a break-up.

606
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:55,160
Seon Woo: Why do you always...

607
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,980
Jun Seong: This happens when you date for a long time. Right?

608
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,600
Seon Woo: Not me.

609
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:00,280
Jun Seong: Come out.

610
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,650
Next.

611
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:06,010
I would even do this when I'm madly in love.

612
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:11,960
Seong Ho: He was two hours away from my home.

613
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,660
Seong Ho: After breaking up, I went to his neighborhood,

614
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:19,340
Seong Ho: and stayed near his house. Then I just went home.

615
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,200
Seong Ho: I just went there and came back.

616
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,470
Seon Woo: Did your efforts pay off?

617
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,440
-Seong Ho: It was a one-sided love.
Chung-ook: One-sided?

618
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:34,370
Seong Ho: It takes me a long time to sort out a relationship.

619
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:37,400
Seong Ho: It's hard for me to handle it well if I kept thinking about it.

620
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,530
Seong Ho: So I went to his neighborhood.

621
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:42,780
Seong Ho: He said he hated it.

622
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:43,720
Seong Ho: He didn't want me to go.

623
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,210
Seong Ho: Until then, I realized that our relationship was over.

624
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:51,410
Chung-ook: My story was also a silly one. It was simple.

625
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:53,060
Chung-ook: When I first fell in love,

626
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:57,000
Chung-ook: the one I was dating went to live in the college dormitory.

627
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,260
Chung-ook: In Gyeonggi-do.

628
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:58,820
He said he wanted a coffee table there.

629
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:04,380
(Chung-ook: My ex said, "I wanted a coffee table here.")
He said he wanted a coffee table there.

630
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,030
Chung-ook: I happened to see a vintage coffee table.

631
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:10,540
Chung-ook: I took the coffee table, transferred twice on the subway,

632
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:13,820
Chung-ook: then took the bus. It took me three hours to go to Gyeonggi-do.

633
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:17,240
Chung-ook: I gave him the coffee table at his school gate.

634
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,290
Chung-ook: When I gave it to him,

635
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:21,840
he said, "I was tired. Can you leave?"

636
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:26,570
-Hyeong Jin: I almost yelled.
-Really.

637
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:29,170
Hyeong Joon: I suddenly got curious about where he lives.

638
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,870
Seon Woo: Was he very young at that time?

639
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:33,340
Chung-ook: No, he was at my age. We were both in our early twenties.

640
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,260
But I became clear-minded from then on.

641
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:35,360
(Chung-ook: I knew from then on that when we were in love, we had to control my emotions)
But I became clear-minded from then on.

642
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,910
I knew from then on
(Chung-ook: I knew from then on that when we were in love, we had to control my emotions)

643
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:40,750
I had to control my emotions.
(Chung-ook: I knew from then on that when we were in love, we had to control my emotions)

644
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:41,260
(Chung-ook: I knew from then on that when we were in love, we had to control my emotions)

645
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:43,640
Jun Seong: Who's next?

646
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,950
Jun Seong: Oh, me?

647
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:48,250
The most memorable date.

648
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:50,470
Jun Seong: It can be a good one

649
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,220
Jun Seong: or a bad one, right?

650
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,900
Seon Woo: Don't you have too many stories?

651
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:57,770
Jun Seong: The most memorable date was the worst date I've ever had.

652
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:00,680
Jun Seong: I hardly took a break on Christmas.

653
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,270
Jun Seong: I was busy during Christmas.

654
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:08,900
Jun Seong: But I took a day off on Christmas.

655
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:12,010
Jun Seong: It took me a lot of effort to go on a date that day.

656
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:14,610
Jun Seong: I was really happy. I bought a Christmas gift

657
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:16,580
Jun Seong: and booked a nice restaurant for dinner.

658
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:19,480
Jun Seong: When we went to the cafe to rest,

659
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,320
Jun Seong: I wanted to go to the bathroom, so I went.

660
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,100
Jun Seong: After I went there, there was a long line in front of the bathroom.

661
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,350
Jun Seong: I thought I could come later, so I went back to my seat.

662
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:28,490
Jun Seong: I saw him swipe his phone screen swiftly.

663
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:30,640
Jun Seong: He went back to the homepage.

664
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,780
Seon Woo: Was he watching something before?

665
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,450
Jun Seong: I think you all know

666
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:34,630
Jun Seong: the page of the blind date app.

667
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:36,010
There are red and white on the page.

668
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:37,530
-Yes.
-You know that, right?

669
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:38,310
Yes.

670
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:40,030
Jun Seong: I saw the page be swiped away,

671
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:44,680
Jun Seong: so I walked out without looking back.

672
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,350
-Good job.
-Good job.

673
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,330
-Good job.
-Good job.

674
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:48,660
Hyeong Joon: Didn't he contact you again?

675
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,510
Jun Seong: He contacted me.

676
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:53,330
Jun Seong: He left the gift and the letter I wrote

677
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:55,370
Jun Seong: in front of my house and left.

678
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:57,520
Jun Seong: I felt annoyed when I saw those.

679
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,250
Jun Seong: If he had something to say,

680
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,650
Jun Seong: if he wanted to apologize or say something,

681
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,870
Jun Seong: shouldn't have he said it in person?

682
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:06,180
Jun Seong: So I called him and told him to come if he had something to say.

683
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:06,650
(Jun Seong: Come here and say it (apologize) again)
Jun Seong: So I called him and told him to come if he had something to say.

684
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:07,700
Come here and say it again.
(Jun Seong: Come here and say it (apologize) again)

685
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,320
Come here and say it again.

686
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,100
Jun Seong: But the most silly thing was

687
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,880
Jun Seong: after saying that, I felt better myself.

688
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,250
Hyeong Joon: What does that mean? Are you saying you were not angry anymore?

689
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:16,500
Seon Woo: You felt like you were a fool or what?

690
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,300
Jun Seong: I forgave him.

691
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,250
Jun Seong: This was the worst and the most memorable date I've ever had.

692
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:23,990
That's why I hate Christmas the most in my life.

693
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:25,870
I really hate it.

694
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:29,480
Seon Woo: Jun Seong impressed me the most when we played Jenga.

695
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:35,190
Seon Woo: I thought he would be the dominating one in a relationship.

696
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,570
Seon Woo: I thought he would be self-centered.

697
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:40,410
Seon Woo: But he actually got hurt a lot in love and relationships.

698
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:42,120
Yung Hee: After listening to his story,

699
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,070
(Yung Hee: I think it's understandable that he's so dark)

700
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,460
(Next is Hyeong Jin)

701
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:50,440
Why is everyone drawing so smoothly all of a sudden?

702
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:55,240
The reasons for coming out publicly or privately are...

703
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:59,420
Hyeong Jin: I already made it public. Because there's no need to hide it.

704
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,340
Seon Woo: How did you do it? Since when?

705
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,760
Hyeong Jin: It felt natural.

706
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,480
Hyeong Jin: Why do I have to...

707
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,440
Hyeong Jin: About coming out publicly,

708
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,670
Hyeong Jin: at first, I told a girl who's my best friend.

709
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:12,340
Hyeong Jin: Then I told my brother and then my sister.

710
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,770
Hyeong Jin: Then my parents. In this order.

711
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:15,870
Hyeong Jin: After telling my parents,

712
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:20,710
Hyeong Jin: I didn't care about whether to come out publicly or not.

713
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,670
Chung-ook: I've already made it public.

714
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:29,260
Chung-ook: I told my parents on Mid-autumn Day two years ago.

715
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:32,380
Chung-ook: I told my friends before that.

716
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:35,780
Chung-ook: The reason I came to South Korea

717
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:39,260
Chung-ook: was to keep a distance from my parents and family.

718
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:43,140
Chung-ook: My family is a very conservative Christine family.

719
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:46,610
Chung-ook: For me to admit my sexual orientation,

720
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:48,200
Chung-ook: I need to keep a distance.

721
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,670
Chung-ook: My parents used to brag to

722
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:54,740
Chung-ook: their friends in church that I'm a musician.

723
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:57,490
Chung-ook: So even if I dared to tell my brothers and friends,

724
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:01,470
I wanted to keep it a secret to my parents.

725
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:03,020
But I found that if this continued, I would have no way back.

726
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:07,550
(Chung-ook couldn't breathe because he was hiding himself)
But I found that if this continued, I would have no way back.

727
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:07,700
It was really hard.
(Chung-ook couldn't breathe because he was hiding himself)
But I found that if this continued, I would have no way back.

728
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,780
It was really hard.

729
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:11,080
Chung-ook: And my brother also said to me,

730
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,640
Chung-ook: "When will you start your own life?

731
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,510
Chung-ook: After 40 years old

732
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:17,320
Chung-ook: or wait until our parents pass away?"

733
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:20,660
Chung-ook: After hearing that, I felt very complex.

734
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,770
Chung-ook: I didn't know what the right answer was.

735
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:25,660
Chung-ook: I didnn't know if I was right to be greedy or

736
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:29,380
Chung-ook: to indulge other people. It was really hard.

737
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:32,840
-Of course.
-Chung-ook: So when I told my parents,

738
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,820
Chung-ook: I felt really guilty.

739
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,890
Chung-ook: Now my parents said they want me to do what I want.

740
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:43,690
But they said that they could support me, but they wouldn't encourge me.

741
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:47,480
Chung-ook: So we are still communicating.

742
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,530
Chung-ook: We should communicate more and leave no regrets.

743
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:55,190
Yes. About coming out publicly,

744
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:57,190
Chung-ook: I think it's really important to me.

745
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,950
Chung-ook: Even if for the future.

746
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:04,190
Seong Ho: I came out in front of my sister and good friends

747
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:07,280
Seong Ho: because I wanted to build a sincere relationship with them.

748
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:11,750
Seong Ho: When getting along with friends, if you told one lie,

749
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,060
Seong Ho: you had to tell ten lies to make it up.

750
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,370
Seong Ho: Then it will become 100. If this goes on,

751
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:18,830
Seong Ho: even if you want to be close, you'll become more distant.

752
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,480
Seong Ho: I'll be cautious.

753
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,740
Seong Ho: I don't want to be like that. It feels uncomfortable.

754
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:24,260
So if I really want to get along with people,

755
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:27,750
(Seong Ho came out to get along with people)
So if I really want to get along with people,

756
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,960
I have to tell them everything about me
(Seong Ho came out to get along with people)

757
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,840
so that we can become real friends.
(Seong Ho came out to get along with people)

758
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,960
So I made it public.
(Seong Ho came out to get along with people)

759
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:38,030
Jun Seong: I didn't plan to come out.

760
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,570
Jun Seong: My parents found out.

761
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:42,140
Jun Seong: The first time I came out was in front of my parents.

762
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,750
-Jun Seong: When I was 18.
-18?

763
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,150
-That was really early.
Jun Seong: When I was 18,

764
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:50,480
Jun Seong: I didn't come out out of my intention.

765
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,240
Jun Seong: I had a huge conflict

766
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,500
Jun Seong: with my parents at that time.

767
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,090
Jun Seong: Actually, at that time, I experienced a delayed adolescence

768
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:59,620
Jun Seong: because of that.

769
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,550
Jun Seong: I even ran away from home for six months because of that.

770
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,890
Jun Seong: I lived with my friends and didn't go to school.

771
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:07,160
Jun Seong: But after that,

772
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,280
Jun Seong: I seemed to have nothing to worry about.

773
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:13,030
Jun Seong: So I came out to my best friend first.

774
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:15,370
Jun Seong: It was strange that he got angry at me.

775
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:17,630
Jun Seong: He asked me why I didn't tell him earlier.

776
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:19,930
Jun Seong: He said, "Shouldn't you have told us first?"

777
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:21,700
It became easier to tell others after that.

778
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,070
(Thanks to the friends who remianed loyal to him, Jun Seong mustered up his courage)
It became easier to tell others after that.

779
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:26,310
Because my friends are still by my side.
(Thanks to the friends who remianed loyal to him, Jun Seong mustered up his courage)

780
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,560
Seon Woo: May I ask how you got found out?

781
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,510
Hyeong Joon: Yes, I'm curious.

782
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,470
-Yeah, so...
-How your mother found out...

783
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:33,280
Jun Seong: It was a tacky story.

784
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,680
Jun Seong: My mom saw the traces of me and my boyfriend.

785
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,400
-Jun Seong: Photos and letters.
-Oh.

786
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,100
-They were full of passion.
-Jun Seong: When my mom saw those,

787
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,610
Jun Seong: she tore them up.

788
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:44,740
Jun Seong: When I went in to look for them, I found nothing.

789
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:47,600
Jun Seong: My mom was angry at that time.

790
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,360
Jun Seong: So she came to get angry at me.

791
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,810
Jun Seong: I couldn't help myself

792
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:54,190
Jun Seong: and said that I was gay and liked men.

793
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:55,130
Jun Seong: That was someone I liked.

794
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:57,930
Jun Seong: I was forced to come out.

795
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:01,830
Jun Seong: But it's been a long time.

796
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:05,650
Jun Seong: After deciding to be on this show, I asked my mom.

797
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,010
Jun Seong: I told my mom that I wanted to be on a show like this,

798
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:10,100
Jun Seong: and asked her if I could.

799
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:13,690
She said, "Do it if you want."

800
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:15,740
"Can you handle it? Do it if you can."

801
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:18,910
"If you want to do it."

802
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:21,400
Sung Ho: I feel a little sad hearing those words.

803
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:23,620
Seon Woo: Mr. Daniel.

804
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,460
Not Daniel. I'm Hyeong Joon here.

805
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,160
(Hyeong Joon: I'm Hyeong Joon here)
Not Daniel. I'm Hyeong Joon here.

806
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:26,860
(Hyeong Joon: I'm Hyeong Joon here)

807
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:31,990
Hyeong Joon: I didn't plan to come out. Not at all.

808
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:34,270
Hyeong Joon: I just wanted my family to know it naturally.

809
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:37,410
Hyeong Joon: But I was preparing to start a business, so I told my family

810
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:39,400
Hyeong Joon: because I needed help.

811
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,200
Hyeong Joon: My sister said, "I don't even know what you did in Seoul

812
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,630
Hyeong Joon: in these 4 or 5 years. Why should I help you?"

813
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:46,390
Hyeong Joon: When I heard her say that,

814
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:48,380
Hyeong Joon: I made a PDF file of 4 pages.

815
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:50,440
Hyeong Joon: I wrote I was a DJ and a bartender.

816
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,730
Hyeong Joon: There are 100,000 subscribers of mine in YouTube.

817
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:53,680
Hyeong Joon: I organized all those and showed them to her.

818
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,710
Hyeong Joon: But we didn't contact for two days.

819
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:58,660
Hyeong Joon: I thought what happened. Oh no.

820
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:01,720
Hyeong Joon: I called her and she answered the phone as usual.

821
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,690
Hyeong Joon: She said she was busy looking after the baby and didn't have time to call me.

822
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:05,170
Hyeong Joon: Just like usual.

823
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:07,260
Hyeong Joon: No matter what happened,

824
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,810
Hyeong Joon: she helped me the next day.

825
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:12,719
Hyeong Joon: I got my family's trust and support.

826
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,060
I heard my family say that they just want me to be happy.

827
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,239
At that time, I was a little...

828
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:22,600
Yung Hee: I was in a gay show on YouTube.

829
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,929
Yung Hee: A friend uploaded it to the groupchat

830
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:25,949
Yung Hee: and asked me what happened to me.

831
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:30,170
Yung Hee: I was a little scared. So I quit the groupchat immediately.

832
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:33,190
Yung Hee: But I was invited about 10 minutes later.

833
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:35,699
Yung Hee: I observed for a while.

834
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:37,989
Yung Hee: I found no one mentioned it.

835
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:39,690
Yung Hee: I wondered what happened. They probably didn't know yet.

836
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:42,300
Yung Hee: But later I found out that after I quit the groupchat,

837
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,020
one of them said that it seemed to be true,

838
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:46,340
but why they would upload this to the groupchat.

839
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,860
Yung Hee: And he criticized the person who uploaded it.

840
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:51,380
Yung Hee: So my acquaintances seemed to

841
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,960
Yung Hee: accept it natuarally and wholeheartedly.

842
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:58,930
Min Seong: I only told a few friends.

843
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,550
-Min Seong: Even my parents don't know yet.
-They don't?

844
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:04,810
Min Seong: But the reason I made it public with my friends

845
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:08,150
Min Seong: was I somehow suddenly told him.

846
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,230
Seon Woo: Sometimes you just want to say it.

847
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:09,850
-Right.
-Right.

848
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:11,720
Min Seong: But I don't know why I did that.

849
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,210
Min Seong: I don't know, but I just said it.

850
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:15,760
Min Seong: But his reaction was,

851
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,050
Min Seong: "So? So what? That's all?"

852
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:23,890
Then he said, "I don't care. I like you as a person."

853
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,620
Min Seong: I said thank you to him on the spot.

854
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:30,070
Min Seong: Only a few people know about me now.

855
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:32,660
Seon Woo: I think I had the similar experience with Min Seong.

856
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:38,550
Seon Woo: It was one week before I decided to join this show.

857
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:41,360
Seon Woo: I only had a week.

858
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,220
Seon Woo: So I rushed to make it public. I even came out three times a day.

859
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:44,770
Three times a day publicly.

860
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:44,860
Really?

861
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,190
(Shocked)
Really?

862
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:46,700
-I was in a hurry.
-I'm gay.
(Shocked)

863
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,080
-I was in a hurry.
-I'm gay.

864
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,980
Jun Seong: I'm gay. I'm gay. I'm gay.

865
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,230
Yes, that's right.

866
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:52,420
Come on.

867
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:55,230
Seon Woo: Yes, but I was lucky.

868
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:59,960
Seon Woo: It's my first time to come out in my life.

869
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:04,250
Seon Woo: First of all, everyone will find out eventually,

870
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,470
Seon Woo: no matter how hard I try to hide it.

871
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:07,130
Seon Woo: For some people, I wanted to tell them myself.

872
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:08,860
Seon Woo: So I told them myself.

873
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:12,000
Seon Woo: I asked my best girl friend to sit in front of me.

874
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,970
Seon Woo: Because I had a lot to say.

875
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:18,270
Seon Woo: From confessing I'm gay to joining this show, I would tell her all these.

876
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:20,320
Seon Woo: "Why don't you respond?", I asked her.

877
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,570
"How can I protect you?"

878
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:25,770
She said she was thinking about that.

879
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:28,060
I'm very grateful for what she said.

880
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,190
Seon Woo: I didn't pour water little by little.

881
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,980
Seon Woo: I just flipped the whole basin.

882
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,910
Seon Woo: I felt so relieved.

883
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:38,300
Jun Seong: You completely laid it all out on the table.

884
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:38,920
Yes, that's right.

885
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,890
Jun Seong: We simply widened the already flowing stream.

886
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:43,330
So, now we...

887
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:46,610
Now, like this, most of our youth has passed.

888
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:47,990
Like this.

889
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:49,540
Seon Woo: I mean, although we're still young...

890
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,420
Seon Woo: How should I put it?

891
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,960
Seon Woo: I feel that youth is slipping away from me.

892
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,190
Seon Woo: Thinking that I can live freely

893
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:57,950
Seon Woo: makes me really happy now.

894
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:01,340
Chung-ook: What Seon Woo said really shocked me.

895
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,820
Chung-ook: When I confessed to everyone,

896
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,480
Chung-ook: I was very careful.

897
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,810
Chung-ook: In the past 20 years, every five years, I would tell one person.

898
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,250
Chung-ook: That was how I did.

899
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:14,180
Chung-ook: I did it more frequently recently and in a more relaxed way.

900
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:18,940
Chung-ook: "I want tell everyone all at once." To do so determinedly,

901
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:21,720
Chung-ook: I really think it's amazing.

902
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,060
Seon Woo: But you didn't come out.

903
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:27,140
Seon Woo: So far, what's the reason?

904
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:31,950
Seon Woo: Actually... Even if we believe that our family won't abandon us...

905
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,990
Min Seong: Yes, no matter what, because they are our family,

906
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:35,660
Min Seong: we feel reluctant to say it. That's one of the reasons.

907
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,650
Seon Woo: I think I didn't do it because of this reason.

908
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:38,280
I think I didn't do it because of this reason.

909
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,750
Seon Woo: I was afraid they would think I'm not who I used to be.

910
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,000
Seon Woo: Just because I'm gay,

911
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,930
Seon Woo: I'm afraid they would see me in a different way since I'm gay.

912
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,770
Seon Woo: But that's my illusion.

913
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:48,310
Seon Woo: Gay Yoo Seon Woo is also me.

914
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:51,430
Seon Woo: But because I present a different side of myself to them,

915
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:55,240
Seon Woo: I'm afraid they might find it inconsistent.

916
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,950
-Min Seong: I think it's disappointment. Being disappointed about me.
-Disappointment.

917
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:03,250
Min Seong: No matter what, because I'm a son,

918
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:09,060
-Min Seong: my parents will automatically imagine that kind of future.
-Right.

919
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:12,480
Min Seong: If I tell them directly I'm gay...

920
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,350
Min Seong: I'm a little scared. I'm scared of this.

921
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,110
(Feel the same)

922
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:20,140
That's right.
(Feel the same)

923
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:22,750
(Jun Seong: Shall we stop talking about parents? The atmosphere is too low)

924
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,420
-Shall we stop talking about our parents?
-Okay.
(Jun Seong: Shall we stop talking about parents? The atmosphere is too low)

925
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,650
-The atmosphere is too low.
-I feel it becomes low.
(Jun Seong: Shall we stop talking about parents? The atmosphere is too low)

926
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:26,450
-Too low.
-Too low.
(Jun Seong: Shall we stop talking about parents? The atmosphere is too low)

927
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:27,310
Cheers. Let's have a refill.
(Jun Seong: Shall we stop talking about parents? The atmosphere is too low)

928
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:29,370
-Cheers.
-Okay.

929
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:30,270
The atmosphere is so low.

930
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:31,970
Jun Seong: I almost cried. Really.

931
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:35,630
Yung Hee: The sharp question came out earlier than expected.

932
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,710
Yung Hee: Aren't we still curious about each other?

933
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:39,690
Yung Hee: Let's ask those questions.

934
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:39,900
-We can play Jenga and also ask something you want to ask.
-Okay.

935
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,580
(Jun Seong: We can pay Jenga and also ask whatever you want to ask)
-We can play Jenga and also ask something you want to ask.
-Okay.

936
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,600
-Hyeong Jin: I have a question for Yung Hee.
-Okay.

937
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:48,920
Hyeong Jin: You said there was someone here you wanted to have physical contact with.

938
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:48,980
"I'm going to call that person today." Yes or no.

939
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:51,990
(Q: Are you going to call the person who you want to have physical contact with?)
"I'm going to call that person today." Yes or no.

940
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:52,410
(Q: Are you going to call the person who you want to have physical contact with?)

941
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:52,860
-A sharp question.
-Wow. It really is.
(Q: Are you going to call the person who you want to have physical contact with?)

942
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,590
-A sharp question.
-Wow. It really is.

943
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:56,300
Hyeong Joon: I was sitting next to him.

944
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,580
Hyeong Joon: He asked such a direct question. I was a little scared.

945
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:02,870
Yung Hee: Yes, I'll call him today.

946
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:05,120
I'll call him today.

947
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:06,580
A free question.

948
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,380
For the two who just joined in,

949
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:08,500
(Q. Hyeong Jin and Hyeong Joon, the range of the person you like narrowed
VS I still need some time to confirm my feelings)
For the two who just joined in,

950
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:11,590
The range of the person you like narrowed
(Q. Hyeong Jin and Hyeong Joon, the range of the person you like narrowed
VS I still need some time to confirm my feelings)

951
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:13,270
Or I still need some time to confirm my feelings.
(Q. Hyeong Jin and Hyeong Joon, the range of the person you like narrowed
VS I still need some time to confirm my feelings)

952
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:18,460
Hyeong Jin: There were three people I wanted to date the most. It's the same now.

953
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:20,050
Hyeong Jin: And there's one more.

954
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:24,360
Hyeong Jin: For this person, I'm not sure

955
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:28,970
Hyeong Jin: whether I want to go on a date with him or not. I don't know yet.

956
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:30,800
Min Seong: From three to four.

957
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,620
Hyeong Joon: For me, there's one.

958
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:34,810
(Surprised)
Hyeong Joon: For me, there's one.

959
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:35,900
(Surprised)

960
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:38,060
Seong Ho: You're very straightforward. Only one.

961
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:41,920
Seon Woo: Hyeong Joon said there's only one he likes.

962
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,740
Seon Woo: He said that.

963
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:48,520
Seon Woo: Because I sent him a signal once.

964
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,410
Seon Woo: For me, I've already mustered up a lot of courage.

965
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:55,100
Seon Woo: I don't have the courage to try again.

966
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:59,970
Min Seong: Maybe it's not necessarily to call someone he likes.

967
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:04,080
Min Seong: But if he calls someone he likes,

968
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:07,350
Min Seong: he might call me.

969
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:10,630
Min Seong: But I thought I shouldn't be self-delusional.

970
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,940
(Jun Seong didn't choose free questions but chose to play Jenga)

971
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:14,580
You did it.

972
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:15,530
(Trembling)
You did it.

973
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:16,820
(Trembling)

974
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:20,460
-You did it.
-Yung Hee: I've never seen him tremble.

975
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:22,420
Jun Seong: I did it on purpose.

976
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:24,710
Jun Seong: Please.

977
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,960
Is the person you have a crush on

978
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,940
sitting on your left or right?

979
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,340
(Jun Seong: Left)
sitting on your left or right?

980
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:37,160
Seon Woo: Because Seong Ho was the only one sitting on his left.

981
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,830
Seon Woo: I was upset because of various reasons.

982
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:41,340
-I'm so nervous.
-Why is everyone so good at drawing?

983
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,860
(Min Seong: Why is everyone so good at drawing?)
-I'm so nervous.
-Why is everyone so good at drawing?

984
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:43,320
-I'm so nervous.
-Why is everyone so good at drawing?

985
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,620
Jun Seong: Why is everyone so good at playing this suddenly?

986
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:47,410
We're in a competition.

987
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:48,310
(Hyeong Jin: It's a competition of pride)

988
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:50,470
It's like a competition of pride.
(Hyeong Jin: It's a competition of pride)

989
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:52,280
Jun Seong: Should we take another round?

990
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,270
-I trust you.
-I think I can guess it.

991
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:54,320
-Min Seong: I'll end this game.
-Please.

992
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,700
-Seon Woo: I trust you.
-Min Seong: I'll take a stand.

993
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:56,860
Seong Ho: Why is everyone so good at playing games?

994
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:56,990
(Shaking)
Seong Ho: Why is everyone so good at playing games?

995
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:58,510
-Which one do you want to draw?
-The one I can draw.
(Shaking)

996
00:40:58,510 --> 00:40:59,340
-There is.
-Yes. There is.
(Shaking)

997
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,520
-There is.
-Yes. There is.

998
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,860
Min Seong: I'll end this game.

999
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,800
Min Seong: I'l end this game.

1000
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:08,580
Yung Hee: After saying that, he's considering again.

1001
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,920
Come on.

1002
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,630
Seon Woo: Don't you dare pass it to me after saying that.

1003
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,540
(Drawing out)

1004
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:17,720
Jun Seong: Ah, you have to put it on top.

1005
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,720
Ah, there's a vacancy.

1006
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,550
(After Min Seong finishes, the game time is over)

1007
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:29,300
I'll make dinner for tomorrow.
(After Min Seong finishes, the game time is over)

1008
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:29,800
I'll make dinner for tomorrow.

1009
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,410
Do you want to play again? I like it.

1010
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:33,440
-I play this a lot.
-Good job.

1011
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,940
-Good job.
-Good job.

1012
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:36,260
I wouldn't have talked about these if I were alone.

1013
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,940
(Min Seong: I wouldn't have talked about these if I were alone)
I wouldn't have talked about these if I were alone.

1014
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,840
Min Seong: I wouldn't have talked about these if I were alone.

1015
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:44,420
Min Seong: But since we can talk together,

1016
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:46,000
Min Seong: I got the courage.

1017
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:49,950
Chung-ook: After hearing their stories,

1018
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:54,440
Chung-ook: I felt relieved.

1019
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,720
Chung-ook: I found out that I'm not the only one who suffers.

1020
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,200
Chung-ook: I feel that we are all the same.

1021
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,630
Chung-ook: I feel more confident.

1022
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:07,130
Chung-ook: To express our feelings is not a matter of self-esteem.

1023
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:09,930
Chung-ook: From a perspective, it's a practice in life.

1024
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:12,620
Yung Hee: I feel today we've deepened the bond between us.

1025
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:17,740
Yung Hee: I feel that I have encountered some new fate and made some friends.

1026
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:21,770
Yung Hee: And I have someone else I like. It's good.

1027
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:29,420
(What changes have happened to their hearts?)

1028
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:34,610
Hyeong Jin: Where should I go?

1029
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:36,050
Hyeong Jin: Can't I stay with you?

1030
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:37,210
-Min Seong: With me?
-Yes.

1031
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:38,860
Min Seong: Stay with me.

1032
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:43,080
Min Seong: Excuse me.

1033
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:52,540
Sit here. Sit on this.

1034
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,170
(Yung Hee and Jun Seong found a place in the living room on the second floor)
Sit here. Sit on this.

1035
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:57,740
(Yung Hee and Jun Seong found a place in the living room on the second floor)

1036
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:01,260
-Jun Seong: Have you decided?
-Yung Hee: About what?

1037
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,730
-Jun Seong: Who you're going to call.
-Yung Hee: Yes, I've decided.

1038
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:08,100
(In their respective seats, they are confirming their feelings again)

1039
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:13,860
(Who will they express their feelings to?)

1040
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:18,480
Min Seong: The person I'm going to call today

1041
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,890
-Min Seong: is someone I like.
-Hyeong Jin: Someone you like.

1042
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:24,330
Hyeong Jin: At least you're interested in him now. You weren't before?

1043
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:25,810
Min Seong: Maybe I wasn't interested but am interested now.

1044
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:28,880
-Min Seong: Or maybe I was interested in him.
-Really?

1045
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,820
Min Seong: Anyway, I'm interested in him now.

1046
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:35,120
Hyeong Jin: I'll do it in my own way.

1047
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,420
Hyeong Jin: For those who I like,

1048
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:40,710
-Hyeong Jin: I think I've flirted with them.
-Min Seong: Yes, flirting.

1049
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:43,000
Hyeong Jin: But I don't know

1050
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,480
Hyeong Jin: if it was flirting to him.

1051
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:51,780
Min Seong: But I think I also expressed something

1052
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:56,560
Min Seong: to whom I'm interested in, I think...

1053
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,150
I think that person...

1054
00:43:58,770 --> 00:43:59,460
-No way.
-Good luck.

1055
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:01,910
(Hyeong Jin, please go to the phone booth.)
(Express your feelings to someone you like in 30 seconds)
-No way.
-Good luck.

1056
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:04,620
(Hyeong Jin, please go to the phone booth.)
(Express your feelings to someone you like in 30 seconds)

1057
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:07,630
Good luck.

1058
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:16,110
Hyeong Jin: I'm so nervous. Instead of saying I'm nervous,

1059
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:21,670
Hyeong Jin: I'm going to express my feelings of day frankly.

1060
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:24,490
Hyeong Jin: I don't think I had a lot on my mind.

1061
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:32,670
-Hello.
-Hello.

1062
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,800
Hyeong Jin: Do you know who I am?

1063
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:40,420
(Hyeong Jin is talking to Yung Hee)

1064
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:43,620
Hyeong Jin, right?
(Hyeong Jin is talking to Yung Hee)

1065
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:45,170
Hyeong Jin, right?

1066
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:48,580
Yes.

1067
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:50,810
You're my first choice today.

1068
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:57,350
Yung Hee: Thank you. For the date today, do you like it?

1069
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,840
Hyeong Jin: I like it. That's why I called.

1070
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:04,690
Yung Hee: During today's date, I was consoled because of you.

1071
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:06,020
Yung Hee: I was happy.

1072
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:07,140

(Embarrassed)

1075
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:13,380
(He hung up after 30 seconds)

1076
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:20,810
Yung Hee: So cruel.

1077
00:45:20,810 --> 00:45:22,680
Yung Hee: Just 30 seconds.

1078
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,270
-Jun Seong: It's brief, right?
-Yung Hee: Yes.

1079
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:28,330
Hyeong Jin: He's more mature than I thought.

1080
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:32,750
Hyeong Jin: I felt comfortable during the conversation.

1081
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,530
Hyeong Jin: Come on. Come on.

1082
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:43,220
(Hyeong Joon, please go to the phone booth
and express your feelings to someone you like in 30 seconds)

1083
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,180
Hyeong Joon: Actually I was worried.

1084
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:57,870
Hyeong Joon: I was wondering if I should call him.

1085
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:03,760
Hyeong Joon: Today I thought I needed to meet him more.

1086
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:10,860
(The one Hyeong Joon chose to meet more)

1087
00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:16,070
Hyeong Joon: Hello.

1088
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:20,200

1089
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,130

1090
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:23,840
(Hyeong Joon called Min Seong)

1091
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:24,950
For what?
(Hyeong Joon called Min Seong)

1092
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:26,580
(Hyeong Joon called Min Seong)

1093
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,700
Hyeong Joon: For helping me organize all kinds of things.

1094
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:33,710
Hyeong Joon: You also cooked. I enjoyed it.

1095
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:35,390

Hyeong Joon: OK.

1099
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:44,590
-Min Seong: Thank you.
-Hyeong Joon: OK.

1100
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,470
Hyeong Joon: My heart almost exploded.

1101
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:06,570
Hyeong Joon: I was thinking about how to say it on my way there.

1102
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:10,510
Hyeong Joon: I thought he'd know if I didn't reveal my identity.

1103
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:14,700
Min Seong: Who was it?

1104
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:20,620
Min Seong: Who was it?

1105
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:24,800
Min Seong: I thought Seong Ho called me.

1106
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,510
Min Seong: I didn't go on a one-on-one date today.

1107
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:36,730
Min Seong: And only Hyeong Jin had a deep

1108
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:38,110
Min Seong: conversation with me.

1109
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:41,020
(Confused)

1110
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:43,580
Min Seong: What number am I in receiving phone calls today?

1111
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:46,770
Hyeong Jin: Are you sure?

1112
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,750
Hyeong Jin: Are you sure whom to call today?

1113
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:53,530
Min Seong: If I only think of one person, I can take action directly.

1114
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:56,540
(Min Seong hasn't decided whom to contact directly)

1115
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:59,140
(Min Seong, please go to the phone booth and express your feelings to someone you like in 30 seconds)

1116
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:00,300
It's your turn. Go.
(Min Seong, please go to the phone booth and express your feelings to someone you like in 30 seconds)

It's your turn. Go.

1118
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:02,920
Hyeong Jin: Fighting.

1119
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:04,570
Fighting.

1120

Hyeong Jin: Fighting. Have a good talk.

1121
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:12,580
Hyeong Jin: Say whatever you want.

1122
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:17,890
Hyeong Jin: Be frank and be straight.

1123
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:18,880
Fighting.

-Min Seong: Go straight
-Go!

1125
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:22,340
Hyeong Jin: You can win with one blow.

1126
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:24,830
Hyeong Jin: Say you want to go on a date.

1127
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:31,020
Min Seong: I had someone in mind.

1128
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:37,660
Min Seong: But I felt a bit complicated when I called.

1129
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:40,840
Min Seong: I felt I would regret if I didn't say it.

1130
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:47,220
(Who is the man Min Seong wants to express his feelings to?)

1131
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:54,110
(Min Seong is calling Hyeong Jin)

1132
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:55,080
Hello?
(Min Seong is calling Hyeong Jin)

1133
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:58,260
Min Seong: Hello.

1134
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:03,680
Min Seong: One of the people I like.

1135
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:07,420
(Embarrassed)

1136
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,010
Min Seong: I'm so shy.

1137
00:49:10,850 --> 00:49:11,600
Min Seong: Don't be embarrassed.

1138
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,860
Min Seong: Don't be embarrassed.

1139
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:21,930
Min Seong: Is it over?

1140
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:27,460
(30 seconds flies)

1141
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:34,640
Min Seong: To be honest, I didn't like him when I first came here.

1142
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:40,580
Min Seong: But after that dinner and some small chat,

1143
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:43,820
Min Seong: I seemed to be interested.

1144
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:50,630
Min Seong: Let's try one-on-one dating first.

1145
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:53,770
Min Seong: Let's get to know more about each other before we proceed.

1146
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:56,080
Hyeong Jin: It turned out that he called me.

1147
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:58,490
Hyeong Jin: It was funny.

1148
00:49:58,490 --> 00:50:00,620
Hyeong Jin: It was unexpected.

1149
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:04,180
(Shy)

1150
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:08,820
(Min Seong goes back to his room with nervousness)

1151
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:16,980
(Hyeong Jin isn't in the room)

1152
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:27,530
I'm sober now.

1153
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:29,000
Chung-ook: Are you sober now?

1154
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,910
Hyeong Jin: I didn't get drunk.

1155
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:34,340
Hyeong Jin: I drank and drank. I threw the ice out.

1156
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:39,470
Hyeong Jin: Gosh.

1157
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:41,780
Min Seong: I was worried for a moment.

1158
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:44,600
Min Seong: I didn't think much before I asked to share a room.

1159
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:47,710
Min Seong: Come to think of it,

1160
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:50,620
Min Seong: I was going to call this person today.

1161
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:56,350
Min Seong: But if I suddenly said no and go to another room, it'll be obvious.

1162
00:50:58,280 --> 00:50:59,460
Hello.

1163
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:07,200
Min Seong: I think I should show my feelings to someone I like

1164
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,770
-Min Seong: so that I won't have any regrets.
-Hyeong Jin: Yes.

1165
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:12,670
Hyeong Jin: Thank you.

1166
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:18,780
(Chung-ook is writing something on his phone)

1167
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:25,190
Chung-ook: I think it'll get disrupted again in the process.

1168
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:28,630
Chung-ook: This time I wanted to convey it well,

1169
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:31,590
Chung-ook: so I wrote it all on my phone.

1170
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:35,140
(Chung-ook, please go to the phone booth and express your feelings to someone you like in 30 seconds)

1171
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:43,420
Chung-ook: I can't say that I've completely sorted out my feelings.

1172
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:44,520
Chung-ook: But

1173
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:50,780
Chung-ook: I think I can start from what I couldn't say yesterday.

1174
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:59,900
(The person who he wants to say something to)

1175
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:03,850
(The person who he wants to say something to is Yung Hee)

1176
00:52:03,850 --> 00:52:04,840
Hello?
(The person who he wants to say something to is Yung Hee)

1177
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:05,780
-Hello?
-Hello?
(The person who he wants to say something to is Yung Hee)

1178
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:06,240
-Hello?
-Hello?

1179
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,510
-Chung-ook: It's me, Jung-wook.
-Yung Hee: It's Chung-ook, right?

1180
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:13,480
Chung-ook: I called you again because my phone was interrupted yesterday.

1181
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:16,450
Chung-ook: We had a good chat in the car yesterday.

1182
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:20,430
Chung-ook: I want to thank you for taking care of me.

1183
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:22,910
Yung Hee: Thank you.

1184
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:25,630
Chung-ook: I see. See you later.

1185
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:28,170
Yung Hee: OK. Have a good night.

1186
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:29,190
Yung Hee: Let's have a drink later.

1187
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:30,820
-Chung-ook: OK.
-OK.

1188
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:38,430
Chung-ook: I think this process is my personal practice.

1189
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:44,460
I think I'm practicing expressing my feelings and mustering my courage.

1190
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:48,430
Yung Hee: I didn't expect Chung-ook would call.

1191
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:50,490
Yung Hee: We didn't receive each other's call yesterday.

1192
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:53,020
Yung Hee: I didn't expect him to call me again today.

1193
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:53,660
(Hyeong Jin & Chung-ook) (Yung Hee: How can I face my roommate now? I'm so sorry)

1194
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:56,080
How can I face my roommate now?
(Hyeong Jin & Chung-ook) (Yung Hee: How can I face my roommate now? I'm so sorry)

1195
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:57,660
I'm so sorry.
(Hyeong Jin & Chung-ook) (Yung Hee: How can I face my roommate now? I'm so sorry)

1196
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:03,330
-Jun Seong: There's nothing to be sorry about.
-Right?

1197
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:05,210
Jun Seong: Don't be sorry. It's just sympathy.

1198
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:07,260
-Really?
-Yes.

1199
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:10,170
Yung Hee: I'm here to have a date of my own.
-Yes.

1200
00:53:10,510 --> 00:53:12,470
Jun Seong: Just express your feelings.

1201
00:53:12,470 --> 00:53:15,780
Jun Seong: No need to indulge others because you feel sorry for them.

1202
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,430
Yung Hee: I learned something from you today.

1203
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:26,820
(Yung Hee, please go to the phone booth and express your feelings to someone you like in 30 seconds)

1204
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:30,210
Good luck.

1205
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:31,400
Should I go after that?

1206
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,330
Yung Hee: Will we call the same person?

1207
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:36,450
Jun Seong: It's possible.

1208
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:38,400
Yung Hee: I'll go first.

1209
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:42,940
(A glance)

1210
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:44,780
(Hello)

1211
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:49,270
Yung Hee: If I had a chance,

1212
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:52,800
Yung Hee: I want to date with you one-on-one.

1213
00:53:53,450 --> 00:53:57,470
Yung Hee: I want to show my feelings.

1214
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:06,700
(Nervous)

1215
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:12,340
(Whom's the man Yung Hee wants to have a one-on-one date with?)

1216
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:14,200
Yung Hee: Hello.

1217
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:17,630
Yung Hee: Now you know it just by hearing my voice.

1218
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:22,270
Yung Hee: I called too many times.

1219
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:27,240
Yung Hee: I hope we can go on a date tomorrow.

1220
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:32,740
Yung Hee: I feel like tomorrow is the last chance I can seize.

1221
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:34,100
(Yung Hee is calling Jun Seong?)

1222
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:35,530
So I called you.
(Yung Hee is calling Jun Seong?)

1223
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:38,210

1226
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:42,370
-See you later.
-See you later.

1227
00:54:42,370 --> 00:54:43,490
Okay.

1228
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:50,900
Yung Hee: I didn't go on a date.

1229
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:55,230
Yung Hee: I hung up after I said I wanted to go on a date with him.

1230
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:56,450
That was all.

1231
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:57,590
I was going crazy.

1232
00:54:59,850 --> 00:55:03,660
Chung-ook: What's wrong? I saw him go out. But...

1233
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:03,730
(Chung-ook: The voice was from the other room from where Jun Seong was sitting)
Chung-ook: What's wrong? I saw him go out. But...

1234
00:55:03,730 --> 00:55:08,430
The call was from the other room.
(Chung-ook: The voice was from the other room from where Jun Seong was sitting)

1235
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:08,940
(Chung-ook: The voice was from the other room from where Jun Seong was sitting)

1236
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:17,740
(Embarrassed)

1237
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:20,050
-Jun Seong: Shall we toast?
-Shall we toast?

1238
00:55:20,890 --> 00:55:21,930
Yung Hee: Did you lift it?

1239
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:23,880
-Yung Hee: Did you hear who answered it?
-Jun Seong: What?

1240
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:26,060
-Yung Hee: Did you hear who answered the phone?
-Jun Seong: Yes.

1241
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:32,620
Yung Hee: I've been calling since the first day.

1242
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:38,480
-Yung Hee: I was so nervous today.
-Jun Seong: Really? Why?

1243
00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:42,740
-Yung Hee: I feel like this is my last chance.
-What?

1244
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:45,300
Yung Hee: I can't help thinking it'll be the last chance.

1245
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,740
Yung Hee: If it doesn't work this time,

1246
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:50,170
Yung Hee: I called with various meanings.

1247
00:55:50,170 --> 00:55:51,830
Yung Hee: If he doesn't come today, now,

1248
00:55:51,830 --> 00:55:56,050
Yung Hee: I'll open my heart to a new guy. I'm going to do that.

1249
00:55:59,170 --> 00:56:01,810
Jun Seong: What? Why?

1250
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:05,980
Jun Seong: he disappeared before me and called me.

1251
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:08,390
Jun Seong: Of course I thought it was Yung Hee.

1252
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:13,310
Jun Seong: But after hearing what Yung Hee said to me when we were chatting,

1253
00:56:13,310 --> 00:56:16,820
Jun Seong: I wasn't the one Yung Hee talked about.

1254
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:20,400
Jun Seong: I knew it wasn't me when he talked to me.

1255
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:25,020
I called Seon Woo today.

1256
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:33,740
(Seon Woo, please go to the phone booth
and express your feelings to someone you like in 30 seconds)

1257
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:41,080
Seon Woo: Different from other days, I decided quickly today)

1258
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:51,300
(Seon Woo has no worries. Who is he calling?)

1259
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:55,620
Seon Woo: Come down tomorrow morning with a spoon.

1260
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:58,170
-Seong Ho: Ah, spoon?
-Yes.

1261
00:56:58,170 --> 00:56:59,360
Seong Ho: Okay.

1262
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,700
-Seon Woo: Yes.
-Seong Ho: Are you going to go to sleep without doing anything else tonight?

1263
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:04,080
Seon Woo: I don't know.

1264
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:06,200
Seong Ho: How is it today?

1265
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,200
Seon Woo: Very good.

1266
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,220
Seong Ho: I see.

1267
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:11,360
Seon Woo: Bye.

1268
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:19,380
Seon Woo: I thought about Seong Ho all day today.

1269
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:25,550
Seon Woo: The date with this person today, after moving in Men's House,

1270
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:30,170
Seon Woo: is the most comfortable, authentic, and natural date where I can truly be myself.

1271
00:57:32,730 --> 00:57:37,060
Seong Ho: I knew it was Seon Woo.

1272
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:39,660
Seong Ho: It sounds like Seon Woo.

1273
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:42,450
Seong Ho: I thought I would be happy when I called.

1274
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:45,080
Seong Ho: I can feel that I really need to choose

1275
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:49,090
Seong Ho: and decide.

1276
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,420
It's torturing.

1277
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:55,250
(Jun Seong, please go to the phone booth and express your feelings to someone you like in 30 seconds)

1278
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:56,320
Hold on. There's more.
(Jun Seong, please go to the phone booth and express your feelings to someone you like in 30 seconds)

1279
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:57,300
(Jun Seong, please go to the phone booth and express your feelings to someone you like in 30 seconds)

1280
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:03,840
(Jun Seong: It's just the phone time has started again)

1281
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:06,240
It just started again.
(Jun Seong: It's just the phone time has started again)

1282
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,240
Jun Seong: There's no one who makes me feel undecisive.

1283
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:20,860
(Jun Seong has no hesitation. He calls Seong Ho)

1284
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:21,770
Hello?

1285
00:58:22,330 --> 00:58:23,250
Hello?

1286
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:25,250
Hey.

1287
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:30,160
-Jun Seong: I don't know what to say.
-Yes.

1288
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:34,500
I miss you all day.

1289
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:37,530
Jun Seong: I want to say this.

1290
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:40,160
Seong Ho: Okay.

1291
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:46,020
(He hung up because he was shy)

1292
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:50,260
Jun Seong: I'll try my best.

1293
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:52,450
Jun Seong: I'll keep going.

1294
00:58:55,620 --> 00:59:00,140
(After getting calls from two men, Seong Ho becomes confused)

1295
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:11,380
Seong Ho: It's better to go on a date. If I get to know a person more,

1296
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:16,580
Seong Ho: I can know more whether this person suits me or not.

1297
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:19,690
Seong Ho: Seon Woo I dated and Jun Seong

1298
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:22,830
Seong Ho: I haven't date,

1299
00:59:22,830 --> 00:59:24,670
Seong Ho: which one suits me more?

1300
00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:25,620
My heart is standing at the intersection of love.

1301
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:27,230
(Seong Ho stands at the intersection of love)
My heart is standing at the intersection of love.

1302
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,980
(Seong Ho stands at the intersection of love)

1303
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:32,710
I'm scared.

1304
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:37,420
It's my turn.

1305
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:46,980
(There's only one person whom he can call)

1306
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:52,940
(At the intersection between Seon Woo and Jun Seong, where will Seong Ho go?)

1307
01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:09,240
Seon Woo: I'm sure I'm waiting for someone to call me today. Maybe.

1308
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:12,250
Seon Woo: I was very nervous.

1309
01:00:13,650 --> 01:00:19,190
Jun Seong: I said everything I wanted to say. That's what I thought.

1310
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:24,310
Seong Ho: I thought about it for a long time.

1311
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:40,460
(What is the direction of Seong Ho's inner thoughts?)

1312
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:44,040
Hyeong Joon: Amazing mission.

1313
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:44,340
-What's wrong?
-Mission?

1314
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:45,300
(Seon Woo: Mission?!)
-What's wrong?
-Mission?

1315
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,740
(They have new missions)

1316
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:51,240
Jun Seong: It's finally time.

1317
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:54,000
Seong Ho: Everyone looks indifferent.

1318
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,160
Seong Ho: I don't know what they are thinking.

1319
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:57,690
Seon Woo: The person I liked the first day...

1320
01:00:57,690 --> 01:00:59,940
Seon Woo: I need to pull myself together. We became rivals.

1321
01:01:00,450 --> 01:01:02,280
Hyeong Jin: Ah, my head will hurt again.

1322
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:03,330
Hyeong Joon: I feel nervous.

1323
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:05,110
Hyeong Joon: He is my competitor.

1324
01:01:05,110 --> 01:01:07,120
Some are very happy.

1325
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:08,650
Some are not very happy.
