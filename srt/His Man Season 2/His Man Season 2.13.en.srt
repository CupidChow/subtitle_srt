00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:11,990

00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,570
Jun Seong: What's wrong with you?

14
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,900
Jun Seong: You said, "You came back after meeting Seon Woo Yoo."

15
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,780
Jun Seong: Why did you say that?

16
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,360

like nothing had happened.
(Seong Ho: Jun Seong was sitting in the living room)

21
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:49,960
Seong Ho: But I was happy to see him like that.

22
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:55,060
Seong Ho: I suddenly got overwhelmed by my emotions. I hugged him as soon as I walked over.

23
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,320
Seong Ho: Did you have a good chat?

24
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,420

25
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:06,560

-Seong Ho: I cried.

26

28
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,590
Seong Ho: What? Why?

29
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:15,600
Jun Seong: Isn't he your first love?

30
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,940
Seong Ho: What first love? But how did you know we talked about this?

31
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,090
-Your first love. -Seong Ho: I got goosebumps.

32
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,140

41
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,580

43
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:41,700

48
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,710
-You really didn't know? -I almost got fooled.

49
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,280
Chung-ook: Oh, you're doing this.

50
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,400
-Jun Seong: So you can tell I really don't have anything else to do.
-Chung-ook: Wow.

51
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,650
I want to join you.

52

53
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,120

54
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,450

55
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,540

56
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,400
OK.

57
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:03,420

(The teacher in the video)
Jun Seong: No, teacher. Let's do it together.

59
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,820
-Seong Ho: What? -Jun Seong: Ah, this step now.

60
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,070
Seong Ho: What?

61
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,490
Seong Ho: How can I know if there are five?

62
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,870
Seong Ho: Teacher, you're going too fast.

63
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,060
Seong Ho: I don't even know where to start over watching.

64
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,180

Seong Ho: I don't even know where to start over watching.

(The teacher in the video)

66
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,560
Jun Seong: The way I made it is different from this teacher's.

67
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:24,930
How can I...

68
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:25,850
(Hesitating)
How can I...

69
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:26,570
(Hesitating)

70
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,870
Jun Seong: We have to make a bump...

71
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,690
Seong Ho: Where should I pull to make the tail?

72
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:31,260
Jun Seong: Mine doesn't have any bumps.

73
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,090
Jun Seong: She's the only one who succeeded, so she's happy.

74
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:34,430
It's really frustrating.

75
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,240
(Upset) (Frustrated)
It's really frustrating.

76
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,690
How can you say this to your teacher?

79
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,730
Jun Seong: I'm hungry. We need him to make curry for us.

80
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,150
Jun Seong: We need Chung-ook.

81
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:47,630
(Chung-ook just went downstairs to the living room)

82
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:51,370
-Jun Seong: Can you make curry for us?
-Chung-ook: I'm hungry.

83
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,250

84
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,390
-Jun Seong: I'm hungry.
-Seong Ho: I'm hungry.

85
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,870
Really?

86
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:56,600
Chung-ook: OK.

87
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,390
-Chung-ook: Where is that? -Jun Seong: What?

88
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,950
-Chung-ook: The measuring cup. -What?

89
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,110
-Jun Seong: What cup? -The cup you use to measure quantities.

90
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,380
(Chung-ook is looking for the measuring cup)
-Jun Seong: What cup? -The cup you use to measure quantities.

91
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:06,840
Jun Seong: If it's not there, it should be down there.
(Chung-ook is looking for the measuring cup)

92
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,350
Jun Seong: If it's not there, it should be down there.

93
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,610
Jun Seong: The place where we put our cups.

94
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:13,370
-Chung-ook: Here? -Jun Seong: Yes. It was there.

95
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,930
-Jun Seong: No? -Chung-ook: No.

96
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,430
Chung-ook: Ah, here.

97
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,570
Holy.

98
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:25,829
Holy moly guacamole. *They all mean surprised.

99
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,950
Seong Ho: Why didn't you laugh?

100
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:33,010
Jun Seong: You went to see some other man and cried. Why should I laugh?

101
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,340
Seong Ho: You changed.

102
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,650
-Jun Seong: Were you happy just now?
-Seong Ho: I always cry when I meet other men.

103
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:40,980
Jun Seong: Yes. I know.

104
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,650
Jun Seong: Seon Woo hasn't come back yet.

105
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:45,820
Jun Seong: I think Yung Hee also went to meet him.

106
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,340
Seong Ho: Oh.

107
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,020
Seong Ho: He'll cry again.

108
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,010
Jun Seong: I know. But he should cry. Then why did you cry?

109
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,490
Seong Ho: It's a secret.

110
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,010
-Jun Seong: You're so annoying.
-Seong Ho: Really?

111
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,070
Jun Seong: No.

112
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:03,690
Seong Ho: What? Why are you being ambiguous? You can only choose one answer.

113
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,360
Jun Seong: I can't choose only one.

114
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,760
-Jun Seong: But can you tell it's a heart?
-Seong Ho: I can.

115
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,990
Jun Seong: It's a bit dislocated.

116
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,300
Jun Seong: The dislocated love between you two.

117
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:17,850
Seong Ho: Give it to Seon Woo.

118
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:21,070
-Seong Ho: You can name it The Dislocated Love and give it to him. -Dislocated.

119
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,180
Seong Ho: I think he'll scream out loud because of anxiety.

120
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,900
Oh, my eyes.

121
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,500
Jun Seong: Are you OK? You must be scared by us.

122
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,790
Jun Seong: I'm sorry.

123
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:31,920
(Panic)

124
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,070
(Hahaha) (Hahaha)

125
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:42,040
Seong Ho: We asked the oldest brother to cook.

126
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:47,050
Seong Ho: But we are dating, doing DIY.

127
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:52,510
(At this moment)

128
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:59,810
(Yung Hee comes to say things that he hasn't said yet)

129
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,610
(Laughing)

130
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,850
-Seon Woo: You're here. -Yes, I'm here.

131
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,850
-Seon Woo: I saw this coming. I knew you would come. -I...

132
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,970
Yung Hee: It's nice to see you here. It's only 9:30.

133
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:22,900
Seon Woo: Didn't you come to see me?

134
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,940
-Yung Hee: Of course I'm here to see you. -Right?

135
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:35,680
Seon Woo: I'm afraid of meeting Yung Hee the most. He's my homework.

136
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,370
Yung Hee: It's really the last day.

137
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,950
-Yung Hee: I have a lot to say today. -Seon Woo: A lot?

138
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,720
-Yung Hee: Yes, I'll cut to the chase. -Seon Woo: OK.

139
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:56,220
Seon Woo: I thought I should listen to everything Yung Hee says.

140
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:04,650
Yung Hee: I'm really happy just looking at you like this.

141
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:08,940
Yung Hee: I like your enthusiasm very much. I like everything about you.

142
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:13,430
Yung Hee: I've been expressing my feelings. But up to now,

143
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:16,640
Yung Hee: I've never received your call.

144
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:22,360
Yung Hee: So, because of that, I somewhat disliked you.

145
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,080
Yung Hee: We've spent seven days together.

146
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:35,280
Yung Hee: I think my advantage in a relationship is persistence, hard work, and passion.

147
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,290
Yung Hee: But I didn't show them all. It's a pity.

148
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,780
Yung Hee: On our first date,

149
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:45,570
Yung Hee: you told me that you liked me 1% more. Do you remember that?

150
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:53,300
Yung Hee: At first, I thought the number was too small. So, I don't like it.

151
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,860
Yung Hee: And I think it's a pity.

152
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:59,240
Yung Hee: But on second thought, if I can increase 1% at a time,

153
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,310
does it mean that I'll win your heart if I go to see you 99 times?

154
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,080
I think that way too.

155
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:11,850
Yung Hee: After I leave this house tomorrow and after you start my business again,

156
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:15,400
Yung Hee: I want to see you only for one minute every day for only 99 times.

157
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:25,940
Yung Hee: I want to show my passion and sincerity to you in this way.

158
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,880
Yung Hee: I have a lot to say besides these.

159
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,909
Yung Hee: Wait a moment.

160
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,390
I see.

161
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:47,220
Seon Woo: You mentioned your advantages just now. I know them very well.

162
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:53,750
Seon Woo: You've done enough to demonstrate them.

163
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,240
Seon Woo: I think it's very cool.

164
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:05,480
Seon Woo: You are a very good person.

165
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:12,030
Seon Woo: You always work hard and take care of others. You're very honest.

166
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,210
Seon Woo: You're a good person.

167
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:17,610
-Yes. -Seon Woo: So I...

168
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:24,310
Seon Woo: If you ask me why I couldn't reject you decisively,

169
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:32,460
Seon Woo: it's because I needed your support back then.

170
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,000
Seon Woo: It gave me a lot of power.

171
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,710
Seon Woo: So I couldn't turn you down like that.

172
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,010
Yung Hee: You said

173
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:47,310
Yung Hee: timing is crucial in a relationship. Do you remember?

174
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,070
Yung Hee: I think this is the right time.

175
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,390
Yung Hee: I have a lot to say. But I can't remember.

176
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,400
-Seon Woo: Just be yourself. -Yes.

177
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:09,130
Seon Woo: Don't force yourself to prepare anything. I don't think it's necessary.

178
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:14,320
Yung Hee: No matter if he feels sad

179
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,650
Yung Hee: or happy because of others,

180
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:21,990
Yung Hee: I'll always be by his side. I wanted to tell him this.

181
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:27,580
Yung Hee: But it's strange. My mind goes blank when I stand in front of Seon Woo.

182
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:31,210
Yung Hee: I can't remember that.

183
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:35,170
Yung Hee: Because after a certain day, I couldn't receive any reply from you.

184
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:38,120
Yung Hee: I thought, "What did I do wrong?"

185
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:43,590
Yung Hee: I started to change little by little.

186
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:47,870
Yung Hee: I quit smoking. I get up early in the morning now.

187
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,740
Yung Hee: I also help when you cook.

188
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:58,270
Yung Hee: During yesterday's group date, we played zip-line together.

189
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:01,680
Yung Hee: I've been thinking it'd be great if this could become our daily life.

190
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:08,970
Yung Hee: The person in your heart. I don't think I can beat him

191
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:15,780
Yung Hee: with my charm. That's a pity.

192
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,290
Yung Hee: I just feel that

193
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:24,650
Yung Hee: even if I leave this house, I also want to express my heart to you.

194
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:28,020
Yung Hee: What I just said to you...

195
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:31,240
-Yung Hee: One minute per day.
-Seon Woo: One minute?

196
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,560
Yung Hee: One minute. I think you'll feel stressed if it's longer.

197
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,520
Seon Woo: I think one minute makes me feel more pressured.

198
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,740
Yung Hee: Will one minute be more stressful?

199
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,560
Yung Hee: Then about one minute. I'll go to you 99 times.

200
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,740
Yung Hee: If you still think I'm not the right one for you,

201
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:51,880
Yung Hee: I think I'll be cool and be your brother.

202
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,760
Yung Hee: I think I already gave him a lot of pressure.

203
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,470
Yung Hee: I would feel the same if someone who likes me

204
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:59,010
Yung Hee: came to the place where I work every day.

205
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,100
Yung Hee: It is indeed stressful.

206
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,220
Yung Hee: But even so,

207
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,480
Yung Hee: I want to show myself for the last time.

208
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:12,270
Seon Woo: He reminded me of my first love.

209
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:16,430
Seon Woo: Passionate, clumsy, and simple.

210
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:22,080
Seon Woo: His feelings towards me are precious.

211
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:26,200
Seon Woo: Thank you for always supporting me.

212
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,000
Yung Hee: Thank you, too, for accepting these without any burden.

213
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,550
Seon Woo: Shall we shake hands?

214
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,620
-Let's take the easy way today. -Of course.

215
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,610
Don't push yourself too hard.

216
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:39,680
It's the last day, so I think too much.

217
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,460
(Tightly)
It's the last day, so I think too much.

218
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:45,100
Don't push yourself too hard.

219
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:49,410
Seon Woo: No matter what the result is, I want to keep my image in your heart

220
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:53,600
Seon Woo: as a good brother.

221
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,040
Okay.

222
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,340
(Nodding)

223
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,690
Yung Hee: I'm going home. See you later.

224
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,240
-Seon Woo: Thank you. -Okay.

225
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,670
-Bye. -See you later.

226
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,370
(Yung Hee confessed his love for the last time and Seon Woo felt heavy)
-Bye. -See you later.

227
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:11,810
(Yung Hee confessed his love for the last time and Seon Woo felt heavy)

228
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:28,120
(Hyeong Jin and Hyeong Joon)

229
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:33,030
-Hyeong Jin: So awkward. -Hyeong Joon: Yes.

230
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:36,080
-No. -Hyeong Jin: I have something to say.

231
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:42,760
Hyeong Jin: I have something to say after sorting it out.

232
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:47,970
Hyeong Jin: Until yesterday, I've been like,

233
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:51,530
Hyeong Jin: "I want to express myself in my own way."

234
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,500
Hyeong Jin: That kind of thought is strong.

235
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:59,250
Hyeong Jin: Anyway, to you, my behavior seems frivolous.

236
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,060
Hyeong Jin: I made my choice too easily.

237
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:06,750
Hyeong Jin: I think you should think like this.

238
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,300
Hyeong Joon: No. I think that's what you should think.

239
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,780
Hyeong Joon: You like someone. Then you go your own way.

240
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:16,780
Hyeong Joon: Your way is not wrong. It's just different from mine.

241
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,550
Hyeong Joon: But to be honest, I'm a little angry

242
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,380
Hyeong Joon: because of what you did.

243
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,710
Hyeong Joon: When you, Min Seong, and I were together,

244
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:28,990
Hyeong Joon: you wanted to avoid us. This happened several times.

245
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,870
Hyeong Joon: That means you know it.

246
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,790
Hyeong Joon: I thought

247
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:35,480
Hyeong Joon: you knew I like Min Seong,

248
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,660
Hyeong Joon: so you left us alone. That's what I thought.

249
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,220
Hyeong Joon: But when all of us were together, you were not like that.

250
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,260
Hyeong Joon: Did you realize it?

251
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:42,870
What?

252
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:48,700
Hyeong Joon: When everyone was present, you would put pressure on Min Seong.

253
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,110
-Hyeong Jin: But that's my...
-Hyeong Joon: Yes, it's your way.

254
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:53,370
Hyeong Joon: But it makes me think you don't know what you're doing.

255
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,510
Hyeong Joon: If you don't like me being alone with Min Seong,

256
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,490
Hyeong Joon: just stay.

257
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,300
Hyeong Joon: Why did you say those words to me?

258
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,650
Hyeong Joon: To be honest, I didn't care about you at all when I was there.

259
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:04,360
I thought you were one of my friends who supported me.

260
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,000
Because you made room for me and Min Seong.

261
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,770
That's it.

262
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:10,890
Hyeong Joon: But why did you do that?

263
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:11,730
Hyeong Joon: If you are interested in him,

264
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,610
Hyeong Joon: you shouldn't have done that.

265
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:18,850
Hyeong Joon: I won't care what you do with Min Seong.

266
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,970
Hyeong Joon: It's normal.

267
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,200
Hyeong Joon: That's why we came here. Right?

268
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,680
Hyeong Joon: But why?

269
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,610
Hyeong Joon: Why did you do that when the three of us were together?

270
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:27,750
Hyeong Joon: And when everyone else was there,

271
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:31,060
Hyeong Joon: why did you make others uncomfortable?

272
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,270
-Hyeong Jin: Did I make everyone uncomfortable? -Yes.

273
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:37,260
Hyeong Jin: Because I don't want Min Seong to feel uncomfortable.

274
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:41,550
Hyeong Jin: I think if the three of us stay together,

275
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,390
Hyeong Jin: Min Seong will be uncomfortable.

276
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:45,700
Hyeong Jin: That's why I left every time.

277
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,590
Hyeong Jin: When everyone was present,

278
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:50,120
Hyeong Jin: I didn't have to.

279
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:54,800
Hyeong Jin: I just want it to be fair.

280
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:54,910
(Hyeong Jin: So, when you're alone with Min Seong)
Hyeong Jin: I just want it to be fair.

281
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:55,880
So, when you're alone with Min Seong,
(Hyeong Jin: So, when you're alone with Min Seong)

282
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,420
So, when you're alone with Min Seong,

283
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,070
Hyeong Jin: I want to give you a chance to talk more.

284
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,700
-I also want to...
-Hyeong Joon: Why should you do that?

285
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,360
-I can decide what to do. -Hyeong Jin: This is my way.

286
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,290
Hyeong Joon: So, why should you do that?

287
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,830
-Hyeong Joon: Anyway, you... -Hyeong Jin: That's my personality.

288
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:09,130
Hyeong Joon: Yes, what I want to say now is

289
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,020
Hyeong Joon: that I'm annoyed by this.

290
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,570
Hyeong Joon: If you think I'm your rival,

291
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:17,140
Hyeong Joon: I hope you don't cross the line.

292
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,710
Hyeong Jin: I'm curious about this.

293
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:21,090
Hyeong Jin: Did I cross the line?

294
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:23,560
Hyeong Joon: Your behavior is self-contradictory.

295
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,080
Hyeong Joon: In my opinion. It's only in my opinion.

296
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,550
Hyeong Jin: Why did I avoid you two when the three of us were together?

297
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:31,880
Hyeong Joon: You told us, "Enjoy your date." And then you left.

298
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,120
Hyeong Joon: You thought you did so because you care about Min Seong,

299
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,910
Hyeong Joon: but from my perspective,

300
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:39,220
Hyeong Joon: I thought you did that for me,

301
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,680
Hyeong Joon: because of our relationship.

302
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,700
Hyeong Jin: Didn't you think I like Min Seong

303
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:47,000
Hyeong Jin: when you saw how I treated him?

304
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,870
Hyeong Joon: I thought about it. But I just found out recently.

305
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,950
Hyeong Joon: I just found out yesterday. I felt it clearly yesterday.

306
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:55,670
Hyeong Joon: I didn't know before. I thought you were helping me.

307
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,920
Hyeong Joon: As for some of your behavior,

308
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,570
Hyeong Joon: I thought you did those things because you and Min Seong know each other well.

309
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,430
Hyeong Joon: That's what I thought.

310
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,990
Hyeong Joon: If you hadn't done that...

311
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,300
Hyeong Joon: Do you know what I was thinking?

312
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,760
Hyeong Joon: You worked hard. It's just that I've been following the rules too much.

313
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,170
Hyeong Jin: Why do you think you are the only one who follows the rules?

314
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:15,800
Hyeong Joon: I'm not talking about whether it's good or bad.

315
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,960
Hyeong Joon: It's just that I thought of your behavior

316
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,910
Hyeong Joon: in a positive way.

317
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,690
Hyeong Joon: In that situation,

318
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:26,710
Hyeong Joon: I 100% believed that was the truth.

319
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,290
If I had known it, things would be fine.

320
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,200
(Hyeong Joon didn't expect Hyeong Jin to be his rival)
If I had known it, things would be fine.

321
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,020
But I didn't see that coming at all.
(Hyeong Joon didn't expect Hyeong Jin to be his rival)

322
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,750
(Hyeong Joon didn't expect Hyeong Jin to be his rival)

323
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,190
Hyeong Joon: I don't mean you did wrong.

324
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:40,020
Hyeong Joon: From my standpoint, it's a little…

325
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,670
Hyeong Joon: When we were alone...

326
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,300
Hyeong Jin: You thought I was helping you.

327
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,040
Hyeong Jin: You thought I knew you like Min Seong.

328
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,190
Hyeong Jin: Is that what you think?

329
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,770
Hyeong Joon: You were helping me.

330
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:50,980
Hyeong Jin: Did you think I was helping you?

331
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,310
Hyeong Joon: Yes, that's what I thought. I thought you supported me.

332
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,510
Hyeong Joon: Even if it wasn't helping me,

333
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,110
Hyeong Joon: I thought of it in a simple way.

334
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:57,760
Because I...

335
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:05,270
Hyeong Jin: But I thought you knew I like Min Seong.

336
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:11,319
Hyeong Joon: Even if I knew, anyway, you shouldn't have done that.

337
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:14,200
Hyeong Joon: Why didn't you just stay?

338
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,890
I keep thinking about it.

339
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:18,910
Hyeong Joon: I was shocked because of this.

340
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,720
Wait a moment.

341
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,140
Hyeong Jin: I didn't expect that.

342
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:35,220
(Hyeong Jin: I avoided them because it would be awkward if the three of us were there)
Hyeong Jin: I didn't expect that.

343
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,690
I avoided them because it would be awkward if the three of us were there.
(Hyeong Jin: I avoided them because it would be awkward if the three of us were there)

344
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:39,400
Hyeong Jin: But he got angry.
(Hyeong Jin: I avoided them because it would be awkward if the three of us were there)

345
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,580
Hyeong Jin: But he got angry.

346
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,230
Hyeong Jin: Suddenly, I felt very wronged and panicked.

347
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,500
Hyeong Joon: It's me who should cry. Why did he cry?

348
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,850
Hyeong Joon: I was flustered.

349
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,570
Hyeong Jin: I'm really sorry.

350
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,370
Hyeong Joon: Anyway, he gets to make the decision.

351
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:07,060
Hyeong Jin: No. I suddenly burst into tears because I...

352
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:10,070
Hyeong Jin: I was surprised. I realized that's what you thought of me.

353
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:12,690
Hyeong Jin: You thought I looked self-contradictory.

354
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:16,970
Hyeong Jin: I didn't expect these parts.

355
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:21,710
Hyeong Joon: I thought about these parts in a too simple way.

356
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:24,310
Hyeong Joon: I thought to myself, "No, it can't be."

357
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,920
Hyeong Joon: Well, I wish this had happened from the beginning.

358
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,470
Hyeong Joon: I've been living a peaceful life. But now suddenly...

359
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:34,370
Hyeong Joon: This happened when everything was about to end. I am really upset.

360
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:37,630
Hyeong Joon: I don't want to show it to others.

361
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:42,420
Hyeong Joon: Because I hope people think I'm still the same.

362
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,400
Hyeong Joon: I don't want to ruin the atmosphere.

363
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:49,940
Hyeong Joon: Don't cry.

364
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,950
Hyeong Jin: No, this.

365
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:58,610
(Can't stop crying because of mixed feelings)

366
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:07,070
Hyeong Jin: It's not only about this. I think...

367
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:10,300
Hyeong Jin: After hearing what you said, I put myself in your shoes.

368
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,060
Hyeong Jin: I think I would be shocked if I were you.

369
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:15,240
Hyeong Jin: After knowing your love style and thoughts,

370
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,130
Hyeong Jin: and after understanding them...

371
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:20,500
Hyeong Joon: So, I've been emphasizing I'm not saying that you did something wrong.

372
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,520
Hyeong Joon: You did nothing wrong.

373
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,090
Hyeong Joon: I hope you don't get me wrong.

374
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:30,720
Hyeong Joon: I was just shocked by these parts.

375
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:36,510
Hyeong Jin: I thought I wouldn't cry and we would just chat casually.

376
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:41,240
Hyeong Jin: I wanted to talk about the misunderstandings.

377
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,150
Hyeong Jin: I just...

378
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:47,750
Hyeong Jin: We have different starting points.

379
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,150
Hyeong Joon: Indeed.

380
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:52,480
Hyeong Jin: So I think I'm too selfish.

381
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,590
Hyeong Jin: I thought a lot about it.

382
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:00,870
Hyeong Jin: After all, you have liked him for a long time.

383
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:04,080
Hyeong Jin: I just got to know him and confirmed my feelings.

384
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,090
Hyeong Jin: For me, it just started.

385
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:05,130
(Hyeong Jin: "Did I suddenly intrude into their relationship?")
Hyeong Jin: For me, it just started.

386
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:08,080
"Did I suddenly intrude into their relationship?"
(Hyeong Jin: "Did I suddenly intrude into their relationship?")

387
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:13,940
-Hyeong Jin: So, I have a lot of complicated thoughts.
-No.

388
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:18,950
Hyeong Joon: I didn't pay much attention to you.

389
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:21,650
Hyeong Joon: I was never wary of you.

390
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,790
Hyeong Jin: I thought that's your personality.

391
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,710
Hyeong Joon: No, I just didn't guard against you.

392
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,730
Hyeong Joon: I'm more jealous than you think.

393
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,740
Hyeong Joon: I say what I should say.

394
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,450
Hyeong Joon: If I want to say something, I will say it.

395
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:35,640
Hyeong Joon: But I didn't think deeper. That's it.

396
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:42,060
I was so stupid.

397
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,680
I...

398
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:52,500
Hyeong Joon: Well, consider it as our unique style.

399
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,980
Hyeong Joon: Let's do it well and finish it well.

400
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:58,990
Hyeong Jin: OK. I should say it with a smile.

401
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,540
Hyeong Jin: I'm sorry.

402
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:05,020
Hyeong Jin: I suddenly cried in a complicated situation.

403
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,330
Hyeong Joon: It's OK.

404
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,880
Hyeong Joon: Let's have dinner and talk later.

405
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,880
OK.

406
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,880
Hyeong Joon: Let's go.

407
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,250
Hyeong Joon: I feel relieved. But I still feel a little uncomfortable.

408
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:21,110
Hyeong Joon: I am a pacifist.

409
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:24,150
Hyeong Joon: I wanted everyone to work hard together.

410
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,600
Hyeong Joon: Anyway, this is a competition.

411
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:31,980
Hyeong Joon: So, it's hard for me to find peace here.

412
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,920
Hyeong Joon: That's it.

413
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,950
Hyeong Jin: I'm not 100% relieved.

414
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:39,600
Hyeong Jin: But we can move on.

415
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:45,490
Hyeong Jin: I feel uneasy.

416
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:59,070
(Another man approaches Hyeong Jin) (Min Seong)

417
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,280
(A glance)

418
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,530
Hyeong Jin: The first thing I thought about when I saw him was

419
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:15,870
Hyeong Jin: that I needed to control my facial expression.

420
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,120
Min Seong: What? When did you come?

421
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,680
Hyeong Jin: Me?

422
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,530
Hyeong Jin: Just now.

423
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,720
Min Seong: Good.

424
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,320
Min Seong: Because I never had a one-on-one date with Hyeong Jin.

425
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,430
Min Seong: We can talk about something sincerely this time.

426
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,660
Min Seong: One-on-one.

427
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,130
Hyeong Jin: Yes.

428
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,710
Min Seong: Let me take off my coat.

429
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:39,570
Hyeong Jin: I'll put it over there.

430
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:46,360
(Hyeong Jin helps with Min Seong's jacket)

431
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,290
-Thank you. -Thank you.
(Hyeong Jin helps with Min Seong's jacket)

432
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:49,250
(Hyeong Jin helps with Min Seong's jacket)

433
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:50,320
Thank you.
(Hyeong Jin helps with Min Seong's jacket)

434
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,460
(Hyeong Jin helps with Min Seong's jacket)

435
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,110
-Hyeong Jin: At least we can talk like this in the end.
-Min Seong: Yes.

436
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,460
Min Seong: I want to do it too. A one-on-one date. That's perfect.

437
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,570
Hyeong Jin: Really?

438
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:03,510
Hyeong Jin: Great. Me too.

439
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,220
Min Seong: But now we are here. It's a bit awkward.

440
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,380
Min Seong: Why?

441
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,820
-Hyeong Jin: Sudden awkwardness?
-Min Seong: Yes. All of a sudden.

442
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,870
-Hyeong Jin: It's not awkward.
-Min Seong: Why?

443
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:17,260
Hyeong Jin: Why is it awkward?

444
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,850
Hyeong Jin: Do you have any questions for me? Or is there something you want to know about me?

445
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,530
Min Seong: But we talked a lot.

446
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:30,990
Min Seong: Aren't you curious about me?

447
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:38,430
Hyeong Jin: I always wanted to date you. I'm curious about you.

448
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:40,250
Hyeong Jin: It's like this.

449
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,610
-Min Seong: We are on a date now.
-Hyeong Jin: Yes.

450
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,210
Min Seong: In that case,

451
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:51,500
-Min Seong: during this period of time
-Yes.

452
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,810
Min Seong: we can talk about something sincerely.

453
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:56,300
Min Seong: Actually, yesterday, I was avoiding...

454
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,010
Hyeong Jin: Me?

455
00:23:57,010 --> 00:24:00,960
Min Seong: No, I was avoiding that scenario.

456
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,840
Min Seong: Because I didn't want to feel uncomfortable.

457
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,310
Min Seong: Because I didn't want to feel uncomfortable, I avoided it.

458
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:10,300
Min Seong: Am I a little selfish?

459
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:14,710
Hyeong Jin: No. That's how you deal with problems.

460
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:22,160
Hyeong Jin: In fact, until this morning, I had very complicated feelings.

461
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,330
Hyeong Jin: But later I made up my mind.

462
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:28,600
Hyeong Jin: Now it has become complicated again.

463
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,960
Min Seong: Why?

464
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,290
-Min Seong: What bothers you? -Well...

465
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,870
Hyeong Jin: Can I say it?

466
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,250
Min Seong: Because this may be the last

467
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,320
Min Seong: one-on-one date we have.

468
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,140
-Min Seong: By the way, today is the last day.
-Right.

469
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:47,060
Hyeong Jin: Then I'll be honest with you.

470
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,520
Hyeong Jin: Before you came,

471
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,410
Hyeong Jin: I had a one-on-one conversation with Hyeong Joon.

472
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:54,620
-Min Seong: Here? -Hyeong Jin: Yes.

473
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,250
Min Seong: Ah, really?

474
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,880
Hyeong Jin: After talking with him,

475
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:04,280
Hyeong Jin: I learned something I didn't know. Also, I found out I misunderstood something.

476
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,750
Hyeong Jin: I was a little flustered.

477
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,280
Hyeong Jin: We talked in detail.

478
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,080
Min Seong: You talked about the two of you.

479
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,870
Min Seong: You two talked alone. I don't want to

480
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:19,050
Min Seong: dig into what you talked about.

481
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:21,350
Min Seong: The result is

482
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:23,390
-Min Seong: that you are here talking with me. That's enough.
-Yes.

483
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,770
Okay.

484
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:26,590
-Min Seong: Yes, talk to me.
-Hyeong Jin: Okay.

485
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:27,030
(Min Seong: Because I can't solve the problem between Hyeong Joon and Hyeong Jin)

486
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:30,200
Because I can't solve that problem.
(Min Seong: Because I can't solve the problem between Hyeong Joon and Hyeong Jin)

487
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,070
Min Seong: It's good now.

488
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,890
Min Seong: But I'm worried

489
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:37,950
Min Seong: if they are unhappy with each other.

490
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:43,140
Hyeong Jin: Anyway, I'm focusing on

491
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,440
Hyeong Jin: what I'm curious about you.

492
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,400
Min Seong: Yes, me too.

493
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,900
Min Seong: Focus on what's between us.

494
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:55,430
Hyeong Jin: Why do you want to go on a date with me?

495
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,680
Min Seong: Because I have feelings for two men.

496
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:06,310
Min Seong: So, I gradually had such thoughts:

497
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,120
Min Seong: What kind of person is this man?

498
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,270
Min Seong: And what kind of person is that man?

499
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:14,660
Min Seong: But about the fact that I can't make a decision easily...

500
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,870
Min Seong: It's true that I shouldn't make a decision too easily,

501
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,100
Min Seong: but I'm angry about myself

502
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,500
Min Seong: for not dealing with the situation as soon as possible.

503
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:26,650
Min Seong: Anyway, I have feelings for both of you.

504
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:30,480
Min Seong: If I could sort out my feelings and choose one person,

505
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,100
Min Seong: then the other one would have time to know more about others.

506
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:38,690
I feel like it's my fault.

507
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:40,160
That's it.

508
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:44,220
Hyeong Jin: You did nothing wrong.

509
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:48,360
Hyeong Jin: Of course, I had someone else that I had feelings for.

510
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:48,400
I know what you're facing.

511
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,960
(Hyeong Jin: I know what you're facing)
I know what you're facing.

512
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,070
Hyeong Jin: I just want you to follow your feelings and make your choice.
(Hyeong Jin: I know what you're facing)

513
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:55,960
Hyeong Jin: I just want you to follow your feelings and make your choice.

514
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,680
Hyeong Jin: I also want to do the same.

515
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,430
Anyway,

516
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:03,380
I only have you now.

517
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,930
Min Seong: What?

518
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:08,970
Hyeong Jin: Are you moved?

519
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:12,050
Min Seong: The last sentence is not that good. Now?

520
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:13,620
Hyeong Jin: No, I...

521
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,300
Min Seong: It means that you've sorted out your thoughts, right?

522
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:20,950
Hyeong Jin: Yes. I'm going to get close to you firmly.

523
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:24,820
Hyeong Jin: I will do it my way, no matter what the result is.

524
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:27,470
Hyeong Jin: Actually,

525
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:32,750
Hyeong Jin: I don't like that the person who I like is taken away by others.

526
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,610
-Min Seong: Then I can ask you this.
-Hyeong Jin: What?

527
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:39,320
-Min Seong: What do you like about me?
-Hyeong Jin: You?

528
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,610
Hyeong Jin: As you said, actually, I am not your type.

529
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:47,180
Hyeong Jin: If I choose according to the first impression, it won't be you, either.

530
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:49,110
Hyeong Jin: But then I thought of you naturally.

531
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:51,970
Hyeong Jin: I found something I didn't know about you.

532
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:54,670
Hyeong Jin: It should be the right timing.

533
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:59,760
Hyeong Jin: And when we made the phone call, you were with me.

534
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:05,750
Hyeong Jin: We were together and you left to make the call first.

535
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:06,390
You went there and called me.

536
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:09,060
(Hyeong Jin: You went to make a call and called me)
You went there and called me.

537
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,650
Hyeong Jin: I thought you were cool.

538
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:16,300
Min Seong: I can't make a choice after hearing what he said.

539
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,560
Min Seong: I feel frustrated.

540
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,410
Hyeong Jin: My hands are shaking.

541
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:23,510
Hyeong Jin: I don't get nervous easily.

542
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,380
Min Seong: Then why are your hands shaking?

543
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:28,320
Min Seong: It's not obvious at all, but you're nervous.

544
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,490
Hyeong Jin: I didn't want to show it.

545
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:32,660
-Min Seong: But you're nervous?
-Hyeong Jin: Yes.

546
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,770
Hyeong Jin: I'm very nervous.

547
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,100
Min Seong: I should go.

548
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:42,240
Hyeong Jin: Don't go. I hope you can stay.

549
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,080
Hyeong Jin: Stay here

550
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,880
Hyeong Jin: until you make the final choice.

551
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,890
Min Seong: I won't leave.

552
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:48,980
-Don't go. -I won't go.

553
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,380
Don't go. Don't go.

554
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,930
Hyeong Jin: I'm happy.

555
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:52,840
Min Seong: I'm leaving.

556
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,670
Min Seong: I'll visit you in your room later.

557
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,250
-See you at home. -See you later.

558
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:01,460
Bye.

559
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,590
-Bye. -Bye.

560
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:17,140
(Sad)

561
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:29,410
Hyeong Jin: This date

562
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:33,610
Hyeong Jin: is the last chance to go out with Min Seong.

563
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:36,480
Hyeong Jin: I feel both happy and sad.

564
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,080
Hyeong Jin: If Min Seong had talked to someone else,

565
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:45,290
Hyeong Jin: I thought it might be Hyeong Joon.

566
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,570
(Hyeong Jin goes back to Men's House)

567
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:51,960
You're back.
(Hyeong Jin goes back to Men's House)

568
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,520
(Hyeong Jin goes back to Men's House)

569
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:55,270
Seong Ho: Wet boy is here. -Wet boy.

570
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:57,930
-Hyeong Jin: What are you cooking?
-Chung-ook: I'm going to make lentil curry.

571
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,720
Jun Seong: Lentil curry.

572
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,000
Hyeong Jin: Didn't you two go out?

573
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,950
Jun Seong: I've been back for two hours.

574
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,720
Hyeong Jin: Really? I'll go inside first.

575
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,270
Hyeong Jin: You don't need me to do anything, right?

576
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,720
Seong Ho: Go have a rest.

577
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:24,040
(Hyeong Jin looks exhausted physically and mentally)

578
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,010
Done.

579
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:27,290
Jun Seong: What do you think?

580
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,030
(Panic)

581
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,260
Seong Ho: Is that a heart?
(Panic)

582
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:31,460
Seong Ho: Is that a heart?

583
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,480
(Glaring)
Seong Ho: Is that a heart?

584
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:35,180
Seong Ho: It's nice. Thank you so much.

585
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,620
Jun Seong: It's even more annoying.

586
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:40,500
Seong Ho: Thank you so much.

587
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:45,230
Chung-ook: Oh, my eyes hurt.

588
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:48,590
Seong Ho: Are you going to use this?

589
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:49,940
Chung-ook: No.

590
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:52,330
Seong Ho: Why are you crying?

591
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:53,870
Chung-ook: Why are you doing this to me?

592
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:54,550
(Panic)

593
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,240
Seong Ho: Me?
(Panic)

594
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,400
Chung-ook: Yes. How could you do that?

595
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,800
Seong Ho: Now you're acting.

596
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,650
-Seong Ho: What are you doing?
-Chung-ook: Ah. I really...

597
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:05,050
Chung-ook: I didn't expect you to be like this.

598
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:09,590
Seong Ho: Don't cry. Move.

599
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:15,830
-Jun Seong: What is this?
-Chung-ook: Red lentil.

600
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:19,050
Chung-ook: I should use turmeric when cooking red lentils.

601
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:21,640
-Jun Seong: Turmeric?
-Chung-ook: Yes. But we don't have it.

602
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,150
Jun Seong: Can't you use curry?

603
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:25,860
-Put curry.
-Chung-ook: My pride doesn't allow me to use curry.

604
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,990
Seong Ho: I understand your pride.

605
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,210
(Yung Hee comes home after the conversation)

606
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,450
Yung Hee: I'm back.

607
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,450
Yung Hee: Are we done?

608
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:39,360
-Jun Seong: Yes.
-Yung Hee: Oh, really?

609
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,170
-I...
-Jun Seong: Don't use the informal form of speech.

610
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,730
-What else?
-Jun Seong: Is it enough to be good looking?

611
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:46,890
-Seong Ho: What are you doing?
-Jun Seong: For me, being good-looking is enough.

612
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:49,590
-Seong Ho: Don't use the informal form of speech.
-Jun Seong: Don't use the informal form of speech.

613
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:53,500
Jun Seong: You are short too.

614
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:56,220
Yung Hee: As a tall guy, you are so annoying to talk like that.

615
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:56,300
Jun Seong: I have a knife in my hand.

616
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,300
(Serious)
Jun Seong: I have a knife in my hand.

617
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:57,380
Jun Seong: I have a knife in my hand.

618
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,530
(Frightened)
Jun Seong: I have a knife in my hand.

619
00:31:58,530 --> 00:31:58,660
-Jun Seong: Watch out.
-Yung Hee: Why are you talking like that? It's scary.
(Frightened)
Jun Seong: I have a knife in my hand.

620
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:01,010
-Jun Seong: Watch out.
-Yung Hee: Why are you talking like that? It's scary.

621
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:09,830
Min Seong: After talking with Hyeong Jin,

622
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:15,500
Min Seong: whom will I talk to and what will we talk about?

623
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,430
Min Seong: I'm just curious.

624
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:31,390
(A man is walking towards Min Seong)

625
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:34,650
(It's Hyeong Joon who walks towards Min Seong)

626
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,490
Hyeong Joon: Why do I feel there's a distance between us?

627
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:39,380
Min Seong: Because we are far away.

628
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,610
Min Seong: I have thought about this. If we're having conversations,

629
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:44,810
Min Seong: will there be you?

630
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:48,210
Hyeong Joon: I smelled something nice right after I entered that place.

631
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:51,300
Hyeong Joon: It's the scent I smelled when we first met.

632
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:55,390
Hyeong Joon: This is the first time we chat like this

633
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,370
Hyeong Joon: after our date, right?

634
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:59,240
Min Seong: This is kind of a date, isn't it?

635
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,100
-Min Seong: This is kind of a date, isn't it?
-Hyeong Joon: Is that so?

636
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,380
Min Seong: We're one-on-one, aren't we?

637
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,340
-Hyeong Joon: This is the last time.
-Min Seong: Yes, it's the last time.

638
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:11,760
Min Seong: In that case, will we be more honest this time?

639
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:14,530
Hyeong Joon: Something we want to say…

640
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:16,840
Min Seong: But as a person who's so good at hiding the real feelings,

641
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,940
-Min Seong: it's a bit...
-Hyeong Joon: Are you talking about me?

642
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,580
-Hyeong Joon: I don't like hiding my feelings.
-Min Seong: Really?

643
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:24,740
Min Seong: But you don't seem to show your feelings much.

644
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,570
-Really?
-Min Seong: Although you show your interest,

645
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:29,890
Min Seong: you still hide something when you talk.

646
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:35,050
-Hyeong Joon: I just didn't have a chance to reveal myself.
-Min Seong: Is that so?

647
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,760
Min Seong: Don't you have any questions about me?

648
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,340
Hyeong Joon: About you?

649
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:46,590
Hyeong Joon: It may not be good to say this,

650
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:50,780
Hyeong Joon: but normally I'm the leading one in every circumstance. Right?

651
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:54,310
Hyeong Joon: But I can't lead in this relationship.

652
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:57,230
Hyeong Joon: I'm the one who waits to be picked.

653
00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:01,060
Hyeong Joon: So I want to hear your words.

654
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:08,739
Hyeong Joon: I felt it clearly yesterday

655
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:12,380
Hyeong Joon: that I slacked off.

656
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:15,030
Min Seong: What does that mean?

657
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:20,350
Hyeong Joon: I was like a fool. All I knew is to move forward.

658
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,929
Hyeong Joon: So I couldn't observe the surroundings.

659
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:27,060
Hyeong Joon: I should have noticed

660
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:32,139
Hyeong Joon: the other competitor.

661
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:38,730
Min Seong: But why didn't you join my anonymous chat group yesterday?

662
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:42,650
-Hyeong Jun: I didn't go in on purpose.
-Min Seong: On purpose? Why?

663
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:45,300
Min Seong: Why didn't you come in?

664
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,460
Min Seong: Well, I didn't mean that you have to join my chat group.

665
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,110
Min Seong: I'm just curious.

666
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:52,360
Min Seong: Why didn't you come in?

667
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,080
Hyeong Joon: What should I talk about once
I'm inside?

668
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,740
-Min Seong: Since it's anonymous, you can just ask whatever you want.
-Hyeong Joon: My nickname is not anonymous.

669
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:02,560
-Hyeong Joon: I used my real name directly.
-Min Seong: Ah, the nickname itself?

670
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,540
Hyeong Joon: So I couldn't hide myself.

671
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,770
Hyeong Joon: Also, I had this thought: "If I want to know something,

672
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:10,500
Hyeong Joon: do I really have to ask it in an anonymous chat room?"

673
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:15,740
Hyeong Joon: Actually, I wanted to talk to Hyeong Jin in his chat group.

674
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:20,380
Hyeong Joon: But I was worried that you might see it.

675
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:25,010
Hyeong Joon: I told you on the terrace before,

676
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:28,480
Hyeong Joon: that this part is too contradictory and irritating.

677
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,240
Hyeong Joon: But you said

678
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,320
Hyeong Joon: we shouldn't feel pressured.

679
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:37,650
Hyeong Joon: So I gradually realized…

680
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:42,430
Hyeong Joon: You said you never thought that far.

681
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,610
Min Seong: Yes, to be honest, when you were saying that,

682
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:50,370
Min Seong: I didn't know how to react.

683
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:54,260
Min Seong: Because in that situation, there may be some misunderstanding between you two.

684
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:57,240
Min Seong: Anyway, It's your freedom.

685
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,520
Min Seong: It's your own thought.

686
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,110
Min Seong: So I don't think

687
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,260
Min Seong: I have right

688
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:05,760
Min Seong: to agree with you or criticize you.

689
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,640
Min Seong: So I think…

690
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,280
Hyeong Joon: But I think it was my mistake to say that.

691
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,290
Hyeong Joon: Because I brought you pressure.

692
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:15,950
Hyeong Joon: If in the anonymous chat group,

693
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:21,110
Hyeong Joon: I said something like "If you want to go on, go on; if you want to quit, just quit."

694
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:24,000
Hyeong Joon: If I say it in an anonymous chat group that everyone can see,

695
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,540
Hyeong Joon: I thought you would feel pressured.

696
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:34,160
Hyeong Joon: I didn't want to give you pressure. That's all.

697
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:38,460
Min Seong: I see.

698
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:43,840
Min Seong: But in my opinion,

699
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,940
Min Seong: I think you look different.

700
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:51,060
Min Seong: Should I say… you look a little cold?

701
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,990
Min Seong: You look a little that way,

702
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:56,010
Min Seong: so I don't dare to get close to you.

703
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:58,390
Min Seong: I always wondered if I had done something wrong.

704
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:01,210
Hyeong Joon: Though I do like you,

705
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:05,070
Hyeong Joon: but because of that sense of loss,

706
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:11,310
Hyeong Joon: I didn't dare to look into your eyes. Somehow.

707
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:14,220
Hyeong Joon: I dinn't know what I could do at that time.

708
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:17,190
Hyeong Joon: I've been like that since yesterday.

709
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:19,560
Hyeong Joon: Since yesterday.

710
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:25,330
Min Seong: I somehow felt that way.

711
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:27,210
Hyeong Joon: I fully understand,

712
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:30,440
Hyeong Joon: but I have my perspective.

713
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:34,670
Hyeong Joon: I didn't want to ruin the atmosphere, either.

714
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:39,330
Min Seong: I know he likes me,

715
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:43,890
so I hope he can get close to me.

716
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:52,040
Hyeong Joon: I wanted to cry from beginning to end when we were chatting anonymously yesterday.

717
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:56,850
Hyeong Joon: I remembered the moment when we were fishing and the moment you gave me cookies,

718
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:59,850
Hyeong Joon: no, the moment we were assigned to the same room.

719
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:02,600
Hyeong Joon: Something always flashed in my head.

720
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:06,040
Hyeong Joon: When I see your anonymous chat group,

721
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:10,330
Hyeong Joon: there was a pop-up saying that I could't enter.

722
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,580
Hyeong Joon: I've entered two other groups, so I could't enter.

723
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,870
Hyeong Joon: I felt very sad when I saw that.

724
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:18,370
Hyeong Joon: It was because I used up my chances before.

725
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:19,440
Hyeong Joon: I didn't want to go into your group,

726
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,010
so I couldn't go in even if I wanted to.

727
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:23,730
(Hyeong Joon: So I couldn't go in even if I wanted to)
so I couldn't go in even if I wanted to.

728
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,550
Min Seong: I see.

729
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:34,680
Hyeong Joon: Anyway, I respect your decision.

730
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,710
Hyeong Joon: But it's not like it's Hyeong Jin's fault.

731
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:39,050
Hyeong Joon: It's not others' fault.

732
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:42,630
Hyeong Joon: I can only blame myself for being negative.

733
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:47,670
Hyeong Joon: My reaction style was a bit disappointing.

734
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:52,850
Hyeong Joon: I can't wait forever. I'm not the type to wait.

735
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:57,190
Hyeong Joon: Anyway I think I've tried my best to get close to you.

736
00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:00,740
At least you can get close to me once.

737
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:07,060
At least once, I hope.

738
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:10,730
Min Seong: Yes, come to think about it, you are right.

739
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:13,390
Min Seong: Actually, I can approach you.

740
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:15,970
Min Seong: There must have been a chance that I could get close to you.

741
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:19,330
Min Seong: But I never thought about it.

742
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,980
I was too selfish.

743
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:29,350
Min Seong: Why have I never thought of it?

744
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:31,520
Min Seong: Why didn't I act like that?

745
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:36,080
Min Seong: Well, I feel like my head was suddenly punched.

746
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:42,250
Hyeong Joon: As long as you think it's good.

747
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:44,610
Hyeong Joon: It's right to do what you want.

748
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:53,110
Yes.

749
00:39:53,860 --> 00:40:01,820
Hyeong Joon: But to be honest,

750
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,800
I want to protect myself now.

751
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:20,910
Hyeong Joon: Normally Min Seong doesn't show his emotions much,

752
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:22,590
Hyeong Joon: but why did he cry?

753
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,120
Hyeong Joon: I almost cried, too.

754
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,740
(Hyeong Joon: Almost, but I held it back)
Almost, but I held it back.

755
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:33,480
(Hyeong Joon: Almost, but I held it back)

756
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,320
Hyeong Joon: Because I didn't want to cry in front of Min Seong.

757
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,850
Min Seong: Think about it.

758
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:47,470
Min Seong: I was the one who slacked off.

759
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:50,780
Min Seong: I just gave you some cookies.

760
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:54,920
Min Seong: And I thought that I had shown my feelings for you by doing that.

761
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:58,120
Min Seong: I slacked off.

762
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:01,520
Min Seong: I didn't do well enough.

763
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:09,040
When I think about this,

764
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:18,550
(Min Seong can't continue)

765
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,400
really…

766
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:29,730
(Looking at Min Seong crying, Hyeong Joon holds back his tears)

767
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:42,820
Hyeong Joon: I didn't expect this to happen.

768
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:47,590
Min Seong: Really, I've never cried because of love issues.

769
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:50,540
Min Seong: I never cried because of the problems with my lover.

770
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:53,160
Min Seong: I didn't expect I would cry like this after I came here.

771
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:57,180
Min Seong: I really feel…

772
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,820
I'm very grateful.

773
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,940
Min Seong: What am I?

774
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:06,340
Min Seong: To be honest, what am I?

775
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:10,670
You're handsome.

776
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,360
And kind.

777
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:23,770
Hyeong Joon: You're handsome.

778
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:31,160
Min Seong: Ah, I can't control it.

779
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:38,630
Min Seong: I couln't control my emotions to continue our conversation.

780
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:42,710
Min Seong: I just felt my mind was totally blank. I really couln't remember anything.

781
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:51,060
Let's go fishing next time.

782
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:53,780
-What?
-Next time.

783
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:59,120
Min Seong: Go fishing? Okay.

784
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,030
Min Seong: Fishing is good.

785
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:05,150
Hyeong Joon: Next time.

786
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:30,750
Hyeong Joon: Anything else you want to say?

787
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,460
Min Seong: Ah. My mind is blank again.

788
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:47,570
-Hyeong Joon: See you at home later.
-Min Seong: Are you leaving?

789
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:52,210
-Min Seong: Okay, I see.
-See you later.

790
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:56,650
Hyeong Joon: Stop crying. Okay?

791
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:58,670
(Nodding)

792
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:02,990
Min Seong: Take care. See you later.

793
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:07,090
(Hyeong Joon leaves his seat first)

794
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:18,840
Hyeong Joon: If I keep looking at his face, I feel like crying.

795
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,320
Hyeong Joon: So I came out quickly.

796
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:27,780
Min Seong: My heart aches. I heard a lot from him.

797
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:30,240
Min Seong: I really feel sorry.

798
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,960
Min Seong: I don't know why I can't say anything

799
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,440
Min Seong: except sorry.

800
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:42,220
And I'm very grateful to him.

801
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,090
(After the conversation between the two men is over)

802
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:58,660
Hyeong Joon: I've said everything.

803
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:04,560
Hyeong Joon: "Now I've sorted it out."

804
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,660
Hyeong Joon: Or "The problems that have bothered me have been solved."

805
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,870
Hyeong Joon: "Now I can focus on you."

806
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:11,340
Hyeong Joon: I actually hoped he could say something like that.

807
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:15,380
Hyeong Joon: I don't know what Min Seong is thinking.

808
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:20,950
Hyeong Joon: Min Seong is hard to see through. You can't see him clearly.

809
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:30,150
Min Seong: In such a situation, it's torturing.

810
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:33,530
Min Seong: It's tiring to sort my thoughts out.

811
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,660
I seem to have made up my mind after the conversation.

812
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:43,560
(How will the conversations affect their feelings?)

813
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:45,390
(Seon Woo: I'm starving from waiting for Hyeong Joon and Min Seong, so let's eat first)

814
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:48,240
I'm starving from waiting for Hyeong Joon and Min Seong, so let's eat first.
(Seon Woo: I'm starving from waiting for Hyeong Joon and Min Seong, so let's eat first)

815
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,480
Seon Woo: Should we wake Hyeong Jin up?

816
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,180
Yung Hee: Oh, right. Hyeong Jin is still asleep, right?

817
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:55,560
(Knocking)

818
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:58,900
Yung Hee: Hyeong Jin, time to eat.

819
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:01,430
Yung Hee: Dinner is ready. No need to rush though.

820
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:03,400
-Hyeong Jin: Are we having dinner now?
-We're about to serve it.

821
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:12,590
Seong Ho: Come here and eat.

822
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,700
-Seon Woo: Let's eat.
-Thank you.

823
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:15,720
-Yung Hee: I'll enjoy it.
-Thank you.

824
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:16,990
-Thank you. -Here.

825
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,320
(The last dinner in Men's House)

826
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,650
Delicious.
(The last dinner in Men's House)

827
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:21,310
(The last dinner in Men's House)

828
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:22,670
Yes, it's good.
(The last dinner in Men's House)

829
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:23,800
Yes, it's good.

830
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:26,400
Chung-ook: I'm glad you like it.

831
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,210
Do you want snacks after eating this?

832
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:27,420
(Jun Seong: Hyeong Joon and Min Seong come back so late)
Do you want snacks after eating this?

833
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:28,940
They come back so late.
(Jun Seong: Hyeong Joon and Min Seong come back so late)

834
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:30,940
Seong Ho: Yeah. What are they doing?

835
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:32,880
Seong Ho: Did they make a match?

836
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:35,450
Did they make a match?

837
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,140
Seon Woo: You went out too, right?

838
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:40,020
-Hyung Jin: Yes, I went out.
-Seon Woo: Who did you meet?

839
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:43,260
Hyeong Jin: Min Seong and Hyeong Joon.

840
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:44,930
-Hyeong Jin: Both of them.
-Oh, yeah?

841
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:48,880
-Hurry up and come here.
-I think it's good.

842
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:49,600
Let's clean up.

843
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,140
-Okay. -Thank you.

844
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:53,470
Yung Hee: Oh, you're back.

845
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:54,140
-Hello. -What?

846
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:55,090
Seong Ho: Why are you back so late?

847
00:46:55,090 --> 00:46:57,640
-Jun Seong: Dinner was just over.
-Hyeong Joon: I didn't know I'd be so late.

848
00:46:58,110 --> 00:46:59,120
(He leaves quickly)

849
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:01,380
-Hyeong Joon: I'll go get changed.
-Seon Woo: Okay.

850
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:13,790
(Sigh)

851
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:37,250
(He has such mixed feelings that it's hard to calm down)

852
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:58,320
(Taking out the memories with Min Seong again)

853
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:33,480
(He tries to get everything back to the original state, but it's not easy)

854
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:01,650
(Min Seong comes back to Men's House)

855
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:02,650
Who is it?
(Min Seong comes back to Men's House)

856
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:03,280
Not bad.
(Min Seong comes back to Men's House)

857
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,370
-Have you had dinner? -Hello.
(Min Seong comes back to Men's House)

858
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:05,010
-How about putting this on top? -Okay.
(Min Seong comes back to Men's House)

859
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:06,070
-How about putting this on top? -Okay.

860
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:09,300
Hyeong Jin: Are you done?

861
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:10,110
(Nodding)
Hyeong Jin: Are you done?

862
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:10,850
(Nodding)

863
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:15,430
Min Seong: The maids are doing the dishes again.

864
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:17,280
Hyeong Jin: I've been doing the dishes all day long.

865
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:44,280
(Hyeong Joon has been looking at Min Seong's room)

866
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:15,400
(After the conversations, the three men meet for the first time)

867
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:19,000
-What? -Just do it all.

868
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,100
Yes, all of them.

869
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:22,470
It should be cooked inside.

870
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,230
Min Seong: Well, I have to act as if nothing happened.

871
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:27,840
Min Seong: That was my plan.

872
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:30,680
Min Seong: But I couldn't do that after seeing him.

873
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:33,010
Hyeong Jin: Did you cry?

874
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:34,470
-Did you cry? -No.

875
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:35,940
Hyeong Jin: No?

876
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:38,200
-Hyeong Jin: Did you cry?
-Min Seong: No.

877
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:40,950
Min Seong: Why do you ask me if I cried?

878
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:42,720
Hyeong Jin: Because I feel that you've cried.

879
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,310
-Hyeong Jin: You really didn't cry?
-Min Seong: Mmm.

880
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:47,670
(Hyeong Joon watched Min Seong and Hyeong Jin together)

881
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:48,780
What?
(Hyeong Joon watched Min Seong and Hyeong Jin together)

882
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:49,690
(Hyeong Joon watched Min Seong and Hyeong Jin together)

883
00:50:49,690 --> 00:50:50,610
What?
(Hyeong Joon watched Min Seong and Hyeong Jin together)

884
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:51,460
(Hyeong Joon watched Min Seong and Hyeong Jin together)

885
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:56,060
Hyeong Jin: When we eat, should I stay next to you or avoid you?

886
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:58,960
-Min Seong: "When we eat?" Have you eaten?
-Hyeong Jin: I have.

887
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:04,000
Min Seong: Then am I going to eat alone?

888
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:05,500
Hyeong Jin: You can eat with Hyeong Joon.

889
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:06,230
(Min Seong: Mmm)
Hyeong Jin: You can eat with Hyeong Joon.

890
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:06,840
(Min Seong: Mmm)

891
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,270
Min Seong: Then we'll eat together.

892
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:12,570
Hyeong Jin: Let's go back. It's cold.

893
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:14,470
-Min Seong: I'll go back then.
-OK.

894
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:22,200
Hyeong Joon: Min Seong, aren't you hungry?

895
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,290
-Min Seong: I need to eat.
-Hyeong Joon: OK. Come here.

896
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:25,630
Come here.

897
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:30,950
Seong Ho: I left around 2:30. I came back at 3 p.m.

898
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:33,290
-Hyeong Joon: Why did you go out?
-Seong Ho: For the conversations.

899
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:36,300
-With whom?
-Seong Ho: Someone wants to talk to me, right?

900
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:37,210
Hyeong Joon: Who did you talk to? Alone?

901
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:38,790
-Seong Ho: With Seon Woo.
-Hyeong Joon: Monologue?

902
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:43,860
-Hyeong Jin: Enjoy your meal.
-Min Seong: Okay, thank you.

903
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,850
Really? Are you kidding?

904
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:51,390
-Min Seong: Come here quickly.
-No. I like it.

905
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:54,070
-Min Seong: Let's eat.
-It must be delicious.

906
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:56,280
Just boil the coffee, right?

907
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:07,680
-Min Seong: The food is so good.
-Hyeong Joon: What?

908
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:09,720
Min Seong: The food is delicious.

909
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:11,610
(Keep eating in silence)

910
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:12,720
But it should be delicious.
(Keep eating in silence)

911
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,920
(Keep eating in silence)

912
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:19,530
(Turning around)

913
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:22,830
Come here.

914
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:24,940
-Min Seong: Aren't you cold?
-Hyeong Jin: I'm cold.

915
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:27,600
-Min Seong: You're walking around with a half-sleeved shirt.
-Is it good?

916
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:36,960
(Paying attention)

917
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,260
What? Is there something on my face?
(Paying attention)

918
00:52:38,910 --> 00:52:41,380
Hyeong Jin: I want to talk to you after dinner.

919
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:43,240
-Right now it's the same.
-Hyeong Joon: What is it?

920
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:46,160
So…

921
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:47,260
Come to my room.

922
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:50,360
Hyeong Jin: I'll go back to my room. Take your time.

923
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,620
Go to YouTube to look for the video and try it.

924
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:56,600
-It's my first time. -Really?

925
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:06,470
Min Seong: Are you done?

926
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:10,880
Chung-ook: Lentils will make you feel so full.

927
00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:12,510
You'd feel very full after eating those.

928
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:14,890
I feel full soon. You're right.

929
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:16,270
You ate too fast.

930
00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:20,590
Hyeong Joon: I'm leaving. Thank you.

931
00:53:20,590 --> 00:53:21,610
Min Seong: OK.

932
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,100
Hyeong Jin: I'll get you a chair.

933
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:27,470
Hyeong Joon: No need.

934
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:30,800
Hyeong Joon: What do you want to talk about?

935
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,380
Hyeong Jin: Nothing.

936
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:34,010
Hyeong Joon: If it's nothing, why did you ask me to come?

937
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:36,450
Hyeong Jin: It's not completely nothing.

938
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:39,150
Hyeong Jin: I just want to be honest with you.

939
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:41,190
Hyeong Jin: I learned something I didn't know.

940
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:43,070
Hyeong Jin: I feel sorry.

941
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:48,440
Hyeong Jin: Let's start with the conclusion.

942
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:52,710
Hyeong Jin: I think I should tell you.

943
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:59,040
I start to think that I should quit.

944
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,140
That would be...

945
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:05,310
Hyeong Jin: But I know what you want to say.

946
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:09,360
Hyeong Joon: Anyway, I've talked to Min Seong and to you.

947
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:12,210
It has been overturned.

948
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:15,790
Hyeong Jin: I really don't know. I've been struggling too.

949
00:54:15,790 --> 00:54:19,800
Hyeong Jin: Because it's also very rude to you.

950
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,580
-Hyeong Joon: But...
-After that...

951
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:22,140
You're such a fool.

952
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:26,490
I don't know. I'm torn.

953
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:29,010
(Hyeong Jin wants to solve this complicated situation no matter what)
I don't know. I'm torn.

954
00:54:29,010 --> 00:54:30,300
I just...
(Hyeong Jin wants to solve this complicated situation no matter what)

955
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:31,870
(Hyeong Jin wants to solve this complicated situation no matter what)

956
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:35,220
Anyway, I...

957
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:37,540
Hyeong Joon: Anyway, we had a good chat just now.

958
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:40,250
Hyeong Joon: What we're saying now is because…

959
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:41,800
you and I...

960
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,960
Hyeong Joon: I feel burdened too. Min Seong must be burdened too.

961
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:47,530
Hyeong Joon: You feel burdened too, so anyway,

962
00:54:47,530 --> 00:54:49,580
Hyeong Joon: I'll pretend I didn't hear it.

963
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:52,940
Hyeong Joon: Don't worry about it. I know you had no choice.

964
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:56,760
Hyeong Joon: Got it? Don't be too upset about this.

965
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:57,810
Hyeong Joon: You fool.

966
00:54:57,810 --> 00:54:59,270
Okay, got it. Stop.

967
00:54:59,270 --> 00:54:59,770
Courage.

968
00:54:59,770 --> 00:55:00,180
(Hyeong Jin finished the conversation in a hurry)
Courage.

969
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:03,090
Let's get back to our own business.
(Hyeong Jin finished the conversation in a hurry)

970
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:04,740
Hyeong Joon: Thank you for your courage.

971
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:06,320
Hyeong Jin: No, go.

972
00:55:19,770 --> 00:55:23,720
Hyeong Jin: I don't want to see Min Seong being torn.

973
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:27,600
Hyeong Jin: In the end, my energy is all drained too.

974
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:32,480
Hyeong Jin: No matter what it is, I put everything down.

975
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:40,650
Yung Hee: Let's take a photo. There will only be photos left.

976
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:42,870
One, two, three.

977
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:46,770
Are you impatient?

978
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:48,580
Hyeong Joon: Do you want to hear the truth?

979
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:48,790
(Quarreling)
Hyeong Joon: Do you want to hear the truth?

980
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:49,660
Go upstairs.
(Quarreling)

981
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:50,560
Go upstairs.

982
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:52,390
Yung Hee: But why aren't we in our room?

983
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:54,610
-Yung Hee: All of us are here.
-Hyeong Joon: Yeah.

984
00:55:55,930 --> 00:55:57,610
-We're all here.
-Suddenly it's getting annoying.

985
00:55:57,610 --> 00:55:59,690
Chung-ook: Let's take a photo together.

986
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:00,650
OK. Let's take a photo together.

987
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:02,140
Chung-ook: Let's take a picture together. All the roommates of the quadruple room.

988
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:03,210
I'll sit here.

989
00:56:05,110 --> 00:56:06,300
Sit like this.

990
00:56:07,510 --> 00:56:08,650
Quadruple Room Forever!

991
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:10,740
(Click)

992
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:13,380
-Yung Hee: Take the photo after counting down.
-Can you do this or not?

993
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:15,460
Why are you so surprised?

994
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:17,380
-Did you do it on purpose?
-I told you it was a public persona.

995
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:18,780
-Let's take another one.
-Let's take another one.

996
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:21,350
Hyeong Joon: I forced a smile. I tried to pull myself together.

997
00:56:21,350 --> 00:56:25,510
Hyeong Joon: I want to smile more and play with everyone.

998
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:27,350
Hyeong Joon: I don't want to think about anything.

999
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:30,330
Hyeong Joon: That's why I did it on purpose.

1000
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:31,930
This is mine.

1001
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:34,810
Hyeong Joon: What is Hyeong Jin doing? Why hasn't he come out yet?

1002
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:35,400
Yung Hee: He's lying in his bed.

1003
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,140
-Hyeong Joon: Lying? He doesn't want to come out?
-Hung Hee: He's not in a good state.

1004
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:37,840
He doesn't want to come out?

1005
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:40,350
Yung Hee: No. He just saw us all here. He didn't come out.

1006
00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:41,630
Hyeong Joon: Why not?

1007
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:45,140
Hung Hee: Looks like he's in a bad mood.

1008
00:56:46,330 --> 00:56:48,260
Hyeong Joon: There's no normal person here.

1009
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:50,970
Yung Hee: Looks like he's in a bad mood. His expression has been…

1010
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:53,750
Jun Seong: I understand.

1011
00:56:54,450 --> 00:56:57,750
(It's time for voice messages)

1012
00:56:58,970 --> 00:57:03,900
(The last chance to confess your love)

1013
00:57:05,070 --> 00:57:06,400
Seong Ho: How are you today?

1014
00:57:07,310 --> 00:57:11,880
Min Seong: I learned something I didn't know.

1015
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,790
Min Seong: It knocked me down.

1016
00:57:13,790 --> 00:57:14,850
Seong Ho: Did you talk to them?

1017
00:57:14,850 --> 00:57:16,210
Min Seong: Yes, I did.

1018
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:16,930
Seong Ho: Who?

1019
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:23,430
Min Seong: Hyeong Joon hit me with something. I cried out suddenly.

1020
00:57:24,590 --> 00:57:27,360
Min Seong: Because I didn't expect that.

1021
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,860
Min Seong: I asked him

1022
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:31,770
Min Seong: why your attitude seems to be changing bit by bit.

1023
00:57:31,770 --> 00:57:34,570
Min Seong: Did I do something wrong?

1024
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:40,840
Min Seong: He said he was waiting for me.

1025
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:44,360
Seong Ho: Why am I crying? It's so easy for me to cry.

1026
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:45,480
Seong Ho: I'm about to cry.

1027
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:48,560
Min Seong: The moment I heard that, I was like being hit.

1028
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:52,650
Min Seong: Before that, I had been holding back my tears.

1029
00:57:52,650 --> 00:57:54,500
Min Seong: After hearing that, I couldn't stop my tears.

1030
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:56,550
Min Seong: I didn't want him to see me cry. And I kept my head up like this.

1031
00:57:56,550 --> 00:57:59,030
Min Seong: Tears streamed down from both sides.

1032
00:58:00,890 --> 00:58:04,120
Min Seong: I feel so sorry.

1033
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,820
Min Seong: After I came here, it was my first time to be liked by so many people.

1034
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:09,670
Min Seong: I was very happy. But now I don't understand.

1035
00:58:09,670 --> 00:58:11,890
Min Seong: I don't know if I deserve it.

1036
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:16,620
Min Seong: I feel when I compare them, I'm such a bad person.

1037
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:19,190
Min Seong: That's what I said, but after hearing that, he said, "No,

1038
00:58:19,190 --> 00:58:22,930
Min Seong: you did nothing wrong. I feel so sorry for you."

1039
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:23,890
Really?

1040
00:58:23,890 --> 00:58:27,840
Min Seong: He told me not to cry. But he couldn't help crying himself.

1041
00:58:28,230 --> 00:58:30,000
(Ah...)

1042
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:32,130
Seong Ho: Are you going to cry?

1043
00:58:32,390 --> 00:58:33,610
Seong Ho: I'm gonna cry, too.

1044
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,770
I feel so sorry.

1045
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:51,240
Min Seong: It was so shocking.

1046
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:04,950
Min Seong: I don't know if it's the right way

1047
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:06,170
Min Seong: to express my feelings with this message.

1048
00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:08,940
Seong Ho: Is it better to use the chance to say something you couldn't say before?

1049
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:09,950
Seong Ho: Are you struggling with these two options?

1050
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:10,970
Min Seong: Yes.

1051
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:15,140
Min Seong: What if I cry when I make the call later?

1052
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:17,170
Seong Ho: It's OK to cry.

1053
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:19,790
Min Seong: Why can't I stop crying?

1054
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:22,520
Seong Ho: Right? Why are we so fragile?

1055
00:59:23,170 --> 00:59:25,280
Min Seong: I cried so hard just now.

1056
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:28,340
Seong Ho: Were you very sad?

1057
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:30,120
-What? -Were you very sad?

1058
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:32,740
-Min Seong: I just feel sorry
-I would feel the same.

1059
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:34,280
-after hearing his words.
-Seong Ho: If I were you, I'd feel the same.

1060
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:38,280
Seong Ho: Just see it as we're comforting each other,

1061
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:39,840
Yes.

1062
00:59:40,690 --> 00:59:42,260
Seong Ho: It doesn't help much though.

1063
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:46,300
Min Seong: We have to make a decision no matter what.

1064
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:48,120
-Yes.
-Min Seong: You have to make a decision.

1065
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:53,440
Seong Ho: Just follow your heart.

1066
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:53,710
(Seong Ho, please go to the phone booth to express your feelings to someone you like for the last time)
Seong Ho: Just follow your heart.

1067
00:59:53,710 --> 00:59:55,280
(Seong Ho, please go to the phone booth to express your feelings to someone you like for the last time)

1068
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,370
Bye.
(Seong Ho, please go to the phone booth to express your feelings to someone you like for the last time)

1069
00:59:57,470 --> 00:59:58,950
-Seong Ho: I'm going. -Bye.

1070
00:59:58,950 --> 00:59:59,910
Min Seong: I need to take some tissues with me.

1071
00:59:59,910 --> 01:00:01,690
Seong Ho: Don't cry.

1072
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:09,820
(Last night, last confession)

1073
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:20,680
(Whom will the men deliver their feelings to?)

1074
01:00:22,110 --> 01:00:26,750
(Leave the last voice message with sincerity)

1075
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:34,680
Min Seong: First, I don't know what to say.

1076
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:40,820
Jun Seong: Since we first met, it's been a week.

1077
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:46,550
Seong Ho: Since a few days ago, I've been thinking a lot about you.

1078
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:49,770
Seon Woo: I don't know

1079
01:00:49,770 --> 01:00:52,120
Seon Woo: what impressions my feelings will leave in your heart.

1080
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:55,140
Hyeong Jin: I just hope you won't be too sad.

1081
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:59,090
Yung Hee: Thanks to you, I've learned a lot and accumulated good memories.

1082
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:01,090
Yung Hee: Thank you very much.

1083
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:14,190
(Men's last confession with sincerity)

1084
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:20,250
(Whom will the men deliver their feelings to?)

1085
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:30,040
(Hyeong Joon can't sleep and comes to the living room)

1086
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:38,890
(Word by word, he writes a letter by hand sincerely)

1087
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:47,010
(Who is it for?)

1088
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:52,070
Hyeong Joon: It's for Min Seong.

1089
01:01:54,030 --> 01:01:55,840
Seon Woo: I'll give it to Min Seong.

1090
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:57,670
Hyeong Joon: He should be able to see it, right?

1091
01:01:58,870 --> 01:02:01,550
Without food, I'm hungry.

1092
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:03,780
Hyeong Joon: Why do the cookies have to appear in the song?

1093
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:05,430
Even without drinks…

1094
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:12,710
(Hyeong Joon left a letter and a photo for Min Seong)

1095
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:24,820
(Min Seong returns to his room and sees the letter)

1096
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:44,660
(What did Hyeong Joon write in the letter?)
