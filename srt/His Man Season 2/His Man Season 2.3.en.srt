38
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,910
Seong Ho: I was very depressed in the house just now.

39
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:44,690
Hyeong Joon: Because you were alone?

40
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,729

Seong Ho: Yes.

44
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,640
Hyeong Joon: But I was paying attention to your reaction.

45
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,600
Hyeong Joon: I couldn't tell that you were surprised at all.

46
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,830
Seong Ho: Maybe it's because I wasn't expecting anything.

47
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:10,490
-That's why... -Yes, just like...

48
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:13,640
Seong Ho: "Maybe I won't go on a date today."

49
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,240
Seong Ho: I was thinking about it at that time.

50
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,340
Seong Ho: To be more precise than not being surprised, I didn't have the energy to think about other things.

51
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,460
Seong Ho: I thought I was supposed to guard the house today, just like a dog.

52
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,470
Hyeong Joon: Put it nicely. You're not just a dog. You're more like a schnauzer.

53
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,560
-Me? -No. I don't know if it's because of your hair.

54

Seong Ho: What do you think it is?

59
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:43,150
Hyeong Joon: Let me guess. But you have to give me some hints.

60
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,130
-Hints? -Yes.

61
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,070
Hyeong Joon: Do you prefer staying at home or…

62
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:48,030
Seong Ho: Oh. It's almost telling you the answer directly.

63
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:51,870
Hyeong Joon: No. You can't think of it that way.

64
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,070
Hyeong Joon: Although I and E represent introverts and extroverts...

65
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,610
-Maybe... -Seong Ho: Or after more communication...

66

171
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,200
Seong Ho: I gave you the coupon. It should be me to decide how to use it.

172
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,909
Seong Ho: It's boring if you drag it for too long.

173
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:35,530
OK.

174
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,190
(Looking around)

175
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,640
Seong Ho: What?

176
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,590
Hyeong Joon: The camera.

177
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,450
Hyeong Joon: We didn't take any food photos.

178
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:45,770
Seong Ho: Do you want to take a photo of this? The meat?

179
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,240
Hyeong Joon: When we go back, we can show off, telling them we had a barbecue today.

180

192
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,660
Hyeong Joon: This button?

193
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,930
Seong Ho: This one is the shutter. The one in front.

194
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,710
One, two, three.

195
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,830
-Seong Ho: You have to stay still like this. -Hyeong Joon: Really?

196
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,690
Seong Ho: I don't know very well either. But I'm afraid the picture will blur.

197
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:36,890
(Seong Ho: Let's check the photos after finishing eating)

198

(Seong Ho: Let's check the photos after finishing eating)

199
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,000

I prefer it blurred.

203
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:53,210
Hyeong Joon: I like the fact that we have the same MBTI.

204
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:57,940
Hyeong Joon: No matter what I said, he could relate to it.

205
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,159
Hyeong Joon: He could understand it.

206
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:02,380
Hyeong Joon: So, I think we can understand each other well.

207
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,100

210
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:14,390
Hyeong Joon: I'm thinking about what wish I should make.

211
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:17,980
Seong Ho: It can't be weird. Anyway, just make a wish.

212
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,630
Hyeong Joon: For example...

213
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:28,530
Hyeong Joon: I don't want zero votes. So, I want your vote.

214
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,080
Seong Ho: Look at you.

215
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,890
Seong Ho: Are you crazy?

216
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:38,760
Hyeong Joon: What? I won this wish.

217
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,309
Hyeong Joon: Then I'll make another wish.

218
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:44,960
Hyeong Joon: Then be my servant.

219
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,170
Seong Ho: What do you mean?

220
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:49,820
Hyeong Joon: Poor water. Pour water. *Hyeong Joon mispronounced.

221
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,840
Hyeong Joon: The servant who pours water.

222
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,520
-Servant. -Servant.

223
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,380
Let's use all the films today.

224
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,240
Seong Ho: You mean it? You want me to pour you water?

225
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,230
-Yes, something like a servant. -It's easy.

Hyeong Joon: Before midnight, pour me water every time I feel thirsty.

231
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,670
It's good.

232
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:12,560
Hyeong Joon: You know, something like expressing emotions.

233
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,120
Seong Ho: Well, you compare expressing feelings to things that a servant does?

234
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,260
Hyeong Joon: Because I express my feelings for my friends in a very intense way.

235
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,020
Hyeong Joon: I'll express my feelings to you like a servant.

(Satisfied)

242
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,500
Seong Ho: But I can't remember people's names. That's a big problem.

243
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,720
Hyeong Joon: I'll tell you the initial of my name.

244
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,650
Hyeong Joon: You don't even know my surname, do you?

245
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,320
Seong Ho: No, after we go back...

You noticed it just now. It's too late.

253
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,270
You should've done it for me earlier.

254
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,650

Seong Ho: I was at a loss at that time.

258
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:07,060
Seong Ho: I only heard his name once.

259
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,190
Seong Ho: I didn't remember it.

260
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,930
Seong Ho: I kept asking him. But he wouldn't tell me.

261
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:15,520
Seong Ho: So, during the whole date, I called him Mr. Hyung.

262

00:11:58,810 --> 00:11:59,700
(Hyeong Joon: That's the right way to describe it)
When my blood sugar is low. That's the right way to describe it.

314
00:11:59,700 --> 00:11:59,710
Seong Ho: So, only when you're working.
(Hyeong Joon: That's the right way to describe it)
When my blood sugar is low. That's the right way to describe it.

315
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:02,150
Seong Ho: So, only when you're working.

316
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,680
That's right.

317
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,720
Hyeong Joon: I don't crave sweets. Even when I have sweets, the nut is my only go-to.

318
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,180
(They start to know about each other's preferences bit by bit)
Hyeong Joon: I don't crave sweets. Even when I have sweets, the nut is my only go-to.

319
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,410
(They start to know about each other's preferences bit by bit)

320
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,540
I love it.
(They start to know about each other's preferences bit by bit)

321
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,750
Seong Ho: Like the couple's foot bath...

322
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,850
Seong Ho: Have you ever tried anything that couples often do together?

323
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,340
Or any place where couples usually go together?

324
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,680
Hyeong Joon: When I went out to have fun...

325
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,340
Hyeong Joon: I can't recall any now.

326
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,750
Hyeong Joon: I think I've tried.

327
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,420
Hyeong Joon: Oh, I haven't been using the respectful form.

328
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,760
Hyeong Joon: I'm sorry.

329
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:31,700
Hyeong Joon: I may be older than you. Maybe younger, right?

330
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,040
Seong Ho: But I also used the casual form from time to time.

331
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,170
-Seong Ho: I felt more comfortable that way. -Hyeong Joon: I know.

332
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:38,150
Seong Ho: Take a picture of our feet.

333
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:43,090
(Very satisfied)

334
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,490
It's cute.
(Very satisfied)

335
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:45,440
(Very satisfied)

336
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,460
Seong Ho: We are taking pictures of our feet instead of our faces now.

337
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,250
Seong Ho: Do you want to take a photo of our faces?

338
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:57,250
Hyeong Joon: I'll hold the camera.

339
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,250
(The two are getting closer)

340
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,450
Make a nice facial expression.
(The two are getting closer)

341
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:06,640
(The two are getting closer)

342
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:11,280
One. Be natural. One, two, three.

343
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:16,500
Seong Ho: I'm afraid that we might look cockeyed in the picture.

344
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,640
Seong Ho: Don't tell me neither of us is on it.

345
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,830
What should we do if that's the case?

346
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:23,190
Tilt your head to the other side.

347
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:25,620
(Out of pity, they try another angle)
Tilt your head to the other side.

348
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,950
-This way. -Yes. One, two, three.
(Out of pity, they try another angle)

349
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:30,500
-This way. -Yes. One, two, three.

350
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,590
Seong Ho: I told you not to move.

351
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,770
I didn't move.

352
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,040
(Noticed the expression in the photo)

353
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,790
(Satisfied)

354
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:43,530
(Seong Ho: What's the date today?)
(Hyeong Joon: 13th)

355
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:44,420
What's the date today?
(Seong Ho: What's the date today?)
(Hyeong Joon: 13th)

356
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,070
-13th. -13th?
(Seong Ho: What's the date today?)
(Hyeong Joon: 13th)

357
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:51,150
Seong Ho: Is there anything about the photo that you don't like?

358
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:53,630
Seong Ho: Let me help you touch it up.

359
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:56,220
Hyeong Joon: I want to draw a mole under my left eye.

360
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,790
-Here? -No, it's too big.

361
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,540
No, I'll draw it carefully.

362
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,250
Hyeong Joon: I'm really happy.

363
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,370
Well...

364
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,930
Hyeong Joon: Well, we two can understand each other.

365
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,480
Hyeong Joon: The chemistry between us is good.

366
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,500
Hyeong Joon: Everything we did together was fun.

367
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,150
Seong Ho: I have feelings for him. I'm happy.

368
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:20,580
Seong Ho: Actually, this whole day, I thought of Seon Woo a lot.

369
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,590
He and the new guy, Hyeong Jin.

370
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:25,740
(Seong Ho: Has he got closer to Hyeong Jin?)
He and the new guy, Hyeong Jin.

371
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,950
Have they got closer?
(Seong Ho: Has he got closer to Hyeong Jin?)

372
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,890
Seong Ho: I thought about this.

373
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,640
(After the date, Jun Seong and Min Seong come back)

374
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,600
Please open the door for me.
(After the date, Jun Seong and Min Seong come back)

375
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,350
What should I do?

376
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,190
(Two handfuls of things)

377
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,620
-Min Seong: Nobody came back? -Jun Seong: We're back.

378
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,930
We're back.

379
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,070
(It's very quiet in the house)

380
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,630
-Jun Seong: No one is here. -Min Seong: None?

381
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,290
Jun Seong: Go check the second floor. I'll go after I take off my jacket.

382
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,510
(Biscuit and Diet Coke)

383
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,980
(He stuffed it casually)

384
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:37,390
(Meanwhile, Min Seong comes to see whether there's anyone on the second floor)

385
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,710
Hello?

386
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,890
Min Seong: We are the first to come back.

387
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:46,330
-Oh, where's Seong Ho? -I was just wondering about it.

388
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:47,930
(Min Seong: Oh, where is Seong Ho?)

390
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:49,020
(Hesitant)
-Oh, where's Seong Ho? -I was just wondering about it.

391
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:49,960
(Hesitant)

392
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,230
(Min Seong noticed something)

393
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,930
(There's one more bed in Min Seong's single room)

394
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:03,830
(Calm)

395
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,160
-He came just this morning. -Yes.
(Calm)

396
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,030
Jun Seong: I'll go find my roommate.

397
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,430
Min Seong: I was a little confused.

398
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:13,340
Min Seong: Oh, he should be here. Why was he gone?

399
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:18,890
(Jun Seong goes around the house again, looking for Seong Ho)

400
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:22,300
Jun Seong: I was a little panicked.

401
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,530
Jun Seong: Where did he go?

402
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:25,760
(Jun Seong: I searched the whole house but I didn't find him)

403
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,870
I searched the whole house.
(Jun Seong: I searched the whole house but I didn't find him)

404
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,650
I did everything I could, but he wasn't there.
(Jun Seong: I searched the whole house but I didn't find him)

405
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:29,640
(Jun Seong: I searched the whole house but I didn't find him)

406
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:34,360
Jun Seong: What? What? I feel a chill down my spine.

407
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,480
Min Seong: What's wrong?

408
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,340
Jun Seong: Don't you feel a little scared?

409
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,810
Min Seong: Why should I?

410
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,230
Jun Seong: Why is no one here?

411
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,380
Jun Seong: There should be someone. But no one is here now.

412
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,000
(Peeking)

413
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,120
Jun Seong: Hold on. I'll buy some noodles.
(Peeking)

414
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,140
Jun Seong: Hold on. I'll buy some noodles.

415
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,890
Jun Seong: What's this?

416
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,170
Jun Seong: Hold on. I'll buy some noodles.

417
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,590
(Min Seong: Did the recorder write that?)
(Jun Seong: We have a recorder here?)
Did the recorder write that?

418
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,710
We have a recorder here?
(Min Seong: Did the recorder write that?)
(Jun Seong: We have a recorder here?)

419
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:59,370
-Yeah. -Really?

420
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:00,870
(Jun Seong: Really?)
-Yeah. -Really?

421
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:02,930
Min Seong: He said he wanted to be the recorder.

422
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,859
-Jun Seong: Seong Ho? -Min Seong: No.

423
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,780
-Min Seong: Seon Woo. -Jun Seong: Ah. Really?

424
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,530
He wrote this, so he probably wrote this too.

425
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,430
Jun Seong: Well, it's so boring.

426
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:18,589
(Hold on. I'll buy some noodles!)
(Seon Woo's message)

427
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:19,480
I'm so confused.
(Hold on. I'll buy some noodles!)
(Seon Woo's message)

428
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:19,560
I'm so confused.

429
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,740
(Seon Woo's message and Seong Ho who disappeared)
I'm so confused.

430
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,859
(Seon Woo's message and Seong Ho who disappeared)

431
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:27,720
(Jun Seong: Seong Ho went out after styling his hair)

432
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,900
went out after styling his hair.
(Jun Seong: Seong Ho went out after styling his hair)

433
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,900
(Jun Seong: Seong Ho went out after styling his hair)

434
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:33,370
(Jun Seong: The hair dryer was still plugged in. The box of contact lenses was on the dresser)

435
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:35,850
The wire of the hair dryer is unfolded.
(Jun Seong: The hair dryer was still plugged in. The box of contact lenses was on the dresser)

436
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:39,280
The box of contact lenses was on the dresser.
(Jun Seong: The hair dryer was still plugged in. The box of contact lenses was on the dresser)

437
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,470
Jun Seong: I saw this scene.

438
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:44,290
"He went out to meet someone."

439
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:46,610
That came to my mind immediately.

440
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,010
Jun Seong: I felt a little upset.

441
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,660
Jun Seong: Who did he meet?

442
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:54,820
(Joon-sung: What if that person is Seong Ho?) What should I do about his type?
Jun Seong: Who did he meet?

443
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:58,910
What if that person is Seong Ho's type?
(Joon-sung: What if that person is Seong Ho?) What should I do about his type?

444
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:04,170
Jun Seong: That's what I was thinking about when I was sitting on the sofa.

445
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:08,560
Why isn't he here?

446
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,740
(Jun Seong: Why isn't Seong Ho here?)
Why isn't he here?

447
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,340
(Jun Seong: Why isn't Seong Ho here?)

448
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:11,270
-He went somewhere. -Probably.

449
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,270
(Min Seong: He went somewhere or met someone)
-He went somewhere. -Probably.

450
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:15,550
Or he met someone.
(Min Seong: He went somewhere or met someone)

451
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,790
Jun Seong: Maybe.

452
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,270
We're back.

453
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:19,360

457
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,040

458
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,830

(Seon Woo: No?)
-No? -Seong Ho isn't here.

485
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:06,260
Seon Woo: Maybe he's too small, so you didn't see him?

486
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:10,850
Jun Seong: No. He's not home.

487

Yes.

495
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,840
Jun Seong: He either went somewhere or met someone.

496
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,210
Min Seong: He might go out alone or with someone.

497
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,970
Seon Woo: Or he quit.

498
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:52,780
Jun Seong: You want him to quit, right?

499
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:52,790

Min Seong: I made that.

525
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:32,190
What is this?

526
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:32,790
What? What? What?

527
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:33,770
We made something too.

528
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:34,290
What is this?

529
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:35,480
Yung Hee: Did you make cakes?

A cup?

538
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,870
We made it for each other.

539
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:50,050
Yung Hee: Look, I made this for him.

540
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,710

541
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,540
Min Seong: Well done.

542
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,180

Chung-ook: No.

546
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,890
I didn't know.

547
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:02,790
Chung-ook: I was bragging about today's date.

548
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:09,840
Chung-ook: I was enjoying that feeling and that moment.

549
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,990
Chung-ook: So, I didn't notice it.

550
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,450
Seon Woo: Let's have dinner now.

551
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,650

Min Seong: Why all grey pants?

555
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,080
What?

556
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,040
Why all grey pants?

557
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,650
Gray pants.

558
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:34,140
Seon Woo: I thought I could avoid this today.

559
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:37,000
Seon Woo: We should sit side by side.

560
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,390
Men should wear grey sweatpants.

561
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:38,470

569
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,190

570
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:50,320
Unnatural.

Min Seong: No, we focused on making that.

575
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:02,630
Seon Woo: That?

576
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:07,060
Seon Woo: But Seong Ho hasn't come back yet.

577
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,590
Jun Seong: Yes.

578
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:17,370
Seon Woo: This is no longer necessary.

579
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:19,830

580
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:20,770
Min Seong: I bought noodles.

581

Min Seong: We'll eat them for supper.

584
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,210
Supper?

585

586
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:38,690
Seon Woo: I couldn't go out with Seong Ho.

587
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:42,700
Seon Woo: I wanted to say I should at least buy him some noodles.

Let's clean up the ingredients first.

606
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:32,590
Seon Woo: It's not helping. It's something you should do.

607
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:34,750
Gosh.

608

Chung-ook: First of all...

614
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,270
Should I open it?

615
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:48,750
OK.

616

(Chung-ook starts cooking in an orderly way)

618
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,810
There's no big plate here.

619

Hyeong Jin: Do you need me to set the tableware?

620

What? Did you get a text message?

1109
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:24,340
What does it say? None of us received it.
(Yung Hee: Did you get a text message? What does it say?)

1110
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:27,670
Hyeong Joon: They ask us to choose the room.

1111
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:27,970
(Yung Hee: How to choose?)

1112
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:28,940
-Wait a minute.
-How to choose?
(Yung Hee: How to choose?)

1113
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:29,490
Hyeong Joon: You can use a triple room on the third floor or a double room on the first floor.
(Yung Hee: How to choose?)

1114
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:32,350
Hyeong Joon: You can use a triple room on the third floor or a double room on the first floor.

1115
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:32,570
-Us. Us.
-The triple room.

1116
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:33,470
(Jung-wook: The triple room?)
(Yung Hee: It's our room)
-Us. Us.
-The triple room.

1117
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:34,830
It's our room.
(Jung-wook: The triple room?)
(Yung Hee: It's our room)

1118
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:35,330
Hyeong Joon: But I don't know what the room looks like.
(Jung-wook: The triple room?)
(Yung Hee: It's our room)

1119
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:36,990
Hyeong Joon: But I don't know what the room looks like.

1120
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:37,960
Let's go visit the rooms first.

1121
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,820
Seon Woo: You two go together.

1122
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:41,970
Yung Hee: The room for three is our room. I'll take you there.

1123
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:43,270
Seon Woo: So I'll be staying in the single room.

1124
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:44,190
I'll show you around my room.

1125
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:44,510
Let's follow them.

(Seon Woo: I want to stay here)

1129
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:50,240
Come with us.

1130
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,790
Min Seong: Twist, twist, twist.

1131
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:52,250
-What?
-Great.

1132

(Min Seong: Great)
(Chung-ook: What's so great?)

00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,200
What's so great?
(Min Seong: Great)
(Chung-ook: What's so great?)

1134
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:54,810

1135
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:58,340
-Where…
-Here. This is a double room.

Here, like this.
(Min Seong's room becomes a double room)

1138
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,570
Here, like this.

1139
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:00,630
And the third floor.

(Hyung-jun: There's a third floor?)
(Min Seong: The second floor)
And the third floor.

Go upstairs.
(Hyung-jun: There's a third floor?)

(Hyung-jun: There's a third floor?)
(Min Seong: The second floor)

1144
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:05,880
Hyeong Joon: Ah, a room for three on the second floor.

1145
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:11,570
Seon Woo: After disclosing our age and career,

1146
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:14,600
Seon Woo: I couldn't help feeling that everyone will be

1147
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:18,690
Seon Woo: much less curious about me. I don't feel good.

1148
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:32,960
Here?

1149
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,800
Our room.

1150
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,180
(Yung Hee and Chung-ook's room became a triple room)
Our room.

1151
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:35,930
It has changed.
(Yung Hee and Chung-ook's room became a triple room)

1152
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:37,590
Yes, it has.
(Yung Hee and Chung-ook's room became a triple room)

1153
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:37,630
That's my bed

1154
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:38,440
(Yung Hee's bed, Chung-ook's bed)
That's my bed

1155
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,410
Over there, does that mean two people will sleep together?
(Yung Hee's bed, Chung-ook's bed)

1156
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:41,180
This is Chung-ook's bed.
(Yung Hee's bed, Chung-ook's bed)

1157
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:43,680
Yung Hee: Maybe you need to sleep with me.

1158
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:45,510
Yung Hee: He looks unhappy.

1159
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:46,110
What should we do? Bet?

1160
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:46,870
(Yung Hee: Bet? Or what? About choosing the room)
What should we do? Bet?

1161
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:48,990
Or what? About choosing the room.
(Yung Hee: Bet? Or what? About choosing the room)

1162
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:50,870
Hyeong Joon: How?

1163
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:53,570
In this case,

1164
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:56,100
Hyeong Jin: Bro, which one do you want to live in?

1165
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,510
Hyeong Joon: I want to live on the first floor.

1166
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:05,080
Hyeong Joon: I hope there are fewer people. For now.

1167
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:07,990
I see.

1168
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:14,200
Hyeong Jin: You live on the first floor.

1169
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:14,230
(Hyeong Joon Why so sudden?)
(Hyeong Jin: I'm fine with anything)
Hyeong Jin: You live on the first floor.

1170
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:15,120
Hyeong Joon: Why so sudden?
(Hyeong Joon Why so sudden?)
(Hyeong Jin: I'm fine with anything)

1171
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,070
(Hyeong Joon Why so sudden?)
(Hyeong Jin: I'm fine with anything)

1172
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:17,080
Hyeong Jin: I'm fine with anything.
(Hyeong Joon Why so sudden?)
(Hyeong Jin: I'm fine with anything)

1173
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,460
-Really?
-Yes.
(Hyeong Joon Why so sudden?)
(Hyeong Jin: I'm fine with anything)

1174
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:20,400
-Min Seong: The first floor?
-Hyeong Joon: I live on the first floor.

1175
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,540
-Hyeong Joon: Who is my roommate?
-Min-seong: Me.

1176
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:22,860
-The first floor.
-Director.

1177
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:23,520
(Ah, director)
-The first floor.
-Director.

1178
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,460
Do you want to change?
(Ah, director)

1179
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:25,700
Seon Woo: You can change it.

1180
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:26,410
You don't know? You can change it.

1181
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:27,240
Are you really okay?

1182
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:31,030
Hyeong Jin: You're the last one. You can choose first.

1183
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:33,950
Seon Woo: Then someone will sleep on the same bed.

1184
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:35,380
-Yes.
-You two sleep together.

1185
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:37,200
Min Seong: Yes. So someone has to sleep on the same bed?

1186
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,830
Yung Hee: Yes. The pillows are on my bed together.

1187
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:42,110
Yung Hee: So we're gonna share a bed.

1188
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:50,960
(Yung Hee walks away after the room is assigned)

1189
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:00,510
Yung Hee: After the information was disclosed, I can't help but get confused.

1190
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:05,380
Yung Hee: To be honest, everyone has a stable job.

1191
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:07,500
Yung Hee: I'm the only one who doesn't.

1192
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:11,570
Yung Hee: I feel I'm lagging behind others.

1193
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:14,030
Yung Hee: I have mixed-feelings, so I want to be alone for a while.

1194
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,620
Seon Woo: I'll wash the dishes.

1195
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:22,980
Yung Hee: I'll do the dishes.

1196
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,340
Seon Woo: Let's do it together.

1197
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:25,530
Yung Hee: I'll wash the dishes.

1198
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:26,380
Seon Woo: Then you wipe it dry.

1199
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:27,780
-The game is a game.
-You can try them.

1200
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:29,750
Yung Hee: No, I'll do the dishes. You can dry them.

1201
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:30,960
OK.

1202
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,650
Yung Hee: I'll wash the dishes.

1203
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:37,570
Thank you.

1204
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:42,670
Put your arm down.

1205
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:44,100
Okay.

1206
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,490
Wait, let me get your hoodie.

1207
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:48,530
Yung Hee: My heart flutters

1208
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:51,640
Yung Hee: when I just put on the apron and was in a muddle,

1209
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:54,320
Yung Hee: and Seon Woo came to help me.

1210
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:55,500
(Seon Woo: How do you feel after the age is disclosed? And the occupation too, did anything change?)

1211
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:56,800
How do you feel after the age is disclosed?
(Seon Woo: How do you feel after the age is disclosed? And the occupation too, did anything change?)

1212
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:57,970
And the occupation too.
(Seon Woo: How do you feel after the age is disclosed? And the occupation too, did anything change?)

1213
00:44:57,970 --> 00:44:59,240
-After knowing about the age?
-Did anything change?
(Seon Woo: How do you feel after the age is disclosed? And the occupation too, did anything change?)

1214
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:02,230
Yung Hee: No. It's as I expected.

1215
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:05,330
Yung Hee: I didn't think about the occupations.

1216
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:06,300
Yung Hee: But I expected I should be the youngest.

1217
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,520
Right?

1218
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,630
Yes.

1219
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,590
Seon Woo: Did you also expect my age?

1220
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:14,450
Yung Hee: Age? I just thought you are all older than me.

1221
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:17,150
Yung Hee: judging from our chat or other things.

1222
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:18,530
Jun Seong: The youngest is great.

1223
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:19,240
Thank you.

1224
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,150
The youngest is great.

1225
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:21,340
Yung Hee: I'll work hard.

1226
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:22,380
Yung Hee: There are so many things.

1227
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,200
-Yeah.
-I thought we were all similar.

1228
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:26,170
Jun Seong: It's indeed a twist.

1229
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:27,490
This is too...

1230
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:31,260
Seon Woo: I feel like I'm more realistic because of Yung Hee.

1231
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:33,920
Seon Woo: You said you were born in the year of the snake, right?

1232
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:34,130
-Yes, that's right.
-A snake.

1233
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:35,720
(Yung Hee: Yes, that's right)
-Yes, that's right.
-A snake.

1234
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:37,390
Jun Seong: He said yes, that's right..

1235
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:39,430
Jun Seong: He still has the habit of the soldiers.

1236
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,570
Jun Seong: I'm a freshman compared to older brothers.

1237
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:46,870
Chung-ook: Interesting.

1238
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:50,350
Seon Woo: You seem to be the happiest person deep inside.

1239
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:52,160
Seong Ho: Yeah.

1240
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:56,330
Seon Woo: We have too many noodles.

1241
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:58,250
Seong Ho: I have no space in my stomach.

1242
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:02,850
Seon Woo: Our team also bought noodles too.

1243
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:03,880
Seong Ho: How many packets?

1244
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,290
Jun Seong: 10 packets.

1245
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:07,920
Seon Woo: 10 packets plus 10 packets. That's 20.

1246
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:08,840
Did you buy 10 packets?

1247
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,110
Yes, I did.

1248
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:12,750
Seon Woo: No, I bought 5 packets. So it's 15 packets.

1249
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:14,120
Jun Seong: I was a little annoyed at that time.

1250
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:15,640
Jun Seong: When did you buy them?

1251
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,540
Seon Woo: Yes. They're in my room.

1252
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:19,060
Jun Seong: Did you buy them secretly?

1253
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:21,390
Seon Woo: No, I bought them. But I heard you bought them too.

1254
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:22,650
Jun Seong: Take them home.

1255
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:24,530
Seon Woo: What noodles did you buy?

1256
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:25,690
Jun Seong: Nongshim.

1257
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:27,960
Seon Woo: I lost. I didn't have that.

1258
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:28,160
(Jun Seong: You should eat Nongshim)
(Seong Ho: I'll give Nongshim first place; you have good taste)
Seon Woo: I lost. I didn't have that.

1259
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,290
You should eat Nongshim.
(Jun Seong: You should eat Nongshim)

00:55:55,920 --> 00:56:01,050
Seong Ho: Actually, it's the second day, but I'm still worried.

1422
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:15,020
Seong Ho: Seeing the gift makes me not so determined.

1423
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:24,600
(Nervous)

1424
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:27,820
Seong Ho: Hello?

1425
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:32,180
Seong Ho: I'm sorry we couldn't go on a date today.

1426
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:36,340
(Seon Woo is the person Seong Ho called)

1427
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:39,090
Seon Woo: I wanted to bring back delicious noodles,

1428
00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:41,520
Seon Woo: but I only bought Paldo.

1429
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:45,470
Seong Ho: Make me noodles next time.

1430
00:56:45,470 --> 00:56:47,960
Seong Ho: Add meat. Add sliced pork belly.

1431
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:48,760
Seon Woo: Of course.

1432
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:50,490
Seon Woo: I'll steal your roommate's food for you.

1433
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,250
Seong Ho: Got it.

1434
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:57,120
Seong Ho: Hope we can really go on a date next time.

1435
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:00,830
Seon Woo: Thank you.

1436
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:03,540

(Shy)

1439
00:57:10,110 --> 00:57:11,570
Seon Woo: In Seong Ho's position,

1440
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:14,760
Seon Woo: I've thought about it. Will he change his mind?

1441
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:17,960
Seon Woo: I'm just grateful.

1442
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:29,720
(Jun Seong, please go to the phone booth

1443
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:35,800
Jun Seong: I thought today would be the same.

1444
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:38,120
Jun Seong: But when it was time to call,

1445
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:42,780
Jun Seong: I was wondering if that was right. So I'm torn.

1446
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:49,940
(Who is Jun Seong thinking about now?)

1447
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:56,440
(Torn)

1448
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:11,350

Jun Seong: I'm hanging up.

1457
00:58:57,250 --> 00:58:58,490
Seong Ho: I was really surprised.

1458
00:58:58,890 --> 00:59:00,840
Seong Ho: I was surprised to know something I didn't know.

1459
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:02,390
Seong Ho: And I also panicked a little.

1460
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:06,620
Seong Ho: Oh, so that's how he feels.

1461
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:08,310
Seong Ho: I seem to be happy inside.

1462
00:59:13,890 --> 00:59:17,780
Seong Ho: I was really lying in bed and breathing deeply. I panicked.

1463
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:25,960
(Stomping)

1464
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:31,940
(Jun Seong called Seong Ho yesterday and today)

1465
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:36,280
(Shy)

1466
00:59:41,970 --> 00:59:46,640
(Yung Hee, please go to the phone booth

1467
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:50,660
(Noisy)

1468
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:55,970
Yung Hee: I have a lot on my mind today.

1469
00:59:57,460 --> 01:00:00,020
Yung Hee: I think I went in there in a bit of confusion.

1470
01:00:09,090 --> 01:00:13,170
(Who is the man who made Yung Hee torn?)

1471
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:19,010
(The phone rings on the second floor)

1472
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:21,900

1475
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:32,220
Yung Hee: Are you happy today?

1476
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:38,020
Seon Woo: Yes, I'm happy. How about you?

1477
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:40,550
Yung Hee: Me too.

1478
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:43,090
Yung Hee: There was a car with a good smell.

1479
01:00:43,090 --> 01:00:45,590
Yung Hee: Maybe because it was raining today, the air was nice, too.

1480
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:48,310
Yung Hee: And I made a lot of nice things.

1481
01:00:48,310 --> 01:00:50,800
Yung Hee: But you were not there today.

1482
01:00:55,130 --> 01:00:58,270
Yung Hee: You were not there when everything else was great.

1483
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:00,570
Seon Woo: Let's…

1484
01:01:00,570 --> 01:01:02,030

1485
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:09,410
Seon Woo: I feel guilty.

1486
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:22,810
(Chung-ook, please go to the phone booth

1488
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:39,280
Chung-ook: I saw the one in front of me was Yung Hee.

1489
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:44,280
Chung-ook: He didn't call me. He called the room next door.

1490
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:46,450
Chung-ook: He called Seon Woo.

1491
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:59,120
(He picks up the speaker after a long time of thinking)

1492
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:14,980

-Yung Hee: Seong Ho?
-Chung-ook: No.

1498
01:02:29,450 --> 01:02:31,930
Yung Hee: I don't know. I can't hear clearly.

1499
01:02:31,930 --> 01:02:33,240
Chung-ook: It's me, Chung-ook.

1500
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:35,130
Yung Hee: Ah, Chung-ook.

1501
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:37,560
Chung-ook: After hearing my age today, did you panic?

1502
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:38,750
Yung Hee: No, not at all.

1503
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:40,220
Chung-ook: Really? Don't lie.

1504
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:42,160
Yung Hee: No. After we met today,

1505
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,670
Yung Hee: do you think I'm a person who lies?

1506
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:46,260
Really? That's good.

1507
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:49,960
Chung-ook: Well, today I…

1508
01:03:03,490 --> 01:03:07,660
(30 seconds which is not enough to express his feelings)

1509
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:20,020
Yung Hee: I was looking forward to it. Wondering if Seon Woo would call me.

1510
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:22,230
Yung Hee: After answering it, I found it was Chung-ook.

1511
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:25,100
Yung Hee: Chung-ook's call comforted me.

1512

And Seong Ho.

1516
01:03:52,310 --> 01:03:58,140
Seon Woo: I was going to call someone else until the moment I arrived at the phone booth.

1517
01:03:58,140 --> 01:04:01,140
Seon Woo: But strangely, when I went there,

1518
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:07,000
Seon Woo: my mind has been overturned. When I made up my mind,

1519
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:23,720
(Who is the man Seon Woo calls after being so torn so long?)

1520
01:04:24,590 --> 01:04:26,010
Hello?

1521
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:28,790
