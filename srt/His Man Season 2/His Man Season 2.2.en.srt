00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,490
(Nervous)

10
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:41,830
Seong Ho: Hello.

11
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:44,990
Hello, roommate.

12
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,510
(Jun Seong chose his roommate Seong Ho)

13
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:51,920
Why did you call me?
(Jun Seong chose his roommate Seong Ho)

14
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:55,730
Jun Seong: No, I just...

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,880
Jun Seong: Thank you for hanging out with me today.

16
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,450
Seong Ho: It's nothing. I should thank you.

17
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,700
(It's more nerve-racking than the time when they meet in person)

18
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:13,120
Spend a few more interesting days playing with me.

19
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,560
Seong Ho: I will.

20
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,860
Jun Seong: Really?

21
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,690
Jun Seong: Are you really going to take the test?

22
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,100
Seong Ho: The test is on the fourth day.

23
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,340
The fourth day.

24
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:26,740
It's not easy.

25
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,200
(30 seconds are up. The call is over)

26
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,350
Jun Seong: I'm more worried.

27
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:45,370
Jun Seong: It might be awkward. Or maybe it won't.

28
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,310
Jun Seong: It won't be awkward, right?

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,400
Jun Seong: "Oh, whatever!" With that in mind, I went in.

30
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,979
Seong Ho: That's foul.

31
00:01:56,979 --> 00:01:57,800
Jun Seong: Why?

32
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,920
Jun Seong: Well, I called the one to whom I'm grateful.

33
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,560
Seong Ho: Foul. Foul.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,830
Seong Ho: OK. Let's move on.

35
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,580
Jun Seong: You didn't call me, though. I'm sad.

36
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,430
Jun Seong: We're roommates, aren't we?

37
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,080
I'm sorry. I should bow to apologize.

38
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,210
(Jun Seong and Seong Ho are lightening the embarrassing mood naturally)
I'm sorry. I should bow to apologize.

39
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,620
Your bad.
(Jun Seong and Seong Ho are lightening the embarrassing mood naturally)

40
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:17,040
Jun Seong: But I'm really grateful to you. That's why I called you.

41
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,680
Seong Ho: But when I got the call just now...

42
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:20,880
(Shy)

43
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,410
That's my reaction.
(Shy)

44
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:22,920
(Shy)

45
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,430
Because I wasn't expecting it.

46
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,760
Seong Ho: Do you want hand cream?

47
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,510
Jun Seong: I like its scent. I want some.

48
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,360
Seong Ho: I won't give this to just anybody.

49
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,570
Seong Ho: I can sleep comfortably today.

50
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,590
Seong Ho: I didn't lose my pride.

51
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,450
I safeguarded my pride.

52
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,170
Seong Ho: Jun Seong was flustered before he left.

53
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:48,960
Seong Ho: He said, "What should I do? Who should I choose?"

54
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,540
Seong Ho: He called me. I guess he wasn't joking.

55
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:58,260
Seong Ho: I told him that he could just call someone to whom he was grateful.

56
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,430
Seong Ho: Also, I told him that he could take it easy.

57
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:08,080
Seong Ho: I guess he called me because he was inspired by these words.

58
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,650
Seong Ho: Jun Seong is like a friend.

59
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,270
Seong Ho: If I were to estimate the percentage of friendship and love...

60
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,510
I think friendship is 100 and love is zero.

61
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:21,470
Jun Seong: I do have feelings for him

62
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,360
Jun Seong: I noticed him the first time we met.

63
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,460
(The call is over)

64
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,170
I have a lot on my mind.
(The call is over)

65
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:33,650
(The call is over)

66
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,270
Chung-ook: I feel relieved now.

67
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,660
Chung-ook: But I also have regrets.

68
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:54,240
Chung-ook: I don't know who Min Seong called at all.

69
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,200
Seong Ho: When I knew Seon Woo didn't call me...

70
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,790
Seong Ho: I'm actually a little sad. Who did he choose?

71
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,910
Seon Woo : I don't get it. About the signal created during chatting with Jun Seong...

72
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:08,890
Seon Woo : "Did I get it wrong?" That's what I thought.

73
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:14,610
Seon Woo : I'll try to get to know him again.

74
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:18,640
But I don't think there's a third time.

75
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:25,010
(The mixed signals among the six men)

76
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,250
(Where are the men's hearts leaning towards?)

77
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:35,190
Yung Hee: At first, about the call thing, I thought...

78
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:39,800
Yung Hee: What should I say to someone I just met today?

79
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,670
Yung Hee: But when I stood in front of the phone booth, I got the courage.

80
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,520
-Chung-ook: I want to say more. -Yeah.

81
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,600
-Chung-ook: But I hung it up.
-Yung Hee: You got hung up?

82
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,280
-Chung-ook: I wasn't hung up. I hung it up. -Really?

83
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,560
Chung-ook: Because I felt I'd be hung up while I was talking.

84
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,700
Chung-ook: If I got hung up, I'd be more depressed.

85
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,000
Yung Hee: Did you finish all you want to say?

86
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,580
Chung-ook: No.

87
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,150
Yung Hee: You didn't say it all out?

88
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,350
Chung-ook: Anyway, this is just the first day.

89
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,020
Chung-ook: Everyone is good. That's great.

90
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,120
Yeah. Everyone looks kind and nice.

91
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:15,020
They are all good with words.

92
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,930
-You too, Chung-ook. -Thank you.

93
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,390
What's wrong?

94
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:21,950
(Shy)
What's wrong?

95
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,500
What's wrong?
(Shy)

96
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,020
Chung-ook: At that moment, I got a crush.

97
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,310
Chung-ook: He was so nice to me. "Is it because he's interested in me?"

98
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:32,040
Chung-ook: Or is he like this to everyone?

99
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,670
Chung-ook: I have mixed feelings now.

100
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:38,800
Yung Hee: When I was alone with Chung-ook...

101
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,370
Yung Hee: I talked a bit more.

102
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,409
Yung Hee: Because we're roommates, I want to be closer to him.

103
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:44,900
Yung Hee: Or maybe I want to see other sides of him.

104
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,940
Yung Hee: Because we have plenty of time.

105
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:48,830
(After the calling time, the men got together) (Men's House)

106
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,890
Cheers.

107

(After the calling time, the men got together) (Men's House)

108
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,510
Good.
(After the calling time, the men got together) (Men's House)

109
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,260
Good.

110
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,640
Yung Hee: It's a little awkward among us.

111
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,250
Jun Seong: What's with the silence?

112
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,630
Jun Seong: Only after a 30-second call...

113
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,380
Jun Seong: Things became so different.

114
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,300
Seong Ho: We'll cry after we do it twice.

115
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,020
But...

116
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,120
Not bad, right?

117
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,660
Seon Woo : We did a good job today. We did well.

118
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:18,720
Good job.

119
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,270
(I'm amazing)
Good job.

120
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,450
-The atmosphere is good. -Good job.
(I'm amazing)

121

-The atmosphere is good. -Good job.

122
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,040
Seong Ho: I should have brought some Diet Coke.

123
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,400
Jun Seong: Diet Coke?

124

127
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:35,409
Min Seong: 30 seconds is really short.

128
00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:37,770
-Really? -Really short.

129
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,230
Jun Seong: Really short.

130
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,520
Seong Ho: Because I left without reading the text.

131
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,690
-Ding ding ding ding. -Seon Woo : Did you run out?

132
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:43,650
Seon Woo : Because you wanted to make the call?

133
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,820
It was really short.

134
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:51,900
Really?

135
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,980
Seon Woo : Glad we said a lot just now, right?

136
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,840
-Seon Woo : It's really different. -Indeed.

137
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,040
Seon Woo : It's different.

138
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,860

Can I put on makeup here?

150
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,100
Of course!

151
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,510
Seon Woo : Come on in.

152
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,180
Thank you.

Seong Ho: Me?

155
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,470
Seong Ho: I slept so well that I felt like I lost my memory.

156
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,520
-Seon Woo : Because I didn't sleep last night. -Why?

157
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,750
Seon Woo : I can't remember clearly. But I didn't fall asleep until 1 a.m.

158
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,049
Why?

159

Seon Woo : He asked me, "Can I get ready here?"

163
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,530
Pretty cute.

164

Seon Woo : We will be drinking coffee already.

172
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:04,620
That's right.

173
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,570
(A loud alarm rang from somewhere)

174
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:07,770
The alarm rang.

(A loud alarm rang from somewhere)

176
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:13,060
(Even if he hears the alarm, Min Seong isn't moving either)

177
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,300
Seong Ho: But he won't get up. What should we do?

178
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,050
Seon Woo : The alarm is so loud. But neither of them is getting up?

179
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:23,660
Seong Ho: For real, I don't know what kind of life everyone is living.

180
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,700
(A sleeping life...)

181
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,300
(Some hissing sound...)

182
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,940
(Hiss, hiss, hiss, hiss)

183
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,810
(Yung Hee starts the day with some hiss(?) sports)

184
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:40,730

187
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,320
It's not 8:30 yet, right?

188
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,480
-Yes. -I'll wake everyone up.

189
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,340
(Stop)

190
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:16,040

(Seon Woo passes by the mission card and goes to the kitchen)

192
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:32,440
(He starts cleaning the kitchen carefully)

193
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:40,250

199
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,480

200
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,450
-Jun Seong: Right now? -What?

201
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,570
-Right now? -Yes.

Min Seong.

207
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:19,940
Seong Ho: Min Seong. We are running out of time.

208
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:22,010

Get up.

212
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:35,100
(Because of Seong Ho, Min Seong finally opens his eyes)

213
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,130

216
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,890
-Seon Woo : Did you read the mission card? -Seong Ho: Not yet.

217
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:49,490
Seon Woo : Take a look. I can't hold it anymore. Just read it.

218
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:50,540
Seong Ho: Okay.

219
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,390
The one who picked the card of arrow...

220
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:55,580
Heart.

Seon Woo : The one hour has started?

229
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,410

Seong Ho: I'm going to pick the card!

232
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:23,110
Seon Woo : I think I want a heart card.

233
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:28,300
Seon Woo : "I hope someone can pick me." That was what I had in mind.

234
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:32,830
Seong Ho: "Please. I wish Seon Woo and I could get different cards."

235
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:33,950
Seong Ho: That was what I thought.

236
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:37,710
(Chung-ook goes downstairs after getting ready)

237
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,580
Seon Woo : Please pick a card.

238

00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,410
Chung-ook: Have you read it?

240

-Seon Woo : Yes. -Ah, really?

243
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,520
Yes.

244
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,850
Look at his facial expression.

248
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,540
Seong Ho: You haven't read it yet, right?

249
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,630
-Chung-ook: I don't want to see it. -What are you doing?

250
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,550
(Yung Hee also chose a card)

251
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:08,400
Which one do you want to eat? Oreo or Corn Frost?

252
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,200
Good morning.

253
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,960
Seong Ho: Please pick a card there, Jun Seong.

254
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,060
What snack?

255
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,070
Jun Seong: If you get the card...

256
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,980
Jun Seong: Invite that person to a date...

257
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:28,960
(Smile)

258
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,170
Jun Seong: Can I borrow your hair dryer?

259
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:34,110
Seong Ho: It's at the bottom. Inner side.

260
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:41,440
(Jun Seong is almost ready to go out)

261
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,470
Seon Woo : They need to come quickly so we can see the cards.

262
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,970
Seon Woo : We need to confirm our date.

263
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:47,560
Seon Woo : We have to make the cards public quickly.

264
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,050
Seon Woo : We need to finish inviting our dates before we go out.

265
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,690
Seong Ho: But someone hasn't picked the card yet.

266
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:52,270
-The last card. Min Seong hasn't got the card? -Yes.

267
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,720
(A card is left alone on the table)
-The last card. Min Seong hasn't got the card? -Yes.

Yung Hee: We need to confirm the date.

271
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:04,780
(They are getting anxious)

272

They need to be here quickly.
(They are getting anxious)

273
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:08,890
(They are getting anxious)

274
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,470
Seon Woo : It seems that you're worried about something.

275
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,850
Yung Hee: No.

276
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,270
Yung Hee: There's nothing to worry about.

277
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,820
Yung Hee: Should we reveal our cards first?

278
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,800
But...

279
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,160
Yung Hee: I got the arrow card.

280
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,830
Seong Ho: Me too.

281
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,300
(Reading others' expressions)

282
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,650

-Chung-ook: Heart. -Oh, then...

284
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,610
We...

285
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:51,450
(The atmosphere became quiet after disclosing the card)

286
00:14:54,130 --> 00:15:00,540
(Can they date the man they want?)

287
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:09,370
(In a subtle atmosphere, the breakfast for four is over)

288
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,250
(Turning around)

289
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:17,500
Yung Hee: Finally.

290
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,620
Min Seong: Are you in green today?

291
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,110
-What? -Yung Hee: We are wearing the same color.

292
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,250
-Seong Ho: Couple outfits? -I have the same question.

293
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,490
Seong Ho: I wanted to wear green today but I held it back.

294
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,990
If I wore that, things would have been interesting.

295
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,540
Yung Hee: Please get a card there.

296
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,220
-Min Seong: Card? -Yung Hee: Yes, the one in the living room.

297
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,120
Jun Seong: There's someone who gets up later than me.

298
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,400
Yung Hee: Both of you need to be punished.

299
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:41,820
-Min Seong: What is this? -But...

300
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,960
(Reading the mission now because of getting up late)

301
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:47,330
Min Seong: These can be revealed, right?

302
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:49,270
Seon Woo : Yes, the four of us have revealed our cards.

303
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,450
I've read it.

304
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,720
(All six men have revealed their cards)

305
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,880
This is mine.
(All six men have revealed their cards)

306
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,570
(All six men have revealed their cards)

307
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:57,240
Really?
(All six men have revealed their cards)

308
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,570
Then we can decide now, right?

309
00:15:59,570 --> 00:15:59,650
Should we decide now? Should I get Chung-ook?

310
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:02,240
(Yung Hee: Should we decide now? Should I get Chung-ook?)

Seon Woo : So manly.

314
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:11,310
(Yung Hee goes to the second floor to find Chung-ook)

315
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,620
Yung Hee: Let's go.

316
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,850
Yung Hee: Everyone's downstairs.

317
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,230
Chung-ook: So quickly?

318

Chung-ook: My card! -Hurry up.

(They finally get together)

320
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:32,100
Then the three of you

-Seong Ho: Me? -Yes.

325
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,730
Seon Woo : You didn't help much.

326
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:48,800
Seong Ho: I made all. I just needed someone to taste it.

327
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,690
Seong Ho: I made all.

328
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:52,600

Seon Woo : I wanted to be chosen soon.

00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,900
Min Seong: I was a little nervous while waiting.

331
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,970
Min Seong: I'm both nervous and curious.

332
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,620
Seong Ho: Should I make the decision here?

333
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,579
I choose Seon Woo .

334
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,270

Seon Woo : I'm very happy.

339
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:33,470
Seon Woo : Part of the reason is that Seong Ho chose me.

340
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:38,660
Jun Seong: I'm not that happy about Seong Ho going on a date with someone else.

341
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:43,650
Jun Seong: But I couldn't do anything. It's just that I don't think today is the right time.

342
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:47,110
Yung Hee: Do you want to choose first, Jun Seong?

343
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,100

Seon Woo : Is it the flow of love?

405
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:02,640

406
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,720
Seon Woo : I'm a little confused.

407

How can you say that here?

432

-Seong Ho: Is it a diss battle? -Chung-ook: No.

433
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,060
Jun Seong: Your room looks like a warehouse.

434
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,050

528
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:09,730

Chung-ook: I was really suffocating.

533

00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:27,860
Hyeong Jin: The date in the skating rink is not that common.

645
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:32,800
Hyeong Jin: You'll have physical contact in that situation, right?

646
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:37,200
Hyeong Jin: "Will we get closer?" So, I chose the skating rink.

647
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,460
-Hyeong Jin: Have you tried skating before? -Seon Woo : No.

648

The skating rink?

652
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:51,000
Hyeong Jin: It'd be boring if I did.

653
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,050
Seon Woo : Do you like this? Skating?

654
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:57,930

655
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:03,050

656
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:06,510

657

Seon Woo : Should I put this inside?

663
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,950
Seon Woo : For safety?

664
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,640

666
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:37,910

Wait.
(The two are in sync)

685
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,910
Is this a three legs race?

686
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:13,740
Seon Woo : I need to take off my coat.

687
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,010
-Hyeong Jin: It's hot, right? -Yes.

688

692
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:23,080

698
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:40,250
Hyeong Jin: Start skating when I say "One, two."

699
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:46,310
Seon Woo: In order to survive, I rely on Hyeong Jin very much. He's very stable.

700
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:48,860
Hyeong Jin: He looks cute like a child.

701
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,830

723
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:38,490
(Hyeong Jin loses to Seon Woo on purpose)

724
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:42,480
Seon Woo: This is boring. Let's be fair. Be fair.

725
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,480
Hyeong Jin: Again. I won't let you win.

726

Seon Woo: One, two, three.

729

Seon Woo: Is this how you skate?

730
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,210
Hyeong Jin: Should I let you win?

731
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:56,700
Seon Woo: I want to win. I want to win.

732
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,590

733
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:59,670
Seon Woo: No, then I'll...

734
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:01,770
Oh my!

735
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:05,620
Seon Woo: It's not over yet, right?

736
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,380
(He's reached the finishing line)

737
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:10,670
Seon Woo: You're ruthless.

738
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:13,139
Hyeong Jin: It's all over your butt. Oh my goodness.

739
00:34:14,949 --> 00:34:18,260
(Seon Woo: Instead of feeling pain, it's more embarrassing for me)

740
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:25,230
(No pets) (No too close physical contact)
(No insults and fights)

741
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:27,500
Seon Woo: Let's go get some drinks.

742
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,340
Hyeong Jin: Is it good? You eat like a child.

743
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,000
Hyeong Jin: He's not so much like a big brother to me.

744
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,280
Hyeong Jin: Actually, I feel that he's more like a younger brother

745
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,580
Hyeong Jin: when we were on a date.

746
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,780
Hyeong Jin: You're in a mess.

747
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,830
Seon Woo: It's all your fault.

748
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:56,790
Hyeong Jin: Go tell them then.

749
00:34:56,790 --> 00:35:00,440
Hyeong Jin: They thought you went out on a date. Then it turned out to be a mess.

750
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,480
Seon Woo: Let's see if you dare to make something nice.

751
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,160
Seon Woo: I'm going to...

752
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,210
Hyeong Jin: Isn't it fun?

753
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:10,490
Seon Woo: It'll leave a deep impression.

754
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,950
Hyeong Jin: Because you skated with me?

755
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,120
Seon Woo: I'll keep you in my memory.

756
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,740
Hyeong Jin: But I think your eyes are really pretty.

757
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,770
Seon Woo: They're different. Which one do you mean?

758
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:29,900
Hyeong Jin: Both. Depends on different moods.

759
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:34,290
Hyeong Jin: Let's go eat now.

760
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:38,310
(The date at the skating rink which makes them more intimate is over)

761
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,550
Hyeong Jin: I'm so excited just thinking about eating.

762
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,030
Seon Woo: It must be delicious.

763
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:47,560
(Restaurant T)

764
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:53,650

(Hyeong Jin takes a photo of Seon Woo with the camera)

767
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,110
Seon Woo: Where should I look? Look here?

768
00:35:59,110 --> 00:35:59,960
Hyeong Jin: Look at the opposite direction.

769
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,100
Seon Woo: Does this side look better?

770
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:01,700
Hyeong Jin: No, the other way.

771
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,500
-Seon Woo: This way?
-Hyeong Jin: Yes.

772
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,430
Seon Woo: It doesn't work if I turn this way?

773
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:04,140
Hyeong Jin: No.

774
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,810
Seon Woo: Do I look better on this side?

775
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,890
Hyeong Jin: You look better with a smile.

776
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:08,980
Seon Woo: Smile?

777
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:09,480
(Shy, nervous)
Seon Woo: Smile?

778
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,660
(Shy, nervous)

779
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:13,550
Hyeong Jin: Can you take a photo for me too?

780
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,140
Seon Woo: How should I do it? Like this. Isn't this better?

781
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,420
Seon Woo: Good. Good.

782
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,130
Hyeong Jin: I don't want to look straight ahead.

783
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:24,880
Hyeong Jin: So embarrassing.

784
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,110
(Embarrassed)
Hyeong Jin: So embarrassing.

785
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:29,130

786
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,290

(They take pictures for each other)

790
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:40,030
Seon Woo: We're wearing more than matching shirts.

791
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,100
Seon Woo: We're almost the same person.

792
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,560
Excuse me. Enjoy.

793
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,400
Seon Woo: Thank you.

794
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,050
Hyeong Jin: Thank you.

795
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,750
Seon Woo: Why am I still hungry after eating the sausage?

796
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,520
Hyeong Jin: You should have had one more earlier.

797
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:53,940
Seon Woo: Let's eat.

798
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,250
Hyeong Jin: It's delicious.

799
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,020
Seon Woo: It's delicious to eat after exercising.

800
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,380
Hyeong Jin: It tastes better.

801
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:12,950
Seon Woo: But for the first time in a man's house,

802
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:17,250
Seon Woo: I didn't have other thoughts in a man's house.

803
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,820
Seon Woo: There's no other way.

804
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:22,450
Hyeong Jin: Are you too tired?

805
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:25,150
Seon Woo: No, it's my first time.

806
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:26,590
Seon Woo: So I'm a little exhausted.

807
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:29,010
Seon Woo: But I feel like I've changed my mind.

808
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:31,800
Hyeong Jin: "Ah, I want to go home quickly. " Don't you have this kind of thought?

809
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,490
Hyeong Jin: So don't you do sports at all? In your spare time.

810
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:39,390
Seon Woo: I like hiking.

811
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,630
Hyeong Jin: That's surprising.

812
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,260
Hyeong Jin: Am I being too honest?

813
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,860
Seon Woo: I think I like being quiet.

814
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:47,790
-Hyeong Jin: Really? So you go mountain-climbing alone?
-Seon Woo: Yes.

815
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:50,880
-Seon Woo: Do you like mountain-climbing?
-Hyeong Jin: I've never done that.

816
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,180
Seon Woo: You don't like mountains?

817
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,440
Hyeong Jin: I like the sea more than the mountains.

818
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,490
Hyeong Jin: We're the opposite. I'm a little surprised.

819
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:01,820
Hyeong Jin: When I'm in a relationship,

820
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,590
Hyeong Jin: most people in a relationship with me

821
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:05,490
Hyeong Jin: are the opposite of me in terms of hobbies.

822
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:06,820
Hyeong Jin: Seon Woo, too.

823
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:10,480
Hyeong Jin: His love style is completely different from mine.

824
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,240
Hyeong Jin: That's why I'm more attracted.

825
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,000
Hyeong Jin: Anyway, you must have a good feeling toward someone

826
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,690
Hyeong Jin: to like him, right?

827
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:18,850
(Seon Woo: Today you moved into the Men's House)

828

Seon Woo: and chose a date.

830
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:26,080
Seon Woo: Why did you choose me?

831
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,490
Hyeong Jin: Are you curious?

832
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:29,480
Seon Woo: Of course.

833
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:33,960
Seon Woo: Because I really had an unexpected day today.

834
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,700
Hyeong Jin: Because your eyes are pretty.

835
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:41,400
-Seon Woo: Even when we just met?
-Hyeong Jin: Yes.

836
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,850
Hyeong Jin: Well, one of your eyes has single eyelids.

837
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:46,540
Hyeong Jin: Which is what I like.

838
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,950
Hyeong Jin: And the other eye has double eyelids, and that's what I like, too.

839
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:50,890
Hyeong Jin: But you have both of them.

840
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:53,370
Seon Woo: So perfect.

841
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:59,230
Hyeong Jin: You left a good impression on me in many aspects.

842
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:02,470
Hyeong Jin: Do you have a certain type?

843
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:04,000
-Hyeong Jin: Your ideal type.
-Seon Woo: My ideal type?

844
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Seon Woo: People who can make me nervous will attract me.

845
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,830
Seon Woo: Or I'm attracted by people I'm curious about.

846
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:17,020
Seon Woo: But in the end, I'll choose someone who fits me well. I'm this kind of person.

847
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:19,320
Seon Woo: What about your ideal type?

848
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,670
Hyeong Jin: I don't have a fixed type.

849
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:26,130
Hyeong Jin: Normally, I prefer gentlemen.

850
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:29,070
Hyeong Jin: It may not be easy to understand.

851
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:31,730
Seon Woo: So you chose me?

852
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:31,880
Seon Woo: Right?

853
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,720
(Pretending)
Seon Woo: Right?

854
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,220
Seon Woo: Right?

855
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,510
Hyeong Jin: Maybe.

856
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:37,870
(Hyeong Jin: What's the most puzzling thing about Seon Woo is)

857
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:39,540
The most puzzling thing about you is,
(Hyeong Jin: What's the most puzzling thing about Seon Woo is)

858
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:42,550
Hyeong Jin: to be honest,

859
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,340
Hyeong Jin: you seem to be friendly to everyone.

860
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:52,150
Hyeong Jin: To be honest, I don't know if that's your personality…

861
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,690
Seon Woo: or because I'm fickle.

862
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:57,300
Hyeong Jin: But I feel it's your natural personality.

863
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,400
Hyeong Jin: Or both.

864
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,420
Hyeong Jin: I'm not sure.

865
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:06,460
Hyeong Jin: We met for the first time,

866
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:09,580
Hyeong Jin: but he was very kind to me.

867
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:15,680
Hyeong Jin: Not just to me. He was very considerate and kind to others, too.

868
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,960
Hyeong Jin: I want to know if he's kind because he likes me

869
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:23,520
Hyeong Jin: or because of his personality.

870
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:28,390
Hyeong Jin: I'm curious about that part. So I asked.

871
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:34,630
Seon Woo: I try to be kind to everyone.

872
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:37,610
Seon Woo: I think that's the etiquette to the others.

873
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:38,810
Seon Woo: That's why I did that.

874
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:40,970
Seon Woo: "If he's kind to everyone,

875
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:43,590
Seon Woo: would he not like me?" He had that kind of thought.

876
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,610
Seon Woo: You don't like gestures that make people misunderstand?

877
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:50,250
Hyeong Jin: Of course not. I don't like gestures that make people misunderstand.

878
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:52,550
Hyeong Jin: Yes means yes and no means no.

879
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:56,030
Hyeong Jin: But as long as he is my type,

880
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:59,170
Hyeong Jin: even if he despises me, I'll try to approach him.

881
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,250
Hyeong Jin: Well, I'll try even if I'll regret it later.

882
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:02,990
Hyeong Jin: I have that kind of philosophy.

883
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:05,620
Hyeong Jin: You'll find out soon. Gradually.

884
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:07,720
Seon Woo: Then I'll wait and see.

885
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:13,930
(How will their relationship change?)

886
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:18,460
(Meanwhile, at Men's House)

887

900
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:52,530
Chung-ook: This should be okay.

901

Chung-ook: If he sits here…

902
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:04,860
Chung-ook: Not bad, OK.

903
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:06,360

Yung Hee: The mixed good and bad smell of dogs' feet, you know?

907
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:17,590
Yung Hee: What's the name of your puppy?

Yung Hee: It must be handsome.

923
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,990

924
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:48,000
-Yung Hee: How old is it?
-Chung-ook: He was a stray dog.

925
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,650
Chung-ook: But I've adopted him for over 6 years.

926
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:54,040
Yung Hee: Then it should be like family.

927
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,240

Chung-ook: But I feel more comfortable

934
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,010
Chung-ook: to be able to drive my own car.

935
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:16,940
Chung-ook: It feels like a one-on-one date.

936
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,840
Yung Hee: Because it's the first time to have a one-on-on date like this,

-Chung-ook: To be honest, at the beginning,
-Uh-huh.

945
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:38,100
-Chung-ook: because you let Jun Seong choose first,
-Uh-huh.

946
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,170
Chung-ook: I almost got mad.

947

Chung-ook: I had some feelings for him,

962

Chung-ook: but it didn't increase.

963
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:15,420
Chung-ook: But the more I talked with Yung Hee,

964
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:19,100

1069
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:01,910
Yung Hee: At the beginning?

1070
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:04,070
Chung-ook: Because you let Jun Seong choose first.

1071
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:06,290

1072
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:06,930

1075
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:18,170
Yung Hee: But when I thought twice about it,

1076
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,040

1077
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,550

00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:45,780
Jun Seong: Why didn't you talk much in the dorm?

1145
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:48,640
Min Seong: It's only been a day.

1146
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,660
Jun Seong: Because you still feel awkward?

1147
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:53,240
Min Seong: Yes, yesterday was really awkward.

1148
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,720
Min Seong: You don't like crowds?

1149
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,740
Min Seong: You always stay alone.

1150
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:01,470
Jun Seong: Me? No.

1151
00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:04,670
Jun Seong: I don't have to

1152
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:07,650
Jun Seong: force myself to socialize with others.

1153
00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:11,220
Jun Seong: I just follow my own rhythm.

1154
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:16,190
Jun Seong: I don't think everyone should be together.

1155
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:18,510
-Jun Seong: I prefer one-on-one.
-Min Seong: I like it more, too.

1156
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:21,280
Jun Seong: It's a better way to get to know each other.

1157
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:27,180
Jun Seong: So in the dorm,

1158
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:30,560
Jun Seong: is there anyone that you have a good feeling for?

1159
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,160
-Min Seong: A good feeling?
-Jun Seong: Yes.

1160
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:34,080
Min Seong: People I have feelings for...

1161
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:37,990
Min Seong: Yesterday was the first day. I'm not sure yet.

1162
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:40,950
-Jun Seong: Then is it a no?
-Min Seong: No?

1163
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:42,160
Jun Seong: I prefer an accurate answer: yes or no.

1164
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,230
Min Seong: Yes or no?

1165
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:46,500
Jun Seong: I don't like vague answers.

1166
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:49,710
Min Seong: People that I have feeling for… No.

1167
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:51,550
-Jun Seong: No?
-Min Seong: No.

1168
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:55,070
Jun Seong: I'm a little hurt sitting next to you.

1169
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:58,150
Min Seong: I might change my mind after today.

1170
00:52:58,150 --> 00:52:59,360
Jun Seong: No...

1171
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:03,170
Min Seong: Do you have one? Someone you have feelings for?

1172
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:06,120
(Um...)

1173
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:07,320
Jun Seong: Yes.

1174
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,340
Min Seong: Yes?

1175
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:09,380
(Oh)

1176
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:12,700
Jun Seong: Even though you may not have feelings, is there someone you're curious about?

1177
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:15,230
Jun Seong: It's just like, "I'm a little curious about this person."

1178
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:16,590
Min Seong: Curious...

1179
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:22,380
Min Seong: I'm curious about Junseong.

1180
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:25,690
Min Seong: I think you have a unique personality.

1181
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,060
(Smile)

1182
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:31,540
-Jun Seong: Why?
-Min Seong: You look a bit unique.

1183
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:33,810
Jun Seong: Why do I look unique? Why?

1184
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:38,930
Min Seong: Judging from your behavior.

1185
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:41,350
Jun Seong: Behavior? What's wrong with my behavior?

1186
00:53:41,350 --> 00:53:42,440
Jun Seong: What did I do?

1187
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:45,010
Jun Seong: I want to hear more details.
-Min Seong: More details?

1188
00:53:45,010 --> 00:53:46,140
Jun Seong: I'm curious.

1189
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:47,030
Min Seong: When everyone were together,

1190
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:50,360
Min Seong: you should say something to make others know you more, right?

1191
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:52,940
Min Seong: But you didn't say anything, so we don't know you well.

1192
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:53,910
Jun Seong: But it's not like I didn't say anything.

1193
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:56,520
(Disappointed)
Jun Seong: But it's not like I didn't say anything.

1194
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:56,730
-Min Seong: No.
-Jun Seong: It's not like that.
(Disappointed)
Jun Seong: But it's not like I didn't say anything.

1195
00:53:56,730 --> 00:53:58,470
-Min Seong: No.
-Jun Seong: It's not like that.

1196
00:53:58,470 --> 00:53:59,930
Min Seong: That's not what I meant.

1197
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:04,970
Jun Seong: I did a good job.

1198
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:10,210
Jun Seong: Push it down so it won't splash.

1199
00:54:10,210 --> 00:54:11,040
Min Seong: How do you press it?

1200
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,650
Jun Seong: Isn't the bottom empty?

1201
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:13,110
Min Seong: Like this? Squeeze down?

1202
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:13,830
(Jun Seong carefully teaches Min Seong who's at a loss)
Min Seong: Like this? Squeeze down?

1203
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:15,900
Jun Seong: Don't squeeze it like that. Put it in the box.
(Jun Seong carefully teaches Min Seong who's at a loss)

1204
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:18,070
Jun Seong: Press it down with this.

1205
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:19,830
Jun Seong: Do you get it?

1206
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:21,130
Min Seong: Yes.

1207
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:23,690
Min Seong: Let's see what it will look like.

1208
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:25,920
Jun Seong: Why can't I squeeze it out?

1209
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:31,920
Jun Seong: You need to use a lot of strength to squeeze it out.

1210
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:35,410
Min Seong: Is it right?

1211
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:36,880
Jun Seong: I think so.

1212
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,290
Jun Seong: I think we did it right.

1213
00:54:38,290 --> 00:54:40,020
Instructor: Too many. Dig out some.

1214
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:41,200
-Jun Seong: Really?
-Min Seong: Should I dig it out?

1215
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,760
Instructor: Use about half of it. Try again.

1216
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:43,380
(Embarrassed)
Instructor: Use about half of it. Try again.

1217
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:44,880
(Embarrassed)

1218
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:45,800
Min Seong: I see.

1219
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:46,780
(Dig out some batter and try again)
Min Seong: I see.

1220
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:49,270
(Dig out some batter and try again)

1221
00:54:49,270 --> 00:54:49,320
Min Seong: It's much easier.
(Dig out some batter and try again)

1222
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:50,750
Min Seong: It's much easier.

1223
00:54:51,930 --> 00:54:54,540
Jun Seong: Oh, I made a great one.

1224
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:56,700
Jun Seong: I did better.

1225
00:54:57,490 --> 00:54:57,580
(A glance)

1226
00:54:57,580 --> 00:54:59,360
Min Seong: What are you talking about? I did better.
(A glance)

1227
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,440
Jun Seong: I did better.

1228
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:01,640
(Carefully)

1229
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:02,540
Jun Seong: This time I'm going to make a big one.
(Carefully)

1230
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:04,190
-Min Seong: Make it bigger?
-Jun Seong: Yeah.
(Carefully)

1231
00:55:04,190 --> 00:55:05,810
(Carefully)

1232
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:10,790
Min Seong: I made it really good. Look at this.

1233
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:12,660
Min Seong: It's really beautiful, right?

1234
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:15,930
Min Seong: Admit it. Dare you say it's not true?

1235
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:18,020
Jun Seong: I don't want to admit it.

1236
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:21,640
Jun Seong: But you did a good job.

1237
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:27,720
Jun Seong: Mess it up!

1238
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:29,680
(Staring)

1239
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,390
Min Seong: Gee.

1240
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:34,460
Min Seong: I'm happy.

1241
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:37,410
Min Seong: We had a smooth conversation.

1242
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:40,660
Min Seong: We can communicate naturally.

1243
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:42,370
Min Seong: It gives me this feeling.

1244
00:55:42,370 --> 00:55:43,330
-Min Seong: I'm done.
-Jun Seong: Me too.

1245
00:55:43,330 --> 00:55:43,900
(Cookies are ready to be baked so soon)
-Min Seong: I'm done.
-Jun Seong: Me too.

1246
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:45,010
Jun Seong: Me too.
(Cookies are ready to be baked so soon)

1247
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:47,870
(Cookies are ready to be baked so soon)

1248
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:51,120
Jun Seong: Done.

1249
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:54,340
Instructor: We're going to make a strawberry cake this time.

1250
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:55,100
Jun Seong: Should I keep doing this?

1251
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:56,000
(Jun Seong carefully stirs it)
Jun Seong: Should I keep doing this?

1252
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,680
Instructor: Yes, keep stirring, until you feel a lot of pressure.
(Jun Seong carefully stirs it)

1253
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:00,810
Min Seong: Should I put fresh cream on it?

1254
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:01,980
Jun Seong: Yes, with fresh cream.

1255
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:03,970
Jun Seong: Put strawberries on it and put fresh cream on it.

1256
00:56:03,970 --> 00:56:06,470
Jun Seong: Then add another layer of cake and syrup.

1257
00:56:08,210 --> 00:56:11,850
(When Min Seong applies syrup, Joon-sung makes whipping cream)

1258
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:14,510
(A glance)

1259
00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:16,740
Min Seong: Are you tired?

1260
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:18,990
Jun Seong: This should be enough.

1261
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:21,160
-Min Seong: What?
-Jun Seong: This should be okay.

1262
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:22,600
Min Seong: I think you should continue to stir it.

1263
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:26,230
Min Seong: I think you need to stir five more minutes.

1264
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:29,170
(Joking)

1265
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:36,660
Min Seong: It's too watery.

1266
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:38,770
Jun Seong: I won't let you off easily.

1267
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:42,810
Min Seong: It's almost done.

1268
00:56:42,810 --> 00:56:43,830
Jun Seong: Very thick.

1269
00:56:43,830 --> 00:56:46,410
Jun Seong: Just put it here. Why do you have to do it there?

1270
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:48,550
Min Seong: I like it this way.

1271
00:56:49,370 --> 00:56:49,530
(Bickering)

1272
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:51,590
-Jun Seong: OK. OK.
-Min Seong: I just like it.
(Bickering)

1273
00:56:51,590 --> 00:56:52,190
(Bickering)

1274
00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:56,170
Jun Seong: Really? Do I have to continue?

1275
00:56:56,170 --> 00:56:58,460
Min Seong: Yes, scoop it up to check.

1276
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,760
Min Seong: Get some up.

1277
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:03,550
Jun Seong: Are you a baker?

1278
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:06,760
Jun Seong: I'll listen to you if you're a baker.

1279
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:09,210
-Min Seong: I learned it when I was young.
-Jun Seong: Really?

1280
00:57:09,210 --> 00:57:11,180
Just kidding.

1281
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,010
-Min Seong: That's enough.
-Jun Seong: My head hurts.

1282
00:57:13,010 --> 00:57:14,250
Min Seong: I think it's okay.

1283
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:15,470
Jun Seong: Use this to apply it.

1284
00:57:16,530 --> 00:57:18,010
Jun Seong: It's supposed to be like this, you know?

1285
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:18,740
-Min Seong: Spin it.
-Jun Seong: Spin it at the same time. You know?

1286
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:20,290
(I've seen it somewhere)
-Min Seong: Spin it.
-Jun Seong: Spin it at the same time. You know?

1287
00:57:20,290 --> 00:57:21,290
(I've seen it somewhere)

1288
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:24,340
Jun Seong: I'm good. I'm good.

1289
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:26,890
Jun Seong: Am I not?

1290
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:27,990
Min Seong: Yes, you are good.

1291
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,960
Jun Seong: I want it to be more densely.

1292
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:34,640
Jun Seong: Make it more dense.

1293
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:37,190
Jun Seong: It's empty here.

1294
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:39,570
Jun Seong: You really need someone to take care of you.

1295
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:42,880
(A cake finished in a blink of an eye)

1296
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,010
Jun Seong: Put some here too.
(A cake finished in a blink of an eye)

1297
00:57:44,010 --> 00:57:44,430
(A cake finished in a blink of an eye)

1298
00:57:44,430 --> 00:57:45,540
Min Seong: So pretty.
(A cake finished in a blink of an eye)

1299

(Eat the leftover strawberries)

1300
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:49,250
Jun Seong: Done.

1301
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:52,030
Jun Seong: Do you want strawberries?

1302
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:58,870
Jun Seong: Are our cookies done?

1303
00:57:58,870 --> 00:57:59,910

Jun Seong: Our cookies.

1307
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:07,290
Min Seong: What? They don't look like what I imagined.

1308
00:58:09,590 --> 00:58:14,830
Jun Seong: Whom will you give the cookies to? Is there anyone you want to give them to?

1309
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:17,930
Min Seong: To everyone.

1310
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:21,940

00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:47,060
Jun Seong: It should be meaningful.

1319
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:51,660
Jun Seong: Only we know the meaning.

1320
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:55,680

Jun Seong: The person who's left alone, I wonder if he has eaten.

1347
00:59:49,010 --> 00:59:50,750
Jun Seong: We need to buy noodles.

Min Seong: And…
(Jun Seong bought the noodles which he had promised Seong Ho)

1355
00:59:58,340 --> 00:59:59,210
Min Seong: What else?

1356
00:59:59,210 --> 01:00:00,340
Jun Seong: I want sugar-free cokes.

1357
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:02,100
Min Seong: Sugar-free cokes should be over here.

1358
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:04,140
Jun Seong: Here.

1359
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:05,420

(Laughing)
Tried. Yes.

1365
01:00:18,570 --> 01:00:21,850
Jun Seong: It's a lie to say I didn't think of him once.

1366
01:00:21,850 --> 01:00:23,910
Jun Seong: Even if I go on a date with someone else,

1367
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:28,270
Jun Seong: I still think of Seong Ho.

1368
01:00:28,650 --> 01:00:30,070
Jun Seong: I like him.

1369
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:34,810
(What about Seong Ho who's alone at Men's House?)

1370
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:39,950
(Men's House, which is so quiet)

1371
01:00:51,930 --> 01:00:55,720
Seong Ho: I was alone in a big house. I'm more speechless.

1372
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:58,700
Seong Ho: I don't want to talk. I just want to lie in bed. I feel depressed.

1373
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:13,090
(Found an empty mug)

1374
01:01:14,930 --> 01:01:16,500
Seong Ho: He left without tidying up.

1375
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:22,220
Seong Ho: He left without putting away the mug.

1376
01:01:23,510 --> 01:01:24,730
Seong Ho: So annoying.

1377
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:31,370
(Seong Ho cleans the house alone)

1378
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:33,080
(Take a look)

1379
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:35,580
Seong Ho: Someone left a message on the fridge.

(Seong Ho: "Wait, I'll buy you some noodles!")

1382
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:42,460
Seong Ho: I wonder who wrote it.
(Seong Ho: "Wait, I'll buy you some noodles!")

1383
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:45,000
Seong Ho: Who wrote that?

1384
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:51,960
Seong Ho: Because I have nothing to do, I'll make an Iceland wool bag.

1385
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:55,350
Seong Ho: So annoying.

1386
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:03,420
Seong Ho: What? Where did it start?

1387
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:06,350
Seong Ho: This…

1388
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:10,520
(Follow the video)

1389
01:02:12,330 --> 01:02:13,690
Seong Ho: What? How did they do it?

1390
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:15,770
Seong Ho: How did they do it?

1391
01:02:18,410 --> 01:02:19,710
Seong Ho: What's going on?

1392
01:02:20,890 --> 01:02:24,790
(Seong Ho gave up and went down to the living room)

1393
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:38,020
(Meanwhile, a car is heading to Men's House)
(Men's House)

1394
01:02:44,730 --> 01:02:46,650
How long do I need to confirm a relationship?

1395
01:02:46,650 --> 01:02:48,380
The shortest time was about 12 hours.

1396
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:49,990
There was no flirting phase.

1397
01:02:57,950 --> 01:03:01,060
Seong Ho: I heard the doorbell. Who is it?

1398
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:02,560
Seong Ho: I was surprised.

1399
01:03:02,790 --> 01:03:07,100
(Who is the man coming to see Seong Ho?)

1400
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:15,850
Seong Ho: I opened the door and went out. That's when I got a little better.

1401
01:03:15,850 --> 01:03:17,230
-Seong Ho: Hello.
-Hello.

1402
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:21,150

1403
01:03:21,150 --> 01:03:23,370
-Seong Ho: Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.
(The eighth man came to Men's House)

1404
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:25,410
My ideal type is

1405
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:28,110
someone who is serious and smells good.

1406
01:03:28,110 --> 01:03:29,550
I like tall guys.

1407
01:03:29,550 --> 01:03:31,250
But if they're cute, it's okay to be short.

1408
01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:34,200
I'm attracted to bad guys too.

1409
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:36,140
I look strong on the outside,

1410
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:39,020
but inside, I'm soft like tofu.

1411
01:03:39,730 --> 01:03:42,160

1412
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:44,540
-Seong Ho: I'm the only one here.
-Hyeong Joon: Really?

1413
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:47,990
Seong Ho: Everyone went on a date except me.

1414
01:03:48,850 --> 01:03:52,480
Hyeong Joon: I thought he was so cute when we first met.

1415
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:59,070
Hyeong Joon: I felt like I was in a veil. My heart fluttered.

1416
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,630
Hyeong Joon: Go get ready.

1417
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:03,550
Seong Ho: Why?

1418
01:04:03,550 --> 01:04:05,080
Hyeong Joon: Let's go on a date.

1419
01:04:06,990 --> 01:04:07,090

1422
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:11,230
What?

1423
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:12,790
(The other guys wandered around to look for Seong Ho)
What?

1424
01:04:12,790 --> 01:04:14,320
It doesn't feel right.
(The other guys wandered around to look for Seong Ho)

1425
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:14,710
What's wrong?
(The other guys wandered around to look for Seong Ho)

1426
01:04:14,710 --> 01:04:17,540
Someone should be here, but he's not.

1427
01:04:17,540 --> 01:04:18,710
Why isn't he here?
(The other guys wandered around to look for Seong Ho)
