Jun Seong.

5
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,280
Did you wait for a long time?

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,110
I just want to thank you.

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,340

10
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,740
(Pick up the phone again nervously)

I waited for a long time.

-You waited for a long time?
-Yes.

18
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,490
Seong Ho: Thank you so much today.

19
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,450
Jun Seong: I can wait longer.

20
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:17,130
Seong Ho: Then wait for two more days.

21
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:21,110
-Jun Seong: Okay.

-That's all?
-Yes.

25
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,210
Me too.

26
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:33,120
-Jun Seong: See you later.
-Seong Ho: Okay.

27
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:40,710
(Has Seong Ho finally reciprocated Jun Seong's feelings?)

28
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,380
Hyeong Jin: Are there any messages for me? No?

29
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:06,680
Hyeong Jin: I'm both nervous and expectant.

30
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,230
You have one new message.

31
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,630
Hyeong Jin.

32
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:30,800
Min Seong: I don't know who you've given your heart to.

33
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:39,600
Min Seong: I'm curious about this, so I'm leaving you a message.

34
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,670
Min Seong: Yes, I'm just curious.

35
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:53,260
Hyeong Jin: I'm still hesitating,

36
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,770
but I think I can't delay it anymore.

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,770
Hyeong Jin: I want to be brave for the person I have feelings for.

38
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,620

43
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,190

44
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,240
(Peeking)

45
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:25,900
(Pretending not to know)

46
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:31,100
Hyeong Jin: If I can have a chance to go on a date with you,

47
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:39,170
Hyeong Jin: I'll be very glad. So I called you.

48
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,690

49
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:44,610

50
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,329
Hyeong Jin: I have to fight for myself.

51
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:58,220
Hyeong Jin: If I keep waiting, it'll all be over.

52
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,420
Hyeong Jin: I'm getting anxious.

53
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:03,120
Min Seong: If possible, I really want to go on a date with him.

54
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:11,510
(Next is Hyeong Joon)

55
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,710
(Whose message will Hyeong Joon find in his mailbox?)

56
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,730
No new message in your mailbox.

57
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:29,040
("No new message in your mailbox")
No new message in your mailbox.

58
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,480
("No new message in your mailbox")

59
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:34,770
Hyeong Joon: I thought Min Seong would leave me a message, but he didn't.

60
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,810
Hyeong Joon: I have to say I'm a bit disappointed.

61
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,250
Hyeong Joon: Maybe he's not sure about us.

62
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:41,300
(Hyeong Joon made the call without thinking for too long)
Hyeong Joon: Maybe he's not sure about us.

63
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,470
(Hyeong Joon made the call without thinking for too long)

64
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,020
(Hyeong Joon is calling Min Seong's roommate Seon Woo)

65
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,180
It startled me.
(Hyeong Joon is calling Min Seong's roommate Seon Woo)

66
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:59,540
(Hyeong Joon is calling Min Seong's roommate Seon Woo)

67
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:00,060
Seon Woo: Hello, I'm Seon Woo Yoo.

68
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,740
Hyeong Joon: Hello, I'm Hyeong Joon.

69
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,310
Hyeong Joon: I just called to say thank you.

70
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:10,920
Hyeong Joon: I'm sorry to let you worry so much about me.

71
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:14,010
-Seon Woo: Oh, I didn't do much.
-Really? Anyway…

72
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:17,850
-Seon Woo: I had a great time too.
-Hyeong Joon: Thank you very much.

73
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:18,140
-Keep fighting to the end.
-Okay. I know.

74
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:21,150
(Hyeong Joon expressed his gratitude to Seon Woo on the phone)
-Keep fighting to the end.
-Okay. I know.

75
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,330
(Hyeong Joon expressed his gratitude to Seon Woo on the phone)

76
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:25,080
Min Seong: I didn't mean to eavesdrop but I heard it anyway.

77
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,080
Seon Woo: You heard everything?

78
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,770
Min Seong: I didn't want to hear anything but I heard his voice.

79
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,570
Min Seong: I didn't hear what he said.

80
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:30,800
(Seon Woo: Just because he called me doesn't mean he has feelings for me)
Min Seong: I didn't hear what he said.

81
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:37,760
Just because he called me doesn't mean he has feelings for me.
(Seon Woo: Just because he called me doesn't mean he has feelings for me)

82
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:42,390
Seon Woo: He just called to say thank you.

83
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,000
(Hyeong Joon came back to his room after the call)

84
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,740
Yung Hee: I can't see anything in your face.

85
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:54,680
Hyeong Joon: This is just my normal face.

86
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,730
Yung Hee: How's it? Did you receive it?

87
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,170
-Hyeong Joon: You asked me if I received the message?
-Yeah.

88
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,320
Hyeong Joon: Ah, voice message? No.

89
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,690
-What?
-No.

90
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:02,450
-No?
-No.

91
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:05,600
-Yung Hee: How about the call? Did you call someone?
-Hyeong Joon: Yes.

92
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,820
Yung Hee: Min Seong?

93

-Hyeong Joon: No.
-What?

94
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,310
-No.
-Yung Hee: Don't lie to me again.

95
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,480
Yung Hee: I must have called Min Seong.

96
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,740
-Yung Hee: I know you.
-Hyeong Joon: You're quick-witted.

97
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:21,750
Yung Hee: What if I suddenly receive a message saying the calling time is over?

98
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,600
That would be…

99
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,610
(Yung Hee, please go to the phone booth, and after confirming the voice messages, express feelings to someone you have a crush on within 30 seconds)
That would be…

100
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:25,170
(Yung Hee, please go to the phone booth, and after confirming the voice messages, express feelings to someone you have a crush on within 30 seconds)

101
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:26,540
-It's hard to say how I feel.
-Bye.
(Yung Hee, please go to the phone booth, and after confirming the voice messages, express feelings to someone you have a crush on within 30 seconds)

It's hard to say how I feel. I'll be back soon.
(Yung Hee, please go to the phone booth, and after confirming the voice messages, express feelings to someone you have a crush on within 30 seconds)

103
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:29,470
It's hard to say how I feel. I'll be back soon.

104
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,540
Hyeong Joon: Don't call me.

105
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,280
Yung Hee: Why would I call you?

106
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,690
-Hyeong Joon: Then you run downstairs?
-Yung Hee: I didn't say who I'll call.

107
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,590
(Sighing)

108
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:47,210
Yung Hee: To be honest, I'm tired and not looking forward to it.

109
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,020
You have one new message.

110
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,250

114
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,100
Chung-ook: I wish that could come true.

115
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:27,550
Chung-ook: Anyway, see you soon. Bye.

116

125
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,159
Yung Hee: You've been hearing it all day.

126
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,850
Yung Hee: I'm just curious about what you're doing

Yung Hee: I'll try my best to win his heart.

136
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,310
Yung Hee: During our date today,

137
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:28,410
Yung Hee: he didn't give me a positive answer.

138
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:32,320
Yung Hee: I think it's because he has feelings for me too.

139
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,539
Yung Hee: Why couldn't he just be honest with me? He's so bad.

Seong Ho: I'm having a lot of feelings

144
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:59,780
Seong Ho: because I haven't figured everything out.

145
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,610

00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,220
Seong Ho: I felt a bit sad.

163
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:12,220
Seong Ho: I could feel his emotions

164
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,660
Seong Ho: in his voice.

165
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,350
Seong Ho: It made me want to cry.

166
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,040
(The second voice message to Seong Ho)
The second message.

167
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,850

168
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,830
Hello, Seong Ho.

169
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,580
(Want to cry)

170
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,470
Jun Seong: I don't know what to say.

171
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:38,300
Jun Seong: Everything I said to you in the past four days,

172
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,640
Jun Seong: I meant them.

173
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,540
I can't see anyone except you.

174
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:52,070
Jun Seong: I was very happy today. I've been very happy

175
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,810
Jun Seong: and will be happy in the future.

176
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,210
Jun Seong: See you in the house.

177
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,410
(Sighing)

178
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,990
Seong Ho: I really wanted to cry.

179
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:13,530
Seong Ho: My feelings for Seon Woo

180
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:16,650
Seong Ho: are tangled with all the other feelings.

181
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:31,560
(Who will Seong Ho choose to call?)

182
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:37,710
Why hasn't anyone called me?

183
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,490
There are too many voice messages.

184
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,400
Maybe someone left a long message.

185
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,900
I've moved on from that. Wait a sec.

186
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,550
(Someone's phone is ringing)
I've moved on from that. Wait a sec.

What's going on?

189
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:47,860

-Jun Seong: Mine was greater.

197
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:14,430
Seong Ho: Don't forget your promise to travel with me.

198
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:15,980
Jun Seong: I won't forget. We'll definitely travel together.

199
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:20,220
-Seong Ho: Don't forget our promise.
-Jun Seong: I won't.

200
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,450
Seong Ho: Okay, I'm hanging up.

201
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:27,740
(Seong Ho and Jun Seong called each other for the first time)

202
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,660
Seong Ho: Every moment of our date,

203
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,060
Seong Ho: I felt very happy.

204
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:32,270
(Seong Ho: I've never been so happy before in the show or in my life)

205

206
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:40,970
Seong Ho: in the show or in my life. It was like a dream.

207
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:43,450
Seong Ho: Wonderful moments like that are rare.

208
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:51,400
(It's Min Seong's turn to call)

209
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:05,660
You have one new message.

210
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,880
Hyeong Joon: Min Seong, how could you give me cookies

211
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,480
Hyeong Joon: but choose someone else?

212
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,980
Hyeong Joon: What's going on? You need to explain everything, okay?

213
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:27,090
Min Seong: I anticipated it.

214
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:36,520
Min Seong: I've decided who to call today before I came out.

215
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:41,620
(On the other side, it's depressing in Hyeong Joon and Yung Hee's room)

216
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,460
Hyeong Joon: No calls.

217
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:46,730
Hyeong Joon: What do you think?

218
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,560
Hyeong Joon: There's nothing we can do, right?

219
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,750
Yung Hee: Let's go on a date tomorrow.

220
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,450
-Hyeong Joon: No.
-Yung Hee: Why?

221
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,360
Yung Hee: I got dumped every day.

222
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:57,370
(Bickering)
(Hyeong Joon: Not every day)
Yung Hee: I got dumped every day.

223
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,810

You dumped me.

228
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,420
-Me?

You can dump me too.
(Yes. You can dump me too)
(Meaningless bickering)

231
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,350
You can dump me too.

232
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,090
(Min Seong decided to call Hyeong Joon)

233
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:10,820
Hyeong Joon: Hello?

234
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,170
-Min Seong: Hello.
-Hyeong Joon: Mmm.

235
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,870
Min Seong: Do you know who I am?

236
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,410
Hyeong Joon: Min Seong, right?

237
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,710
Min Seong: I had a good day.

238
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:27,410
Hyeong Joon: Me too. Come to the patio later.

239
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:30,320
-Min Seong: I see.
-Okay.

240
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,270
(Smiling)

241
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,880
-Is that Min Seong?
-Yes.

242
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,700
Gosh.

243
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:42,750
What should I do?

244
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,880
(He's finally smiling again)
What should I do?

245
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,940
We were comforting each other just now.
(He's finally smiling again)

246
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,440
We were comforting each other just now.

247
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,340
(Min Seong's call lightened the atmosphere)
We were comforting each other just now.

248
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:47,550
(Min Seong's call lightened the atmosphere)

249
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,190
-We were about to take photos like this.
-Are you crazy?
(Min Seong's call lightened the atmosphere)

250
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,020
-We were about to take photos like this.
-Are you crazy?

251
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:56,710
Min Seong: I've made up my mind. It's Hyeong Joon.

252
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:59,830
Min Seong: By the way, Hyeong Joon smells really nice.

253
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:02,750
Min Seong: I like people who smell nice.

254
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,700
Min Seong: And his perfume smells really good.

255
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:11,330
(Lastly, it's Chung-ook's turn)

256
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,540
Chung-ook: I think my heart is empty.

257
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:24,500
(With an empty heart, he checks the mailbox)

258
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,060
No new message in your mailbox.

259
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,500
("No new message in your mailbox")
No new message in your mailbox.

260
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,270
("No new message in your mailbox")

261
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:48,050
(Chung-ook finally put down the phone)

262
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:52,620
Chung-ook: For a few seconds, I didn't want to call anyone.

263
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,610
Chung-ook: I was very frustrated.

264
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:56,870
Chung-ook: My mind went blank.

265
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,270
(After thinking for a long time, he picks up the phone again)

266
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,920
Yung Hee: Hello, I'm Yung Hee Kim.

267
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,980
Chung-ook: Hey, I'm Chung-ook.

268
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,080
Yung Hee: I got your voice message.

269
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,440
Chung-ook: You did? You've already been here?

270
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,330
Yes, I've been there.

271
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:27,190
Yung Hee: I keep telling everyone

272
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:30,790
Yung Hee: that meeting you is the best thing that has happened here.

273
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:31,840
Really?

274
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,210
Yung Hee: We must go bungee jumping and skydiving together.

275
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,750
Chung-ook: OK. Thank you.

276
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,950
-I see.
-Thank you so much.

277
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:45,200
-Chung-ook: OK. Let's have a drink later.

278
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,700
-Yung Hee: Okay.
-Okay.

279
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,780
(A bit cold but conveyed his feelings anyway)

280
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:54,410
Chung-ook: To be honest, I do have feelings for someone.

281
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:57,750
Chung-ook: But I didn't know what else to say.

282
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:01,070
Chung-ook: To win him over, I need to try harder to let him know me

283
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:04,180
Chung-ook: or repeat the same words I said before.

284
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:08,910
Chung-ook: Maybe just receiving a message can make someone happy.

285
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:11,099
Chung-ook: I thought it'd be fine to call without thinking too much.

286
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:11,130
So I called him.

287
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,050
(Chung-ook: So I called him)
So I called him.

288
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:14,960
(Chung-ook: So I called him)

289
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,900
(The calling time is over)

290
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:25,020
(The calling time is over)

291
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:28,630
Seon Woo: After I tried it, I realized

292
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:32,350
Seon Woo: that it took a lot of courage to call someone

293
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:38,690
Seon Woo: who wouldn't call back.

294
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:47,660
(Chung-ook is sitting alone in the room)

295
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,140
Seong Ho: Are you okay?

296
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,600
Seong Ho: Hyeong Jin told me.

297
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,330
-Chung-ook: Really?
-Yes.

298
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,270
Seong Ho: Do you want to be alone?

299
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:08,990
-Chung-ook: I don't know.
-Seong Ho: You feel helpless, right?

300
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:10,160
(Chung-ook: Yeah)

301
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,300
Yeah.
(Chung-ook: Yeah)

302
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:11,950
(Chung-ook: Yeah)

303
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:16,670
Chung-ook: I just think… I think

304
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:22,010
Chung-ook: this is useless. So I…

305
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:27,760
Chung-ook: I'm fine. You can go downstairs.

306
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,870
Seong Ho: Do you want to be alone for a while?

307
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,280
Seong Ho: You need time to figure things out, right?

308
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,910
Yes.

309
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,220
(Patting)

310
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,640
-I don't know.
-It's okay.
(Patting)

311
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,230
-I don't know.
-It's okay.

312
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,900
Seong Ho: Fighting.

313
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,020
-Seong Ho: See you later.
-Chung-ook: Okay.

314
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,550
Seong Ho: Should I turn off the lights?

315
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,380
Chung-ook: No. It's OK.

316
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,060
Seong Ho: Tell me when you feel better.

317
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,300
(Nodding)
Seong Ho: Tell me when you feel better.

318
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:03,950
(Seong Ho left Chung-ook to process his feelings alone)

319
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,630
Chung-ook: I must be crazy.

320
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:23,300
(Finally, he's crying)

321
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,250
Chung-ook: It was so hard.

322
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:41,950
Chung-ook: I never cried in my last eight-year relationship.

323
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:47,720
Chung-ook: I was depressed after breaking up, but I didn't cry.

324
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,600
Chung-ook: I don't know how to express my emotions.

I like kimchi.

494
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:14,010
(Seong Ho suddenly starts running)

495
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:19,720
(Today's mission is finally out)

496
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,190
Hyeong Joon: Oh.

497
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,250
Seong Ho: Bye.

498
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,380
Hyeong Joon: Why?

499
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,690
Hyeong Joon: Hey, give me the card. They haven't seen it yet.

500
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:41,810
-Really?
-Hyeong Joon: I can't believe it.

501
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:43,030
Chung-ook: What's going on?

502
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,280
-Have you seen it?
-Chung-ook: What's this? What's this?

503
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,490
Hyeong Joon: Have you seen it?

504
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,280
Min Seong: What's going on?

505
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,910
Hyeong Joon: I see.

506
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:59,520
Hyeong Joon: I'll show it to others.

507
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,480
Min Seong: Unbelievable.

508
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:08,750
(Seong Ho and Jun Seong called each other last night, so they'll go on a date today.
Others will have a date together.)

509
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,660
(Embarrassed)

510
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,140
Min Seong: So funny.
(Embarrassed)

511
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:12,830
Min Seong: So funny.

512
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,370
Haven't you seen it?

513
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:16,030
-Seon Woo: What's it?
-Yung Hee: What's it?

514
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,510
Now?

515
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,510
What?

516
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,530
-Yung Hee: What's going on? So sudden.
-Is he not here?

517
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,610
Come.

518
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:27,100
Come here.
Come.

519
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:27,550
Come here.

520
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:28,990
(Mission Card)

521
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:32,710
(Running)

522
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,810
(They all find the mission hilarious)

523
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:38,450
Yesterday, I…
(They all find the mission hilarious)

524
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,880
I'm so angry.

525
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,460
You should've called him.

526
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:42,700
(Mission card. Just take it and go out)
You should've called him.

527
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,220
-Just take it and go out.
-I feel…
(Mission card. Just take it and go out)

528
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,680
Yung Hee: Get out.

529
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,090
Yung Hee: Get out.

530
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:47,710
Yung Hee: Don't sit down.

531
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:49,670
Seong Ho and Jun Seong called each other last night,

532
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:53,040
so they'll go on a date today.

533
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,940
Others will have a date together.

534
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,440
Jun Seong: Good job.

535
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,180
-You're so annoying.
-This is how it feels.

536
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,400
Out.

537
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:04,520
Seon Woo: I felt embarrassed and frustrated.

538
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:08,180
Seon Woo: It was a new feeling for me.

539
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:12,230
Hyeong Joon: I didn't call Min Seong yesterday.

540
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:13,550
Yung Hee: Oh.

541
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:15,750
My goodness.

542
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:16,880
What?

543
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,690
My goodness.

544
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:18,540
Can't believe it.

545
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:18,660
(Patting)
Can't believe it.

546
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,720
(Patting)

547
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,060
Seon Woo: Hey, I'm sorry.

548
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,030
Hyeong Joon: Not at all.

549
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:25,170
Hyeong Joon: This is so bad.

550
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:27,210
Hyeong Joon: If I had called Min Seong yesterday,

551
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:29,380
Hyeong Joon: I could go on a date with him today, right?

552
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:32,730
(Sighing)

553
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:35,710
(Sad)

554
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,310
No.
(Sad)

555
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:41,360
Seon Woo: Hyeong Joon called me yesterday.

556
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:46,080
Seon Woo: He thanked me for helping him and Min Seong.

557
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,780
Seon Woo: He happened to call me that day.

558
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:48,870
(Seon Woo: If he hadn't, he and Min Seong could've been a match)
Seon Woo: He happened to call me that day.

559
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:51,180
If he hadn't, he and Min Seong could have been a match.
(Seon Woo: If he hadn't, he and Min Seong could've been a match)

560
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:55,640
Seon Woo: I think my interference ruined their date.

561
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:59,480
Seon Woo: That's all I was thinking about.

562
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,770
Jun Seong: Have you seen this?

563
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:04,610
Seong Ho: Yes. I'm the first one to see it.

564
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:05,780
Jun Seong: Why didn't you tell me?

565
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,160
Seong Ho: Because I was brushing my teeth.

566
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:11,730
Seong Ho: But yesterday,

567
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:11,810
(Seong Ho: Didn't Hyeong Joon call Min Seong?)
Seong Ho: But yesterday,

568
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:13,440
didn't Hyeong Joon call Min Seong?
(Seong Ho: Didn't Hyeong Joon call Min Seong?)

569
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,660
Jun Seong: I'm confused too.

570
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,680
Seong Ho: What's going on between them?

571
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,180
Seong Ho: What are you going to wear?

572
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,670
Jun Seong: Just this.

573
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:22,480
-Seong Ho: Are you sure?
-Yes. I came out in it.

574
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,210
Jun Seong: Do I need to change?

575
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:25,610
-Do you want to see it?
-Seong Ho: You don't have other clothes, do you?

576
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:27,150
-Jun Seong: Other clothes?
-Yes.

577
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:28,010
Jun Seong: I have.

578
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:30,230
Jun Seong: Does anyone have green clothes?

579
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:32,070
Seong Ho: Hello, we're here to buy clothes.

580
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,350
Seong Ho: Do you have green clothes?

581
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,250
(Seon Woo's racks)

582
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:37,400
Jun Seong: These colors are a bit dull.
(Seon Woo's racks)

583
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,300
Yung Hee: I do, but I don't want to lend it to you.

584
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:39,430
I do, but I don't want to lend it to you.

585
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:41,010
(The youngest man is jealous)
I do, but I don't want to lend it to you.

586
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:41,250
-Show me.
-But it's too bright.
(The youngest man is jealous)
I do, but I don't want to lend it to you.

587
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:41,490
-Show me.
-But it's too bright.

588
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:43,200
(Yung Hee: It's green but too bright)
-Show me.
-But it's too bright.

589
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:44,990
-It's too bright.
-It's okay.

590
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:46,480
Seong Ho: This clothing store is lame.

591
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,860
Jun Seong: Oh, clothes here are a little dull.

592
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,540
Seon Woo: That's too much.

593
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,870
Seon Woo: Are you talking about my clothes?

594
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:51,620
Jun Seong: I don't know whose clothes they are.

595
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:54,510
Seon Woo: I suddenly found that they came to my room

596
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:56,210
Seon Woo: and checked my wardrobe.

597
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:58,850
Seon Woo: And they said that my clothes are too dull.

598
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:01,420
Seon Woo: Then they went out hand in hand.

599
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,180
Seon Woo: I was speechless.

600
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,340
(Ridiculous)
Seon Woo: I was speechless.

601
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,450
I can't believe it.

602
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:09,060
Yung Hee: Is Seon Woo a saint?

603
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:14,010
Yung Hee: How could he watch them laughing and do nothing?

604
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:15,550
Jun Seong: Why didn't they call each other?

605
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,630
-Why didn't they call each other?
-I don't know.

606
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:18,410
Yung Hee: Yes.

607
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:19,830
But yesterday,

608
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:26,470
Seong Ho: Hyeong Joon said he called someone he's grateful to.

609
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:27,810
Gosh.

610
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:28,050
This is so…

611
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:29,140
(Depressed)
This is so…

612
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:30,830
Yung Hee: I wore it on the second day.

613
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,460
Jun Seong: It's OK. The color is so bright.

614
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,630
-Jun Seong: The tone is different.
-Different.

615
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:35,320
Seong Ho: It's a bit different.

616
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,890
Jun Seong: Let's borrow this.

617
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:37,860
Seong Ho: This one?

618
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,050
O-Okay.

619
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,380
Okay.

620
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,490
-Jun Seong: You don't sound very sure.
-Seong Ho: Okay.

621
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:45,300
Okay.

622
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,770
-Jun Seong: Should we borrow it?
-Okay.

623
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:48,560
Seong Ho: Ask him first.

624
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:48,970
-This is Chung-ook's.
-Chung-ook.

625
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:50,450
(Seong Ho: Chung-ook, can we borrow this couple jacket?)
-This is Chung-ook's.
-Chung-ook.

626
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:51,520
Can we borrow this jacket?
(Seong Ho: Chung-ook, can we borrow this couple jacket?)

627
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,490
Chung-ook: Ah, you want to wear the couple outfits?

628
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:56,270
Seong Ho: Both of them are yours?

629
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:00,150
Seong Ho: I'll go downstairs and ask around.

630
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,520
Chung-ook: Go ahead. I can lend mine to you.

631
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,980
-Jun Seong: Go grill Hyeong Joon.
-I won't wear it.

632
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,070
Seong Ho: OK.

633
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,560
-Grill.
-Jun Seong: Ask him what he is doing.

634
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,580
Seong Ho: What he is doing?

635
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,510
Seong Ho: Aren't you in a relationship?

636
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:10,190
Seong Ho: Are you Baek Ji-young?

637
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,770
Seong Ho: Won't you fall in love again?

638
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:13,670
Jun Seong: Ask him if he was shot.

639
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:17,790
(In the kitchen, Min Seong is with Hyeong Jin who's washing the dishes)

640
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,180
Thank you.

641
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:23,610
Hyeong Joon: So many dishes.

642
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:23,730
(Glance)
Hyeong Joon: So many dishes.

643
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:24,470
(Glance)

644
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:28,290
Min Seong: Let me help you.

645
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:29,480
Hyeong Jin: You'll help me?

646
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,670
Min Seong: Yes. Too many dishes.

647
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:34,100
Seon Woo: Look, I…

648
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:37,670
Seon Woo: I was afraid something like this would happen.

649
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:38,980
Seon Woo: This shouldn't happen again.

650
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:42,380
Seon Woo: The timing… Unbelievable.

651
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:46,490
Hyeong Joon: The crew is waiting for this moment.

652
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:52,230
Min Seong: It's a pity.

653
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:57,730
Min Seong: But I don't like it when they do this.

654
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:59,990
Hyeong Jin: Can you get me a cup of coffee?

655
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:01,270
-Min Seong: A cup of coffee?
-Okay.

656
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,600
Okay.

657
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:07,880
More dirty dishes?

658
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,429
I thought we'd washed them all.

659
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,940
(Hyeong Joon stays by Min Seong's side)

660
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:13,969
Hyeong Joon: Because I somehow felt guilty too.
(Hyeong Joon stays by Min Seong's side)

661
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:18,120
Hyeong Joon: Because I somehow felt guilty too.

662
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:21,120
Hyeong Joon: So I kept hanging around Min Seong.

663
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,449
Hyeong Jin: I hope it can be peaceful today.

664
00:34:37,969 --> 00:34:39,420
Min Seong: Do you want some coffee?

665
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,440
Hyeong Joon: Yes.

666
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,570
Min Seong: Let me get you a cup of coffee.

667
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:43,540
-Hyeong Joon: No, no, no.
-No?

668
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,330
Min Seong: You don't want coffee?

669
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:47,090
Min Seong: Do you want it or not?

670
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:48,050
Hyeong Joon: Do you want it?

671
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:50,500
-Min Seong: Yes.
-Hyeong Joon: Then I want some too.

672
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,630
Min Seong: What? Why do you mimic me?

673
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:53,070
Hyeong Joon: I like it.

674
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:57,110
-Seong Ho: Brother Hyeong Joon.
-No, brother.

675
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:58,130
Seong Ho: Lend me your clothes.

676
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,820
-What? -Lend me your clothes.

677
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:00,860
-Hyeong Joon: Flowers?
-Seong Ho: Clothes.

678
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:04,350
-Hyeong Joon: What flowers?
-Seong Ho: That baseball jacket.

679
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:06,380
Hyeong Joon: You want to borrow my jacket? Sure. I'll lend it to you.

680
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,880
Hyeong Joon: Go try it on and see if it fits.

681
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:15,450
Hyeong Jin: Is there anyone you want to date?

682
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:17,490
Hyeong Jin: Not anyone you've dated.

683
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,630
Someone else.

684
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,560
Hyeong Joon: I don't think so.

685
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,140
Hyeong Joon: Anyway, I have had a date with him.

686
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,160
-With Min Seong?
-Hyeong Joon: Because I have dated Min Seong.

687
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,660
Hyeong Jin: You're kind of a pacifist.

688
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:30,400
-Me? -Yes.

689
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,280
Hyeong Joon: A little.

690
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,400
Hyeong Jin: If

691
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,310
Hyeong Jin: you have a lover,

692
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:39,450
Hyeong Jin: no, someone you like,

693
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:44,790
Hyeong Jin: but a friend of yours or someone else also likes him,

694
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:47,190
Hyeong Jin: will you back off or…

695
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:49,610
Hyeong Joon: I won't back off.

696
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:53,420
Hyeong Joon: I'll respect his choice.

697
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,970
Hyeong Joon: I'll just do what I should do.

698
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:57,710
-Hyeong Joon: Let him make the decision.
-Okay.

699
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,250
Hyeong Jin: As for the current

700
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:04,780
Hyeong Jin: relationship among me, Hyeong Joon, and Min Seong,

701
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:07,580
Hyeong Jin: I want to ask him indirectly.

702
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:13,670
Hyeong Jin: But I won't put too much meaning into Hyeong Joon's answer.

703
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:18,970
As long as I like someone, I'll strive for his love.

704
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,010
Seong Ho: Hello, I'm here to see the jacket.

705
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:23,050
Chung-ook: OK.

706
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:25,100
Chung-ook: How about this?

707
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,050
Seong Ho: Is this the jacket I ordered?

708
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:29,720
Chung-ook: Yes, this is in a small size. It should fit well.

709
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:34,360
Seong Ho: It's a little small. A little small.

710
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:37,040
Chung-ook: It suits you.

711
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:37,910
(Oh)

712
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:40,060
Seong Ho: I need to wear a T-shirt inside this.

713
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:40,520
Right?

714
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,930
-Jun Seong: Seong Ho.
-Seong Ho: Yes?

715
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:44,620
Seong Ho: What?

716
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,350
Jun Seong: I need to try this on.

717
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,500
(Jun Seong tries on Hyeong Joon's jacket)

718
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,310
Jun Seong: It suits me well.

719
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:09,420
Chung-ook: Oh, it suits you so well.

720
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:12,060
-Yung Hee: Oh, wearing that. Okay.
-Gosh.

721
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,100
(Hey)
-Yung Hee: Oh, wearing that. Okay.
-Gosh.

722
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:13,560
-Yung Hee: Oh, wearing that. Okay.
-Gosh.

723
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,020
It's so annoying.

724
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:17,440
-Yung Hee: Go get the clothes.
-Hyeong Joon: Do you want to borrow my shoes, too?

725
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:17,700
(Shaking his head)
-Yung Hee: Go get the clothes.
-Hyeong Joon: Do you want to borrow my shoes, too?

726
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,560
(Shaking his head)

727
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:23,670
Hyeong Jin: Oh, you look good. You look like a college student.

728
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:25,200
(Making a V gesture)
(Chung-ook: The jackets suit Jun Seong and Seong Ho both well)

729
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,460
The jackets suit them both well.
(Making a V gesture)
(Chung-ook: The jackets suit Jun Seong and Seong Ho both well)

730
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,950
-Hyeong Jin: Do you want to go smoke?
-Hyeong Joon: Okay.

731
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,460
Where's Seong Ho?

732
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,230
Hyeong Jin: What do you think of this situation? Is it fun?

733
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:39,180
-Hyeong Joon: Did you ask me if it was fun?
-Hyeong Jin: Or do you just feel tired?

734
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:42,670
Hyeong Joon: No, I was busy adjusting at first. I was a little tired then.

735
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,870
Hyeong Joon: I seldom showed it.

736
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:48,300
Hyeong Joon: Now it's more and more like a battlefield.

737
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,410
Hyeong Joon: Anyway, it has nothing to do with me.

738
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:59,100
Hyeong Joon: But until two days ago,

739
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:02,740
Hyeong Joon: I didn't talk much or listen to others.

740
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:05,180
Hyeong Joon: I heard nothing because I didn't talk to others much.

741
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,700
Hyeong Joon: You know what I mean, right?

742
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:10,200
Hyeong Joon: Since I made it public, I now know many things.

743
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,030
Hyeong Joon: I didn't know those things before.

744
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:17,750
Hyeong Joon: I also feel a sense of crisis now.

745
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:20,300
Hyeong Jin: But being in this place,

746
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,530
Hyeong Jin: I can say you have to fight. We fight for each other.

747
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:27,300
Hyeong Jin: You can't help but feel competitive.

748
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:30,350
Hyeong Joon: Everyone is hiding a dagger in a smile.

749
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,660
Right?

750
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:36,550
Hyeong Jin: If it goes on like this, will you change your face in the end?

751
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,870
-Hyeong Jin: Will you take out an electric saw?
-Hyeong Joon: Sixth sense.

752
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:41,320
Hyung Jin: Giving us an unexpected ending.

753
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,600
Yung Hee: How is my skin?

754
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,520
Yung Hee: I've had a lot of zits, right?

755
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:49,020
Chung-ook: But it doesn't look dirty.

756
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,810
(Watch carefully)
Chung-ook: But it doesn't look dirty.

757
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:53,040
Yung Hee: But why do I mind it so much?

758
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,150
Yung Hee: What about dark circles? Are they all right?

759
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:57,360
Chung-ook: I don't think they're very serious, either.

760
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,740
Yung Hee: Can you help me check it?

761
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:02,750
-Yung Hee: Fix it for me. I'll take a look at you too.
-Chung-ook: There's still time anyway.

762
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:07,280
Chung-ook: Take care of your skin when you're still in your early 20s.

763
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,060
Yung Hee: I'm going to take care of my skin starting today.

764
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:11,090
(Clapping)
Yung Hee: I'm going to take care of my skin starting today.

765
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:17,790
(Chung-ook's hand touches Yung Hee's face)

766
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:22,590
Chung-ook: It feels different.

767
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:24,820
Chung-ook: Yung Hee asked me to put a little makeup on him.

768
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,980
Chung-ook: I put on a base of makeup for him.

769
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:34,190
Chung-ook: I've never felt such complicated emotions all at once before.

770
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,990
-Hyeong Joon: Which shoes should I wear?
-It's the opposite of me.

771
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:38,000
Hyeong Joon: Which pair is better?

772
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,130
-But I think this kind…
-Hyeong Joon: Which pair is better?

773
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:41,210
They're not suitable.

774
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:43,600
Jun Seong: It looks better with Air Force style.
-Hyeong Joon: This pair or that pair?

775
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:45,060
Jun Seong: It looks better with Air Force style.

776
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,000
-Hyeong Joon: This pair? -Jun Seong: If you wear those, you'll look like a white bear.

777
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:47,980
-This pair? -Yes.

778
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:48,820
-Jun Seong: It looks better with Air Force style.
-OK.

779
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,490
Hyeong Joon: They're better than the black ones, right?

780
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:51,730
Jun Seong: Yes. Do you want to borrow mine?

781
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:52,210
(Jun Seong: You can wear them together with Min Seong)
Jun Seong: Yes. Do you want to borrow mine?

782
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:53,760
-Me? -You two can wear them together.
(Jun Seong: You can wear them together with Min Seong)

783
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,130
Jun Seong: Do you wear size 260?

784
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:56,310
Hyeong Joon: I wear 260, but…

785
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:56,410
(Jun Seong: Min Seong wears size 250, right? He can wear 250)
Hyeong Joon: I wear 260, but…

786
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:58,270
Min Seong wears size 250, right? He can wear 250.
(Jun Seong: Min Seong wears size 250, right? He can wear 250)

787
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,900
Hyeong Joon: Who? But the air force itself…

788
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,490
Hyeong Joon: Ask him first. I'm fine with anything.

789
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:02,650
Well.

790
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,730
-Jun Seong: Sir. -Yes?

791
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:07,650
Jun Seong: Do you want my shoes, "Soybean Paste?"

792
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:08,490
Min Seong: No, thanks.

793
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,140
Jun Seong: Hyeong Joon said he wanted to wear "Soybean Paste."

794
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,110
Min Seong: I'm fine.

795
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:13,780
Jun Seong: But your outfit doesn't match "Soybean Paste."

796
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:16,110
(Looking around)

797
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:21,670
Jun Seong: Don't you have any clothes with an Activity Style? A more casual outfit.

798
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:23,330
Min Seong: Activity?

799
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:26,550
Jun Seong: Yes. A little more like Hyeong Joon's style.

800
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,730
Jun Seong: So it can create a kind of ambiance.

801
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:30,980
Min Seong: It's OK. We coordinated yesterday anyway.

802
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,880
Jun Seong: Are you drawing a line because he didn't call you?

803
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,910
Min Seong: No, it's not like that.

804
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:36,670
Min Seong: It's not like that.

805
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:41,470
Jun Seong: Don't you have wide-legged pants?

806
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:43,000
Min Seong: Wide-legged pants? I didn't bring such clothes here.

807
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,760
Min Seong: All I brought are formal clothes.

808
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:55,810
Jun Seong: Where's my coffee?

809
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:58,050
(Here)

810
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:04,000
(Jun Seong: I wanted to match Hyeong Joon's and Min Seong's clothes)

811
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,800
I wanted to match Hyeong Joon and Min Seong's clothes.
(Jun Seong: I wanted to match Hyeong Joon's and Min Seong's clothes)

812
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,980
Jun Seong: Min Seong doesn't have any suitable clothes.

813
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,490
Seong Ho: Yung Hee has green clothes.

814
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:13,450
Jun Seong: No, I wanted to go with Hyeong Joon's style.

815
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:16,140
Jun Seong: Because Min Seong wears formal clothes every day.

816
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,770
Seong Ho: Are we going for an outing today?

817
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:18,940
Jun Seong: Are you the minister today?

818
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,770

Jun Seong: Can everyone go this high?

1062
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:45,520
Seong Ho: Maybe it's because you're heavier than me. Right?

1063
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:49,730
Jun Seong: Did those kids go this far?

1064

1069
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:18,660
Seong Ho: Ah, I'm a little worried about what kind of wish he'd say.

1070
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:22,030
Seong Ho: Because he's naughty.

1071
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:25,530
Seong Ho: I dare not imagine it.

1072
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:29,720

Jun Seong: If there's nothing else to buy,

1087
00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:13,880

1088
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:16,470

-Jun Seong: Dozens.

1089

In bunches?

1090
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:21,440
Jun Seong: Ah, it's a medical hospital game.

1091
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,560
It's so childish.

1092
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:24,790
Seong Ho: It's for pupils.

1093
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:27,190

-What?

1094
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:28,460

Seong Ho: I'll take this with me, okay?

1100
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:42,340
Jun Seong: you never answered my questions. You just said what you want to say,

1101
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:43,440
-and then hang up.
-It's not that serious, is it?

1102
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:48,200
Seong Ho: It's fake. It's thinner than a Samsung phone.

1103
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:49,990
Jun Seong: Ah, it's so funny.

1104

00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:18,990
-Jun Seong: His eyes are open.
-It's of bad quality.

1118
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:21,660
-Jun Seong: What if they accuse us of doing it?
-Seong Ho: No, no.

1119
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:22,900
-No.
-Jun Seong: Pretend you didn't see it.

1120
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:25,000

Seong Ho: Actually, I don't use a phone chain recently.

1127
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:38,470
Look at it.

1128
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:42,490
Seong Ho: We went to the souvenir store

1129
00:52:42,490 --> 00:52:45,260

1132
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:53,290
Seong Ho: and like the universe.

1133
00:52:53,290 --> 00:52:55,690
Seong Ho: So we each bought one as a couple.

1134
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:58,670
Jun Seong: Instead of declaring our relationship as a couple,

1135
00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:05,260
Jun Seong: it's more like an expression of the same feelings from us.

1136

(Men's House) (Six men are preparing for a group date)

1137
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:09,270
How do we share the cars? We have to decide on that too.
(Men's House) (Six men are preparing for a group date)

1138
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:11,980
How do we share the cars? We have to decide on that too.

1139
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,500
I think we should decide first. About later.

1140
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:14,790
Chung-ook: Who wants to ride in my car?

1141
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:16,200
-Today… -Who wants to ride?

1142
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:16,250
(Yung Hee: Wait… Are Chung-ook and Hyeong Joon driving? )
(Chung-ook: Yes)
-Today… -Who wants to ride?

1143
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:18,120
-Wait. Are you two driving?
-Yes.
(Yung Hee: Wait… Are Chung-ook and Hyeong Joon driving? )
(Chung-ook: Yes)

1144
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:19,390
-Then I'll go first.
-Hyeong Jin: Are they driving?
(Yung Hee: Wait… Are Chung-ook and Hyeong Joon driving? )
(Chung-ook: Yes)

1145
00:53:19,390 --> 00:53:22,210
-Then I'll go first.
-Hyeong Jin: Are they driving?

1146
00:53:22,210 --> 00:53:22,450
I want…

1147
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:22,800
(Hyeong Jin: I want to ride in Hyeong Joon's car)
I want…

1148
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,640
Then I'll take Hyeong Joon's car.
(Hyeong Jin: I want to ride in Hyeong Joon's car)

1149
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:26,640
What do you mean?

1150
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:30,590
Hyeong Jin: Chung-ook and Hyeong Joon will drive later.

1151
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:32,910
Hyeong Jin: We can take two separate cars.

1152
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:34,550
Hyeong Jin: I'll take Hyeong Joon's car.

1153
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:35,550
Seon Woo: Okay.

1154
00:53:37,070 --> 00:53:40,460
Seon Woo: Oh, okay. Then Min Seong can take that car.

1155
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:44,160
Hyeong Jin: Min Seong, you can really sleep anywhere.

1156
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:47,640
Min Seong: It may be narcolepsy. I fall asleep accidentally.

1157
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:53,130
Hyeong Jin: Are you too used to this place?

1158
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:54,650
Min Seong: Is that so?

1159
00:53:54,650 --> 00:53:56,320
Yung Hee: Are you up? Yes.

1160
00:53:57,140 --> 00:54:00,740
Yung Hee: Ah, I'm sleepy. I'm so sleepy that I can faint.

1161
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:02,630
Yung Hee: What is that? Is it to reduce swelling?

1162
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:06,780
Hyeong Jin: Yes. Min Seong and I will take Hyeong Joon's car.

1163
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:07,310
Oh, really?

1164
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:07,790
(Min Seong is silent)
Oh, really?

1165
00:54:07,790 --> 00:54:09,100
(Min Seong is silent)

1166
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:10,200
I'm asking if you want to ride with us.
(Min Seong is silent)

1167
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:10,820
I'm asking if you want to ride with us.

1168
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:12,670
Hyeong Jin: I want to ride in Hyung Joon's car.

1169
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:14,900
Hyeong Joon: Me? Do you want to ride in my car?

1170
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:18,170
-Yes. Can I?
-Hyeong Joon: You've never been in my car.

1171
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,060
-Yung Hee: Then let's divide like that.
-What do you think it'll be?

1172
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:21,440
Let's just sit like that.

1173
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,320
Yung Hee: Let's take Chung-ook's car.

1174
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:24,450
Chung-ook: We can sit separately like that.

1175
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:24,510
(Yong Hee: Me, you, and Seon Woo, we three take one car, and Hyeong Jin, Hyeong Joon, and Min Seong, you three take the other)
(Chung-ook: Okay)
Chung-ook: We can sit separately like that.

1176
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:26,210
Yes, the three of us take one car. They three take the other.
(Yong Hee: Me, you, and Seon Woo, we three take one car, and Hyeong Jin, Hyeong Joon, and Min Seong, you three take the other)
(Chung-ook: Okay)

1177
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:27,100
Okay.
(Yong Hee: Me, you, and Seon Woo, we three take one car, and Hyeong Jin, Hyeong Joon, and Min Seong, you three take the other)
(Chung-ook: Okay)

1178
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:31,710
-Hyeong Jin: Let's go. Are you ready?
-Min Seong: Yeah.

1179
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,370
Hyeong Jin: I have to go to the bathroom.

1180
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:42,580
(Sigh)

1181
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:49,230
-Min Seong: I won't let you go.
-Me?

1182
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:50,390
I won't let you go.

1183
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:52,630
Seon Woo: What's wrong? I can't help it.

1184
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:54,970
-Isn't that right?
-Min Seong: Why am I automatically assigned to their car?

1185
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:57,150
Seon Woo: Just together… Wait. What do you want?

1186
00:54:57,150 --> 00:54:57,230
(Min Seong: I don't know… Actually, I'm not comfortable with either Hyeong Joon or Hyeong Jin)
Seon Woo: Just together… Wait. What do you want?

1187
00:54:57,230 --> 00:55:00,680
I don't know… Actually, I'm not comfortable with either Hyeong Joon or Hyeong Jin.
(Min Seong: I don't know… Actually, I'm not comfortable with either Hyeong Joon or Hyeong Jin)

1188
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:04,420
Seon Woo: No. I think it's still okay for you to change your mind now.

1189
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:07,140
Seon Woo: But I think

1190
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:09,790
Seon Woo: it may help you to make up your mind.

1191
00:55:09,790 --> 00:55:12,690
Min Seong: No, I think... I think I should give up both of them.

1192
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:14,920
-Seon Woo: Stop kidding. Let's see.
-I mean it.

1193
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,860
Min Seong: I might have to give up both.

1194
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:20,240
-Min Seong: Who wants to switch with me?
-What?

1195
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:21,700
-Min Seong: Who wants to switch places with me?
-Seon Woo: Why?

1196
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:22,030
-Why?
-I want to ride in Chung-ook's car.

1197
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:23,900
(Min Seong: I want to ride in Chung-ook's car)
-Why?
-I want to ride in Chung-ook's car.

1198
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:25,040
I want to try it once.
(Min Seong: I want to ride in Chung-ook's car)

1199
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:25,100
I want to try it once.

1200
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:25,600
(Seon Woo: I think you prefer Hyeong Joon's car, don't you?
I want to try it once.

1201
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:28,990
I think you prefer Hyeong Joon's car, don't you?
(Seon Woo: I think you prefer Hyeong Joon's car, don't you?

1202
00:55:28,990 --> 00:55:30,960
-Seon Woo: Don't you?
-Min Seong: Er…

1203
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,490
(Hyeong Joon called Yung Hee aside alone)

1204
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:37,260
-What?
-Do you want to drive?
(Hyeong Joon called Yung Hee aside alone)

1205
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:37,790
-What?
-Do you want to drive?

1206
00:55:37,790 --> 00:55:42,140
Yung Hee: By the way, why did Min Seong suddenly say he didn't want to take your car?

1207
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:44,050
Hyeong Joon: It's OK. We don't have to ride together.

1208
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:45,980
Yung Hee: Then I'll drive.

1209
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:48,040
Hyeong Joon: Then we have to change members.

1210
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:49,330
-What?
-Hyeong Joon: We have to change members again.

1211
00:55:49,330 --> 00:55:52,010
Yung Hee: Ah, it's okay. Just go and tell them.

1212
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:58,830
Hyeong Joon: We have a new driver.

1213
00:55:58,830 --> 00:55:58,840
(Hyeong Joon: Chung-ook, Seon Woo, and Min Seong, the three sit together and I'll take this one)
Hyeong Joon: We have a new driver.

1214
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:01,250
The three sit together and I'll take this one.
(Hyeong Joon: Chung-ook, Seon Woo, and Min Seong, the three sit together and I'll take this one)

1215
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:04,680
-Hyeong Jin: Are you driving?
-Yung Hee: Yes.

1216
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:08,140
Hyeong Jin: I'll sit in Yung Hee's car. Is that OK?

1217
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:09,450
Seon Woo: Are you sure

1218
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:11,990
-Seon Woo: we can choose freely which car to take?
-Min Seong: Can't we?

1219
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:18,320
Hyeong Joon: I wanted to ride with Seon Woo and Min Seong,

1220
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:23,040
Hyeong Joon: but I felt Min Seong didn't like it.

1221
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:27,110
Hyeong Joon: So I was in a bad mood at that time.

1222
00:56:27,110 --> 00:56:30,450
Hyeong Joon: Though I felt sorry, I asked to sit in the other car.

1223
00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:33,150
Hyeong Joon: Because I was in a bad condition to drive.

1224
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:37,230
Hyeong Joon: I was in a bad mood.

1225
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,530
-Chung-ook: Min Seong, sit in the front.
-Min Seong: Should I sit in the front?

1226
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:42,590
Seon Woo: Why should I sit in the back?

1227
00:56:42,590 --> 00:56:45,050
Seon Woo: Why should I sit in the back?

1228
00:56:49,770 --> 00:56:51,970
-Hyeong Joon: See you later.
-Chung-ook: Please fasten your seat belt.

1229
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:53,610
Okay.

1230
00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:58,940
Min Seong: I think I feel uncomfortable being with Hyeong Joon and Hyeong Jin together.

1231
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:03,390
Min Seong: I think that's the main reason.

1232
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:10,500
Min Seong: If we are all together, I feel suffocated.

1233
00:57:13,790 --> 00:57:17,940
Min Seong: I don't know what I should say in that situation.

1234
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:23,630
Min Seong: So I think it's kind of awkward.

1235
00:57:24,030 --> 00:57:26,320
Min Seong: I feel so at ease here.

1236
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:27,690
Chung-ook: Because of the car?

1237
00:57:27,690 --> 00:57:30,590
Min Seong: Both the car and the atmosphere are comfortable.

1238
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:31,950
Seon Woo: Who makes you uncomfortable?

1239
00:57:31,950 --> 00:57:32,110
(Min Seong: Hyeong Joon and Hyeong Jin, those two)
Seon Woo: Who makes you uncomfortable?

1240
00:57:32,110 --> 00:57:34,830
Those two.
(Min Seong: Hyeong Joon and Hyeong Jin, those two)

1241
00:57:34,830 --> 00:57:35,650
(Min Seong: Hyeong Joon and Hyeong Jin, those two)

1242
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:38,600
Seon Woo: The fact you're not comfortable putting aside, haven't you already preferred one of them?

1243
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:39,520
-Min Seong: Me? -Yes.

1244
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:42,030
Min Seong: No, I don't prefer anyone.

1245
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:43,360
Why are you behaving like that, too?

1246
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:45,780
Seon Woo: You might end up like me if you keep sounding out…

1247
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:47,140
Min Seong: I'm not sounding out anyone.

1248
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:48,560
Min Seong: To be honest, I thought I could make a choice yesterday.

1249
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:48,700
(Seon Woo: Why did you get angry? "I'm not sounding out anyone")
Min Seong: To be honest, I thought I could make a choice yesterday.

1250
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:51,160
"I'm not sounding out anyone."
(Seon Woo: Why did you get angry? "I'm not sounding out anyone")

1251
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:54,060
Min Seong: But... No.

1252
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:56,790
Seon Woo: Oh, you thought you could make a choice, but you couldn't?

1253
00:57:56,790 --> 00:57:58,440
Min Seong: Yes, I thought I preferred one of them.

1254
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:01,110
-Min Seong: Yes. After our date, I thought I already preferred one.
-Uh-huh.

1255
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:04,110
Min Seong: But why? Why are they pushing me again?

1256
00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:05,700
Seon Woo: What do you think?

1257
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:09,070
Seon Woo: Both of them. Did you notice their love triangle?

1258
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:12,620
Chung-ook: Well, is there a problem?

1259
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:16,610
-No, well...
-Chung-ook: I think I know

1260
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:21,020
Chung-ook: who likes whom.

1261
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:21,060
But I don't know if there is a love triangle.

1262
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:24,220
(Chung-ook: But I don't know if there's a love triangle)
But I don't know if there is a love triangle.

1263
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:24,460
Who do you think is better? Jin or Joon?
(Chung-ook: But I don't know if there's a love triangle)
But I don't know if there is a love triangle.

1264
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:24,530
Who do you think is better? Jin or Joon?

1265
00:58:24,530 --> 00:58:30,190
(Seon Woo: Who do you think is better? Jin or Joon?)
Who do you think is better? Jin or Joon?

1266
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:31,290
Who do you think is better? Jin or Joon?

1267
00:58:32,850 --> 00:58:34,110
Jin-Joon.

1268
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:38,430
-Chung-ook: Personally, I think…
-Yeah.

1269
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:41,520
Chung-ook: If being in a relationship,

1270
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:44,660
Chung-ook: I might like Jin more, in terms of personality.

1271
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:48,180
Chung-ook: Joon is interesting,

1272
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:53,510
Chung-ook: but sometimes he's not serious enough.

1273
00:58:53,510 --> 00:58:57,600
Chung-ook: Because he wants to solve every problem without hard feelings.

1274
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,200
Chung-ook: In terms of personality…

1275
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:02,430
Seon Woo: Oh, I'm a little surprised.

1276
00:59:02,430 --> 00:59:02,470
(Min Seong: That's how I feel, because I talked more with Jin, Hyeong Jin)
Seon Woo: Oh, I'm a little surprised.

1277
00:59:02,470 --> 00:59:05,290
That's how I feel
(Min Seong: That's how I feel, because I talked more with Jin, Hyeong Jin)

1278
00:59:05,290 --> 00:59:07,560
because I talked more with Jin.
(Min Seong: That's how I feel, because I talked more with Jin, Hyeong Jin)

1279
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:08,110
(Min Seong: That's how I feel, because I talked more with Jin, Hyeong Jin)

1280
00:59:08,110 --> 00:59:09,940
I started to have feelings for Jin during our conversations.
(Min Seong: That's how I feel, because I talked more with Jin, Hyeong Jin)

1281
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:10,000
I started to have feelings for Jin during our conversations.

1282
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,630
(Min Seong: I started to have feelings for Jin during our conversations)
I started to have feelings for Jin during our conversations.

1283
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:13,280
Really?
(Min Seong: I started to have feelings for Jin during our conversations)

1284
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,360
Min Seong: At first, I wondered what was wrong with him.

1285
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:16,720
Min Seong: He didn't like what I liked.

1286
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:16,840
In my eyes, Joon is far far better.

1287
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:19,800
(Seon Woo: In my eyes, Joon is far far better)
In my eyes, Joon is far far better.

1288
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:20,830
(Seon Woo: It must be Joon, Hyeong Joon)

1289
00:59:20,830 --> 00:59:22,360
It must be Joon.
(Seon Woo: It must be Joon, Hyeong Joon)

1290
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:25,330
Seon Woo: I see. Isn't that too much?

1291
00:59:25,330 --> 00:59:27,670
Seon Woo: Okay. I won't set you up anymore.

1292
00:59:27,670 --> 00:59:31,460
Min Seong: But that's what I'm worried about.

1293
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:31,490
(Min Seong: I'm worried that Joon and I have different lifestyles)
Min Seong: But that's what I'm worried about.

1294
00:59:31,490 --> 00:59:36,360
I'm worried that Joon and I have different lifestyles.
(Min Seong: I'm worried that Joon and I have different lifestyles)

1295
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:39,360
Min Seong: And I don't really want to date famous people.

1296
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:39,710
-Right.
-I think it'll be stressful.

1297
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:41,420
(Min Seong: I think it'll be stressful)
(Chung-ook: You'd feel pressured?)
-Right.
-I think it'll be stressful.

1298
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:42,360
You'd feel pressured?
(Min Seong: I think it'll be stressful)
(Chung-ook: You'd feel pressured?)

1299
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:44,770
Yes, I'd feel pressured to date a celebrity.
(Min Seong: I think it'll be stressful)
(Chung-ook: You'd feel pressured?)

1300
00:59:44,770 --> 00:59:46,300
Chung-ook: Why?

1301
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:50,770
Min Seong: I'd feel tired in the end. I mind a lot of things.

1302
00:59:50,770 --> 00:59:52,530
Min Seong: Because if he knows a lot of people,

1303
00:59:52,530 --> 00:59:53,960
Min Seong: many people may contact him.

1304
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:56,690
Min Seong: Well, I still mind those things.

1305
00:59:56,690 --> 00:59:58,980
Min Seong: I didn't have any feelings for Hyeong Jin at first.

1306
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:01,160
Min Seong: I didn't think he was my type.

1307
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:03,140
Min Seong: But after our conversation, I found he's a nice guy.

1308
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:04,050
Really?

1309
01:00:04,050 --> 01:00:04,110
(Min Seong: Considering Joon's shortcomings in his different lifestyles, Jin suits me in this aspect)
Really?

1310
01:00:04,110 --> 01:00:09,500
Considering Joon's shortcomings in his different lifestyles, Jin suits me in this aspect,
(Min Seong: Considering Joon's shortcomings in his different lifestyles, Jin suits me in this aspect)

1311
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:09,620
(Min Seong: Hyeong Jin's lifestyle is the same as mine)
Considering Joon's shortcomings in his different lifestyles, Jin suits me in this aspect,
(Min Seong: Considering Joon's shortcomings in his different lifestyles, Jin suits me in this aspect)

1312
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:11,580
His lifestyle is the same as mine.
(Min Seong: Hyeong Jin's lifestyle is the same as mine)

1313
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:15,400
Min Seong: They both have advantages and disadvantages in different aspects.

1314
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,930
Seon Woo: If I fall in love with someone,

1315
01:00:17,930 --> 01:00:21,600
Seon Woo: these parts won't matter.

1316
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:25,590
Seon Woo: It must be hard to be in love because our lifestyles are different.

1317
01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:30,670
Seon Woo: But to me, those problems are not as important as the attraction.

1318
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:32,460
Min Seong: See? I guess I'm really an avoidant type of person.

1319
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:34,550
Seon Woo: Not avoidant, you're just realistic.

1320
01:00:34,550 --> 01:00:37,870
-Chung-ook: Yeah, you're not avoidant.
-Well.

1321
01:00:37,870 --> 01:00:40,190
Yung Hee: It's snowing again today.

1322
01:00:40,190 --> 01:00:42,080
-Hyeong Joon: It's snowing.
-Being…

1323
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:44,730
Yung Hee: Being able to pair up and go on a one-on-one date on a day like this,

1324
01:00:44,730 --> 01:00:44,840
(Yung Hee: Jun Seong and Seong Ho must be very happy)
Yung Hee: Being able to pair up and go on a one-on-one date on a day like this,

They must be very happy.

1327
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:48,130
Hyeong Jin: I know.

1328
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:50,740
Longxin Pavilion.

1329
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:53,990
Hyeong Joon: But to be honest, the reversal of today's mission is me, right?

1330
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,280
Hyeong Joon: Don't you think so?

1331
01:00:59,230 --> 01:01:00,700
Yung Hee: Did everything go well for you guys?

1332
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:03,030
Yung Hee: After today, tomorrow is the last day.

1333
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:04,850
Yung Hee: Wow, it's really the last day.

1334
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:09,110
Hyeong Joon: Tomorrow is the last day. Last night.

1335
01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:09,770
Yung Hee: Yes.

1336
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:16,060
For a long time…

1337
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:16,580
No, for a short time.

1338
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:20,820
(Correction: For a short time)
No, for a short time.

No, for a short time.

1340
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:25,560
We become friends who have feelings for each other.

1341
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:33,650
There's no need to say goodbye. Let's meet in Itaewon.

1342
01:01:33,650 --> 01:01:35,860
See you in Itaewon.

1343
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:38,150
Yung Hee: How about we go to Itaewon? The three of us.

(Look)

1357
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:03,080
Hyeong Jin: Then why are you walking like this?

1358
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:05,190
-Why? -Are you cold already?

1359
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:05,510
I'm a little scared.

1360
01:02:05,510 --> 01:02:07,340
(Men's first group date: karting)
I'm a little scared.

1361

Chung-ook: They're smaller than I thought.

1366
01:02:15,930 --> 01:02:17,060
-Sit on it. -You can step on it.

1367
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:18,340
Seon Woo: What is this?

1368
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:19,100
If you step on this, you'll rush out, right?

1369
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:20,680
(Everyone chooses a kart they like)
If you step on this, you'll rush out, right?

1370

(Everyone chooses a kart they like)

1371
01:02:22,130 --> 01:02:23,600
I can't step on it.

1372
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:25,070
The brake is on the left and the accelerator is on the right.

1373

(Before starting the karts, the six men learn safety instructions first)
The brake is on the left and the accelerator is on the right.

1374
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:28,060

(Before starting the karts, the six men learn safety instructions first)

1375
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:29,470
If you step on both together, you won't go forward. Just step on one.

1376
01:02:29,470 --> 01:02:30,710
The accelerator, the brake.

1377
01:02:30,710 --> 01:02:33,790
Step on the accelerator hard to move forward.

1378
01:02:33,790 --> 01:02:35,620
Yung Hee: Should we make a bet today?

1379
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:36,620
Min Seong: No.

1380
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:37,100
Okay, no bets then.

What do you think?
(Hyeong Joon: First of all, let Jun Seong and Seong Ho do the dishes today! What do you think?)

1388
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,180
Seon Woo: I'm afraid they won't come back today.

1389
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:46,880
They're not coming back?

1390
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:47,760
Will they stay out tonight?

1391
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:48,520
They won't come back.

1392
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:50,220

1397
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:56,420
Do the dishes and make supper.

1398
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:57,290
Hyeong Joon: Do you all agree?

1399
01:02:57,290 --> 01:02:58,000
-Yes. -OK.

1400
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,620
-OK. -OK.

1401
01:02:59,630 --> 01:03:01,050
(Ah)

1402
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:02,450
(Confused)

1403
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:02,760
Shouldn't we fix this?

1404
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:05,240
(Worried)
Shouldn't we fix this?

1405
01:03:05,510 --> 01:03:07,140
Seon Woo: You all should be careful. Don't get hit by me.

1406
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:07,910
Yung Hee: Do you have a driver's license?

1407
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:09,720
Seon Woo: Of course I do.

1408

-Yes. -One lap?

1417
01:03:21,710 --> 01:03:23,440
Hyeong Joon: Should I make it look real?

1418
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,700
Yung Hee: Make it real.

1419
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:29,520
(Start to drive like driving a car)

1420
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:30,430
What?

(Start to drive like driving a car)

1422

Hold on.
(Start to drive like driving a car)

1423

Seon Woo: Oh, washing dishes is not a big deal.

1424
01:03:34,970 --> 01:03:36,390
Min Seong: That's right. No big deal.

1425
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:38,490
Seon Woo: Washing dishes is not a big deal. Why risk your life?

1426
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:40,740
(Hyeong Joon passes the finish line first)

1427

No.
(Hyeong Joon passes the finish line first)

1428
