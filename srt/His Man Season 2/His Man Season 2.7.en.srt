00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:08,390
Seong Ho: I wanted to be Jun Seong's roommate to the end. I had this thought.

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,520
Seong Ho: I always thought about it.

6
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:16,000
(Seong Ho chose a single room after a lot of thought)

7
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:20,230
Seong Ho: I'm still wavering between Jun Seong and Seon Woo.

8
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:24,780
Seong Ho: I don't want to act like I'm giving someone more votes.

9
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:26,580
What about the five of us?

(The quad room and the other single room are left)

12
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,460
Do you have any preference?
(The quad room and the other single room are left)

13
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,400
Hyeong Jin: I choose the other single room.

14
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,060
Jun Seong: Me too.

15
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,540
Jun Seong: I want a single room too.

16
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,810
Hyeong Joon: Hyeong Jin gave me the single room on the first day.

17
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:40,830
Hyeong Joon: I wanted a single room actually.

18
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:41,960
Yung Hee: Now you change your mind? The quad room?

19
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,610
-Hyeong Joon: Yeah, I'm OK with the quad room. -Yung Hee: Let's go.

20
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,700
Jun Seong: Do you want the other single room?

21
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,540
Chung-ook: I choose the quad room.

22
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,990
Yung Hee: Then it's about you two. What's your decision?

23
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:56,250
Hyeong Jin: I recommend you to stay in the quad room. It's nice.

24
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:57,540
(Jun Seong: I don't want to)

25
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,300
I don't want to.
(Jun Seong: I don't want to)

26
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,000
Yung Hee: Seong Ho, which single room do you want? The one on the first or second floor?

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,070
Seon Woo: Yes. Your choice matters.

28
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:04,110
Seong Ho: The second floor.

29
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,240
Yung Hee: The single room on the second floor? OK.

30
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,700
-Jun Seong: Then I choose the quad room. -Okay.

31
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,870
Jun Seong: Seong Ho said he wanted the single room on the second floor.

32
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:15,130
Jun Seong: If I live on the second floor, I can go to him every day.

33
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:17,260
Hyeong Jin: Thank you.

34
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,110
Hyeong Jin: I almost screamed.

35
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,030
Hyeong Jin: I didn't show it. But I was happy.

What's wrong?

46
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:55,070
Min Seong: When we were changing rooms, I met Hyeong Jin and Hyeong Joon.

47
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:59,370
Min Seong: So, I smiled embarrassedly.

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,570
Hyeong Joon: I felt complicated

49
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,820
Hyeong Joon: I just wanted to get out quickly.

50
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,400
Hyeong Joon: It'd be awkward if we met.

51
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,340
Seong Ho: Let's move.

52
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,670
Jun Seong: What I worried about came true.

53
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,770
Jun Seong: Is this Hyeong Jin's?

54
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:21,070
-Seong Ho: It's mine. The spray is mine. -Okay.

55
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:30,120
Jun Seong: What a pity. Bye.

56
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,160
Jun Seong: I could only accept the reality.

57
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,230
Jun Seong: But at least we're on the same floor.

58
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,350
Jun Seong: Just think about it in an easy way.

59
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:42,320
Should I use the suitcase?

60
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,740
I went back and forth so many times.

61
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,570
-Seon Woo: Seong Ho, you are moving into my room, right? -Yes.

62
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:46,750
Seon Woo: I'll help you.

63
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,240
Seon Woo: I've almost packed my things.

64
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,079
Seong Ho: Seon Woo, move your things down here first.

65
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,650
Seon Woo: I did finish packing them up. Then I'll move them here first.

66
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,930
Seong Ho: You have to move yours first so that I can put my stuff in that room.

67
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,320
Seon Woo: Oh, okay.

68
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,110
Seong Ho: He wrote to Min Seong, so we were in that situation.

69
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,250
Seong Ho: Then he came to me and wanted to help me pack.

70
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:06,260
Seong Ho: He was so enthusiastic, which made me even angrier.

71
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,670
-Yung Hee: Now that I think about it, I don't need to move. -But the luggage...

72
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,690
Then you just need to put them back.

73
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,560
Yung Hee: I'm still in the same room. That's right.

74
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,630
Yung Hee: I shouldn't have packed.

75
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,540
Chung-ook: I knew this would happen.

76
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,750
Yung Hee: I shouldn't have packed in advance. It was tiring.

77
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,740
I'm going to keep everything the same.

81
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,270
Jun Seong: Which one is your bed?

82
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:30,470
Yung Hee: I sleep on the inner side, close to the window.

83
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,790
-Chung-ook: Can I take the window side? -Yung Hee: Oh, okay.

84
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,410
-Yung Hee: Do you want to sleep in the same bed with me? -Chung-ook: OK.

85
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:36,490
Yung Hee: Can you two sleep in the same bed?

86
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:37,380
Jun Seong: Yes, we don't care.

87
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,090
Okay, it's decided then.

88
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,370
Chung-ook: I said I wanted to sleep on the bed close to the window.

89
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,240
Chung-ook: And I wanted to sleep on the window side.

90
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,480
Chung-ook: It happened naturally.

91
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,000
Chung-ook: But honestly, I don't know...

92
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,880
Chung-ook: I don't know what I did today.

93
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:57,320
Chung-ook: I don't know what I wanted to do.

94
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:02,150
Yung Hee: I regard Chung-ook as my elderly brother. I really like him.

95
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,520
Yung Hee: I think sleeping in the same bed with Chung-ook is not bad.

Seong Ho: What?

100
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,180

101

(Jun Seong ties the cookie box's ribbon around his wrist)

102

Jun Seong: I'll check every day.

103
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,320
-Seong Ho: Check my hand? -Yes.

104
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,940
Seong Ho: Does this make sense?

105
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,950
Jun Seong: Is it not good?

106
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,170
Seong Ho: Does this make sense? Don't I need to wash up?

107
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,659
Jun Seong: Put it on after washing up.

108
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,070
Jun Seong: It binds you.

109
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,909
Seong Ho: Do you know the token?

110
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:41,860
Seong Ho: Do you know the token that people exchange when they get married?

111

Jun Seong: Do you want to get married?

112

Seong Ho: Do you have money?

113
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,430

116

Min Seong: It doesn't matter to me.

122
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,330
-Seon Woo: Really? -Min Seong: Uh-huh.

123
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,160
Seon Woo: But you'd better sleep over there if you want to sleep well.

124
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,070
Seon Woo: Because I get up early and I may walk around.

125

If so...

128

Min Seong: Me too.

130
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,550
Seon Woo: Did you hesitate about which room to choose?

131
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,600
Min Seong: Why should I?

132
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,320
Seon Woo: You received three letters, didn't you?

133
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,490
-Min Seong: They're from Hyeong Jin and Hyeong Joon. -Them?

134
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:42,190
Min Seong: The other two letters.

135
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,300
-Min Seong: But towards those two... -That kind of feeling?

136
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,000
Min Seong: I have feelings for them and I called them.

137
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,870
Min Seong: But the funny thing is...

138
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,290
Min Seong: To be honest, at the very first...

139
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,330
Min Seong: Hyeong Joon was...

140
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:03,780
Min Seong: I liked him at the very beginning.

141
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:08,250
-Min Seong: And then Hyeong Jin. -Later.

142
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,310
Min Seong: At first, I thought, "Oh, what?"

143
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,370
Seon Woo: But...

144
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,990
Seon Woo: You are really...

145
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,820
Seon Woo: Should I say this?

146
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,040
Min Seong: Why?

147
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,030
Seon Woo: There's no consistency of the type you like.

148
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,850
Min Seong: Consistency of the type I like. Right.

149
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:22,500
I chose a single room because there's no double room.

150

(After sorting out the room, Jun Seong and Hyeong Joon come out)
I chose a single room because there's no double room.

Hyeong Joon: Min Seong has the right to choose.

153
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:33,909
Min Seong: But no matter what I asked, Hyeong Joon didn't answer me.

154
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:35,330
-Really? -No answer.

155
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,600
-Is he like that? -He didn't answer any of my questions.

156
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,710
(Wow)
-Is he like that? -He didn't answer any of my questions.

00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:53,040
Hyeong Joon: But I didn't want to see them at all.

160
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,190
Hyeong Joon: I went to the smoking area. I could see them through the window.

161
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:58,850
Hyeong Joon: I avoided looking in that direction.

162
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,130
Seon Woo: Do you like a love triangle?

163
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,650
Min Seong: You asked me if I like a love triangle?

164
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,830
Seon Woo: Who would like a love triangle?

165
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:11,460
Seon Woo: If you like someone and there is a competitor...

166
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,250
Min Seong: Competitor.

167
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,970
Seon Woo: Rival.

168
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,290
Seon Woo: What will you do?

169
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:19,440
Min Seong: Because I want to win,

170
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,170
-Min Seong: I'll try to win that person's heart. -Right.

171
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:25,530
Seon Woo: If you really like him, It's right to fight for it.

172
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,180
Min Seong: A love triangle.

173
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,380
Min Seong: But there's already a love triangle.

174
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,640
Seon Woo: What are you talking about?

175
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,140
Min Seong: No.

176
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,040
Seon Woo: Do you all know?

177
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,810
-This... -Seon Woo: I didn't know.

178
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:45,510
Seon Woo: Do you know what's the hardest for me right now?

179
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,880
-Can you tell? -What is it?

180
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:52,180
Seon Woo: Seong Ho is a bit special to me.

181
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,650
Seon Woo: I'm not totally into him.

182
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,790
Seon Woo: If I met him outside Men's House,

183
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,510
Seon Woo: I wouldn't have given him a note.

184
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,110
No.

185
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:04,080
Seon Woo: But he said he had the same feeling for me.

186
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,040
That's also how he feels about me.

187
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,340
(Nodding) (Min Seong: Did you say that to each other?)
That's also how he feels about me.

188
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,210
-Did you say that to each other? -Yes.
(Nodding) (Min Seong: Did you say that to each other?)

189
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:08,810
-Did you say that to each other? -Yes.

190
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:12,890
-Seon Woo: But we met each other in Men's House... -Of course.

191
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,730
Seon Woo: I knew about his strengths.

192
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,520
Seon Woo: I realized that he is a good person.

193
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,940
-Seon Woo: I found this amazing. -Yes.

194
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,340
Seon Woo: I was thinking about this yesterday.

195
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,630
Seon Woo: I want to take care of him and I think he's cute.

196
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,210
Seon Woo: Is it because I want to date him?

197
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:30,160
Seon Woo: Or do I think of him as my younger brother?

198
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,000
Seon Woo: Maybe I just wanted to confirm.

199
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,770
Seon Woo: Because he expressed his feelings for me.

200
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:39,940
Seon Woo: But this is what I care about the most.

201
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:44,190
Seon Woo: In fact, he doesn't show his feelings often.

202
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,870
Seon Woo: I didn't realize he liked me at all. That's why I'm always surprised.

203
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:52,100
Seon Woo: "Oh, he called me." That kind of feeling.

204
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:57,840
Seon Woo: I went on a date with him yesterday. I felt comfortable.

205
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,930
Seon Woo: He makes people comfortable. He's willing to cooperate with others.

206
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:02,780
Seon Woo: First of all, I have someone else I want to know better.

207
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,590
Seon Woo: Before the show ends, I want to know all of you better.

208
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,730
Seon Woo: I told him this.

209
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:06,940
Seon Woo: So now...

210
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:11,350
Seon Woo: I want to get in touch with people I'm curious about.

211
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,810
Seon Woo: And then confirm my feelings.

212
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,970
Seon Woo: That's what I'm thinking about, to be honest.

213
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:20,010
Seon Woo: But there is such a strong rival.

214
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,440
Seon Woo: A greedy and aggressive rival.

215
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,590
Seon Woo: I didn't expect...

216
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,480
Seon Woo: I didn't expect this rival

217
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,020
Seon Woo: to be so close to that man.

218
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,610
Seon Woo: A rival. I have a rival.

219
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,220
-I didn't see that coming at all. -Min Seong: Yes. He's a bit aggressive.

220
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,940
Yeah.

221
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,760
Min Seong: I didn't know at first.

222
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,340
-Min Seong: But yesterday, I was sure. -Yesterday?

223
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:41,510
Min Seong: Yes. I saw him taking care of him, but this...

224
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,490
Min Seong: It was very clear.

225
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:44,870
Seon Woo: And when we were playing Jenga,

226
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:45,890
Seon Woo: we already felt it.

227
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:48,080
Min Seong: So, did your mind change?

228
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:49,750
Seon Woo: I told you just now.

229
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,870
Seon Woo: I'm not sure about Seong Ho.

230
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:57,470
Seon Woo: Because I've never dated anyone like him in my life.

231
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:01,340
Seon Woo: I have feelings for him because we are in Men's House.

232
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,020
Seon Woo: If we met in another place,

233
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,620
Seon Woo: would we be able to grow feelings for each other?

234
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,930
Seon Woo: I'm not sure about this yet.

235
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:09,750
Seon Woo: Even if we become a couple in the end, that's still a question in my mind.

236
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:15,280
Seon Woo: So today's call should be crucial.

237
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:18,650
Min Seong: But I was very flustered today.

238
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:21,960
Min Seong: Because Hyeong Joon and I barely talked.

239
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,010
Min Seong: We had a long chat yesterday.

240
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:24,060
(Min Seong: But today, Hyeong Joon said something very determinedly)
Min Seong: We had a long chat yesterday.

241
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,260
But today he said something very determinedly.
(Min Seong: But today, Hyeong Joon said something very determinedly)

242
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,450
-Really? Did he say so? -Hyeong Joon...
(Min Seong: But today, Hyeong Joon said something very determinedly)

243
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:30,150
Min Seong: He said, "I'll send this letter

244
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,590
Min Seong: to the person who I called yesterday."

245
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,850
Min Seong: He left after saying that.

246
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:38,900
Seon Woo: I kind of felt it. The way Hyeong Joon looked at you...

247
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,470
Seon Woo: From a certain moment, I felt...

248
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,400
Min Seong: But when I think about it now...

249
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,340
Min Seong: Actually, everyone has something that makes me irresolute.

250
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:51,400
Seon Woo: Really? But I think Hyeong Joon is the purest.

251
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,050
Min Seong: About Hyeong Joon, first...

252
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,810
Min Seong: I think my feelings are important.

253
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:57,560
Min Seong: As soon as I saw Hyeong Joon, I got the feeling.

254
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,740
Min Seong: So, I was attracted to Hyeong Joon.

255
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,830
Min Seong: One of my love styles is...

256
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,260
Min Seong: I don't drink.

257
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,610
Min Seong: So, I don't get along with people who like drinking.

258
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:08,920
Min Seong: And Instagram influencers

259
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,600
Min Seong: or famous people don't get along with me either.

260
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,480
Min Seong: Although I have feelings for Hyeong Joon,

261
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,910
Min Seong: this makes me hesitate.

262
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,280
Min Seong: At last,

263
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,150
Min Seong: when I see their shortcomings,

264
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:27,520
I think, "What about the other one?"

265
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,800
What should I do?

266
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,110
This is driving me crazy.

267
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,970
Seon Woo: Hey, we...

268
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,060
-Seon Woo: It's really hard, isn't it? -Yes.

269
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,540
Min Seong: Seriously,

270
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,050
Min Seong: maybe they don't like me at all.

271
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,290
Min Seong: It may be like this.

272
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,320
Min Seong: Well, because you can think freely in your own mind.

273
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:50,190
Jun Seong: I have nothing to move. So idle.

274
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,010
-I'm done. -Are you done?

275
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:51,690
(Yung Hee: Did you move all your luggage?)
(Jun Seong: Yes)
-I'm done. -Are you done?

276
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:52,780
-Yes. -Did you move all your luggage?
(Yung Hee: Did you move all your luggage?)
(Jun Seong: Yes)

277
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,680
Jun Seong: Yes. I don't have much luggage.

278
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:58,650
-Really? -Jun Seong: I'm hungry.

279
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:58,980
Then let's have lunch.

280
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,770
(Yung Hee: Do you want to eat lunch?)
Then let's have lunch.

281
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:00,830
Yung Hee: We have nothing to do anyway. Then let's eat.
(Yung Hee: Do you want to eat lunch?)
Then let's have lunch.

282
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:04,970
Yung Hee: We have nothing to do anyway. Then let's eat.

283
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,010
Yung Hee: What do you want to eat?

284
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,970
I have to check the ingredients first.

285
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:10,160
(Scanning the ingredients)
I have to check the ingredients first.

286
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:10,450
(Scanning the ingredients)

287
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:13,000
There are eggs and spicy rice cakes.
(Scanning the ingredients)

288
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:15,380
Yung Hee: Well...

289
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:15,520
Let's have noodles, pork belly, and pork neck for lunch.

290
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,100
(Yung Hee: Let's have noodles and pork belly for lunch today)
Let's have noodles, pork belly, and pork neck for lunch.

291
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:18,760
-Isn't it good? -Nice.

292
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,150
(Satisfied)
-Isn't it good? -Nice.

293

00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,110
I'll ask others. OK.
(Satisfied)

295
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,900
I'll ask others. OK.

296
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,130
Not bad.

297
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,410
-Yung Hee: Are you hungry? -Yes.

298
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:25,460
(Yung Hee: How about noodles with pork belly?)
(Min Seong: Okay)
-Yung Hee: Are you hungry? -Yes.

299

301
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:29,970
-Good, good, good. -Good, good.

302
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:33,560
(Men gather together for lunch)

303
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,970
Yung Hee: Excuse me.

304
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,330
Yung Hee: Let me set the table.

305
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,170
Hyeong Jin: Thank you.

306
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:46,120
Where should I put it?

307
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,550
-Min Seong: Thank you. -Okay.

308
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,090
Make it crispy.

309
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:48,130
(Angry) (Yung Hee: Can I see your ID? Never mind)
Make it crispy.

310
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:49,720
Can I see your ID?
(Angry) (Yung Hee: Can I see your ID? Never mind)

311
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,320
-Never mind. -Are you okay?
(Angry) (Yung Hee: Can I see your ID? Never mind)

312
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:51,850
(Angry) (Yung Hee: Can I see your ID? Never mind)

313
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:52,720
(Joking) (I'm a minor)

314
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,640
-I'm a minor. -I was just kidding.
(Joking) (I'm a minor)

315
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,850
Min Seong: Aren't you hungry?

316
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,720
Hyeong Jin: I'm hungry, but I have no appetite.

317
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,120
Min Seong: Why not?

318
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,390
Min Seong: Why don't you have any appetite?

319
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,530
Who wants kimchi?

320
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:04,180
-Me. -Me.

321
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:04,970
-Me. -Kimchi.

322
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:05,810
-OK. -Kimchi.

323
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:07,050
(Hyeong Jin suddenly leaves his seat)
-OK. -Kimchi.

324
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,010
Again? Again?
(Hyeong Jin suddenly leaves his seat)

325
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:08,880
You don't know this song? You really don't know this song?
(Hyeong Jin suddenly leaves his seat)

326
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,150
This song again?
(Hyeong Jin suddenly leaves his seat)

327
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,190
-Kimchi... -You don't know this song either?

328
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:13,600
-Is it really a song? -You don't know it either?

329
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,840
No.

330
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,050
Hyeong Jin: Why are you lying here to recuperate?

331
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,570
Hyeong Jin: My energy is gone.

332
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,890
Seon Woo: Did you move into the room you wanted?

333
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,240
Hyeong Jin: Yes.

334
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,710
Hyeong Jin: But I think...

335
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,180
Hyeong Jin: The whole situation...

336
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,850
Hyeong Jin: "What's going on?" This kind of feeling.

337
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:45,590
-"What's going on?" This kind of feeling. -Really?

338
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,700
Hyeong Jin: So, if I didn't get the single room,

339
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,500
Hyeong Jin: I wouldn't have been able to control my expression.

340
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,550
-Seon Woo: If you have a rival... -Yes.

341
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:56,830
Seon Woo: What do you think? Would you be more competitive?

342
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,720
Seon Woo: The fact that I am involved in a love triangle...

343
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,440
-Hyeong Jin: You don't like it? -I hate it.

344
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,420
Seon Woo: I'm tired. Because other than the man I like...

345
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,140
Seon Woo: My so-called rival...

346
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,950
Seon Woo: I don't hate him.

347
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,730
Seon Woo: But I have to compete with him.

348
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:13,570
Seon Woo: I've never been in such a situation before.

349
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,300
Seon Woo: I don't know what to do.

350
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,860
Hyeong Jin: But if he is the person I want,

351
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,950
Hyeong Jin: I will try my best to grab him.

352
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:23,430
Hyeong Jin: To be honest, I will do that.

353
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,660
Hyeong Jin: I don't want my things to be taken away by others.

354
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:25,940
If I confirm my feelings...

355
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:29,250
(Hyeong Jin: If I confirm my feelings...)
If I confirm my feelings...

356
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,430
Hyeong Jin: I'll keep fighting to the end.

357
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:33,960
Yes.

358
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,570
Seon Woo: I can't tell which is right and which is wrong.

359
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,340
Seon Woo: I just...

360
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,920
Seon Woo: I just...

361
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:45,970
Seon Woo: Today, I just want to wait and see.

362
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:52,310
Seon Woo: I want to see Jun Seong do whatever he wants today.

363
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,910
Seon Woo: I want to let it be ad give Seong Ho the right to choose.

364
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,600
Seon Woo: I want to know what Seong Ho thinks about me.

365
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,900
Seon Woo: I want to know how much he likes me.

366
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,230
Hyeong Jin: What if...

367
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,650
Hyeong Jin: What if someone else comes to you now? Will you be swayed?

368
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,040
-Me? -Yes.

369
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,680
-Hyeong Jin: Isn't this the right time? -Well...

370
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,110
-Hyeong Jin: You're not sure about this either? -No.

371
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,740
Seon Woo: No. I don't even know how to answer this question.

372
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,890
Seon Woo: In most cases, I'm not like this.

373
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:18,520
Seon Woo: Now we're all in the same place

374
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,470
Seon Woo: for 8 days and 7 nights.

375
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:24,180
-Hyeong Jin: Are you crying? -That's why I'm acting like this.

376
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:27,250
Seon Woo: It's not that I don't have the courage.

377
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,040
Seon Woo: But I like people who can give me certainty.

378
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,100
I like people who can give me certainty.

379
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,650
Hyeong Jin: I think he's also in a state of confusion.

380
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:39,070
Hyeong Jin: And I cleared my misunderstanding about him.

381
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:39,110
(Hyeong Jin: So, I now think differently about Seon Woo)
Hyeong Jin: And I cleared my misunderstanding about him.

382
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:42,690
So, I now think differently about him.
(Hyeong Jin: So, I now think differently about Seon Woo)

383
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:42,820
(If I can make him believe) I can shake his heart now.
So, I now think differently about him.
(Hyeong Jin: So, I now think differently about Seon Woo)

384
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,590
"If I can bring him certainty,
(If I can make him believe) I can shake his heart now.

385
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:45,950
I can shake his heart now."
(If I can make him believe) I can shake his heart now.

386
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,700
That occurred to me suddenly.
(If I can make him believe) I can shake his heart now.

387
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:50,400
-Min Seong: Excuse me. -Seon Woo: Excuse me? How could you say that?

388
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,440
-Please. -Excuse me.

389
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,640
Owner.

390
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,250
-Hyeong Jin: I'm going out now. -You're the owner of this room.

391
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,010
-Min Seong: Let's go. It's time to eat. -Ah. Lunch.

392
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,050
-Min Seong: I'm here to pick you up. -Is the meal ready?

393
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:58,860
Can we go out now?

394
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,960
Min Seong: Yes. Please come out.

395
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,910
By the way, I really like this shelf.

396
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,490
It's very nice.

397
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,090
Is group buying available?

398
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,710
It's right in the room.

399
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:09,660
(The first meal after changing roommates)

400
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,720
Enjoy your meal.
(The first meal after changing roommates)

401
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,640
Enjoy your meal.
(The first meal after changing roommates)

402
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,020
-Thank you. -Thank you.
(The first meal after changing roommates)

403
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:13,640
-Thank you. -Thank you.

404
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,530
Seong Ho: It's troublesome to make noodles, so I don't eat them much.

405
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,770
Seong Ho: I won't choose to eat noodles if no one can help me cook.

406
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:24,000
Seong Ho: Someone made noodles for me. So delicious.

407
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,260
(A glance)

408
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:36,260
(Everyone's quiet at the table today)

409
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:39,020
(Min Seong: To be honest, I care about Chung-ook)

410
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:42,170
To be honest, I care about Chung-ook.
(Min Seong: To be honest, I care about Chung-ook)

411
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:47,710
Min Seong: I wrote a letter to Chung-ook, but I chose Seon Woo.

412
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,220
Min Seong: But I don't think I can face him.

413
00:16:54,870 --> 00:17:00,150
Chung-ook: I think I'm now in a very safe position here.

414
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:05,089
Chung-ook: In English, it's neutral. Neutral.

415
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:06,630
Chung-ook: Of course, I'm in a bad mood.

416
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:11,280
Chung-ook: It's like he's 100% sure we won't be a couple. So, he feels comfortable.

417
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,130
Chung-ook: That's what he makes me feel.

418
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,320
Hyeong Joon: In fact,

419
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,450
Hyeong Joon: I tried very hard to control myself.

420
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:36,910
Hyeong Joon: I was really annoyed and angry.

421
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:40,960
Hyeong Joon: I had mixed feelings. But I tried my best to suppress them.

422
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,180
Hyeong Joon: I wanted to control my expression and put on a smile.

423
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,510
Hyeong Joon: But when I saw others' expressions,

424
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:49,240
Hyeong Joon: the atmosphere...

425
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:52,020
Hyeong Joon: The atmosphere was really bad.

426
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:55,710
Hyeong Joon: It was very serious.

427
00:17:56,670 --> 00:18:01,160
Hyeong Jin: I think you always look calm here.

428
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:02,590
Seong Ho: You look happy.

429
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,640
Hyeong Jin: Yes, you look carefree.

430
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,920
Hyeong Joon: I'm eating.

431
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,320
Hyeong Joon: I'm the happiest while eating.

432
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,110
Hyeong Joon: Don't think too much while eating.

433
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,880
Seon Woo: Do you have worries when you don't eat?

434
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,330
Hyeong Joon: Why?

435
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:13,700
I'm asking because I'm curious.

436
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,500
Hyeong Joon: Of course, I have worries.

437
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,460
Yung Hee: What should we eat next time?

438
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,980
(Chuckle)

439
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,910
Seon Woo: I'm full.

440
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,890
Seon Woo: I'll wash the dishes.

441
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,300
Why does everyone look so tired?

442
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,640
(Lunch break)

443
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:51,320
(Today's dinner is a barbecue party)
(The four people in charge of grocery shopping can go by Hyeong Joon's car)

444
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:53,650
Hyeong Joon: What's going on?

445
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,580
I have to go.

446
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,910
Jun Seong: Don't you need more sleep? You are gonna drive.

447
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,790
Hyeong Joon: I had a very sound sleep just now.

448
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,330
Yung Hee: Are you leaving at 5 pm?

449
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:03,420
Hyeong Joon: Yes. With whom?

450
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,120
-Yung Hee: Four people? -Hyeong Joon: Yes. Four.

451
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,290
Yung Hee: How about the next three people who step into this room?

452
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:10,960
Jun Seong: Are the rest four people going to prepare for dinner?

453
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,940
-Yung Hee: Yes. I think so. -Yes.

454
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,180
Yung Hee: But I want to talk to someone.

455
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,490
Yung Hee: Can I stay here with him?

456
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:18,760
Hyeong Joon: Am I the one to choose?

457
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,790
You are going to drive them to the supermarket.

458
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,590
Yung Hee: You can choose.

459
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:24,480
Jun Seong: You can choose the people you want.

460
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,570
Hyeong Joon: Then draw lots.

461
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:28,770
Draw lots?

462
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,990
Jun Seong: How about something like who can finish hot coffee more quickly?

463
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:34,780
Yung Hee: Or we can play bottle caps on the table.

464
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:35,700
Bottle caps?

465
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:35,750
Yes, we can flip bottle caps. The person with the bottle cap closest to the edge survives.

466
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,590
(Yung Hee: The person with the bottle cap closest to the edge survives)
Yes, we can flip bottle caps. The person with the bottle cap closest to the edge survives.

467
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,760
-This is a good idea. -That's considered survived.
(Yung Hee: The person with the bottle cap closest to the edge survives)

468
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:43,120
(Looking around)

469
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,360
Seong Ho: Did you go to the second floor for anything?

470
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,010
Seon Woo: I went to look for you, but you weren't there.

471
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:54,670
Seong Ho: What's wrong? I was downstairs.

472
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,120
Seong Ho: I went to the bathroom.

473
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,570
Seong Ho: Why are you looking for me?

474
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,080
Seon Woo: Oh.

475
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:08,630
Seon Woo: It is so fun today.

476
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:09,920
Seong Ho: Is it fun?

477
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,580
Seon Woo: Don't you think so?

478
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,360
Seong Ho: You asked me if it was fun. Are you here to make fun of me?

479
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:15,120
What?

480
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,900
Seon Woo: Well, today...

481
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,790
Seong Ho: How is it fun?

482
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:22,560
Seon Woo: Not at all.

483
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,650
Seon Woo: Today is not fun at all.

484
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,190
Seong Ho: Why?

485
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:28,700
Seon Woo: It's chaotic.

486
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,180
(What does Seon Woo want to say to Seong Ho?)

487
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:36,360
(Seon Woo closes the door carefully)

488
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:41,510
Seon Woo: I didn't choose you when I chose the room.

489
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,060
Seon Woo: Were you disappointed?

490
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:44,720
You said you didn't want to share a room.

491
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,340
(Seong Ho: You said you didn't want to share a room)
You said you didn't want to share a room.

492
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:52,380
Seong Ho: You said you wanted to know more people on our date.

493
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,620
Seong Ho: I thought that might be the reason.

494
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,090
Seong Ho: I was a little disappointed.

495
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,540
Seon Woo: But I felt disappointed.

496
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:02,090
Seon Woo: I felt so upset.

497
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:05,480
Seong Ho: Why? What do you mean?

498
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,560
I only found out this morning that someone likes you very much.

499
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:12,710
(Seon Woo: I only found out this morning that Jun Seong likes you very much)
I only found out this morning that someone likes you very much.

500
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,960
Seon Woo: I didn't know that at all.

501
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,700
Seong Ho: Really?

502
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,680
Seon Woo: I didn't know he was so close to you.

503
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,150
Seong Ho: From the second day...

504
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:25,190
Seong Ho: I heard that when he gave me the gift,

505
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:27,410
Seong Ho: you were there.

506
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:31,590
Seong Ho: I wondered whether you knew it.

507
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,440
Seong Ho: I thought

508
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:37,630
Seong Ho: from the second day to the third day,

509
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:41,100
Seong Ho: that's enough.

510
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,740
Seon Woo: Are we talking about Jun Seong?

511
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,320
Seong Ho: Yes.

512
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:54,760
Seong Ho: I called you for three consecutive days.

513
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,960
Seong Ho: I made it so clear.

514
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,070
Seong Ho: I think I did my best.

515
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:02,580
Seon Woo: So, I...

516
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:11,100
Seon Woo: I can't do anything today, to be honest.

517
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,570
Seon Woo: Jun Seong said, "Mine won't be taken away."

518
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:15,690
Seon Woo: That's why I said, "Not yours."

519
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,090
(Knock)

520
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:18,370
Come in.
(Knock)

521
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:18,860
Come in.

522
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,670
-Hyeong Joon: Can I come in? -Please come in.

523
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:21,850
Hyeong Joon: We are going to play a game.

524
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:23,650
-Seon Woo: Is everyone there? -Yes.

525
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,290
Seon Woo: Anyway...

526
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:28,300
Seong Ho: I'll see you tonight.

527
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,490
Seon Woo: I don't think we'll see each other tonight.

528
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:31,760
Seong Ho: Why?

529
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,650
Seon Woo: Because I won't come.

530
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:34,500
Seong Ho: Why won't you come?

531
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,780
Seong Ho: Are we done?

532
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,680
Seon Woo: What did you say?

533
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:40,450
Seon Woo: No. You know what I mean.

534
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:41,870
Seong Ho: I know what you mean.

535
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:45,600
Seon Woo: I think we have the same idea now.

536
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,530
Me too.

537
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:47,730
Should we date?

538
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:51,410
(Seon Woo: A relationship is about two people)
Should we date?

539
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:53,500
A relationship is about two people.
(Seon Woo: A relationship is about two people)

540
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,750
Seon Woo: It can't involve three people.

541
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,510
That's correct.

542
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:59,670
Seon Woo: No matter what he does, I only focus on you.

543
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,600
Seon Woo: But I don't want to grab you very tight so that you won't be swayed by others.

544
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,230
Seon Woo: I just don't want to force you or make you focus on me only.

545
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,240
Seon Woo: Well...

546
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,110
Let's go.

547
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:08,560
Seon Woo: Like this.

548
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,040
Seong Ho: I see.

549
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,060
What was it again?

550
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,570
-Seon Woo: Hyeong Joon will go grocery shopping, right? -Yes.

551
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:18,170
Seon Woo: Because he needs to drive.

552
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:19,520
Hyeong Joon: I still need three more people.

553
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,360
Seon Woo: Min Seong and I want to go, but we haven't got changed.

554
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,640
Yung Hee: We wanted to decide by playing a game.

555
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,230
It's a fair way.

556
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,550
Hyeong Joon: It doesn't matter to me.

557
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:31,150
Hyeong Joon: Actually, I didn't want to go with Seon Woo and Min Seong.

558
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:37,640
Seong Ho: I have to prepare tomorrow's dinner in advance.

559
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,840
Seong Ho: Jun Seong and I can't go.

560
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,610
Yung Hee: Then I'll go. Okay.

561
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:42,680
Seon Woo: Okay, let's go together.

562
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,800
Seon Woo: Do you want to stay?

563
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,630
Chung-ook: I don't care. I can go.

564
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:47,530
Seon Woo: Then we have the result.

565
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:50,750
Seon Woo: Because Hyeong Joon needed to drive,

566
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,050
Seon Woo: I think it's a good opportunity.

567
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:54,210
Seon Woo: So, I didn't ask my roommate

568
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:57,650
Seon Woo: and said Min Seong and I wanted to go.

569
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:03,490
Seon Woo: Hyeong Joon has to drive, so he must go.

570
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:04,760
Seon Woo: I don't think anyone else wants to go out.

571
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,620
-Seon Woo: I told them Min Seong and I wanted to go. -Min Seong: Yes.

572
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,510
Seon Woo: Am I too nosy?

573
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:14,270
Seon Woo: No. We have to decide something.

574
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,240
(Poke)

575
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:23,150
(Yung Hee asks Hyeong Joon to leave alone)

576
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:29,200
Yung Hee: I want to talk to you one-on-one.

577
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,510
Hyeong Joon: Why? Why?

578
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,070
Yung Hee: Among those who are going to buy groceries,

579
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,760
Yung Hee: do you like anyone? I do.

580
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:37,640
I do.

581
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,880
Hyeong Joon: If you feel uncomfortable, we can ask another one to go.

582
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,650
Yung Hee: Can we split into two groups when we go to the supermarket?

583
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:44,280
Hyeong Joon: OK. You can be with me.

584
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,150
We can be on one team.

585
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,290
Yung Hee: No. I want to be with the person I like.

586
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:48,030
The person you like. OK.

587
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,510
-Can I? -Yes.

588
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,910
Yung Hee: Aren't you going to ask me who he is?

589
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:51,400
Aren't you going to ask me who he is?

590
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,590
-Hyeong Joon: I'll know when we get there. -Yung Hee: OK.

591
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:53,980
Okay.

592
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,310
-Yung Hee: Then it's settled. -Okay.

593
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,400
Yung Hee: Thank you.

594
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,220
I'll take care of it.

595
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,050
Yung Hee: I asked you

596
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:02,950
Yung Hee: because you might like that person as well. Maybe I shouldn't do this.

597
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,070
(Chuckle)
Yung Hee: because you might like that person as well. Maybe I shouldn't do this.

598
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:05,910
Hyeong Joon: It should be fun.

599
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,060
Is this the bystander effect?

600
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:08,160
(Yung Hee: I don't think we like the same person)
Is this the bystander effect?

601
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,570
I don't think we like the same person.
(Yung Hee: I don't think we like the same person)

602
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:10,330
Hyeong Joon: Really?

603
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,900
I'm not sure.

604
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:13,750
I think we need to wait and see.

605
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:14,580
(Hyeong Joon and Yung Hee form a love alliance)
I think we need to wait and see.

606
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,820
Interesting.

This one.

615

This one?

616

Which one?

617

-Seon Woo: Yung Hee, let's sit in the back. -Yung Hee: OK.

618

Seon Woo: Min Seong, you can sit in the front.

620

Seat belt.

622
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:35,710
Show me your driver's license first.

623
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,220

-What? -I'm cold.

631
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,900
Yung Hee: Gosh, you scared me.

632
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,370

Hyeong Joon: OK. OK.

640
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,800

647
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,640
Because there are four of us.

648
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:30,670
Min Seong: I tried hard not to be nervous.

649
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:35,660
Min Seong: But seeing how clumsy he is, I think he's cute.

650
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,420
Yung Hee: Have you ever gone grocery shopping with your other half?

651
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,690
-Min Seong: Yes. -Hyeong Joon: When we went out for fun.

652
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:43,940
Really?

653
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:46,100
Yung Hee: Will you go to the villa for fun with your other half?

654
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,090
Hyeong Joon: Why not?

655
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:48,520
Yung Hee: Oh, really?

656
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:50,990
-Seon Woo: No. -Yes?

657
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:54,630
Seon Woo: Have you ever been...

658
00:26:54,630 --> 00:27:00,400
-Seon Woo: When? I almost asked if you've been in a relationship. -Yes.

659
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,800
Yung Hee: I haven't been on a trip for a long time.

660
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:07,730
-Yung Hee: So, I said I wanted to walk through daily life with my other half. -Yeah.

661
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:10,180
Yung Hee: Because I haven't done many things with my other half.

662
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:13,260
Hyeong Joon: You're still young.

663
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:13,740
What?

664
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,290
You're still young.

665
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,090
-Min Seong: Yes, you're really young. -Yes.

666
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:22,990
-Hyeong Joon: My first boyfriend was 21. -Seon Woo: How old were you?

667
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:26,410
Hyeong Joon: 25 or 26 years old.

668
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:31,140
Seon Woo: So, you are okay with people who are younger than you. Do you like this type?

669
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:35,790
Hyeong Joon: Age doesn't matter to me. Even now.

670
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,040
-Seon Woo: You spend a lot of time with others. -Yes.

671
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,300
Seon Woo: Is it the same when you're alone with someone?

672
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,570
Seon Woo: Or you actually don't talk much under that circumstance?

673
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:50,850
Seon Woo: You aren't the silent type, are you?

674
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:51,950
Hyeong Joon: Yes.

675
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:54,440
Hyeong Joon: I need to make the conversation happen.

676
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,610
Seon Woo: When you are one-on-one...

677
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:00,220
Hyeong Joon: One-on-one situations don't occur that often.

678
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:04,320
Min Seong: At the beginning, his answers were "Yes" and "Ah."

679
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,220
Min Seong: It's obvious that he thought too much.

680
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:10,560
Min Seong: He has many secrets.

681
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:15,320
Min Seong: That's why he had that kind of boring reaction.

682
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,940
(At the same time, Men's House)

683
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,700
Seong Ho: Did they leave?

684
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,680
-No one's here. -Jun Seong: I think so.

685
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:33,450
-Jun Seong: Did you put everything in? Over. -Seong Ho: Yes.

686
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:43,180
Seong Ho: I just talked to Seon Woo.

687
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,440
Seong Ho: We chatted.

688
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:52,100
Jun Seong: But I feel that as time passes by,

689
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:56,650
Jun Seong: he has changed.

690
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:59,700
Seong Ho: What's the difference?

691
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:04,680
Jun Seong: He was naughty at first.

692
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,030
Jun Seong: He was like that at first.

693
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:10,240
-Jun Seong: But now he's serious. Yeah.

694
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:10,770
Really?

695
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:12,750
Jun Seong: I think he's less naughty.

696
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,190
(Drink)

697
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,810
Seong Ho: The tomatoes are sour.

698
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:21,380
-Seong Ho: I put a lot of sugar in it. -Jun Seong: Add more.

699
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:21,680
(Whoosh)

700
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,070
Then cook longer.
(Whoosh)

701
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:31,340
Seong Ho: Why didn't you choose the single room? I thought you'd choose the other single room.

702
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:35,000
Because you are on the second floor.

703
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,420
No, so...

704
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:43,760
Jun Seong: You chose a single room. But I didn't know which floor's single room.

705
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,060
Jun Seong: Therefore, I said I wanted a single room too.

706
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:46,390
(Jun Seong: If you're in the single room on the second floor)

707
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,920
If you're in the single room on the second floor,
(Jun Seong: If you're in the single room on the second floor)

708
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,570
Jun Seong: then I'll choose the quad room.

709
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,030
Seong Ho: I'm upset.

710
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:54,030
Seong Ho: I thought if I lived on the first floor, we'd meet.

711
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:56,820
-Seong Ho: I was in a bad mood earlier. -Jun Seong: What?

712
00:29:56,820 --> 00:30:00,630
-Seong Ho: I was in a bad mood when I was choosing the room. -Jun Seong: Oh.

713
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:03,550
Seong Ho: So, I chose the second floor.

714
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:08,760
-Jun Seong: Why did you feel bad? -Seong Ho: Well, I'm not sure.

715
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,470
Jun Seong: But I'm curious.

716
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:22,580
Jun Seong: Why did you write "selfish?"

717
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:29,430
-Seong Ho: You never changed your mind. -Jun Seong: No.

718
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:33,320
Seong Ho: But you're not the only one I like.

719
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:37,840
-Seong Ho: I think I'm comparing you two. -OK.

720
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,850
Seong Ho: That's selfish.

721
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:49,860
Jun Seong: Well, if that's what your heart wants... I respect your choice.

722
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:54,100
-Seong Ho: You made it sound like not a big deal. -Respect.

723
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,710
Seong Ho: You said it in a very easy way.

724
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:57,010
Jun Seong: It's not easy.

725
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:59,080
Seong Ho: Really? Then never mind.

726
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,990
Seong Ho: Wow, it's really hot.

727
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:09,770
Seong Ho: It's cool, but it's threatening.

728
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,070
Jun Seong: I will hold on tight.

729
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,950
Seong Ho: It's cool, but it's threatening.

730
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:15,780
-Jun Seong: It's much better than the cutting board, right? -Seong Ho: Yes.

731
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:19,250
Seong Ho: Stop it. It's stressful.

732
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:21,320
Jun Seong: So hot.

733
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:23,810
Seong Ho: Should I do it for you?

734
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:24,750
(Wave wave)

735
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,760
-Do you feel better? -Very cool.
(Wave wave)

736
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,270
Right?
(Wave wave)

737
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:26,780
Right?

738
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,290
Jun Seong: Keep fanning.

739
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:29,970
Seong Ho: Keep fanning? Rock, paper, scissors?

740
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:39,780
-Seong Ho: I like cooking something like this, which takes a long time. -Jun Seong: Why?

741
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:42,780
Seong Ho: Even if I'm not good at cooking,

742
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,600
Seong Ho: food like this can turn out to be tasty.

743
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:46,650
This is made by time.

744
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:47,900
(Wipe)
This is made by time.

745
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,520
(Wipe)

746
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:53,030
But there's no salami. I'm not sure.

747
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,570
-Let's go. -Let's go.

748
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,170
Let's go grocery shopping.

749
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:59,190
(Men arrive at the supermarket)

750
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,170
So cold.
(Men arrive at the supermarket)

751
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:01,420
I opened it.
(Men arrive at the supermarket)

752
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:01,900
(Men arrive at the supermarket)

753
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:02,540
Let's go.
(Men arrive at the supermarket)

754
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:05,050
-Let's go. Let's go. -Let's go.

755
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:07,550
-Seon Woo: Let's just walk around to see what we need to buy. -Yung Hee: I remember someone wants some fruit.

756
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:10,170
-Then should we buy some? -There are strawberries.

757
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:13,320
(Take the fruit that everyone wants to eat first)

758
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,900
-Two packs of brisket. -Two packs.

759
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:19,130
Seon Woo: Radish and sesame oil are here.

760
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:22,520
-Do you want to see the list? -Yes.

761
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,570
Hyeong Joon: Oh, brisket.

762
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:25,530
-Min Seong: I got two packs of brisket. -Hyeong Joon: Wow, OK.

763
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:36,100
(The four men bought a lot for the barbecue party)

764
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,620
Did you turn the car around?

765
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:44,620
No?

766
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,770
Hyeong Joon: I'll open the trunk.

767
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:53,670
Oh.

768
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:54,480
(Put a bunch of food in the car)
Oh.

769
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,960
(Put a bunch of food in the car)

770
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,430
It's done.
(Put a bunch of food in the car)

771
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:58,180
-Whose mask is it? -Mine.
(Put a bunch of food in the car)

772
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,000
-Whose mask is it? -Mine.

773
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:03,360
(They go back to Men's House for barbecue)

774
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:09,930
Yung Hee: I wanted to talk to Seon Woo after being divided into two.

775
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:15,990
Yung Hee: It's pitiful that I didn't get the chance, so I was not in a good mood.

776
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,400
(Men are resting after cooking)

777
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,820
-Who do you like? -Me?
(Men are resting after cooking)

778
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,570
-Who do you like? -Me?

779
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:22,490
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to.

780
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:23,940
(Hyeong Jin: You don't have to tell me if you don't want to)
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to.

781
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,390
-Chung-ook: But I expressed my feelings several times. -We might...
(Hyeong Jin: You don't have to tell me if you don't want to)

782
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:27,500
-Chung-ook: But I expressed my feelings several times. -We might...

783
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,430
Seong Ho: To us?

784
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:29,270
Chung-ook: Yes.

785
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:29,940
Hyeong Jin: You expressed your feelings?

786
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,050
Chung-ook: I think it's very obvious.

787
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:34,730
Chung-ook: But I…

788
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:39,660
Chung-ook: I told you yesterday. The person who called

789
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:39,770
(Spray)
Chung-ook: I told you yesterday. The person who called

790
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:40,530
(Spray)

791
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:43,330
Chung-ook: Yung Hee.

792
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,800
But...

793
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,790
Hyeong Jin: Is he the only one? From the start?

794
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,950
Chung-ook: Since the second day.

795
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:52,170
Chung-ook: So, I was shocked on the second day.

796
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:53,700
Jun Seong: What was it?

797
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,220
Hyeong Jin: I'm curious. Shocked?

798
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,780
Jun Seong: Why is it shocking?

799
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:59,660
-Hyeong Jin: Because you had a date with Yung Hee. -Because...

800
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:03,930
Chung-ook: On that date, I think

801
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,770
Chung-ook: I said a lot of things from the bottom of my heart.

802
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:11,420
Chung-ook: We talked a lot while driving.

803
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:15,230
Chung-ook: I thought we felt the same way back then.

804
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:15,300
Who?

805
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:15,840
Yung Hee.

806
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,760
Yes.

807
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,550
Chung-ook: But...

808
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:19,510
Chung-ook: Can I ask you a question?

809
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:21,090
Jun Seong: Yes. Go ahead.

810
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:22,570
Chung-ook: Did Jun Seong call you yesterday?

811
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:24,020
Chung-ook: No, not Jun Seong.

812
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:24,449
Jun Seong: Yung Hee?

813
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:25,810
Chung-ook: Yes. Did you get a call from Yung Hee yesterday?

814
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:27,750
Jun Seong: Yes, Yung Hee called me.

815
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,639
Jun Seong: But he called me

816
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:32,010
Jun Seong: because he pressed the wrong button.

817
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:34,800
Jun Seong: But he didn't know he did it wrong.

818
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,850
Jun Seong: He thought I was the person he wanted to call.

819
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:39,179
Jun Seong: That's why he called me.

820
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:40,350
Jun Seong: Yung Hee found out this morning.

821
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:41,030
Jun Seong: Because I told him.

822
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:42,290
Who is the person he wanted to call?

823
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:43,670
Jun Seong: I won't tell you.

824
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,340
Seong Ho: Please tell me.

825
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:48,870
Chung-ook: How did you feel when you were on a date with Yung Hee?

826
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:50,270
Hyeong Jin: I think...

827
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:51,199
Jun Seong: I think it's better if you don't know.

828
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,820
Seong Ho: Why?

829
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:57,080
Hyeong Jin: He's very different from Seon Woo. Totally different.

830
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,920
Chung-ook: When you two were on a date, did he show his feelings about you very clearly?

831
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:06,770
Chung-ook: Did he want to get close to you or did he say that he likes you?

832
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:09,000
Hyeong Jin: I don't know. Anyway, he could

833
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,340
Hyeong Jin: use this to compare.

834
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:13,980
Hyeong Jin: So you should judge it by yourself.

835
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,710
Jun Seong: Are you two fighting for Yung Hee at the same time?

836
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:17,470
Chung-ook: No, I'm just curious.

837
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:19,660
Chung-ook: Because I don't know what to do.

838
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,250
Chung-ook: I don't know

839
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:24,030
Chung-ook: if I should keep calling the one I like

840
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:29,890
Chung-ook: or the one I'm curious about.

841
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:32,050
Chung-ook: But

842
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:36,310
Chung-ook: when we revealed our age, I really felt heavy in my heart.

843
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:36,860
Hyeong Jin: Heavy?

844
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,410
Hyeong Jin: So you've been feeling heavy?

845
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:40,220
-Seong Ho: Right.
-Chung-ook: But…

846
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,460
Jun Seong: I don't care about age.

847
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:42,980
Seong Ho: What?

848
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,270
Jun Seong: I don't care about age.

849
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:44,860
Seong Ho: You?

850
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,180
Jun Seong: Yes.

851
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:48,520
Seong Ho: Imagine I'm 47 years old.

852
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:52,860
Jun Seong: With this face of yours, it's okay. I can date you.

853
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:56,770
Seong Ho: I want to take photos like this.

854
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:58,280
Jun Seong: Do you want to get the camera?

855
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,780
Seong Ho: I don't want to get up.

856
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,120
Jun Seong: No, just use the phone.

857
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,580
Seong Ho: Do you have your phone here?

858
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,250
(Click)

859
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:11,820
-Chung-ook: Are you taking photos of your feet?
-Jun Seong: Yes.

860
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,040
Chung-ook: Are you perverts?

861
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,440
Hyeong Jin: Is this the first day or what?

862
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,570
Jun Seong: It's the first day for us three.

863
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:19,720
Chung-ook: You three are like lovers.

864
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:19,780
-Come here.
-You're cute. Cute.

865
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,300
(Come here)
-Come here.
-You're cute. Cute.

866
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:21,960
-Come here.
-You're cute. Cute.

867
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:24,250
(The supermarket team is arriving at the moment)

868
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:24,370
(Maids) (The supermarket team is arriving at the moment)

869
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:25,820
Maids.
(Maids) (The supermarket team is arriving at the moment)

870
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:25,980
(Maids) (The supermarket team is arriving at the moment)

871
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:26,680
-Go in.
-Thank you.
(Maids) (The supermarket team is arriving at the moment)

872
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,380
Yung Hee: Someone!

873
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:33,860
Yung Hee: What? Why is no one here?

874
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,190
Seon Woo: Are they playing?

875
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,740
-Yung Hee: Oh, really?
-Seon Woo: What?

876
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:40,480
Jun Seong: What are you talking about? Playing! We took a break after the cooking is all done.

877
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,660
-It's a misunderstanding.
-Everyone, roll up your pants legs.

878
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,600
Everyone, come here! Roll up your pants legs and stand in a line.

879
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,850
Jun Seong: Thank you, everyone.

880
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:51,060
Thank you.

881
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:53,640
Seong Ho: Can't we play?

882
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:59,920
Min Seong: Where is my scarf?

883
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:05,970
Hyeong Joon: Do you have my phone?

884
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:09,140
-Min Seong: Isn't it on the table over there?
-Hyeong Joon: Yes.

885
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:13,540
Seon Woo: But why do you look so unfamiliar?

886
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,060
Min Seong: I told you he's avoiding me.

887
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,120
Seon Woo: What did you say he's doing?

888
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,310
Min Seong: He's avoiding me.

889
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:19,220
Seon Woo: Is he arrogant or what?

890
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:23,560
Seon Woo: It's the same just now. I thought I was the least familiar with you.

891
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,560
Seon Woo: But he's more awkward than I am.

892
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,570
Min Seong: He doesn't even want to look at me. Does he hate me?

893
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:30,810
Min Seong: Does he hate me?

894
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,400
Seon Woo: Right, I can't drink today.

895
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,160
Min Seong: What's wrong? What's wrong with the wine?

896
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,770
Seon Woo: I think you should take the initiative.

897
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:40,930
Min Seong: Really? Will it work?

898
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:44,390
Seon Woo: Of course. Anyway, he's always been expressing his interest in you.

899
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:45,120
Min Seong: Yes, he expressed that to me before.

900
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,060
Min Seong: But why? Why? Why?

901
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:49,350
-Min Seong: He expressed his feelings. But why did he say those words anyway?
-Seon Woo: Right.

902
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:55,450
Seon Woo: This hat doesn't suit me.

903
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,150
Seon Woo: I didn't plan to wear it here today,

904
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,670
Seon Woo: but I can't go there like this.

905
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:02,430
Seon Woo: I don't think it's a good idea.

906
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,470
#NAME?

907
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:05,040
Min Seong: It suits you.

908
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,910
-Seon Woo: Is it okay?
-Min Seong: Yes.

909
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,790
Chung-ook: What happened? Did your nose bleed?

910
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:09,250
Seong Ho: Yes.

911
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:09,770
Chung-ook: Why?

912
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:13,140
Seong Ho: I don't know. My nose just bled suddenly.

913
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,490
Hyeong Jin: You must be really stressed.

914
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:16,810
Seong Ho: Maybe.

915
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:19,080
Hyeong Jin: Are you easy to panic?

916
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,970
Seong Ho: I didn't know I was like this.

917
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:24,570
Hyeong Jin: I was totally that kind of person. I took four pills of Tylenol today.

918
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:27,380
Seon Woo: This hat doesn't suit me.

919
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:30,020
Seon Woo: Do I look okay without bangs? Is it OK?

920
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,250
Seon Woo: Doesn't it look good?

921
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,060
Seon Woo: Should I take it off now? I think it suits you better.

922
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,650
Hyeong Joon: Should I lend you mine?

923
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:38,510
Min Seong: Hey. It's the same as asking him to take it off.

924
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:40,130
-Min Seong: Maybe you should show your forehead.
-Hyeong Joon: Lower it.

925
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:41,670
Hyeong Joon: Pull it down a bit.

926
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:43,150
Seon Woo: Pull it down for me, please.

927
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:45,080
Seon Woo: I've never worn a knitted hat. So I don't know what it's like.

928
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,910
Hyeong Joon: Is it because of this?

929
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,250
Hyeong Joon: It should be better without this.

930
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:50,930
Seon Woo: OK. Then lend me your knitted hat.

931
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:52,050
Knitted hat?

932
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:54,100
Knitted hat.

933
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:55,170
(Hyeong Joon: To be honest, I really don't want to lend mine to him)

934
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:57,640
To be honest, I really don't want to lend mine to him.
(Hyeong Joon: To be honest, I really don't want to lend mine to him)

935
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,250
Hyeong Joon: I wanted to say it suited him.

936
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:03,210
Hyeong Joon: But with a thought of returning good for evil,

937
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:04,670
Hyeong Joon: I went upstairs and lent the hat to him.

938
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:07,050
No, not this.

939
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:08,980
Hyeong Joon: It may be a little big. Try it on first.

940
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,290
Okay.

941
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:11,600
Seon Woo: This is the front, right?

942
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,240
Hyeong Joon: The front is the side with the Logo on.

943
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:14,960
Hyeong Joon: Where is the other one?

944
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,280
Seon Woo: If you can't find it, this one looks good too.

945
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,910
Hyeong Joon: Well, you'll look better wearing a knitted hat a little lower.

946
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:24,780
Seon Woo: I've never worn a knitted hat before.

947
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:28,740
Seon Woo: Will it be better if I don't wear it at all?

948
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,520
Hyeong Joon: No, no. It looks good.

949
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,590
Hyeong Joon: Wait, because of the angle of the light…

950
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,390
Hyeong Joon: Nice. Wow, your face is so small.

951
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:35,820
Seon Woo: Thank you.

952
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,430
Gosh.

953
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:40,150
Seon Woo: But just now,

954
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:43,680
Seon Woo: I tried so hard to make Min Seong sit next to you.

955
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:48,000
Seon Woo: But he always said he was disappointed. He said you didn't express anything to him.

956
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,890
Seon Woo: You did give signals at critical times.

957
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:53,980
Seon Woo: But why do you look so awkward when you're together?

958
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,480
Seon Woo: That's why I asked you that question.

959
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,990
Seon Woo: I asked when we were all together,

960
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:59,940
Seon Woo: and when you are one-on-one with someone, are the two situations so different?

961
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:04,390
Seon Woo: I want Min Seong to hear the answer. That's why I asked you.

962
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:08,230
Hyeong Joon: What? What's your position?

963
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:14,120
Hyeong Joon: Aren't you always interested in Min Seong?

964
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:14,670
Seon Woo: In whom?

965
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:15,940
Hyeong Joon: Aren't you interested in Min Seong?

966
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,700
Seon Woo: We're friends who can talk about our worries about love.

967
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,600
Hyeong Joon: Really? So you two are in that kind of relationship?

968
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,780
Seon Woo: Yes.

969
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,970
Seon Woo: So…

970
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,450
Hyeong Joon: I know what you're talking about. Thank you.

971
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:29,230
(Hyeong Joon: I thought there was something going on between Seon Woo and Min Seong, so I misunderstood)

972
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:33,690
Hyeong Joon: I thought there was something going on between Seon Woo and Min Seong, so I misunderstood.

973
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,890
Seon Woo: But you told me

974
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:40,700
Seon Woo: you were interested in one person since the second day, right?

975
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,720
Seon Woo: It's only the other person doesn't know that.

976
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,450
Seon Woo: When you were talking just now,

977
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:46,850
Seon Woo: you seemed less unfamiliar with him than I with him.

978
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:49,090
Hyeong Joon: It's just I'm not good at expressing myself.

979
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:51,490
Hyeong Joon: Not only am I not good at it, but also, if there are others around,

980
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,520
Hyeong Joon: I'll be worse.

981
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,830
Hyeong Joon: How should I put it? He seems like that kind of person.

982
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:58,860
Hyeong Joon: He's like a love consultant.

983
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,360
Hyeong Joon: So from then on,

984
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:04,680
Hyeong Joon: Seon Woo looked more pleasing to my eye.

985
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:09,290

Seon Woo: I think I need to wear something. But it is warmer than I thought.

990
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:21,190
Min Seong: Come to think of it, I didn't bring my down jacket.

991
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:22,750
Min Seong: Can you just go in from here and then come out?

992
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:23,780
Hyeong Joon: I'll get it for you.

993
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,130

1008
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,660
Hyeong Joon: Well, I'll have to try to find out.

1009
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:12,710
Yung Hee: Shall we do it together?

1010
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:13,390

Put it in like this.

1017

Chung-ook: Instead of being jealous, I longed for it.

1018
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:36,240
Chung-ook: It would be refreshing to meet someone you like

1019
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,860
Chung-ook: in that environment.

1020
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:44,760
Chung-ook: When you're doing something actively, It's always cool.

1021
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:47,610

1022
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:50,180
Seon Woo: Well, I just find out Yung Hee seems to be able to do everything well.

Hyeong Joon: Why are you doing this suddenly?

1030
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:08,190
No.

1031
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:11,210
Hyeong Joon: I'll leave it to you then.

1032
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,620
Hyung-jun: I’m not sure if it can be roasted.

1033
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:17,130
Just keep grilling -Hyung-jun Let me try.

1034

Hyeong Jin: When I was grilling the barbecue,

1035
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:25,120
Hyeong Jin: I was thinking someone would wrap the meat and give it to me.

1036
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,330
Hyeong Jin: I stayed there grilling all the time

1037
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:30,690
Hyeong Jin: just to see who'd come.

1038
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:34,020
Hyeong Jin: I really hate the smell of meat stuck to my clothes.

1039
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:38,410
Hyeong Jin: Who likes to do that kind of thing? With the smoke and the smell.

1040
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:41,270
Seon Woo: Jun Seong, wear this.

00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:47,020
Seon Woo: OK, I put it on the sofa here.

1045
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:50,850
Jun Seong: I gave my down jacket to someone I like.

1046
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:54,560
Jun Seong: Then I borrow someone else's down jacket?

1047
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,390
Jun Seong: It's embarrassing.

1048
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:58,790

00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:44,990
Seon Woo: Yes, we will only cause trouble for them.

1065
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:46,320

Seong Ho: We should unite.

1068
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,970

Seon Woo: Secretly. What does that mean?

1087
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,130
Well...

Seon Woo: I see.

1103
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,600
-Why?
-Seon Woo: I thought this was the next seat.

1104
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,380
I thought we should be divided like this.

1105
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:05,880
Why do you have to sit there?

1106
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,700

(Far away)
Are you two not close?

1125
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:47,900
Do you think they're close?

1126

-Min Seong: He's resisting me. -They really don't look close.

1127

Seon Woo: But he got a little closer.

1129
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:52,960
-A little.
-He's avoiding me.

1130
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,390
Why does it look like Min Seong is avoiding him?

1131
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:54,950
No, this one looks like Min Seong is avoiding.

1135
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:01,300
Min Seong: I told you he was avoiding me.

1136
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:02,190
Seong Ho: Why? Why?

1137
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:03,760
-I don't know.
-Seong Ho: He feels burdened.

1138
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,530
Min Seong: Maybe he doesn't want to talk to me.

1139
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:06,920

1142
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:11,250
He's acting like nothing happened again.

1143
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:13,620
Seon Woo: He's a good talker, but he's not saying anything now.

1144

What is this?

1145
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:18,220
Min Seong: It became different from a certain moment.

1146
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:22,810
Min Seong: It may be my imagination. My own thoughts.

1147
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:24,950
Min Seong: He seems to peep at me a lot.

1148
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:27,460

1164
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:00,660
Seon Woo: Then I told him that he's no good.

1165
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:01,640
I said, "You're no good."

1166
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:02,720
Seong Ho: I also want to know what you are talking about.

1167

1170
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:10,610
So how could he know?

1171
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:12,010
Seong Ho: why didn't you have any reactions?

Yung Hee: For example, go to the arcade.
-Oh, arcade.

1293
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:22,530
Chung-ook: It's fun to go to the arcade.

1294
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:23,860
Yung Hee: Did you play something like a dancing machine?

1295
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:24,730
Dancing machine.

1296
00:53:24,730 --> 00:53:27,160
Chung-ook: Yes. Dancing machine and coin-throwing karaoke.

1297
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:28,110
Seon Woo: Does Hyeong Joon sing well?

1298
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:29,440
Yes.

1299
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,290
-Really?
-Chung-ook: Yes.

1300
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:31,620
Chung-ook: We even sang a duet.

1301
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:33,020
A duet.

1302
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:34,690
Seon Woo: A song that two men can sing together.

1303
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:36,110
-Brother.
-Hyeong Joon: Fly to The Sky.

1304
00:53:36,110 --> 00:53:37,700
Fly to the Sky.

1305
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,710
Jun Seong: If two among us become a couple,

1306
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,110
Jun Seong: what kind of date do you want to have?

1307
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:44,560
Seon Woo: I want a stay-at-home date.

1308
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:45,390
A stay-at-home date is good.

1309
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:47,260
Jun Seong: You've never changed.

1310
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:50,220
Seon Woo: Yes, I like stay-at-home dates.

1311
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:50,240
I want to go on a stay-at-home date too.

1312
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,310
(Immediately)
I want to go on a stay-at-home date too.

1313
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:54,420
Jun Seong: Why? What a stay-at-home date is like?

1314
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,800
Seon Woo: No need to dress up. How should I put it?

1315
00:53:57,060 --> 00:54:01,290
Seon Woo: You don't have to force yourself to do anything, because you're sharing your life.

1316
00:54:01,290 --> 00:54:03,760
Seon Woo: I think that's the best.

1317
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:05,390
Seong Ho: I want to go to a safari park.

1318
00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:06,380
Jun Seong: A safari park.

1319
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:08,760
Seong Ho: Yes. My dream is to go to Zootopia in Everland.

1320
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:09,680
Seon Woo: Is it a dream?

1321
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:12,180
Seong Ho: Yes, because I haven't been there before.

1322
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:15,850
Seon Woo: Do you particularly want to see any animals, if you go there?

1323
00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:17,980
-Chung-ook: There are pandas there, right?
-Yes.

1324
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:20,810
Seong Ho: I want to see the bear stand up.

1325
00:54:20,810 --> 00:54:22,380
Seong Ho: If I tell it to turn around, it'll do it.

1326
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:24,250
-Jun Seong: And you can feed it.
-Seong Ho: Yes.

1327
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:26,380
-More importantly…
-Feed it when it applauds.

1328
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:28,790
Seong Ho: More importantly, I think if we go to Zootopia,

1329
00:54:28,790 --> 00:54:30,520
Seong Ho: the drivers talk interestingly.

1330
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:31,810
Yes.

1331
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:37,020
Jun Seong: Are there any kinds of dates that you don't like?

1332
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:38,540
Are there?

1333
00:54:39,430 --> 00:54:41,640
Seong Ho: Yes. The worst kind I've experienced is

1334
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:44,230
Seong Ho: is having ice cream in a cold park.

1335
00:54:44,230 --> 00:54:45,690
Why? Why?

1336
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:47,310
I don't know.

1337
00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:49,530
Seong Ho: My date planned the dating route.

1338
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:50,150
Min Seong: In winter?

1339
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:53,050
Seong Ho: We ate the ice cream in a hurry, shaking,

1340
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:54,430
Seong Ho: and then we went to the cafe.

1341
00:54:54,430 --> 00:54:57,540
Jun Seong: What is that?

1342
00:54:57,850 --> 00:54:59,950
Chung-ook: I don't like surprises and things like that.

1343
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:01,230
Yung Hee: I like surprises.

1344
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:03,290
Chung-ook: For example, if it's your surprise birthday party,

1345
00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:06,790
Chung-ook: he decorates the room and calls everyone here.

1346
00:55:06,790 --> 00:55:08,790
Chung-ook: You thought you two were going to be alone,

1347
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:10,530
-Chung-ook: and it would be a small surprise.
-Seong Ho: But he calls someone else?

1348
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:11,400
Min Seong: A lot of people are called here.

1349
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:11,710
(Shocked)
Min Seong: A lot of people are called here.

1350
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:12,610
Then it turns out there are ten people.
(Shocked)

1351
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:13,330
Ten people.

1352
00:55:13,330 --> 00:55:15,160
-Yung Hee: And anyone is blowing a party horn.
-That's the worst.

1353
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:16,240
Holding the banner…

1354
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,640
Chung-ook: and "Bang", they fly balloons.

1355
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:19,910
-Jun Seong: No, no, no.
-I don't like that.

1356
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:22,760
Jun Seong: Calling everyone here. That won't do.

1357
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:24,280
Jun Seong: Surprises are fine.

1358
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:26,630
Yung Hee: Some restaurants offer the stage to customers, you know?

1359
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:29,600
Yung Hee: Then your boyfriend suddenly appears on the stage. You are still eating.

1360
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:30,940
Jun Seong: Singing while playing the piano?

1361
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:32,440
Yung Hee: Yes, something like that.

1362
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:33,970
Min Seong: Personally, I don't like it.

1363
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:35,480
Yung Hee: No one likes this?

1364
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:38,020
-Seong Ho: I really don't like that.
-Min Seong: I have to cover my face.

1365
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:41,150
Chung-ook: As a musician, I will never do that, either.

1366
00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:42,550
Seong Ho: I won't like it even if he's an entertainer.

1367
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:43,930
Min Seong: You really don't like that.

1368
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:47,060
Seong Ho: Yes. Even if my lover is an entertainer, I won't like him doing that.

1369
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:49,050
Chung-ook: I feel like vomiting.

1370
00:55:51,830 --> 00:55:54,070
Jun Seong: Come here.

1371
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:55,770
Jun Seong: Come here.

1372
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:03,460
(Seong Ho moves beside Jun Seong)

1373
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:04,400
Did he go there?
(Seong Ho moves beside Jun Seong)

1374
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,650
-Where did he go?
-What?

1375
00:56:05,650 --> 00:56:07,620
-Seong Ho: Take a picture for me.
-I didn't see it.

1376
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:09,630
-Min Seong: Take a photo for you?
-Seong Ho: Yes.

1377
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:11,510
Okay.

1378
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:13,000
Seong Ho: It can take great photos.

1379
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,120
Min Seong: Let me take a photo for you. It's so cold.

1380
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:16,790
(Min Seong: Okay, please come closer) (Close)

1381
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:19,140
Okay, please come closer.
(Min Seong: Okay, please come closer) (Close)

1382
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:20,300
Okay, here we go.
(Min Seong: Okay, please come closer) (Close)

1383
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:21,190
Okay, here we go.

1384
00:56:24,350 --> 00:56:27,930
Hyeong Joon: I'm curious about Yung Hee. For example, an argument like this…

1385
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:28,010
If in your boyfriend's car,

1386
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:29,900
(Hyeong Joon: If in your boyfriend's car)
If in your boyfriend's car,

1387
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:31,540
Hyeong Joon: someone else's…

1388
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:36,910
Hyeong Joon: some other friends' Bluetooth connects with the car automatically.

1389
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:38,210
Hyeong Joon: But he's your boyfriend.

1390
00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:40,020
Hyeong Joon: What do you think about it?

1391
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:41,290
Yung Hee: My car?

1392
00:56:41,290 --> 00:56:42,410
-Your lover's car.
-Yung Hee: My lover's car?

1393
00:56:42,410 --> 00:56:45,720
You're in your lover's car, but some other friend's Bluetooth is connected.

1394
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,270
Always connected.

1395
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:50,000
Yung Hee: I'll ask him why his Bluetooth can be connected.

1396
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,460
Yung Hee: After that, if he stutters, then first,

1397
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:54,990
Yung Hee: I know he's hiding something from me.

1398
00:56:54,990 --> 00:56:56,030
-Seong Ho: Dig deeper immediately.
-Jun Seong: Stop the car.

1399
00:56:56,030 --> 00:56:56,790
What?

1400
00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:58,300
-Stop the car.
-Stop the car.

1401
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:03,280
Yung Hee: But if I don't have solid evidence, I can't really say anything.

1402
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,050
Yung Hee: I don't know what they did.

1403
00:57:04,050 --> 00:57:05,260
Yung Hee: Or we have to check the dashcam.

1404
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:06,100
What about that?

1405
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:08,000
Chung-ook: What if a handsome guy goes past and your boyfriend praises him?

1406
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,340
Chung-ook: Like, saying "He's really handsome."

1407
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:13,040
Seong Ho: I myself would do that.

1408
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:14,540
Min Seong: I'll praise him too.

1409
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:16,140
Min Seong: I'll say, "Yes, he's really handsome."

1410
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:19,490
Seon Woo: But this is because of your work, right?

1411
00:57:19,490 --> 00:57:20,400
Min Seong: Is that so?

1412
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,090
Hyeong Joon: Handsome is relative. So I don't think it's good.

1413

(Min Seong: He looks coordinated—His eyes, nose, and mouth are coordinated)
Hyeong Joon: Handsome is relative. So I don't think it's good.

1415
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,550
-I don't want to hear that.
-His eyes, nose, and mouth are coordinated.
(Min Seong: He looks coordinated—His eyes, nose, and mouth are coordinated)

1416

1418

You don't say someone's handsome like that.

1419
00:57:28,530 --> 00:57:31,220
-Hyeong Joon: Oh, a perilla leaf flew over.
-What's with the perilla leaf?

1420
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:34,180
Seong Ho: It's a gift from the next table.

1421
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:39,660
Jun Seong: It's almost time. Let's go inside. It's so cold.

1422
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:41,970
-Seon Woo We maids should move.
-Thank you for the food.

1423
00:57:41,970 --> 00:57:43,530
-Jun Seong: Maids.
-Maids.

1424

Min Seong: No.

1427
00:57:48,270 --> 00:57:51,290
Yung Hee: How to throw the grills? Do we need to do waste sorting?

1428
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:53,500
Min Seong: There's trash again.

1429
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:56,830
Should I throw this away? It's burnt.

1430
00:57:56,830 --> 00:57:58,390
Yung Hee: What? I've got a text.

1431
00:57:58,590 --> 00:58:00,270
-It's cold.
-Yung Hee: What is it? I'm occupied.

1432
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:02,190
Yung Hee: Please read it. My hands are occupied.

1433
00:58:02,190 --> 00:58:03,690
Jun Seong: I don't have my phone here.

1434
00:58:03,690 --> 00:58:03,810
What is it?

What is it?

1436

What is it?

1439

Seong Ho: One hour. One hour.

1440
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:14,610
-What?
-An hour.

1441
00:58:14,610 --> 00:58:16,390

00:58:57,080 --> 00:59:00,140
Yung Hee: Can I ask how many people you like?

1451
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:01,140
-Seon Woo: Me?
-Yung Hee: Yes.

1452
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:03,190
Yung Hee: Our age gap is quite big.

1453
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:03,480
(Yung Hee: Is that why you feel pressured when facing me?)
Yung Hee: Our age gap is quite big.

1454
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:06,230
Is that why you feel pressured when facing me?
(Yung Hee: Is that why you feel pressured when facing me?)

1455
00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:08,650
Seon Woo: Don't you feel pressured when facing me?

1456
00:59:08,650 --> 00:59:09,580
Yung Hee: No.

1457
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:13,020
-Yung Hee: I...
-Seon Woo: Don't you feel pressured by a big brother who's 12 years older than you?

1458
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:15,340
Yung Hee: I don't feel pressured at all.

1459
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:19,310
Yung Hee: To be honest, I've thought many times that you might feel the pressure.

1460
00:59:19,310 --> 00:59:22,380
Yung Hee: But I never felt pressured.

1461
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:28,480
Seon Woo: Actually, I want to confirm all this through a date with you.

1462
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:29,330
-Yung Hee: Really?
-Seon Woo: Yes.

1463
00:59:29,330 --> 00:59:33,670
-Seon Woo: Yes. So I thought about going on a date with you.
-Yung Hee: OK.

1464
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:43,150
Seon Woo: I'm sure I have that idea, but...

1465
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,360
Seon Woo: I wanted to call someone else today.

1466
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:48,870
Seon Woo: I want to tell you this, too.

1467
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:57,110
Seon Woo: I've always been grateful to you.

1468
00:59:57,110 --> 00:59:59,120
Seon Woo: I also want to tell you this.

1469
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:03,070
Yung Hee: To be honest, I'm unhappy.

1470
01:00:03,070 --> 01:00:05,420
Yung Hee: Someone I like doesn't like me.

1471
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:08,760
Yung Hee: And he was determined to call someone else.

1472
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:13,010
Yung Hee: It's the time when I feel the most depressed since I came here.

1473
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:15,450
Yung Hee: After hearing what he said, I was really down.

1474
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:17,870
Yung Hee: Thank you, too.

1475
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:22,510
Yung Hee: It's not easy to tell me things like this. Thank you for telling me.

1476
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:28,680
Seon Woo: Go.

1477
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:30,450
Yung Hee: I see. See you later.

1478
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:31,510
Seon Woo: See you later.

1479
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:49,770
(Yung Hee is the first one to leave a message)

1480
01:00:50,870 --> 01:00:57,250
I'm going to cheer for Seon Woo's future.

1481
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:00,350
(Please leave a message after the beep)

1482
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,320
Yung Hee: Hello?

1483
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:12,790
Yung Hee: I'm Yung Hee. I received a lot of comfort from you.

1484
01:01:12,790 --> 01:01:19,530
Yung Hee: I want to say thank you, so I leave this message to you.

1485
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:24,170
(Who is the man that Yung Hee wants to thank?)

1486
01:01:24,830 --> 01:01:26,770
Yung Hee: I want to say sorry.

1487
01:01:26,770 --> 01:01:28,660
Yung Hee: It's also a message to express my feelings.

1488
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:32,030
Yung Hee: I think it's okay to just express feelings between two friends.

1489
01:01:32,030 --> 01:01:34,140
Yung Hee: I think I said everything I wanted to say.

1490
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:55,930
Chung-ook: Because there's no time limit,

1491
01:01:55,930 --> 01:02:00,420
Chung-ook: I thought a lot more.

1492
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:05,690
Chung-ook: Should I send it to Yung Hee or…

1493
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:10,310
Chung-ook: should I try to contact others? I started to feel torn.

1494
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:13,690
Chung-ook: Hi.

1495
01:02:18,190 --> 01:02:22,770
Chung-ook: Anyway, see you soon. Bye.

1496
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:27,950
(Who made Chung-ook smile?)

1497
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:37,010
Jung-wook: I've been thinking about it and I've finally made up my mind

1498
01:02:37,010 --> 01:02:38,540
I need to push him.

1499
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:40,840
I need to push him.

1500
01:02:47,990 --> 01:02:51,440
Hyeong Jin: Don't pine over others. Play with me.

1501
01:02:52,630 --> 01:02:54,280
Hyeong Jin: I'll wait for you.

1502
01:02:54,550 --> 01:02:55,920
Hyeong Jin: Good night.

1503
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:03,000
Hyeong Jin: I've been thinking, this is my only chance.

1504
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,680
There's only one chance.

1505
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:13,310
Seon Woo: I just did what I could do to Seong Ho.

1506
01:03:13,310 --> 01:03:15,790
Seon Woo: I didn't want to interfere or stop him.

1507
01:03:15,790 --> 01:03:17,800
Seon Woo: I want to know what he was thinking

1508
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:20,120
Seon Woo: and how much he feels about me.

1509
01:03:27,110 --> 01:03:30,140
Seon Woo: Seong Ho, I'm Seon Woo.

1510
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:34,070
Seon Woo: When I first met you,

1511
01:03:34,070 --> 01:03:39,720
Seon Woo: I never thought I'd leave you a message.

1512
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:43,620
Seon Woo: But then we met.

1513
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:49,440
Seon Woo: I wanted to know more about you. That alone

1514
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:54,250
Seon Woo: made I think it's something special.

1515
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:55,460
Seon Woo: So, thank you.

1516
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:57,670
Seon Woo: Bye.

1517
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:02,810
Seon Woo: I've fully expressed my feelings to Seong Ho,

1518
01:04:02,810 --> 01:04:05,020
Seon Woo: so I want Seong Ho to make the decision.

1519
01:04:11,590 --> 01:04:13,300
Jun Seong: No one makes me distressed.

1520
01:04:14,810 --> 01:04:17,140
Jun Seong: He should know I'm expressing my feelings for him.

1521
01:04:17,210 --> 01:04:20,410
Jun Seong: I'm making him interested.

1522
01:04:22,670 --> 01:04:24,040
Hello, Seong Ho.

1523
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:30,980
I can't see anyone else except you.

1524
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:36,520
I'm sure I'll keep liking you.

1525
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:39,410
Jun Seong: See you inside.

1526
01:04:40,890 --> 01:04:42,560
Jun Seong: Over.

1527
01:04:48,850 --> 01:04:51,970
I'll keep moving forward to the end.

1528
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:54,190
I don't want to slack off.

1529
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:06,420
Message.

1530
01:05:07,610 --> 01:05:11,610
(Which man is Seong Ho thinking about?)

1531
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:17,760
Seong Ho: I've been torn between Seon Woo and Jun Seong.

1532
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:24,410
Seong Ho: It's half and half. My feelings do not favor any one of them.

1533
01:05:24,410 --> 01:05:27,940
Seong Ho: In fact, I think it'd be better if I favored one of them.

1534
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:30,530
Seong Ho: I always feel distressed.

1535
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:37,490
Seong Ho: I want to say this to you,

1536
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:41,110
Seong Ho: so I sent this voice message.

1537
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:43,280
Seong Ho: See you later.

1538
01:05:44,630 --> 01:05:48,990
(Which man will Seong Ho like more?)

1539
01:05:49,610 --> 01:05:52,640
Seong Ho: I hope he will send me a voice message too.

1540
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:54,500
Seong Ho: I think he will.

1541
01:05:57,050 --> 01:06:00,610
Min Seong: By the way, Chung-ook, do you like any person in particular?

1542
01:06:00,610 --> 01:06:04,620
Min Seong: To be honest, I have feelings for two people. Two people.

1543
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:07,230
Min Seong: I don't know clearly

1544
01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:09,440
Min Seong: how one of them thinks.

1545
01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:13,630
Hyeong Joon: Everyone has a lot of secrets.

1546
01:06:13,630 --> 01:06:16,630
-A lot of secrets.
-Min Seong: You have the most secrets.

1547
01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:17,850
-No.
-Min Seong: No. You have the most secrets.

1548
01:06:17,850 --> 01:06:20,480
Hyeong Joon: No, I just don't know how to take action.

1549
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:23,050
Min Seong: See? You're hiding something.

1550
01:06:23,050 --> 01:06:24,590
Hyeong Joon: I'm not hiding anything.

1551
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:28,770
Hyeong Joon: I used to be like that.

1552
01:06:28,770 --> 01:06:31,230
Hyeong Joon: After I expressed my feelings,

1553
01:06:31,230 --> 01:06:37,200
Hyeong Joon: there were many problems.
-Why?

1554
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:40,940
Hyeong Joon: I'm like the bad guy people always talk about.

1555
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:42,350
Hyeong Joon: I often hear people call me that.

1556
01:06:42,350 --> 01:06:45,370
Hyeong Joon: So I don't say anything to anyone easily.

1557
01:06:45,370 --> 01:06:48,900
Hyeong Joon: To be honest, I'm also frustrated about it. It's hard.

1558
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:50,270
Hyeong Joon: But I couldn't say it.

1559
01:06:50,270 --> 01:06:52,390
Hyeong Joon: So I've been depressing it all the time.

1560
01:06:52,390 --> 01:06:53,770
But I think there's only one way no matter what.

1561
01:06:53,770 --> 01:06:55,630
("I think there's only one way")
But I think there's only one way no matter what.

1562
01:06:55,630 --> 01:06:58,390
I don't want to go anywhere else except here.
("I think there's only one way")

1563
01:06:58,390 --> 01:07:03,110
Hyeong Joon: I'm usually shy in terms of expressing myself.

1564
01:07:03,790 --> 01:07:06,870
I don't want to hurt other people.

1565
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:18,610
Hyeong Joon: In this way, I can say what I want to say.

1566
01:07:27,950 --> 01:07:30,370
Hyeong Joon: I'm sure.

1567
01:07:30,370 --> 01:07:32,050
Hyeong Joon: Because I trust him.

1568
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:42,470
Min Seong, you gave me the cookies,

1569
01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:45,640
but you turned to someone else.

1570
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:47,420
Hyeong Joon: What's going on with you?

1571
01:07:47,420 --> 01:07:50,580
Hyeong Joon: You have to explain it. You know?

1572
01:08:01,030 --> 01:08:02,800
Hyeong Joon: Because I've made up my mind.

1573
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:04,640
Hyeong Joon: I think I should move forward

1574
01:08:10,180 --> 01:08:15,450
(How in the world does Min Seong feel?)

1575
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:19,240
Min Seong: What should I do?

1576
01:08:21,939 --> 01:08:26,850
Min Seong: My mind is really blank. I have no idea at all.

1577
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:30,529
Min Seong: There are two people who make me anxious.

1578
01:08:31,970 --> 01:08:35,939
(Min Seong is torn between two men)

1579
01:08:41,939 --> 01:08:50,460
Min Seong I don't know who you like.

1580
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:57,060
Min Seong: I'm curious about this, so I leave you this message.

1581
01:08:58,569 --> 01:09:01,830
Min Seong: I'm just a little curious.

1582
01:09:04,109 --> 01:09:05,899
Min Seong: Guess who I am.

1583
01:09:10,779 --> 01:09:15,740
Min Seong: I should satisfy my curiosity first.

1584
01:09:16,180 --> 01:09:16,210
So I sent it.

1585
01:09:16,210 --> 01:09:17,319
(Min Seong: So I sent the voice message)
So I sent it.

1586
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:18,140
(Min Seong: So I sent the voice message)

1587
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:20,500
Seon Woo: Did it go well?

1588
01:09:21,109 --> 01:09:23,300
Min Seong: I...

1589
01:09:24,350 --> 01:09:28,000
-I didn't choose Hyeong Joon.
-What?

1590
01:09:33,399 --> 01:09:37,439
I sent a message to Hyeong Jin.

1591
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:43,060
(Whose message will be in the voicemail?)

1592
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:43,520
(Hyeong Jin: I'm not sure)

1593
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:46,240
I'm not sure,
(Hyeong Jin: I'm not sure)

1594
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:48,370
but is it Min Seong?

1595
01:09:48,370 --> 01:09:53,410
I think Min Seong will send it to me.

1596
01:09:53,410 --> 01:09:58,490
I'm sure it's Yung Hee who left me the message.

1597
01:09:58,490 --> 01:10:01,370
I don't think anyone would leave me a message.
