1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,890
As said earlier,

2
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:03,810
Safety Guard: after you two hold hands, you can set off.

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,820
Min Seong: How do we hold hands? Is it long enough?

4
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,189
Min Seong: Is it long enough? Can our arms reach each other?

5
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:10,100
Yung Hee: Hold hands and set off?

6
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,760
Safety Guard: Your arms may hurt when you slide to the middle.

7
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,010
Safety Guard: At that time, you can let go. Got it?

8
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:13,570
-Yes.
-Yes.

9
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:14,930
Please hold hands.

10
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:15,010
Is it okay that way?

11
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:16,580
(Holding tight; two hands are holding tight under the pretext of zip-line)
Is it okay that way?

12
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,300
Move forward a little bit. One.
(Holding tight; two hands are holding tight under the pretext of zip-line)

13
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:18,820
-Let's go.
-Two. Three.
(Holding tight; two hands are holding tight under the pretext of zip-line)

14
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:19,900
-Let's go.
-Two. Three.

15
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,790
Let's go.

16
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,040
It's so fast.

17
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,160
Yung Hee: It's my first time holding hands with him. The first time holding hands.

18
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,760
Yung Hee: I was so happy. We slid down the zip-line holding hands with each other.

19
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,100
Yung Hee: When I was holding hands with him, I was thinking, "It'd be great if it's daily life."

20
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,590
Yung Hee: I had such a thought at one moment.

21
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:41,210
Seon Woo: Before Yung Hee went on the zip-line,

22
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:42,980
Seon Woo: he was a little scared.

23
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,640
Seon Woo: I felt like taking care of the youngest.

24
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,790
Seon Woo: I held his hand tightly, and we slid down together.

25
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,600
-Safety Guard: Next two people.
-Let's go.

26
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,850
Safety Guard: Please come.

27
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:54,760
Please come.

28
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,050
-Where are you going?
-Where are you going?

29
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:57,820
We aren't going to fall into hellfire, are we? Hellfire.

30
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,610
(It's Hyeong Joon and Min Seong's turn)

31
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:03,880
(Very nervous)

32
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,690
-Min Seong: Do you have long arms?
-Hyeong Joon: Yes.

33
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:10,280
Min Seong: My arms aren't long.

34
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,490
Safety Guard: You'll be separated soon

35
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:14,350
-That's enough. That's enough.
-Safety Guard: because your arms might hurt.

36
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,350
Yung Hee: I need to take a photo of them when they slide down over here.

37
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,380
(Sniffing)

38
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:24,640
Runny nose.

39
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,300
Yung Hee: Thank you.

40
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,990
Yung Hee: He suddenly wiped my nose with his clothes.

41
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,640
Yung Hee: Helping me wipe my nose is a little…

42
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,420
Yung Hee: I don't know, either. Well, if not, if it's not that,

43
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,509
Yung Hee: he could say "You have a runny nose." That would work too.

44
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:43,009
Yung Hee: He suddenly wiped it for me with his own clothes.

45
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:46,180
Yung Hee: I was a little shy, but it made my heart flutter too.

46
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,240
Safety Guard: Please hold your hands.

47
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,090
-How should we hold hands?
-Then come up and stand here.

48
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:51,170
(Holding tight)
-How should we hold hands?
-Then come up and stand here.

49
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,240
(Holding tight)

50
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,220
You can let go if your arms hurt.
(Holding tight)

51
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,009
You can let go if your arms hurt.

52
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:54,610
Okay.

53
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:55,300
One more step forward.

54
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,009
(Holding hands tight and ready to go)
One more step forward.

55
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:56,910
(Holding hands tight and ready to go)

56
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,440
Bend your knees when you set off.
(Holding hands tight and ready to go)

57
00:01:59,440 --> 00:01:59,920
Okay.
(Holding hands tight and ready to go)

58
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,570
One, two, three.
(Holding hands tight and ready to go)

59
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,960
One, two, three.

60
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,090
Hyeong Joon: He said his arms are short.

61
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,560
Hyeong Joon: Then let's hold hands for as long as we can.

62
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,760
So…

63
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,070
Hyeong Jin: They've held hands for a long time, right?

64
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,660
Chung-ook: Yes.

65
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,670
Min Seong: My arm hurts. Should we let go now?

66
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:27,660
Hyeong Joon: It was fun. I liked it.

67
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:29,440
(Plus Hyeong Jin and Chung-ook; zip-line sliding is complete)

68
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,020
I'm scared.
(Plus Hyeong Jin and Chung-ook; zip-line sliding is complete)

69
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:35,650
(Plus Hyeong Jin and Chung-ook; zip-line sliding is complete)

70
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,700
Chung-ook: Hold on till the end. Don't let go.

71
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,440
Yung Hee: It's fun, right?

72
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,770
Hyeong Jin: Yes, it's so fun.

73
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:47,860
Hyeong Joon: Shall we go eat dinner?

74
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,470
Chung-ook: I'm hungry.

75
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,100
-Let's go eat.
-You must be hungry.

76
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,240
I feel hungry after playing.

77
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:51,280
-Let's go.
-Let's go eat.

78
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,690
(The men are hungry in the blink of an eye)
-Let's go.
-Let's go eat.

79
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:53,840
-I'm hungry. I'm hungry.
-Let's go.
(The men are hungry in the blink of an eye)

80
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,079
-I'm hungry. I'm hungry.
-Let's go.

81
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:54,500
(An intense outdoor group date for the men)
-I'm hungry. I'm hungry.
-Let's go.

82
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:59,030
(An intense outdoor group date for the men)

83
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,120
Seong Ho: I'm really hungry.

84
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,080
Jun Seong: Exactly.

85
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,960
(The two arrived at the second date location, campground)

86
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,400
But where is it? Where?
(The two arrived at the second date location, campground)

87
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,130
(The two arrived at the second date location, campground)

88
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,410
Seong Ho: It's so beautiful. It's my first time coming to a place like this.

89
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:16,480
(Jun Seong: I'm a little curious about the inside of the caravan.)
Seong Ho: It's so beautiful. It's my first time coming to a place like this.

90
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,490
I'm a little curious about the inside.
(Jun Seong: I'm a little curious about the inside of the caravan.)

91
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,810
Seong Ho: There's an inside? Wow. Is it warm inside?

92
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,680
Jun Seong: The fire is on. There's a stove.

93
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,060
(Come in to warm the bodies for a while)

94
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,740
Face. Face.
(Come in to warm the bodies for a while)

95
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:33,910
Jun Seong: It's so warm inside.

96
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,810
-Seong Ho: Let's start tidying the place.
-Fire. Fire.

97
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,280
Jun Seong: I'll build a fire. You can tidy the place.

98
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,070
Seong Ho: I'll tidy the place.

99
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:40,860
Hey ho.

100
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,680
Seong Ho: It's really cold.

101
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,740
(Jun Seong: Do you want to take a look around the caravan?)
(Seong Ho: Where?)
-Do you want to take a look around here?
-Where?

102
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:49,750
-Jun Seong: Wow.
-Seong Ho: What's wrong? What's wrong?
(Jun Seong: Do you want to take a look around the caravan?)
(Seong Ho: Where?)
-Do you want to take a look around here?
-Where?

103
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,400
-Jun Seong: Wow.
-Seong Ho: What's wrong? What's wrong?

104
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,100
Seong Ho: What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong?

105
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,040
Jun Seong: It's super warm.

106
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,730
-Seong Ho: Is it warm here?
-Yes.

107
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,140
It's so amazing.

108
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,680
Seong Ho: Wow, it's really beautiful.

109
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,490
Jun Seong: Is there anything inside?

110
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,760
Gosh.

111
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,840
I wanted to use it, but I almost destroyed it.

112
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,110
Why can't I open it?

113
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,760
You can't open it?

114
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:15,660
Jun Seong: Are we going to sleep here tonight?

115
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,399
(Can't hear)
Seong Ho: Oh, there's a button here.

116
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,019
(Can't hear)

117
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,320
Seong Ho: But it's so beautiful here.

118
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,390
There are buttons on the door.

119
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,080
Jun Seong: Is this the bathroom?

120
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,710
Seong Ho: Let's come again next time.

121
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,190
Jun Seong: This is the shower room.

122
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,070
Really?

123
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,550
But can we take a shower here?

124
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:33,190
(The two are talking past each other)
But can we take a shower here?

125
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,700
-Shower.
-Isn't it?
(The two are talking past each other)

126
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,430
Jun Seong: There might be a separate bathroom.

127
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,060
Seong Ho: There should be a separate bathroom.

128
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,290
-Seong Ho: You closed the door, right?
-Jun Seong: It's really cold.

129
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:46,400
Seong Ho: Keep it warm inside. We'll go in when it's cold.

130
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,700
Seong Ho: How do I close this door?

131
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,990
Jun Seong: Do we need to close the door like this?

132
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:01,230
(They already hit a rough patch when the camping has just begun)

133
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,020
Jun Seong: Stop it! Don't close the door!

134
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:07,990
Seong Ho: I can't close the door.

135
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,630
Jun Seong: Don't close the door. Don't close the door.

136
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,810
Jun Seong: Hurry and build a fire.

137
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,340
Seong Ho: But it feels so much better as we went inside and came out.

138
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,590
(Shocked)

139
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,020
Seong Ho: Be careful. I don't want to die yet.

140
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,540
Jun Seong: Why is it like this? Its rage is strong.

141
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,780
Jun Seong: Why is it doing this to me?

142
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,080
Seong Ho: Do you want to grill meat there? Or…

143
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,370
Jun Seong: I don't know. But we need to build a fire first so that it can be warm.

144
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,620
Seong Ho: You can't light the fire?

145
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:58,400
Jun Seong: It was my first time going to the campground, other than going with my family.

146
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:04,250
Seong Ho: Let's grill meat here. Let's just leave the fire over there.

147
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,030
Jun Seong: Shall we?

148
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,570
Jun Seong: If I had known, I would have stacked the firewood nicely.

149
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,970
-The firewood that was stacked originally…
-Seong Ho: Just stack it like this.

150
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:10,200
Exactly.

151
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,490
-Let's stack it again in that way.
-Seong Ho: If I had known we have to build a fire this way.

152
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,970
-Seong Ho: Do you need help?
-Like this?

153
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,710
Seong Ho: Can you do it by yourself? You can't do it by yourself, can you?

154
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:23,650
Seong Ho: It looks like it's taking shape now.

155
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,220
-Jun Seong: It's taking shape, right?
-Right?

156
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,540
Jun Seong: I hope it can blaze.

157
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,330
Jun Seong: But there won't be a fire, right?

158
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,020
Jun Seong: What's this?

159
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,590
Seong Ho: What?

160
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,310
Jun Seong: It says Magic Fire on it.

161
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,880
Jun Seong: "Chase away the monotonous trance when you stare at the bonfire.

162
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,420
Jun Seong: You'll be accompanied by Magic Fire." The smoke…

163
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,280
(Smoke lingering)
Jun Seong: You'll be accompanied by Magic Fire." The smoke…

164
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:46,770
(Smoke lingering)

165
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:48,650
(The surroundings are completely shrouded by smoke)

166
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,470
We'd better turn this on.
(The surroundings are completely shrouded by smoke)

167
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:53,200
Because the wind blew the smoke in.
(The surroundings are completely shrouded by smoke)

168
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,020
-Smoke.
-It's so heavy.
(The surroundings are completely shrouded by smoke)

169
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,380
-Smoke.
-It's so heavy.

170
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,470
Blow it over there.

171
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:57,650
(Blazing)
Blow it over there.

172
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,320
Just let it blow towards this side.
(Blazing)

173
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,280
(Turns on the fan)

174
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,580
(The two people's camping isn't easy from the beginning)

175
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,860
(Magic Fire)

176
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,290
I'm a little scared.

177
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,390
(Dumbfounded)

178
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,560
Seong Ho: It's really amazing, right?

179
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,070
Yes.

180
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,770
Seong Ho: There's such a thing?

181
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,220
-It's so beautiful.
-Amazing!

182
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,820
Jun Seong: Cover yourself with this. The blanket.

183
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,230
Seong Ho: Let me get this done first.

184
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:00,300
Jun Seong: But the fire has started burning, right?

185
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,580
No, it can't start burning.

186
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,700
Jun Seong: It starts to burn. It's getting a little hot.

187
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,110
Jun Seong: This looks really pretty.

188
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,260
Jun Seong: I've learned a trick.

189
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:14,610
Seong Ho: Let's find another time and come again.

190
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:19,050
Seong Ho: Remember to wear long down coats then.

191
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,230
Seong Ho: We've known as we came here once.

192
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,150
-Seong Ho: Salt? Should I sprinkle some?
-Jun Seong: Yes. Yes.

193
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,200
Seong Ho: Have you ever gone camping?

194
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,809
Jun Seong: I've gone with my family.

195
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:37,860
Seong Ho: With your family? It's my first time camping.

196
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,850
Jun Seong: But when I went with my family,

197
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:42,250
Jun Seong: my parents prepared everything. And I went there…

198
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,059
Seong Ho: To eat the ready-made food?

199
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:46,740
Jun Seong: To eat the ready-made food and sit quietly. I just needed to help a little.

200
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,140
Seong Ho: Did you feel any difficulties today?

201
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,750
-Today?
-Seong Ho: I kind of felt it.

202
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,830
Jun Seong: Me too.

203
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,240
Jun Seong: I think it's okay. It's pretty good.

204
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,660
Jun Seong: You need to sprinkle more to make it taste good, you know?

205
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:56,990
Seong Ho: Did it come out?

206
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,600
Jun Seong: Did you tear open the inner layer?

207
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,450
Seong Ho: No, I didn't.

208
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:00,870
Jun Seong: No. Why did you tear all these?

209
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,420
I didn't.

210
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:02,460
I didn't tear it open. I thought it was open.

211
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,760
(Embarrassed)
I didn't tear it open. I thought it was open.

212
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,560
I didn't tear it open. I thought it was open.

213
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,790
Jun Seong: You like ripping off the labels.

214
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,350
Seong Ho: But why is the fire getting weaker?

215
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,610
-Is the fire weak?
-Jun Seong: Why is it like this?

216
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:18,720
-Seong Ho: See? That's different.
-Jun Seong: What?

217
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,400
Seong Ho: The ideal and the reality are so different, right?

218
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,630
Jun Seong: How about I hold the pan above the fire like this?

219
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,460
The fire is quite strong on this side.

220
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,090
Jun Seong: I'll hold it like this.

221
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,460
Seong Ho: Are we really going to fry it in this way?

222
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,510
Seong Ho: How about making the firewood flat?

223
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,090
Okay.

224
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,010
Seong Ho: We don't need it to look nice.

225
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,360
Jun Seong: Okay. We'll stare at the bonfire and be in a trance later.

226
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,870
-Seong Ho: We'll stack it again later.
-Jun Seong: Alright.

227
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:41,900
Seong Ho: After all, we have to eat first.

228
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,550
Jun Seong: Ah, it's not easy.

229
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,630
Seong Ho: This is not how I imagined camping to be.

230
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,730
Seong Ho: My imagination is so different from the reality.

231
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,650
It's not good for the fire to be as strong as this.

232
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,190
But it's warm.

233
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:00,960
(Unlike how it looks in the dream, the camping date is somewhat tough)

234
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,780
Should we just boil the meat in water?
(Unlike how it looks in the dream, the camping date is somewhat tough)

235
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,020
Put the pan… Let's put the pan up here.
(Unlike how it looks in the dream, the camping date is somewhat tough)

236
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,820
(At last, the pan was put on the firewood)

237
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:16,250
Seong Ho: It was really beautiful and delightful, but it was too tiring.

238
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:21,070
Seong Ho: The wind was strong too. We two had to prepare everything one by one.

239
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:24,840
Seong Ho: The fire died out faster than we thought. And it wasn't easy to light a fire.

240
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,720
Jun Seong: I'm sorry but I'll sit down and eat first.

241
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,910
Seong Ho: You can eat first.

242
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,800
Jun Seong: You are so manly today. You're even responsible for grilling the meat.

243
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,730
Seong Ho: I've always been manly.

244
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:35,410
Jun Seong: At where?

245
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,870
Seong Ho: Though I usually wear heavy make-up.

246
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,500
Jun Seong: Where do you mean?

247
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:44,070
Seong Ho: No? Forget it then.

248
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:49,330
(Jun Seong: I really want to make the meat wrap delicious)

249
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,190
I really want to make it delicious.
(Jun Seong: I really want to make the meat wrap delicious)

250
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:54,090
Jun Seong: No, I want it to wrap it nicely, but the scallion is too long.

251
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,730
Seong Ho: Is it too long? I should have cut it.

252
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:59,150
-Right?
-Seong Ho: Thank you.

253
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,360
(Takes a big bite)

254
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:09,820
Jun Seong: It's tasty, right?

255
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,250
(Mumbling)

256
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,090
It got stained here.
(Mumbling)

257
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:15,050
(Wiping)

258
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,340
-Jun Seong: It's delicious, right?
-Seong Ho: Yes.

259
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,400
Seong Ho: Ah, it's really delicious.

260
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,970
Seong Ho: It tastes even better than the ones we ate last time.

261
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:34,410
-Jun Seong: Better than the ones we ate last time?
-Yes.

262
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,420
Seong Ho: Don't you think so?

263
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:37,690
Jun Seong: That's good.

264
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,300
Is it because we two are eating together?

265
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:43,710
(Giggling)

266
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,030
Jun Seong: I'm curious about one thing.

267
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,260
Seong Ho: What is it?

268
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,700
Jun Seong: Didn't you have feelings for Seon Woo at first?

269
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:59,580
Jun Seong: What made you change your mind and choose me?

270
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:05,350
Seong Ho: Because I like your persistence.

271
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,430
Seong Ho: You don't change easily.

272
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,030
Seong Ho: And in that case,

273
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,220
Seong Ho: the other person might feel burdened.

274
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:16,690
Seong Ho: But you don't want to burden me. I think that's good.

275
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:16,910
(Nodding)
Seong Ho: But you don't want to burden me. I think that's good.

276
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,990
(Nodding)

277
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,150
Seong Ho: Besides me,

278
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:26,260
-Seong Ho: you haven't had feelings for anyone else?
-Jun Seong: No.

279
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:31,240
Jun Seong: I feel comfortable when I'm with you.

280
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,920
-Jun Seong: So I feel good.
-Seong Ho: Really? You don't feel your heart flutters or anything like that?

281
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,910
-Jun Seong: Of course my heart flutters.
-Seong Ho: I like that kind of love.

282
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,710
-Jun Seong: Oh, really?
-Yes.

283
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:43,820
Jun Seong: Compared to a love relationship as if it's between friends,

284
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,610
Jun Seong: do you prefer a love relationship that makes your heart flutter?

285
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:48,390
Seong Ho: Isn't love that makes your heart flutter always good?

286
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:52,910
Jun Seong: Is it? But wouldn't you feel nervous?

287
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:56,180
Seong Ho: Ah. There might be problems like that too.

288
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:58,280
(Seong Ho: Since you mentioned that, I don't think a love relationship that makes the heart flutter is that good then)

289
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,260
Since you mentioned that, I don't think it's that good then.
(Seong Ho: Since you mentioned that, I don't think a love relationship that makes the heart flutter is that good then)

290
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:00,830
(Seong Ho: Since you mentioned that, I don't think a love relationship that makes the heart flutter is that good then)

291
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,870
Jun Seong: If it makes me too nervous,

292
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,600
Jun Seong: I don't feel it's good.

293
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:13,690
Seong Ho: Don't grill more. Let's just grill these.

294
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:15,040
Jun Seong: Good job. Thank you.

295
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:21,360
Seong Ho: But I've always wanted to try that.

296
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,170
Seong Ho: In the future, when we have a date, let's do grocery shopping and cook food together.

297
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,580
Jun Seong: Me too.

298
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,870
Jun Seong: But I'm afraid that I will buy such a big pile

299
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:33,380
Jun Seong: when I do grocery shopping. So I'm a little worried.

300
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,230
Seong Ho: I like doing that.

301
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:38,210
Seong Ho: I like to shop for groceries for a month.

302
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,110
Seong Ho: Shop enough for a month. Then I'll divide them into small portions and freeze them.

303
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,450
Jun Seong: Really?

304
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:48,380
Seong Ho: It feels like I'm preparing food for a month.

305
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:52,240
Jun Seong: It's like preparing for a battle or so.

306
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,830
Seong Ho: I like it that way very much.

307
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,160
Seong Ho: I'm so happy. Really.

308
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:05,920
Jun Seong: Because you drank Coke Zero?

309
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,750
It's like in the movie.

310
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,650
Jun Seong: I'm so happy to hear you say that it's your first time camping.

311
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,660
Jun Seong: So in the future, wherever you go,

312
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,850
Jun Seong: when you talk about camping, you'll think of me, right?

313
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,180
Seong Ho: Who knows?

314
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:24,670
(Joking)
Seong Ho: Who knows?

315
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:25,460
(Joking)

316
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,700
Jun Seong: At least you'll remember me, right?

317
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,340
Seong Ho: I think I will.

318
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,360
Really.

319
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:34,550
Seong Ho: It's really good. It's so good that I want to sleep here for a night before we leave.

320
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:43,530
Jun Seong: The meat is delicious too, but the ambience is too great.

321
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:44,810
Seong Ho: Really.

322
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:51,230
Maybe because I'm with you, I feel happier.

323
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,880
Me too.

324
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:01,010
-Jun Seong: Don't you feel cold?
-Seong Ho: I'm fine.

325
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,490
Seong Ho: It's a little cold, but it's not freezing cold.

326
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:05,460
Jun Seong: Me too.

327
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:10,460
Jun Seong: At a beautiful place, in beautiful weather,

328
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,860
Jun Seong: having a date

329
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,170
Jun Seong: with a beautiful person

330
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:19,520
Jun Seong: actually feels very unrealistic.

331
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,540
Everything was beautiful.

332
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,700
Seong Ho: So warm.

333
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,890
Jun Seong: I don't know who built the fire. It was built so well.

334
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:32,360
Seong Ho: The fire was built so well.

335
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,630
Jun Seong: So in the future, when you need to build a fire, you can do it yourself.

336
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,520
Seong Ho: Oh, this is not good.

337
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,290
Seong Ho: It's not good.

338
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,700
Jun Seong: What do you think about the past six days?

339
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,850
Jun Seong: Though there's one more day left.

340
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,390
Seong Ho: Good. I think I made the right choice to come.

341
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:56,440
Seong Ho: On about the third day,

342
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,430
Seong Ho: I agonized about it a bit.

343
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:01,330
Seong Ho: I had thoughts like "Why did I come to participate in the show?"

344
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,720
Seong Ho: But now I think, luckily, I am participating in it.

345
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,410
Jun Seong: Why would you have the thought like "Why did I come to participate in the show?"

346
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:08,810
Seong Ho: Because I was tired.

347
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,510
Seong Ho: It was emotionally exhausting.

348
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,180
Seong Ho: Because it was my first time encountering such a situation.

349
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,890
Seong Ho: What about you?

350
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,090
-Jun Seong: Me?
-Yes.

351
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:26,920
Jun Seong: I think it was all good.

352
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,970
Seong Ho: Stop lying. Didn't you feel tired too?

353
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,990
Jun Seong: Though I felt tired, I still felt happy.

354
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:38,430
Jun Seong: Isn't it good to have someone like that?

355
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,380
Jun Seong: Before I came, I thought about it for a long time.

356
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,800
Jun Seong: "What if there's no one I like after I go there?"

357
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,170
Seong Ho: Same for me.

358
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:49,710
Jun Seong: But there is one, right? Isn't that a good thing?

359
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:52,050
Jun Seong: It's good even if I feel tired.

360
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,600
Jun Seong: I'll have something to do, right?

361
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:56,900
(Smiling)
Jun Seong: I'll have something to do, right?

362
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,720
(Smiling)

363
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:57,730
I have something I can do, so I'm happy.
(Smiling)

364
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:59,950
I have something I can do, so I'm happy.

365
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,109
Seong Ho: I'm not Jun Seong,

366
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:07,770
Seong Ho: so it's impossible for me to know how he feels.

367
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:11,240
Seong Ho: But I think I'm a little certain now.

368
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,900
Seong Ho: Besides Jun Seong, other people

369
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,829
Seong Ho: are like friends or colleagues to me.

370
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:21,980
It seems that I only have feelings for Jun Seong.

371
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,050
Seong Ho: I've always wanted to try this.

372
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:28,830
Seong Ho: I only saw it on TV before.

373
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,840
(The two want to roast marshmallows)

374
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,560
Seong Ho: It's going to melt here.

375
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,650
Seong Ho: I've been wanting to try it.

376
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,900
Jun Seong: Just think of it as a lamb skewer. Keep spinning like this.

377
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,320
-Spin it like that?
-Yes.

378
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,290
Seong Ho: Isn't that spun by a machine?

379
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,260
Seong Ho: When we were eating,

380
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,580
Seong Ho: when we came in, it was really beautiful here.

381
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:04,560
Jun Seong: When I'm with you, when we come out on a date,

382
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,400
Jun Seong: the weather is always nice.

383
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,750
Jun Seong: It's amazing.

384
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:10,910
Jun Seong: It's like someone is controlling it.

385
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,300
Seong Ho: Are you a weather elf?

386
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,350
Jun Seong: Right. Before, when I traveled with my friends,

387
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,270
Jun Seong: it would always rain.

388
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,860
-Seong Ho: Oh, really?
-Jun Seong: Yes.

389
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,340
Seong Ho: Ah, that's not good.

390
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:24,060
Jun Seong: But when I'm with you, the weather is always nice.

391
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,420
Jun Seong: So I don't think I'm a weather elf. You are, right?

392
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,380
Seong Ho: Sorry. I can't focus on what you're saying.

393
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,870
Seong Ho: It must be delicious.

394
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:36,410
Jun Seong: I lost to marshmallows. I completely lost.

395
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,330
Seong Ho: It looks delicious.

396
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:41,340
Jun Seong: It's not even a person. I lost to food. Really.

397
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,080
Seong Ho: I'm really looking forward to it.

398
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,980
Jun Seong: Do you also feel happy to be with me today?

399
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:50,830
(Stops suddenly)

400
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:51,990
Seong Ho: Yes.
(Stops suddenly)

401
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:54,750
Seong Ho: I was about to eat but I spit it out in order to answer you.

402
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,910
Seong Ho: I've really been very happy since yesterday.

403
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:03,150
Seong Ho: What about you?

404
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,590
Jun Seong: Well…

405
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,960
Jun Seong: Of course I'm happy.

406
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,760
I have no reason to be unhappy.

407
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,800
It's delicious.

408
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,130
-Jun Seong: Why do you do this?
-Seong Ho: It's really delicious.

409
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,460
Jun Seong: You really spoiled the mood.

410
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:28,850
Jun Seong: It's been a long time since I roasted marshmallows so attentively.

411
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,600
Jun Seong: Not that it's been a long time, but it might be the first time in my life.

412
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:37,160
Jun Seong: I had roasted marshmallows before.

413
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:41,800
Jun Seong: But it's the first time that I roast them so carefully.

414
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:42,150
-What's wrong?
-It got stained all over here.

415
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:44,290
(Wiping)
-What's wrong?
-It got stained all over here.

416
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:45,950
Seong Ho: A lot?

417
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,380
Jun Seong: No, a little.

418
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,560
Seong Ho: It can't be wiped off?

419
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,910
Jun Seong: Alright.

420
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,110
(Wow)

421
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:05,340
Jun Seong: Are you eating cheese?

422
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,280
Seong Ho: It's really delicious.

423
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:12,470
Seong Ho: Would I look dirty? Is it dirty?

424
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,190
(Cute)

425
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,860
What's wrong?

426
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:33,330
Seong Ho: Jun Seong's special look really makes my heart flutter.

427
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,120
-Seong Ho: Do you want to go in and take a rest?
-Jun Seong: Sure.

428
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,020
Seong Ho: Do you want me to help you put on lip balm?

429
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:46,310
Jun Seong: Put it on for me.

430
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,200
(Gets close to him)

431
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:50,570
Seong Ho: Let me apply it first.

432
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:55,110
Jun Seong: What? Don't you normally put it on for the person you like first?

433
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,270
Seong Ho: My hairstyle looks so old-fashioned.

434
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,720
-Jun Seong: What about mine?
-Seong Ho: My bangs are covering my eyes.

435
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,580
Jun Seong: It's okay. As long as it looks good in my eyes.

436
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,950
(Bang)

437
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,670
(Hugging tightly)

438
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:27,070
Jun Seong: Are you okay? Are you okay?

439
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:30,170
Seong Ho: Oh. It really hurts.

440
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:31,760
Jun Seong: Wait. Are you really okay?

441
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,830
Seong Ho: But it really hurts.

442
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:36,330
Jun Seong: Are you really okay? It looks like it hurts a lot. The sound was so loud.

443
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,360
Seong Ho: You're not insane, are you?

444
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,440
Here, let me take a look.

445
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,080
-Jun Seong: Are you alright?
-Seong Ho: I'm fine.

446
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,310
Jun Seong: Ah, I really got flustered just now.

447
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,490
Seong Ho: Give me your hand. Your hand.

448
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,870
(Holding)

449
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:53,460
Seong Ho: You're holding my hand like this again. Use the other one.

450
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,970
Seong Ho: It's inconvenient.

451
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,080
(Fondling)

452
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,950
Seong Ho: I don't want to go back to the house.

453
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,190
-Jun Seong: Should I turn off the light?
-Seong Ho: Why should we turn off the light?

454
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,670
Jun Seong: I want to sleep.

455
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,400
Seong Ho: Do you really want to sleep?

456
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,010
Jun Seong: Just for 30 minutes.

457
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:14,190
-Seong Ho: Are you tired?
-Jun Seong: No.

458
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:17,360
Seong Ho: Don't turn it off.

459
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,520
(Staring)

460
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,890
Jun Seong: Let me look at your face.

461
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,730
It's really cute.

462
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,480
Seong Ho: It was almost perfect.

463
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,670
Seong Ho: I felt happy.

464
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,370
Jun Seong: It was perfect.

465
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:39,790
It was all perfect, from the weather to Seong Ho.

466
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,640
Seon Woo: We're all having dinner now, right?

467
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,610
-Yes.
-Yes.

468
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:45,040
Seon Woo: I'll wash my hands and cook right away.

469
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,670
(Swiftly)

470
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:53,560
Seon Woo: Garlic paste, garlic paste, garlic paste…

471
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,490
(Min Seong wants to change into comfortable clothes)

472
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:09,110
-Hyeong Jin: Are you going to change your clothes? Eventually?
-Min Seong: Yes.

473
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,370
-Hyeong Jin: You look tired.
-Min Seong: Yes.

474
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:12,800
Hyeong Jin: Are you tired?

475
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,060
Min Seong: I'm a little tired today.

476
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,630
Hyeong Jin: Hurry and get some rest then.

477
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,380
Hyeong Jin: Aren't you tired? Are you okay?

478
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,090
Hyeong Jin: Do you need any help?

479
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:29,940
Seon Woo: I'm in a good mood today.

480
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,150
Hyeong Jin: Do you want something to drink?

481
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,600
Seon Woo: I think you want to drink coffee, right?

482
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,440
-Hyeong Jin: Yes, as well.
-Seon Woo: Drink your coffee.

483
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,660
-Hyeong Jin: Are you okay?
-Seon Woo: I already had three cups today. I can't drink more.

484
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,100
-Hyeong Jin: Don't drink too much coffee.
-Seon Woo: Ah, okay.

485
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:47,620
Seon Woo: You seem to be speeding up on your relationship with Min Seong.

486
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,830
-Hyeong Jin: Me?
-Yes.

487
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,360
Seon Woo: Do you think it's going well?

488
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:54,520
Hyeong Jin: I just want to take it easy and then keep the other person

489
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,510
Hyeong Jin: from feeling burdened.

490
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,650
-Seon Woo: Keep the other person from feeling burdened.
-Yes.

491
00:23:58,930 --> 00:23:59,830
That's right.

492
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,090
-What?
-Nothing.

493
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,080
Hyeong Jin: Don't you have something to say?

494
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,500
-Seon Woo: Ah.
-Yes?

495
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,420
Seon Woo: No.

496
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,070
Hyeong Jin: What? Why? Tell me. Hurry.

497
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,280
Seon Woo: But even if you want to be calm,

498
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,750
Seon Woo: don't you have a rival?

499
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,220
Hyeong Jin: Well, I don't care.

500
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,160
-Seon Woo: You don't care?
-Hyeong Jin: I don't.

501
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,780
Hyeong Jin: Now I'm kind of,

502
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,680
Hyeong Jin: within my limits,

503
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,400
Hyeong Jin: giving him a break while taking action.

504
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,770
-Seon Woo: Oh, you're giving him a break?
-Yes.

505
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:25,920
Seon Woo: But you have bad luck in dating, don't you?

506
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,550
-Hyeong Jin: Because even if I can't go on a date, I'm confident too.
-Seon Woo: Uh-huh.

507
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,330
-Hyeong Jin: Because we don't have to go on a date in order to get bonus points for ourselves.
-Seon Woo: Uh-huh.

508
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,220
Hyeong Jin: Love is not an easy thing, is it?

509
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,330
-Hyeong Joon: Are you preparing?
-Seon Woo: Preparing. I'm preparing.

510
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:44,100
-Hyeong Jin: Do you want some coffee too?
-Hyeong Joon: No. I'll have some water.

511
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Hyeong Jin: It turns out that you all don't really drink coffee.

512
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,490
-Hyeong Joon: I don't drink more than two or three cups a day.
-Hyeong Jin: Really?

513
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:51,730
What? Why are you all here?

514
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:53,720
(After the group date, the atmosphere between the men has become a little different)
What? Why are you all here?

515
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,070
(After the group date, the atmosphere between the men has become a little different)

516
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,330
Why is this happening?
(After the group date, the atmosphere between the men has become a little different)

517
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:57,720
(After the group date, the atmosphere between the men has become a little different)

518
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,270
Wash it again and use it as a new one.
(After the group date, the atmosphere between the men has become a little different)

519
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,530
Wash it again and use it as a new one.

520
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:01,630
Yung Hee: Is there anything else to wash?

521
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,650
(Peeking)

522
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,150
(Hyeong Joon goes to see Min Seong)

523
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,890
Hyeong Joon: Aren't your pants too small?

524
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:19,710
Min Seong: Are they? Should I change? Should I change into a bigger pair of pants?

525
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:21,780
-Hyeong Joon: Let me take a look.
-Min Seong: I did this on purpose.

526
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:24,440
-You did?
-Hyeong Joon: Come here.

527
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,500
-Min Seong: Is it too skintight?
-Hyeong Joon: Yes, it's too skintight.

528
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,200
Min Seong: It is? I did it on purpose.

529
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,620
-Hyeong Joon: Oh, really?
-Yes.

530
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:32,470
-Hyeong Joon: Then forget it.
-Min Seong: Let me change into a pair that is slightly different then.

531
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:35,460
Please change into another one.

532
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,360
Hyeong Joon: But you… Wow. Did you make it like this on purpose?

533
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,210
Hyeong Joon: For that?

534
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:40,360
-Min Seong: What?
-Hyeong Joon: For highlighting the shape of your butt?

535
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,770
Min Seong: Is my butt too eye-catching?

536
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:45,970
Eye-catching?

537
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:49,360
-Min Seong: OK. I'll change into another one.
-Hyeong Joon: Okay.

538
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:52,250
-Min Seong: You mean you don't want to see it, right?
-Hyeong Joon: Of course not.

539
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,130
Min Seong: Now, you mean you don't want to see it, right?

540
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:54,660
Hyeong Joon: Other people might think so.

541
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:57,010
Hyeong Joon: Well, it's okay if you wear it.

542
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:04,270
-Min Seong: I'll wear a bigger one.
-Hyeong Joon: Yes.

543
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,020
(Peeking)

544
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,750
Min Seong: Then let me change it to this one, a loose-fitting one.

545
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,320
-Hyeong Joon: No. Don't wear it.
-Why? Why?

546
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,540
-Hyeong Joon: Don't wear it. Don't wear it.
-Min Seong: Are you telling me not to wear clothes?

547
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,440
Hyeong Joon: Yes. Don't.

548
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,080
-Hyeong Joon: No. Wear this.
-Min Seong: This. I'll wear this.

549
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:29,810
Hyeong Joon: Why? Why?

550
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:32,270
-Why?
-I've looked for one but there's none.

551
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:36,840
Min Seong: Are you coming in with me?

552
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,760
-What?
-Min Seong: Nothing.

553
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:42,560
(Min Seong listened to Hyeong Joon and changed his pants)

554
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,030
-What's wrong?
-What I find funny is

555
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:44,630
(Hyeong Joon is protecting Min Seong till the end)
-What's wrong?
-What I find funny is

556
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:47,020
that the person who cooks always has good sense.
(Hyeong Joon is protecting Min Seong till the end)

557
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,260
-What should I do?
-I…
(Hyeong Joon is protecting Min Seong till the end)

558
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:48,720
-It's so funny.
-I…
(Hyeong Joon is protecting Min Seong till the end)

559
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,220
-It's so funny.
-I…

560
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,890
Hyeong Jin: Are you two chatting?

561
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:11,290
-Min Seong: Yes. We're going to smoke a cigarette.
-Hyeong Jin: Really? I want to go with you too.

562
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:16,280
-Hyeong Jin: No. You two, go ahead.
-Min Seong: Can you carry me over there on your back?

563
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:17,760
Hyeong Jin: Go ahead, you two.

564
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,690
Yung Hee: Because we need to taste the degree of saltiness first. Let's put a little bit first.

565
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:23,170
-No need. No need.
-That's right. That's right.

566
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:23,310
(In the meantime, Seon Woo's delicious stir-fried pork is ready)
-No need. No need.
-That's right. That's right.

567
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,790
When the meat is a little more cooked,
(In the meantime, Seon Woo's delicious stir-fried pork is ready)

568
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:26,540
put in the vegetables and stir-fry for a while.
(In the meantime, Seon Woo's delicious stir-fried pork is ready)

569
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,880
Okay, got it.

570
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,080
Hyeong Joon: I'll have to wash the dishes later.

571
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,390
-Then here…
-I'll surely have to.

572
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,940
-Hyeong Joon: Do you need help?
-But there's not much I need help with.

573
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,360
-Hyeong Jin: Have you finished smoking?
-Hyeong Joon: Yes

574
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:54,310
(Min Seong: We just need to heat the instant rice in the microwave, right?)

575
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,750
We just need to heat this in the microwave, right?
(Min Seong: We just need to heat the instant rice in the microwave, right?)

576
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:58,310
-Yung Hee: Yes, that's right.
-Seon Woo: It's almost done.

577
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:03,790
Hyeong Joon: Ah, it's so hot.

578
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:06,970
Min Seong: Be careful. It's hot.

579
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:09,480
(Staring)

580
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:17,040
-Seon Woo: Who can make one more plate of this?
-Hyeong Jin: Let me help you.

581
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:17,770
Okay. Okay.

582
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:20,130
Can't we stir-fry it directly in this state?

583
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:21,380
-What?
-Hyeong Jin: Can't we stir-fry it directly in this state?

584
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,220
Seon Woo: It's a bit too much.

585
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:26,210
We just need to stir-fry about the same amount of meat as the vegetables.

586
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:27,670
Got it?

587
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:33,320
(The two are staying together all the way; someone finds the scene a bit of an eyesore)

588
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,650
-Today…
-Ah, it's so hot.
(The two are staying together all the way; someone finds the scene a bit of an eyesore)

589
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:35,120
(The two are staying together all the way; someone finds the scene a bit of an eyesore)

590
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,900
Be careful.
(The two are staying together all the way; someone finds the scene a bit of an eyesore)

591
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,840
(The two are staying together all the way; someone finds the scene a bit of an eyesore)

592
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,050
(Gauging the mood)

593
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:48,060
Hyeong Joon: What are you doing? Are you going to stir-fry it?

594
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:51,110
Hyeong Jin: Yes. I'm an assistant. A helper.

595
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:56,990
(Both men find each other to be an eyesore)

596
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,510
I plan to put in all the vegetables and give it a try.

597
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,180
(And a man noticed these two men)

598
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,570
No. Have you smelled it?
(And a man noticed these two men)

599
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:01,160
(And a man noticed these two men)

600
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,290
The pan at the back. The pan. He wants the pan.
(And a man noticed these two men)

601
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,930
-Hyeong Joon: It's perfect.
-Yung Hee: Right? Okay. Good.

602
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:16,280
Hyeong Jin: Are you tired?

603
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,710
Hyeong Jin: Your eyelids are stuck together.

604
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:21,750
Min Seong: Me? My eyelids originally would stick together easily.

605
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:24,000
Hyeong Jin: Why are your bangs divided again?

606
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:25,980
(Gently)

607
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,630
Hyeong Jin: Hurry and finish your meal. And go get some rest.

608
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,200
-Min Seong: It must be delicious.
-Exactly.

609
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,440
Hyeong Joon: I thought Hyeong Jin was a person who would cheer for us.

610
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:44,480
Hyeong Joon: I totally didn't expect that this friend is planning to get in our way.

611
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:46,800
(Dinner is finally ready)

612
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,590
-It must be delicious.
-It's crazy.
(Dinner is finally ready)

613
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:50,010
-I'll enjoy it.
-I'll enjoy it.
(Dinner is finally ready)

614
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:50,540
Let's eat. Let's eat.
(Dinner is finally ready)

615
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,330
Let's eat. Let's eat.

616
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:00,890
-It tastes good, right?
-Yes.

617
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:01,380
It's really delicious.

618
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,150
(The men didn't say a word; they start eating silently)
It's really delicious.

619
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:06,750
(The men didn't say a word; they start eating silently)

620
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:20,360
(Silence is flowing around the dining table)

621
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:23,350
(Crack)

622
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,340
-Chung-ook: Are you chewing the bone?
-Yes.

623
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:25,920
(Embarrassed)
-Chung-ook: Are you chewing the bone?
-Yes.

624
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,210
-Really?
-Yung Hee: A man who even chews and eats the bones.
(Embarrassed)
-Chung-ook: Are you chewing the bone?
-Yes.

625
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:28,260
-Really?
-Yung Hee: A man who even chews and eats the bones.

626
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,940
Hyeong Jin: I like to eat gristle.

627
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:32,670
(Hyeong Jin: Min Seong, do you eat gristle?)
(Min Seong: Yes, I like to eat it.)

628
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:34,630
-Min Seong, do you eat gristle?
-Yes.
(Hyeong Jin: Min Seong, do you eat gristle?)
(Min Seong: Yes, I like to eat it.)

629
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:35,920
-Do you like to eat it?
-Yes.
(Hyeong Jin: Min Seong, do you eat gristle?)
(Min Seong: Yes, I like to eat it.)

630
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:39,720
-Yung Hee: Speaking of gristle, I want to eat chicken feet too.
-Min Seong: Chicken feet are good too.

631
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:43,470
Hyeong Joon: Chicken feet and beef tripe.

632
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,570
Hyeong Jin: The chicken feet sold in our neighborhood are really delicious.

633
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:46,720
-Really?
-Hyeong Jin: Come and play next time.

634
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,800
-Min Seong: Really?
-Hyeong Jin: Yes. I'll treat you.

635
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,730
-Our neighborhood? Our neighborhood?
-Yes.

636
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:54,040
Hyeong Jin: Yung Hee lives far away, right? It's too hard for you to come over.

637
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,250
Yung Hee: Me? I live in the same neighborhood as him.

638
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:58,610
Hyeong Jin: It's too far.

639
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,740
Hyeong Jin: Try to eat it like this.

640
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,570
(Peeking)

641
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,150
-I'm teaching you how to eat it. -Hyeong Joon: Well, if you want to feed him,

642
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:10,820
Hyeong Joon: then feed everybody here.

643
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,040
Yes.

644
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:14,880
Hyeong Jin: Everyone has their own hands, right? You're all healthy.

645
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,680
-Seon Woo: Maybe Min Seong has lost his hands. -Right.

646
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,000
Hyeong Jin: I am just teaching him how to eat it.

647
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,510
Hyeong Joon: We also want to know it.

648
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,530
Hyeong Jin: Okay, Hyeong Joon. Tell me what you want to eat.

649
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:22,960
-I'll feed you first. -Hyeong Joon: No. I'm done.

650
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,010
Hyeong Jin: What? Why?

651
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:29,220
Hyeong Jin: The guy sitting in the middle should take care of those sitting next to him.

652
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:31,900
(Hyeong Joon was speechless and flustered?)

653
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,870
I was speechless and flustered.
(Hyeong Joon was speechless and flustered?)

654
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:37,730
Hyeong Joon: When only three of us were there, he stepped back.

655
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:37,870
But when we were on such an occasion,

656
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:39,510
(Hyeong Joon: When everybody else was there, he would start to be very nice to him)
But when we were on such an occasion,

657
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:42,330
he would start to be very nice to him.
(Hyeong Joon: When everybody else was there, he would start to be very nice to him)

658
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:42,860
he would start to be very nice to him.

659
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:46,150
At that moment, I thought, "Oh, the situation is not right now."

660
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,460
I could feel it.

661
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:54,600
A catfish suddenly came in.

662
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,540
Min Seong: Well, I can't say I was comfortable with everything.

663
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:06,360
Min Seong: When we were all there, it was a little bit suffocating.

664
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,500
Min Seong: I felt uncomfortable with Hyeong Jin and Hyeong Joon

665
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,030
Min Seong: when only three of us were at the same place.

666
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,530
After the interview...

667
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:14,600
Ah, who will be the maid today?

668
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,080
(After the karting race, Min Seong got the right to decide who the maid will be)
Ah, who will be the maid today?

669
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,360
-Oh, right. We need to choose a guy as the maid. -Let the maid do the dishes.
(After the karting race, Min Seong got the right to decide who the maid will be)

670
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,980
Hyeong Jin: I was a born maid.

671
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:24,510
-Min Seong: A born maid? -Hyeong Jin: I was a born maid.

672
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:26,280
-Min Seong: Then I'll let you be the maid. -Hyeong Jin: Okay.

673
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:29,010
-Okay, you got it. -Let the maid do the dishes right away.

674
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:30,020
Of course. That's good.

675
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,580
Hyeong Jin: I enjoy doing the dishes.

676
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,710
Hyeong Jin: Anyway, I know Min Seong well. Even if I was chosen as the maid,

677
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:39,820
Hyeong Jin: I believed he would be there and help me.

678
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:43,670
Hyeong Jin: Then I could flirt with him while chatting with him.

679
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:45,280
(Min Seong: But Hyeong Jin, didn't you do the dishes this morning?)

680
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,490
But Hyeong Jin, didn't you do the dishes this morning?
(Min Seong: But Hyeong Jin, didn't you do the dishes this morning?)

681
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,140
Seon Woo: Right. You did the dishes this morning.

682
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,910
Hyeong Joon: That's okay. I'll do it again.

683
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:51,840
-Really? -Yeah.

684
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,650
Min Seong: Let me help you do the dishes

685
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:55,540
Min Seong: since the meal was cooked by all of us.

686
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:58,750
Hyeong Jin: why do you all want to help me do the dishes after I said I'll do it?

687
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:02,800
-Because you did the dishes this morning. -Didn't you do the dishes this morning?

688
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:04,980
(The men finished the meal in an awkward atmosphere)

689
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:07,030
-Just leave them there. I'm going to take a shower. -I'll also take...
(The men finished the meal in an awkward atmosphere)

690
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:08,010
-I'm going to take a shower. -Seon Woo: Thank you all. The food is delicious.
(The men finished the meal in an awkward atmosphere)

691
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:10,130
-I'm going to take a shower. -Seon Woo: Thank you all. The food is delicious.

692
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,730
-Yung Hee: I enjoyed the food. -I enjoyed the food.

693
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:14,890
Hyeong Jin: Just put the dishes in the water. The maid will wash them clean.

694
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:23,040
Hyeong Jin: Bro, I'll wash them after I finish the meal.

695
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:25,050
(No reply and being silent)

696
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:28,370
(Peeking)

697
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:37,750
Hyeong Jin: It's okay. Just go back to your room.

698
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,900
-What? -Hyeong Jin: Go back to your room now.

699
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,980
Min Seong: I have to help.

700
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,370
-No more? -No more.

701
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:44,310
Okay, let's continue.

702
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,350
-Min Seong: Let me help you. -Hyeong Joon: It's almost done.

703
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,980
-Min Seong: Too many things to wash. -Hyeong Joon: I've washed them all.

704
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,020
Really?

705
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:53,570
(Hyeong Joon looks cold and stiff)

706
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:55,270
Let me help you clean them.
(Hyeong Joon looks cold and stiff)

707
00:33:56,930 --> 00:34:00,440
Hyeong Jin: Would you like something to drink? Coffee?

708
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,520
-Hyeong Joon: No, thanks. -Hyeong Jin: No?

709
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:05,730
-Hyeong Joon: Am I blushing? -I'm done.

710
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:07,740
Min Seong: Well, bro. Why are you blushing?

711
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:15,179
(Hyeong Joon goes to the second floor after doing the dishes)

712
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:29,429
(Trying to make himself calm despite complicated feelings)

713
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:30,679
(Hyeong Joon: I got so angry when I saw Hyeong Jin showing such an ambivalent attitude)

714
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:33,920
I got so angry when I saw Hyeong Jin showing such an ambivalent attitude.
(Hyeong Joon: I got so angry when I saw Hyeong Jin showing such an ambivalent attitude)

715
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:38,889
Hyeong Joon: He is always changing his target. Why is he chasing Min Seong now?

716
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:42,800
Hyeong Joon: Why would he go to Min Seong and do that to him

717
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,070
Hyeong Joon: when it didn't work on others?

718
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:49,440
He's my friend. He's the guy I have feelings for.

719
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,790
Hyeong Joon: What he did made me angry.

720
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,500
(Hyeong Joon feels upset so he is walking behind Min Seong)

721
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:04,770
Hyeong Joon: No matter what your choice is, I'll respect it.

722
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:07,090
Hyeong Joon: But when I saw

723
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:11,120
Hyeong Joon: Hyeong Jin showing that ambivalent attitude,

724
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,450
-Hyeong Joon: I hated it. -Min Seong: Hated what?

725
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:15,680
Hyeong Joon: I mean, when we were together, he stepped back.

726
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,900
Hyeong Joon: But in front of others, suddenly he did that to you.

727
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,700
Hyeong Joon: Did he do that to irritate me?

728
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,140
Hyeong Joon: Or did he just want to do that?

729
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,580
Hyeong Joon: He should either do it completely or never do it at all.

730
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,340
Hyeong Joon: This is what I want to tell him.

731
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,220
-I see. -What?

732
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,980
Min Seong: I didn't expect that you would think this way.

733
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:31,390
Look what he did.

734
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:31,970
(Hyeong Joon expressed his sadness honestly)
Look what he did.

735
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,850
He's always like this. Changing his mind easily.
(Hyeong Joon expressed his sadness honestly)

736
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:35,610
How should I deal with him?
(Hyeong Joon expressed his sadness honestly)

737
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,810
(Well...)

738
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:43,890
Min Seong: So this is how others may feel about what he did.

739
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:46,360
Min Seong: I just realized it.

740
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,600
Min Seong: Let's make it simple.

741
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,940
Min Seong: Don't feel too pressured.

742
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:56,720
Hyeong Joon: The implication I got from his words made me feel a little sad.

743
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,420
Hyeong Joon: To some extent, he was speaking for him.

744
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:04,070
If I had been him, I wouldn't have given a reply like that.

745
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:04,360
His words made me feel a little disappointed.

746
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:10,690
(Hyeong Joon's feelings were hurt a little bit because of Min Seong's disappointing words)
His words made me feel a little disappointed.

747
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:11,420
(Hyeong Joon's feelings were hurt a little bit because of Min Seong's disappointing words)

748
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,620
That's it.
(Hyeong Joon's feelings were hurt a little bit because of Min Seong's disappointing words)

749
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,630
(Hyeong Joon's feelings were hurt a little bit because of Min Seong's disappointing words)

750
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:17,320
(Min Seong goes back to his room alone)

751
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:21,380
Min Seong: To be honest, I don't quite understand it.

752
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:21,950
I feel Hyeong Joon does have some problems with Hyeong Jin.

753
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:26,700
(Min Seong feels the situation is a mess and he is uncomfortable with it)
I feel Hyeong Joon does have some problems with Hyeong Jin.

754
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,160
(Min Seong feels the situation is a mess and he is uncomfortable with it)

755
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,770
Hyeong Joon: What are you doing?

756
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:37,200
Yung Hee: I'm sleepy.

757
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,840
Yung Hee: How are you feeling?

758
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,380
What?

759
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,630
How are you feeling?

760
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:47,160
Hyeong Joon: My feeling? Just so-so.

761
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,500
-Yung Hee: Just so-so? -Yes.

762
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,290
Yung Hee: You're calmer than I thought you would be.

763
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:52,640
Yung Hee: Good for you.

764
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,600
Hyeong Joon: But I still... I still feel a little surprised.

765
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,660
Hyeong Joon: I feel like I was being fooled.

766
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:02,480
Hyeong Joon: I had this kind of feeling before.

767
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,640
Hyeong Joon: Today it was confirmed.

768
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:09,070
Hyeong Joon: So I'm a little surprised.

769
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:13,770
Yung Hee: He must feel troubled when making a choice.

770
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:16,250
Hyeong Joon: Of course. There is pressure on him.

771
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,970
Hyeong Joon: I'm just like...

772
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:30,260
(Hyeong Joon is unable to continue)

773
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:38,730
Hyeong Joon: From Min Seong's point of view, he must be under pressure.

774
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:47,030
Hyeong Joon: I'm just like that.

775
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:56,380
Hyeong Joon: Well, if I ask Min Seong to chat with me

776
00:37:56,380 --> 00:38:00,620
Hyeong Joon: or smoke with me, he'll feel pressured.

777
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:04,880
Hyeong Joon: I'm really sad about this, though I realized it a long time ago.

778
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:06,370
(Hyeong Joon is also worried about Min Seong)

779
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:07,780
That's it.
(Hyeong Joon is also worried about Min Seong)

780
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:11,290
(Hyeong Joon is also worried about Min Seong)

781
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,460
People will probably think I am unhappy.

782
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:14,580
-You were throwing a tantrum. -I can barely keep my eyes open.

783
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,830
(Jun Seong and Seong Ho return to the Men's House after their date)
-You were throwing a tantrum. -I can barely keep my eyes open.

784
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:18,200
Yes.
(Jun Seong and Seong Ho return to the Men's House after their date)

785
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,210
(Jun Seong and Seong Ho return to the Men's House after their date)

786
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,540
It's so cold.

787
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,450
-It's nice. -So cold.

788
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,930
Jun Seong: There is a strong smell of smoke on our clothes.

789
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:32,420
-Seong Ho: Really? -Yes.

790
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,490
They might think our clothes were burnt.

791
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:36,550
No one is here.

792
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,600
(No one on the first floor)
No one is here.

793
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,570
(No one on the first floor)

794
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:43,600
What?

795
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:50,000
-Yung Hee: Oh, you are back. -I can barely keep my eyes open.

796
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,190
Hello.

797
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:52,750
Hyeong Joon: Where is the gift?

798
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,260
-What? -Where is the gift?

799
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,950
Yung Hee: Where did you go?

800
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:56,920
-Jun Seong: We? -Yes.

801
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,900
Hyeong Joon: I asked if you bought the gift.

802
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:02,150
Jun Seong: Only our gifts. Oh, we bought you a gift.

803
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:04,200
Wait.

804
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:06,070
Wait.

805
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,050
Jun Seong: After you finish that, let's make DAENYEOL a gift-giving ceremony.

806
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:12,360
-Seong Ho: Oh, that's right. -We bought you a gift.

807
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,350
-Wait a moment. Have a seat first. -Okay, okay.

808
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,000
(Waiting for the gift respectfully)

809
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,500
Where did you go?
(Waiting for the gift respectfully)

810
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,360
Jun Seong: We went sledding.
(Waiting for the gift respectfully)

811
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,940
Jun Seong: We went sledding.

812
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:23,760
-It must have been fun. -Jun Seong: Then we went to the campsite.

813
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,500
Really?

814
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:28,310
Jun Seong: We had a barbecue and stayed in a caravan for a while.

815
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:29,230
Yung Hee: Wow, really?

816
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:31,170
-We had a barbecue. -Yung Hee: It must have been fun.

817
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:32,530
Jun Seong: Did everyone come back?

818
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:34,800
Yung Hee: We took the zip-line.

819
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,420
Jun Seong: Oh, it must have been great fun.

820
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,510
We then drove the kart truck.

821
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:37,970
Hyeong Joon: Don't say anything insincere.

822
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,830
Don't.

823
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:44,770
This X gesture means "Don't do that". I'm serious. Got it?

824
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:45,940
I'm serious.

825
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:48,840
Yung Hee: Everyone knows going to the campsite with their matched man is more enviable.

826
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,470
-Hyeong Joon: We don't even need to compare. -Yung Hee: They even stayed in the caravan.

827
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,750
Let's make a gift-giving ceremony.

828
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:54,880
-Yes. We're going to give him a gift. -Let's tell him about this first.

829
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,040
(The gift-giving ceremony for Hyeong Joon)
-Yes. We're going to give him a gift. -Let's tell him about this first.

830
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,120
Yung Hee: What? Should I hold him?

831
00:39:59,120 --> 00:39:59,930
Should I hold him?

832
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:04,030
Seong Ho: It can advance your career.

833
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:06,210
-Seong Ho: With it, you'll be able to keep up with the times. -Yes.

834
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:08,390
Seong Ho: It can help you show your professionalism.

835
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:08,880
This is what I was thinking when choosing the gift.

836
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,260
(Seong Ho: This is what I was thinking when choosing the gift)
This is what I was thinking when choosing the gift.

837
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:10,740
This is what I was thinking when choosing the gift.

838
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,260
-Seong Ho: Please close your eyes. -Hyeong Joon: Did you buy the truth?

839
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:14,070
Close your eyes. Close your eyes.

840
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:20,090
Ta-da.

841
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:25,040
Yung Hee: Do they want you to make cocktail with this?

842
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:27,180
It's obvious.

843
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:27,290
(Jun Seong and Seong Ho's gift: a toy blender to make bomb wine?)
It's obvious.

844
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:29,060
-You can use it to make somaek. -I'll use it to make cocktail.
(Jun Seong and Seong Ho's gift: a toy blender to make bomb wine?)

845
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,690
Make me cocktail.
(Jun Seong and Seong Ho's gift: a toy blender to make bomb wine?)

846
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:31,590
Hey, you piece of trash.

847
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:33,080
(Joking)
Hey, you piece of trash.

848
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,820
Jun Seong: When you make somaek next time, use it.

849
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:35,740
Use this?

850
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,300
Seong Ho: Where is everybody?

851
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,540
Yung Hee: They're all at the House. Maybe they're having a rest.

852
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,500
Today?

853
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,600
Jun Seong: They had a wonderful time.

854
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,550
Jun Seong: They said they had driven the kart car and taken the zip-line.

855
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:44,560
Seong Ho: What's the zip-line?

856
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,100
Yung Hee: It is a device that enables people to be attached to a rope and slide down from a high point.

857
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,250
-Seong Ho: Wow, it must have been great fun. -Yes.

858
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:49,540
I said don't say anything insincere.

859
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,150
He said, "Don't say anything insincere".

860
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,660
Don't say anything insincere.

861
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,950
Seong Ho, you know it.

862
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:56,150
When I am making an X gesture like this, I'm kidding. But when I am making an X gesture like this, I'm serious.

863
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:58,420
I'm sorry.

864
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,980
I can't do that.

865
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:02,440
Yung Hee: You must have had a wonderful time.

866
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,210
(Beep beep beep)

867
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:06,940
What is it?
(Beep beep beep)

868
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,030
It means you should go away.

869
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,610
Yung Hee: Let's go back to the room. To the single room.

870
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:12,130
-I'm going to... -Jun Seong: Let's open that.

871
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:13,030
-What? -Jun Seong: The Pokémon.

872
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:13,570
Seong Ho: Oh, okay.

873
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:14,570
I'm not in a good form. Go away.

874
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:15,570
Yung Hee: Don't come out if you go in.

875
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:17,300
Seong Ho: Let's show off the gift.

876
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:20,850
(Episode 11 Anonymous Chat)

877
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:22,040
I got a new text.
(Episode 11 Anonymous Chat)

878
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:26,620
(Now anonymous chat begins)

879
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,340
Don't read it. I haven't checked it yet.
(Now anonymous chat begins)

880
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,470
Wait. What is it? I haven't checked it yet.

881
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:32,590
We need to make the final decision right now?

882
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:32,810
(When the man you're interested in creates a chat group, you can join his group and chat with him anonymously for five minutes. You can only join two chat groups at most.)
We need to make the final decision right now?

883
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:34,030
Yes, today.
(When the man you're interested in creates a chat group, you can join his group and chat with him anonymously for five minutes. You can only join two chat groups at most.)

884
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:36,690
You don't know? We need to spend one more week with the new man.
(When the man you're interested in creates a chat group, you can join his group and chat with him anonymously for five minutes. You can only join two chat groups at most.)

885
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:38,170
Let's check immediately.

886
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:39,710
Hyeong Joon: Anonymous chat?

887
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:44,350
Hyeong Joon: I needed to make a call today. What a pity.

888
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:49,100
Hyeong Joon: I planned to call Hyeong Jin today.

889
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:52,310
Hyeong Joon: I wanted to tell him if he wants it, just go for it. If he wants to give up, then just quit.

890
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:54,300
Hyeong Joon: I wanted to make it clear to him.

891
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:57,450
Hyeong Joon: But now we could only chat anonymously. What a pity.

892
00:41:57,450 --> 00:41:58,670
Chung-ook: I have no advantage for it.

893
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:02,240
Chung-ook: Because I used to live abroad, my spelling is terrible.

894
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,610
Chung-ook: I don't type quickly, either.

895
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:06,440
Chung-ook: What does anonymous mean?

896
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,380
-Yung Hee: It means our real names will be hidden when we are chatting. -By using a code?

897
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:12,110
Yung Hee: You'll hide your name from the guy you'll be chatting with.

898
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:13,730
Yung Hee: The guy you are chatting with doesn't know who he is chatting with.

899
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:16,050
Seon Woo: Tell me the rules.

900
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:21,510
Seong Ho: Each of us has five minutes.

901
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:23,830
Seong Ho: If Chung-ook creates a chat group,

902
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:26,600
Seong Ho: we can join his group.

903
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,150
Seong Ho: It's not a one-on-one chat.

904
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:30,340
Seong Ho: It's a group chat.

905
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,250
All of us can join any group.

906
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:32,750
Seon Woo: But not at the same time.

907
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,060
Seon Woo: The chat groups are not created at the same time.

908
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:36,700
Seon Woo: We can't join all the chat groups at the same time, right?

909
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:37,970
Seong Ho: I can only join two groups.

910
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:40,900
Seon Woo: It's not one-on-one, right?

911
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:42,450
Yung Hee: Well, then it is not appropriate for us

912
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:43,470
Yung Hee: to stay there together.

913
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:44,680
Yung Hee: We need to separate

914
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,650
Yung Hee: because we can't know who is who.

915
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:47,870
It should take a long time.

916
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:49,040
(Which chat groups will the men join? What will they say?)
It should take a long time.

917

(Which chat groups will the men join? What will they say?)

918
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:06,150
Min Seong: Every time we do this, we will be quiet.

919
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:07,760
Min Seong: The whole house will be quiet.

920
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:10,330
Min Seong: We won't even make calls today.

921
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:12,630
Seon Woo: Yes, I'm glad that it's not making calls.

922
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:19,320
Hyeong Joon: There were many thoughts in my mind when I was waiting.

923
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:23,890
Hyeong Joon: What should I say when Min Seong or Hyeong Jin creates a chat group?

924
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:27,290
Hyeong Joon: Should I join their groups? I hesitated for a long time.

(Seong Ho Shin joined the group)

927

Seong Ho: Is it possible that no one will join my group?
(Seong Ho Shin joined the group)

928

930
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:59,480
Seong Ho: Well, is there anyone still curious about me?
(Seong Ho Shin joined the group) (Seong Ho Shin: What? No one is coming? Really?)

931

Seong Ho: Anyone who wants to ask me questions?

932
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:07,070

933
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:08,970
Seong Ho: Who will come?

934
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:15,680

(Man 2: Hi) (Seong Ho Shin: The maid should leave. Hahahaha)

939
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:30,150
(Man 2: Hi) (Seong Ho Shin: The maid should leave. Hahahaha. I'm so angry)
(Maid 2: Hahahaha. Are you talking to me?)
(Man 2: Get me some water)

940

(Seong Ho Shin: You can only be angry) (Man 2: Maid)
(Seong Ho Shin: At your service anytime)

00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:15,100
(Beep: Yours is the same as this one, right??) (Yung Hee Kim: Yes)
(DAENYEOL: Is that puppy Yung Hee?)
Chung-ook drew for me on our first date.

990
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:19,000
It's like I was reviewing the relationship between me and Seon Woo.

991
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,880
Yung Hee: At the same time, I felt very grateful.

992
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:33,930
(Yung Hee Kim: Why don't you say anything, Bro Maid?)
(DAENYEOL: Who is the maid?) (Maid 2: Who else can it be? It's a maid)

993
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:37,880
Yung Hee: First, the guy with the nickname DAENYEOL should be Hyeong Joon.
(Yung Hee Kim: Why don't you say anything, Bro Maid?)
(DAENYEOL: Who is the maid?) (Maid 2: Who else can it be? It's a maid)

994
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:38,140
Yung Hee: Chung-ook should be the one who sent the picture of the puppy. I'm grateful to him.

(Yung Hee Kim: Why don't you say anything, Bro Maid?)
(DAENYEOL: Who is the maid?) (Maid 2: Who else can it be? It's a maid)

996
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:44,420
Yung Hee: Then a guy nicknamed Maid 2 joined the group.

997
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:48,650
Yung Hee: He didn't say anything in the group, just like a maid.

998
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:49,970
Yung Hee: I wondered what was happening. Was he trying to be a real maid?

999
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:51,710
Yung Hee: He still didn't say anything so I asked him first.

1000
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:57,910
(DAENYEOL: Who is the maid?)
(Maid 2: Who else can it be? It's a maid)

1001
00:48:57,950 --> 00:49:04,350
(Yung Hee: Let's play Mafia game and have a drink tonight)

1002
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:16,170
(Maid 2: Don't drink tonight. Don't be so tired)

1003
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:21,430
(Maid 2: Don't drink tonight. Don't be so tired)
(Beep: I don't like people who make Yung Hee so tired)

1004
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:22,620
Chung-ook: All of a sudden,
(Maid 2: Don't drink tonight. Don't be so tired)
(Beep: I don't like people who make Yung Hee so tired)

1005
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:23,300
(Maid 2: Don't drink tonight. Don't be so tired)
(Beep: I don't like people who make Yung Hee so tired)

1006
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:28,020
Chung-ook: I typed and sent "I don't like people who make Yung Hee so tired".
(Maid 2: Don't drink tonight. Don't be so tired)
(Beep: I don't like people who make Yung Hee so tired)

1007
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:28,270
(Maid 2: Don't drink tonight. Don't be so tired)
(Beep: I don't like people who make Yung Hee so tired)

1008

(Beep: I don't like people who make Yung Hee so tired)
(Maid 2: I'm still cheering for you. I'm sorry)

1011
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:53,910
(DAENYEOL: Don't say sorry) (Yung Hee Kim: Hahahahaha)
(DAENYEOL: Cheer for yourself) (Yung Hee Kim: What are you sorry for?)

1012
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:55,870
Yung Hee: The guy nicknamed Maid 2
(DAENYEOL: Don't say sorry) (Yung Hee Kim: Hahahahaha)
(DAENYEOL: Cheer for yourself) (Yung Hee Kim: What are you sorry for?)

1013

Yung Hee: Oh, sorry?
(DAENYEOL: Don't say sorry) (Yung Hee Kim: Hahahahaha)
(DAENYEOL: Cheer for yourself) (Yung Hee Kim: What are you sorry for?)

1015
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,810
Yung Hee: Who would feel sorry for me?
(DAENYEOL: Don't say sorry) (Yung Hee Kim: Hahahahaha)
(DAENYEOL: Cheer for yourself) (Yung Hee Kim: What are you sorry for?)

1016
00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:02,040
Yung Hee: At first, I thought it was Seong Ho.

1017
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,600
Yung Hee: Is it because I like Seon Woo

1018
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,480
Yung Hee: and Seon Woo likes Seong Ho?

1019
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:10,970
Yung Hee: I thought he said sorry because of this.

1020
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:14,420
Yung Hee: But then I felt it wasn't Seong Ho.

1021
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:19,620
Yung Hee: I also doubted whether it was Seon Woo.

1022
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:24,860
(Seon Woo is repeatedly typing the message and then deleting it)

1023
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:28,820
Seon Woo: To me, whatever I say, it would be strange.

1024
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:30,730
Seon Woo: I wanted to send a message to Yung Hee.

1025
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:33,370
Seon Woo: But after I typed it, I just deleted it. Over and over again.

1026
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:37,600
(Feeling troubled)

1027
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:57,150
(Maid 2: Let's spend the rest of the time) (Maid 2: happily)
(Maid 2: Don't leave any regrets) (Yung Hee Kim: Okay~~) (DAENYEOL: Go get me a cup of water, Maid) (There is another guy who has difficulties writing a message)

1028
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:01,960
(DAENYEOL: I'm thirsty. I'm on the second floor) (Maid 2: Hahahahaha. Bye) (Beep beep beep beep) (There is another guy who has difficulties writing a message)

1030

Chung-ook: I couldn't talk about anything serious there.

1031
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:08,520
I felt Daniel was kind of...

1032
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:12,730
(Chung-ook: I felt Daniel was kind of...)
I felt Daniel was kind of...

1033

(Chung-ook: I felt Daniel was kind of...)
I felt Daniel was kind of...

1034
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:14,670
Chung-ook: I felt Daniel was kind of annoying.

1035
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:19,820
(Hyeong Joon has already joined a chat group)

1036
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:25,780

(Chung-ook's anonymous chat group created)

1038
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:43,670
Chung-ook: To be honest, I wasn't waiting for anyone but Yung Hee.

1039
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:47,900
Chung-ook: I was thinking what I should do if no one joined my group.

1040

(David Chung-ook Kim joined the group)
(Dinosaur joined the group)

1045
00:52:03,930 --> 00:52:08,280
Yung Hee: I looked like a dinosaur when I was a kid. So my friends often called me Dinosaur.

1046
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,770
Yung Hee: That's why I got myself nicknamed Dinosaur.

1047
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:12,680
Yung Hee: I guess no one would remember it. Is it on the first day that I said it?

1048
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:15,100
Yung Hee: I mentioned it when we were talking about our first impression of each other.

1049

1071
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:23,930
