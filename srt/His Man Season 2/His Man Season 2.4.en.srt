Hello?

3
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:11,040
Seon Woo: Are you sure you get along well with ENFJs?

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,070
What?

5

(Seon Woo is calling Hyeong Joon)

8
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,680
Hyeong Joon: I may get along well with them, but maybe not.

9
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,110
Seon Woo: Maybe not?

10
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,600
Seon Woo: I see.

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,320

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,770

14
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:39,090
Hyeong Joon: It was so sudden. I was surprised.

15
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:44,370
Seon Woo: Actually, the calling time today was quite hard for me.

16
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,830
Seon Woo: I think he was surprised.

17
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:51,500
Seon Woo: I'm just fond of him by instinct.

18
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,190
Seon Woo: I think I should be honest with my feelings,

19
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,960
Seon Woo: so I called him.

20
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,700
(The calling time is over.)

21
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,570
Jun Seong: It's fine that no one called me.

22
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,660
Jun Seong: I'll feel disappointed if I have expectations.

23
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:31,880
Jun Seong: I just want to do my best.

24
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:38,009
(The calling time is over.)

25
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:42,840
Chung-ook: It's only been two days. Today is the hardest.

26
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,370
Chung-ook: I'm worried that it'll get harder and harder.

27
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,400
Chung-ook: So for now,

28
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:54,390
Chung-ook: I want to keep my feelings for Yung Hee to myself.

29
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,500
Chung-ook: I won't be too greedy.

30
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:04,570
Chung-ook: I need some time to gather my thoughts.

31
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:11,190
Seon Woo: I received three calls, but I'm not happy.

32
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,550
Seon Woo: Because I didn't receive the call I was waiting for.

33
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:14,580
(Yung Hee, Hyeong Jin, Seong Ho)
(Seon Woo: I can't reciprocate the feelings of those who called me.)

Hyeong Jin: I didn't receive any calls,

37
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,520
but I don't feel very disappointed.

38
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,410
Hyeong Jin: Should I be bothered? There's tomorrow.

39
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:33,700
Hyeong Jin: To be honest, I was too nervous on the first day.

40
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,760
Hyeong Jin: It's a pity that I didn't show them who I am.

41
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,350
Hyeong Jin: If I had been myself,

42
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:42,140
Hyeong Jin: I may have appeared more charming.

43
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,579
I'm going dark.

44
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:51,829

46
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,820
Yung Hee: I called Seon Woo.

47
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,820
Hyeong Jin: I'm surprised that he owns a gelato shop.

48
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:04,120
Yung Hee: At first, I thought he was a bartender or a barista.

49
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,750
I mean Seon Woo.

50
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,300
Hyeong Jin: I thought he worked in a company.

51
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,250
Yung Hee: What? Like a clerk?

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,100
Who do you think he called?

Hyeong Jin: I don't know. I thought he called you.

57
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,100
Hyeong Jin: Or the tall one.

58
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:18,740
Yung Hee: Jun Seong?

59
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:18,880
(Hyeong Jin: Yeah.)
Yung Hee: Jun Seong?

60
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,980
Hey, Jun Seong.
(Hyeong Jin: Yeah.)

70
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:46,430

72
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,250
Jun Seong: I'm so tired.

73
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,850
Really.

74

(Shocked)
(Jun Seong: You want to die?)

-Yes.

78
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,800
Chung-ook: No, I just feel like I'm about to faint.

(Jun Seong: Because you're too tired.)

You're right.

100
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,750
This is a real room.

101
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,200
Min Seong: The atmosphere here is great.

102
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,120
Yeah.

103
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,810
Min Seong: But why is the bed crooked?

104
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,530
Seon Woo: I rolled on it.

105
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,710
Min Seong: For what?

106
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:41,840
(Plop)

114
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,270

115
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,630

-Min Seong: A different guy.

116
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,860
Seon Woo: It's so hard.

117
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,690
Seon Woo: Before I came, I thought it was just making a call. I can do it.

118
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:01,910
Seon Woo: But I was exhausted after making the call.

119
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,490
Seon Woo: I don't know what to do with myself.

120
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,260
Yeah.

121
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,720
Seon Woo: Were you in the room with him? No?

122
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,380
Min Seong: No.

123
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,860
Min Seong: I was alone in the living room.

124
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:13,230
Seon Woo: Did the guy you called call you?

125
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,600
Min Seong: The guy I called?

126
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,640
Min Seong: I think so.

127
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,080
Seon Woo: Really? Then you'll make a match.

128
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,490
Min Seong: Maybe, but I'm not sure.

129
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,120
Seon Woo: I know. It's too early to tell.

130
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,620
Min Seong: That guy wouldn't tell me his name.

131
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,820
Min Seong: I asked who he was.

132
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,370
Seon Woo: You can guess, can't you?

133
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:32,740
Min Seong: But voices sound different on the phone.

134
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,840
Seon Woo: But if

135
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,990
Seon Woo: you saw how I was yesterday and today,

136
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,180
Seon Woo: you'd be surprised by who I called.

137
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,030
Seon Woo: Before I came here, I decided

138
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:42,090
(Seon Woo) (Don't think too much.)
Seon Woo: Before I came here, I decided

139
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:43,540
-to be honest with my feelings
-Yeah.
(Seon Woo) (Don't think too much.)

140
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,950
-and not think too much.
-Yeah.
(Seon Woo) (Don't think too much.)

141
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:46,010
So I pushed the button right after I went in.

142
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:50,130
(Seon Woo: I pushed the button right after I went in. He sounded very surprised.)

He sounded very surprised.
(Seon Woo: I pushed the button right after I went in. He sounded very surprised.)

144
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,170
Min Seong: Who is he?

145
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,380
We may become rivals tomorrow.

146
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,730
Seon Woo: I think the Date Right is very important.

147
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,240
Min Seong: Date?

148
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,200
Min Seong: I want to go on a date with everyone.

149
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,100

I want to know all of them.
(Min Seong: I want to go on a date with everyone.)

152
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:15,230

-Me too.

156
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,710
Min Seong: Could they be the same guy?

157
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,210
Seon Woo: You get up late. No.

158
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,260
Min Seong: They might be the same guy.

159
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,440
Seon Woo: Be careful. I'll go all out.

160
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,700
(Who's in the men's hearts?)

161
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,640
(Taking a hint)

162
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,480
(The men are still sleeping.)

163
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,520
I got a car. I'll go pick you up.

164
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,850
Get in. Let's go.

165
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:43,860
I don't care where we go.

166
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,840
(Seong Ho is doing morning exercise with music.)
I don't care where we go.

167
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,190
Seong Ho: I feel like I'm going to throw up.

168
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:01,750
(Today, Seon Woo is the first to start preparing as well.)

169
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,320
Seon Woo: You're working harder today.

170
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,100
(Panting)

171
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,860
Seong Ho: I used dumbbells today.

172
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:16,950
(Seon Woo: Your roommate gets up at 7:30?)
(Nod)

173
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,180
Your roommate gets up at 7:30?
(Seon Woo: Your roommate gets up at 7:30?)
(Nod)

174
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,120
(Seon Woo: Your roommate gets up at 7:30?)
(Nod)

175
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,830
Seon Woo: Come to my room if you're worried about waking him.

176
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,170
Yung Hee: You scared me.

177
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,040
What's going on?

178
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,990
Yung Hee: Don't roll up the mat. I'll use it.

179
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,230
-Okay.
-Oh yeah.

180
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,020
(Oh yeah)
-Okay.
-Oh yeah.

181
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:31,600
(Oh yeah)

182
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,350
Yung Hee: You're up early.

183
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,080
Seong Ho: I'm going to faint.

184
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,230
(Shaking)
Seong Ho: I'm going to faint.

185
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,700
My legs are shaking.
(Shaking)

186
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,900
(Hyeong Joon is waking up.)

187
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:51,400
(It's his first morning in the Men's House.)

188
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,780
Yung Hee: Good morning.

189
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,500
(Hyeong Joon comes to use the bathroom in Seon Woo's room.)

190
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:14,530
(Chung-ook and Hyeong Jin got up too.)

191
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:15,730
What time is it?
(Chung-ook and Hyeong Jin got up too.)

192
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:16,770
7:30.
(Chung-ook and Hyeong Jin got up too.)

193
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:17,690
7:30?
(Chung-ook and Hyeong Jin got up too.)

194
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:18,480
7:30?

195
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,570
Hyeong Jin: Have you washed up?

196
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:21,310
Chung-ook: Yes. I took a shower.

197
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,990
Hyeong Jin: I'm going to wash up and change.

198
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,430
Wash up.

199
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:28,080
Hyeong Jin: Is the toothpaste in the bathroom yours?

200
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,120
Chung-ook: No. You can…

201
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,740
Hyeong Jin: Can I use it?

202
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,470
Chung-ook: Yes, you can.

203
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,900
Hyeong Jin: The lock is broken, isn't it?

204
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:35,630
Chung-ook: It's not.

205
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:35,650
(Hyeong Jin: It's not broken? I can't lock the door.)
Chung-ook: It's not.

206
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,210
-It's not broken?
-No.
(Hyeong Jin: It's not broken? I can't lock the door.)

207
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:39,090
I can't lock the door.
(Hyeong Jin: It's not broken? I can't lock the door.)

208
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,000
Chung-ook: Try again.

209
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:45,960
(Huh?)

210
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,020
(Huh?)
(Huh?)

211
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,410
-Did you turn it to the end?
-Yes.

212
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:49,100
(Yes!)
(Yes?)
-Did you turn it to the end?
-Yes.

213
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,570
Chung-ook: But… Wait.

214
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:55,050
Chung-ook: I locked it just now.

215
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,500
(Click)

216
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:00,430
-I'll watch the door for you.
-Okay.

217
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,030
(Chung-ook: I'll watch the door for you.)
-I'll watch the door for you.
-Okay.

218
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,530
(Chung-ook: I'll watch the door for you.)

219
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,250
(Rummaging)
(Min Seong is the last one to get up.)

220
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:16,830
(He starts a new day with scraping.)

221
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,370
Seong Ho: Sir.

222
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,070
Seong Ho: Sir.

223
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,790
Seong Ho: You're late.

224
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,890
Hyeong Joon: I'll do it myself.

225
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,430
Seong Ho: Tell me if you need anything.

226
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,450
Hyeong Joon: What's your style today?

227
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:34,880
Seong Ho: My style today is Hype Boy.

228
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,400
Hype Boy.

229
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,180
I can see it.

230
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,410
I want to go with that style too.

231
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,880
Hyeong Joon: But it's so dark here that I can't see if I've put it on.

232
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,500
(Clapping)

233
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:54,700
Hyeong Joon: No personal feeling is involved, right?

234
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,650
(Seon Woo gets ready first.)

235
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:06,180
(He starts cleaning the kitchen again.)

236
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,570
(Halt)

237
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:24,720
Seon Woo: I turned around and saw three mission cards.

238
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,750
Seon Woo: I was like, "I'm late. I have to hurry."

239
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,940
Seon Woo: So I checked them right away.

240
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:39,920
(Seon Woo chose one mission card.)

241
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,510
Seon Woo: It turned out that I was not late. I was the first.

242
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,240
Seon Woo: We go in order.

243
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,780
(Only three people can have the Date Right today.
Those who find these cards can ask whoever they want to spend time with for a date. Invitations go in order. The one being invited can't refuse.)
Seon Woo: We go in order.

244
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,560
(Only three people can have the Date Right today.
Those who find these cards can ask whoever they want to spend time with for a date. Invitations go in order. The one being invited can't refuse.)

245
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:54,630
(Seon Woo is lost in thought.)

246
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:06,990
(He puts the mission card back.)

247
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,360
Seon Woo: I feel more comfortable being chosen.

248
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,350
Seon Woo: I wanted to be chosen today so I put it back.

249
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,550
Seon Woo: Do you want coffee?

250
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:21,780
Jun Seong: I think I'm the last one to wash up.

251
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,990
Seon Woo: I'll make the coffee. Go wash up.

252
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:25,550
-It doesn't work? I want my coffee warm.
-Okay.

253
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,640
(Jun Seong:It doesn't work? I want my coffee warm.)
-It doesn't work? I want my coffee warm.
-Okay.

254
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,280
(Jun Seong:It doesn't work? I want my coffee warm.)

255
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,640
-Warm?
-Yes.

256
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:36,460
(Pause)

257
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:41,870
Seon Woo: I realized that what I did was underhand.

258
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:45,740
Seon Woo: I thought I shouldn't do that and should be honest with my feelings.

259
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,430
Seon Woo: So I came out again

260
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,580
Seon Woo: and took the card.

261
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,350
Jun Seong: It won't work.

262
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,570
Seon Woo: I'll unplug it and try again.

263
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:00,380
Seon Woo: You don't eat sandwiches, right? Do you want some salad?

264
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,820
Seon Woo: You're not having anything? Okay.
Jun Seong: I don't want to eat.

265
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:07,540
(Jun Seong passes the mission cards directly.)

266
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,410
Yung Hee: Do you need help?

267
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:09,440
-Yeah. Let's all have coffee.
-What can I do for you?

268
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,020
(Seon Woo: Yeah. Let's all have coffee.)
-Yeah. Let's all have coffee.
-What can I do for you?

269
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:12,180
(Yung Hee: Eight cups of coffee?)

270
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,690
-Anyone doesn't drink coffee?
-Eight cups of coffee?
(Yung Hee: Eight cups of coffee?)

271
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:16,370
Seon Woo: There are two cups of espresso there.

272
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,230
Chung-ook: Do you need help?

273
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,130
Seon Woo: It's all done. Let's grab a bite and go out.

274
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:25,340
Chung-ook: Maybe we should wait for a while. We'll be told of the task today, right?

275
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,470
-I saw mission cards when I came downstairs.
-Yes.
(Yung Hee: I saw mission cards when I came downstairs.)

276
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:31,770
Chung-ook: I'll go find out what today's mission is.

277
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,510
Seon Woo: I see. You don't know what we'll do today.

278
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,150
Yung Hee: Find out and get ready to go out.

279
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:39,240
Seon Woo: Do you want to choose someone for a date

280
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,010
Seon Woo: or be chosen?

281
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:44,320
Chung-ook: To be honest, I prefer to be chosen.

282
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,440
Yung Hee: I want to choose.

283
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,820
-Choose?
-Yes.

284
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:51,580
Chung-ook: I don't think we'll do that today. We already did it yesterday.

285
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,250
-Right?
-I think so.

286
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,280
Chung-ook: I think there'll be something new.

287
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,510
-Have you read that?
-What?

288
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,780
-Yung Hee: Have you read it?
-Chung-ook: No.

289
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,270
Yung Hee: Go read it. We may not have to make choices.

290
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,310
Seon Woo: Go read it together.

291
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,990
Should we? I...

292
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,090
(Yung Hee: Shouldn't we be preparing to go out?)
Should we? I...

293
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:04,490
Shouldn't we be preparing to go out?
(Yung Hee: Shouldn't we be preparing to go out?)

294
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:07,200
Chung-ook: What time is it now? We still have a lot of time.

295
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,490
It's just eight.

296
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,300
Isn't it?

297
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:10,310
-Did you choose?
-Are we in a hurry?

298
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,300
(Seon Woo: Did you choose?)
-Did you choose?
-Are we in a hurry?

299
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,160
Yung Hee: No, I didn't.

300
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,390
Yung Hee: I didn't touch anything.

301
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,390
Seon Woo: You must have chosen.

302
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,460
Yung Hee: I didn't choose.

303
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,400
Chung-ook: Did you come downstairs first?

304
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,340
Yung Hee: No.

305
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:21,380
-He was here when I came downstairs.
-Was he?

306
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,700
(Yung Hee: He was here when I came downstairs.)
-He was here when I came downstairs.
-Was he?

307
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,880
Yung Hee: You've already chosen?

308
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,220
-We're the only ones who haven't chosen.
-What are you talking about?

309
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,290
(Laughing)
-We're the only ones who haven't chosen.
-What are you talking about?

310
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:25,930
Let's go.
(Laughing)

311
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:26,680
Let's go.

312
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,060
Seon Woo: Read the instructions before you choose.

313
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,620
Okay.

314
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,610
(Quick)
(Quick)

315
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,420
Gosh.

316
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,960
Okay.

317
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,540
Yung Hee: I see. That's why you asked me that question.

318
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,390
Yung Hee: I took it right after reading the first line.

319
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,490
Seon Woo: I could've kept quiet, but I told you anyway.

320
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:51,810
Chung-ook: So we can ask someone on a date?

321
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:52,590
Seon Woo: Yes.

322
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,060
Chung-ook: I regretted it for a moment.

323
00:13:55,060 --> 00:14:00,010
Chung-ook: I felt complicated. I preferred to be chosen.

324
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:01,320
Yung Hee: Did you take one card too?

325
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,020
(Nod)
Yung Hee: Did you take one card too?

326
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:02,590
(Nod)

327
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,670
Yung Hee: Okay.

328
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:09,300
Yung Hee: To be honest, I want to ask Seon Woo on a date.

329
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,250
Yung Hee: I didn't expect Seon Woo to have an Arrow Card too.

330
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:11,280
If I had known that, I might not have taken the card.

331
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,770
(Yung Hee: If I had known that, I might not have taken the card.)
If I had known that, I might not have taken the card.

332
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,740
Yung Hee: What's it? Read it. I don't know.

333
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:27,620
-Choose your date right now.
-Choose.

334
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,980
Those having the cards can't choose each other.

335
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:32,950
Seon Woo: Choose.

336
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,980
Seon Woo: So I just give it to him?

337
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,190
I see.

338
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,720
(Sigh)

339
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,810
Yung Hee: I felt very sad that I couldn't ask him on a date.

340
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:48,230
Yung Hee: I'd rather stay home.

341
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,920
(Seon Woo is going somewhere.)

342
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:55,930
("Let's go on a date.")

343
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:58,510
-Let's go on a date.
-Okay.
("Let's go on a date.")

344
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,420
("Let's go on a date.")

345
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:06,440
Seong Ho: I felt flustered. Jun Seong was there too, so I also felt complicated.

346
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:12,820
Seon Woo: It was very exciting to suddenly appear in his room.

347
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,810
Jun Seong: I thought that was bad.

348
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:24,710
Jun Seong: I saw the mission cards but didn't do anything.

349
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:27,140
Jun Seong: I was half asleep.

350
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:34,440
I'm too loose perhaps.

351
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,320
Jun Seong: Am I a little lazy? Do I relax too much?

352
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,070
Jun Seong: I feel very guilty about that.

353
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:47,750
(Yung Hee goes to the second floor to ask for a date.)

354
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,990
-What were you doing?
-What?

355
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,480
-What were you doing?

356
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:56,510
I?

357
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,680
(Yung Hee puts the card on Hyeong Jin's bed.)
I?

358
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,550
I was washing the dishes.
(Yung Hee puts the card on Hyeong Jin's bed.)

359
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,230
(Yung Hee puts the card on Hyeong Jin's bed.)

360
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,230
Yung Hee: I decided to go out with Hyeong Jin again.

361
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:11,830
Yung Hee: I didn't give it to him directly. I put it next to his pillow.

362
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,020
Seon Woo: Go. You're late.

363
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,190
I?

364
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:26,440
Chung-ook: They both gave the cards out immediately. I had to make my choice too.

365
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,630
(Who is Chung-ook going to ask for a date?)

366
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,140
Good morning

367
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:34,980
(The card is suddenly given out.)
Good morning

368
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,520
(The card is suddenly given out.)

369
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,320
Hyeong Joon: What's this?

370
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,650
-Hyeong Joon: What's this?
-Chung-ook: We'll do it in order today.

371
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,350
Hyeong Joon: What's this?

372
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:43,580
-We're going on a date today.
-Really?

373
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,960
(Chung-ook: We're going on a date today.)
-We're going on a date today.
-Really?

374
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,640
-We're going on a date today.
-Really?

375
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:51,660
Hyeong Joon: I got an Arrow Card but didn't know what it was. I was unsettled.

376
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:56,530
Chung-ook: I was thinking while looking at the balcony outside.

377
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:59,090
Chung-ook: Hyeong Joon passed by.

378
00:16:59,090 --> 00:16:59,240
(Chung-ook: His jacket is the same brand as mine.)
Chung-ook: Hyeong Joon passed by.

379
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,990
His jacket is the same brand as mine.
(Chung-ook: His jacket is the same brand as mine.)

380
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,400
His jacket is the same brand as mine.

381
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,849
Chung-ook: If we wear the same jacket for a date, it'll be interesting.

382
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,720
Chung-ook: I'll give you choices.

383
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,670
Chung-ook: Do you want to do something really cheesy or…

384
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:16,329
Chung-ook: How should I put it?

385
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:19,720
-Yung Hee: Are you talking about your date style today?
-Chung-ook: No. That's not what I'm talking about.

386
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,210
(Curious)
-Yung Hee: Are you talking about your date style today?
-Chung-ook: No. That's not what I'm talking about.

387
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:21,740
(Curious)

388
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,220
Chung-ook: I'm thinking maybe we can wear the same clothes.

389
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,020
Hyeong Joon: What? The same clothes? With me?

390
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:29,850
-Yeah.
-Really?

391
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:30,110
Really.

392
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:30,440
(Chung-ook: Yes. I have the same jacket.)
Really.

393
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,410
-Yes. I have the same jacket.
-You have this jacket too?
(Chung-ook: Yes. I have the same jacket.)

394
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:31,510
-Yes. I have the same jacket.
-You have this jacket too?

395
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,300
(Shocked)
-Yes. I have the same jacket.
-You have this jacket too?

396
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,720
Really?
(Shocked)

397
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,250
Really?

398
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,350
Hyeong Joon: Let's wear the same jacket.

399
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,970
Chung-ook: Are you sure? Is it OK?

400
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,290
Hyeong Joon: Yes. It's fun.

401
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,480
OK.

402
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,690
Chung-ook: We'll dress like a couple.

403
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,390
Chung-ook: Don't regret it.

404
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:44,510
(-Seong Ho: Our outfits don't match today.
-Seon Woo: You're right.)

405
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:47,090
-Our outfits don't match today.
-You're right.
(-Seong Ho: Our outfits don't match today.
-Seon Woo: You're right.)

406
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:49,010
Seong Ho: I'm in Hybe Boy style today.

407
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,190
Seon Woo: I have pink clothes.

408
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,480
Seong Ho: Wow, great.

409
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,990
Seon Woo: Okay. I'll get changed.

410
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:54,760
(Looking around)

411
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,080
Wear the same clothes.
(Looking around)

412
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:56,630
(Looking around)

413
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,810
Yung Hee: What are they doing?

414
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:04,800
(Hyeong Jin hasn't found the card and is still preparing.)

415
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,840
Hyeong Jin: What's this?

416
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,420
(Drop)

417
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,280
(Hyeong Jin doesn't know what the card means.)

418
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,880
Yung Hee: Did you see the card?

419
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,350
Yung Hee: Hyeong Jin.

420
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,460
Yung Hee: Did you read the card on your bed?

421
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,260
Hyeong Jin: That one?
Yung Hee: Yes.

422
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,210
Yung Hee: I put it there.

423
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,140
-Really?
-Yes.

424
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,710
Hyeong Jin: I was happy

425
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:40,050
Hyeong Jin: that he chose to date me.

426
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:40,780
Thank you.

427
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,620
(Jun Seong comes out late after preparations.)
Thank you.

428
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,810
(Jun Seong comes out late after preparations.)

429
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,020
I'm sleepy.

430
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:54,120
Seong Ho: You just pushed it to him as soon as he sat down.

431
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:00,260
Jun Seong: It's meaningless to me.

432
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,220
Seon Woo: I feel offended.

433
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,650
Seong Ho: At least you need to know what's happening.

434
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,920
Jun Seong: Who's the other guy left?

435
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:09,090
-He's coming.
-So funny.

436
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,440
(Yung Hee: He's coming.)
-He's coming.
-So funny.

437
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:10,990
Hi.

438
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:12,220
(Min Seong is obliviously cheerful.)
Hi.

439
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,800
Min Seong.
(Min Seong is obliviously cheerful.)

440
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,220
-Seon Woo: Today's mission is over.
-Min Seong: What's that?

441
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,610
Min Seong: So who are those three guys?

442
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:21,450
Jun Seong: You and I will be left alone.

443
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:24,050
Min Seong: Left alone? Where?

444
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,340
-Jun Seong: Here.
-Min Seong: Here?

445
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:25,920
Yes.

446
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:25,930
(Min Seong: Really?)
Yes.

447
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,080
-Really?
-Yeah.
(Min Seong: Really?)

448
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,030
Jun Seong: What should we do? Take a walk into the fog?

449
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:34,200
Jun Seong: I felt relieved to know that Min Seong would be left with me.

450
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,700
Jun Seong: Because we talked a lot yesterday,

451
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:42,020
Jun Seong: I feel relaxed around him.

452
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:46,770
(Three couples are paired in order.)

453
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,950
(Chung-ook is putting on the matching outfit.)

454
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,430
(Seon Woo changes into a color that goes with Seong Ho's outfit.)

455
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:12,160
Seon Woo: No matter what I wear, I don't look like a Hype Boy.

456
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,230
-Do I look like a Hype Boy?
-Yes.

457
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:16,040
Seon Woo: So it's done, right?
Seong Ho: Yes.

458
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,570
Do you like trying things you haven't done before?
(Seong Ho: Do you like trying things you haven't done before?)

459
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:18,650
-Seon Woo: This one is better than that one, right?
-Seong Ho: Yes.

460
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:19,960
Seon Woo: It's good to try something new.

461
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,540
-Really?
-Yes.

462
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:22,900
Should I wear this or that?

463
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,590
(Jun Seong is watching them.)
Should I wear this or that?

464
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,530
(Jun Seong is watching them.)

465
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:31,300
Jun Seong: What should I do? I'm too lazy.

466
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,500
(They're all ready for the dates.)

467
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:40,120
(Seong Ho is taking a break.)

468
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:43,760
(Knock knock)

469
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:47,320
(-Jun Seong: Seon Woo is waiting for you outside.
-Seong Ho: Okay.)

470
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,490
-Seon Woo is waiting for you outside.
-Okay.
(-Jun Seong: Seon Woo is waiting for you outside.
-Seong Ho: Okay.)

471
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,810
Have fun.

472
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:02,350
Yung Hee: Are you going to cook?

473
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:04,120
-Jun Seong: Yes.
-Yung Hee: What are you going to cook?

474
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,940
-Min Seong: Spicy rice cake.
-Spicy rice cake.

475
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,310
Yung Hee: It must be very delicious. Spicy rice cake.

476
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,730
I'm leaving.

477
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:09,740
(Yung Hee is the last one to leave. Everyone else has gone on a date.)
I'm leaving.

478
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,410
Bye.
(Yung Hee is the last one to leave. Everyone else has gone on a date.)

479
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:11,280
See you later.
(Yung Hee is the last one to leave. Everyone else has gone on a date.)

480
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,900
Bye. Bye.
(Yung Hee is the last one to leave. Everyone else has gone on a date.)

481
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:13,430
It looks delicious. Let's eat over there.

482
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:16,530
(The simple snack time for the two men left.)
It looks delicious. Let's eat over there.

483
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:19,250
(The simple snack time for the two men left.)

484
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:29,400
Jun Seong: It's quite relaxing.

485
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:29,920
Min Seong: Yes.

486
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,480
Jun Seong: I'm relaxed now. I love staying at home.

487
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:39,570
Jun Seong: Someone made my bed. Who did it?

488
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,680
Min Seong: It looks so delightful.

489
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,470
Jun Seong: It smells good too.

490
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:55,850
Min Seong: After I came here, I didn't have one meal relaxedly.

491
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:55,900
(Jun Seong: Yes.)
Min Seong: After I came here, I didn't have one meal relaxedly.

492
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,230
Yes, relaxedly.
(Jun Seong: Yes.)

493
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,820
Jun Seong: I ate a lot but didn't feel comfortable.

494
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,860
-Min Seong: We ate quite well,
-Yes.

495
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,550
Min Seong: but didn't feel comfortable.

496
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,400
It looks delicious.

497
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,710
It smells so good.

498
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,080
(Expectant)

499
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:12,700
Is it super good?
(Expectant)

500
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,980
Is it super good?

501
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,450
Jun Seong: Dig in.

502
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,490
Min Seong: I'll start eating.

503
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:18,590
Jun Seong: This is so good. Very delicious.

504
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,940
-Min Seong: Very delicious?
-Jun Seong: Yes.

505
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:21,870
It's really delicious. If there's more sauce,

506
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,290
(Good)
(Jun Seong: If there's more sauce, we can use it to make delicious fried rice.)
It's really delicious. If there's more sauce,

-Min Seong: It's so good.
-Jun Seong: Yes.

509
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:29,450
It's spicy.

510
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,680
Delicious.

511
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:36,300
Jun Seong: Who do you want to date today?

512
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,070
Min Seong: Hyeong Jin, right?

513
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:43,100
Jun Seong: Why? You're just curious?

514
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,010
Min Seong: Yes, just curious.

515
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:48,020
Min Seong: I want to try going on a date too.

516
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:54,580
Min Seong: But the person I called yesterday,

517
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:58,060
Min Seong: I chose him by instinct. I just followed my heart.

518
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,530
Min Seong: But I think we called each other.

519
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:03,950
Min Seong: That guy and I.

520
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:04,450
(Surprised)
(Jun Seong: Really?)

521
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,770
Really?
(Surprised)
(Jun Seong: Really?)

522
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:06,890
Min Seong: I think so.

523
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:12,880
Jun Seong: But why are you here?

524
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:17,720
Min Seong: Maybe he didn't call me for a special reason.

525
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,490
Min Seong: So, did you send the cookies out?

526
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:21,850
Jun Seong: Yes, I did immediately.

527
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:23,480
-Immediately?
-Yes.

528
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,500
Min Seong: Actually, yesterday,

529
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:30,460
Min Seong: I thought about giving the cookies to the one I called.

530
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,970
Min Seong: But I thought it was too soon. The deadline is tomorrow anyway.

531
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:35,320
So I decided not to give them out so soon.

532
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,740
Jun Seong: Are you being cautious?

533
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,790
Min Seong: But I got cold feet

534
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:42,750
Min Seong: because I considered starting a relationship with that guy.

535
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:46,230
Min Seong: That made me change my mind.

536
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,380
Min Seong: I became a bit cautious.

537
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:51,550
Min Seong: I plan to give it to him tonight, but I'm not sure.

538
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:54,430
Jun Seong: Once I fall in love with someone,

539
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:59,010
Jun Seong: I'll be very brave and not care about anything else.

540
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:05,620
Jun Seong: I won't care if he's with someone or not.

541
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:06,110
(Jun Seong: I think Seon Woo called Seong Ho.)

542
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:10,730
I think Seon Woo called Seong Ho.
(Jun Seong: I think Seon Woo called Seong Ho.)

543
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:11,190
(Jun Seong: I think Seon Woo called Seong Ho.)

544
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:11,270
Jun Seong: I saw him asking Seong Ho for a date.
(Jun Seong: I think Seon Woo called Seong Ho.)

545
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:14,810
Jun Seong: I saw him asking Seong Ho for a date.

546
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:21,630
Jun Seong: To be honest, we should seize the chance to express ourselves.

547
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:24,390
Jun Seong: Maybe it's because I didn't seize the chance.

548
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:28,290
Jun Seong: I'm very careful with Seong Ho.

549
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:28,640
(Jun Seong: No one could tell what I was thinking from what I did.)
Jun Seong: I'm very careful with Seong Ho.

(Jun Seong: No one could tell what I was thinking from what I did.)

551
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:34,750
No one could tell what I was thinking from what I did.

552
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:37,120
I blame myself quite often.

553
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:42,510
Jun Seong: I often have self-deprecating thoughts.

554
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,210
Jun Seong: Even so,

555
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,230
I'm going to do my best.

556
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:55,180
Jun Seong: Anyway, I'll be brave for now.

557
00:24:55,180 --> 00:25:00,350
Jun Seong: I don't even want to know anyone else.

558
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:03,670
I just want to know more about him.

559
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:10,130
Min Seong: I want to be brave, but I'm running out of time.

560
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:10,610
I want to know more about him before taking the next step.

561
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:14,510
(Min Seong wants a clear answer before taking further action.)
I want to know more about him before taking the next step.

562
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:18,260
Min Seong: I want to clear my head as soon as possible.

563
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:19,630
I tell myself to relax

564
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,690
(They're looking for love in different ways.)
I tell myself to relax

565
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:24,720
but still feel torn.
(They're looking for love in different ways.)

566
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,550

567

Yes.

568
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:28,390
Jun Seong: But I feel relaxed today.

569
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:31,000
-Yeah.
-Jun Seong: It's just you and me.

570
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,160
Jun Seong: It's much easier to talk about such things with you

571
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,660
Jun Seong: than in front of everyone.

572
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:38,290
We're much closer than when we started.

573
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:40,180
(Min Seong: I and Jun Seong are much closer than when we started.)
We're much closer than when we started.

574
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,640
Min Seong: He's like a friend.

575
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,390
We've become friends.

576
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,340
(Jun Seong is washing the dishes.)

577
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:56,710
(Min Seong starts cleaning the room.)

578
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,040
(Roll)

579
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,840
(Roll)

580
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,890
Min Seong: I usually wait until everything's in a mess to clean up.

581
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:15,490
Min Seong: I decided to clean up today, so I did.

582
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,360
Min Seong: Because I have a roommate,

583
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,540
Min Seong: I helped Hyeong Joon clean up too.

584
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:30,270
(Not missing any dust.)

585
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:32,350
Min Seong: I don't know if he'll like it.

586
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:35,170
Min Seong: I'm a little worried that he may be angry

587
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:35,340
(Min Seong: He may be angry that I touched his things without his permission.)

590
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,320
(Exhale)

591
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,710
(Fall asleep right after cleaning the room.)

592
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:06,880
(Both men fell asleep in a blink of an eye.)

593
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:12,530
(At the same time, where is Seon Woo and Seong Ho?)

594
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,980
They're looking at me.

595
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:15,040
Let me hold it if it's heavy.

596
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,180
(Just walking together makes them happy.)
Let me hold it if it's heavy.

597
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,980
No. I've been relaxed the whole time.

598
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:18,990

I even thought I should hold it.
(Just walking together makes them happy.)

600
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:21,190
I even thought I should hold it.

601
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:23,360
I thought the size was perfect.

602
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,760
I'll hold the door. It's okay.

603
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:25,790
(Where are they?)

604
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:26,760
Okay.
(Where are they?)

605
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,750
Hold it here.
(Where are they?)

606
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:32,880
Hello.

607
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,330
Hello

(A cafe where you can draw paintings)

610
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,480
Seon Woo: Can you do it yourself?

611
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,900
Seong Ho: Help me.

612
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:57,420
Seong Ho: Is this right?

613
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,880
No.

614
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,790
Seon Woo: Have you never worn an apron before?

615
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,790
Seon Woo: I wear an apron every day.

616
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:04,680

617
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,120
Seong Ho: No. Make it loose.

618
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,210
Okay. Loose.

Look, a beret.
(A hat is spotted.)

621
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:18,080
Seong Ho: This material is perfect for traveling.

622
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,070
-Do I look weird?
-You look like the MC of Music Bank.

623

Haven't you picked yet?
(Seong Ho: Are you done? Haven't you picked yet?)

628

(HYPE Boys are carefully choosing the color.)
What does it look like?

633

It looks like this.
(HYPE Boys are carefully choosing the color.)

634
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,040
I can't find it.
(HYPE Boys are carefully choosing the color.)

635
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,420
Seon Woo: Then I'll settle for two different ones.

636
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,270
-Seong Ho: Mix and match.
-Seon Woo: That's it.

637
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,140
Seon Woo: It's not too bad. Let's just go.

638
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:43,230
It's okay.

639
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:44,090
(Giggling)
It's okay.

640
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:44,540
It's okay.

641
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,620
(A space where they can paint face to face)

642
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,310
Oh, we'll sit face to face?
(A space where they can paint face to face)

643

Seong Ho: Wow, it's so beautiful.

644
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,120
Seon Woo: Sit with your back to the sea.

645
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,880
Okay.

646
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,920
Seong Ho: You have to draw the sea too.

647
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,050
Okay.

648
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:58,130
Seon Woo: Are you good at art too?

649
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:58,440
Did you choose that career because you're good at art?

650
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,750
(Seon Woo: Did you become a makeup artist because you're good at art?)
Did you choose that career because you're good at art?

651
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,010
No, I'm not good at art.
(Seon Woo: Did you become a makeup artist because you're good at art?)
Did you choose that career because you're good at art?

652
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:01,120
No, I'm not good at art.

653
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,490
(Seong Ho: I'm not good at art. I have no talent for that.)
No, I'm not good at art.

654
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:05,670
-You're not?
-I have no talent for art.
(Seong Ho: I'm not good at art. I have no talent for that.)

655
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:10,190
Seon Woo: Let's both sit still when we sketch.

656
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:10,220
(-Seon Woo: Do you want to draw first?
-Seong Ho: Yes. I want to draw first.)
Seon Woo: Let's both sit still when we sketch.

657
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,460
Do you want to draw first?
(-Seon Woo: Do you want to draw first?
-Seong Ho: Yes. I want to draw first.)

658
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,240
-Yes, I want to draw first.
-Okay.
(-Seon Woo: Do you want to draw first?
-Seong Ho: Yes. I want to draw first.)

659
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,560
(Staring)

660
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:19,130
(Shy)

661
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:21,660
(-Seon Woo: I'm joking. My side face is better.
-Seong Ho: No.)

662
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,280
My side face looks better.
(-Seon Woo: I'm joking. My side face is better.
-Seong Ho: No.)

663
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:23,660
(-Seon Woo: I'm joking. My side face is better.
-Seong Ho: No.)

664
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,620
No, no.
(-Seon Woo: I'm joking. My side face is better.
-Seong Ho: No.)

665
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,430
Seon Woo: Okay. I'm mistaken.
(-Seon Woo: I'm joking. My side face is better.
-Seong Ho: No.)

666
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,670
Seon Woo: Okay. I'm mistaken.

667
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:28,460
Seong Ho: Please look right at me.

668
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:37,590
(Slowly drawing Seon Woo's face on the canvas.)

669
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:41,450
Seon Woo: We finally went on a date.

670
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:43,450
Seong Ho: Yes. I thought we wouldn't get a chance.

671
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:46,190
Seong Ho: We have to call twice to go on a date.

672
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,890
Seon Woo: I kept my promise, right?

673
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:53,300
(Focused)

674
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:56,730
(So cute)

675
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:00,090
Seon Woo: Will you make me look good?

676
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,410
Seong Ho: Sure. Don't move.

677
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,870
Seong Ho: I need to focus. Don't move.

678
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,540
-Seon Woo: I can't say anything?
-Seong Ho: No.

679
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:11,170
Seong Ho: I can't focus at all. I can't multitask.

680
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:14,090
Seong Ho: We agreed to give the paintings to each other.

681
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:18,020
Seong Ho: I really hope I can draw a nice painting for him.

682
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,950
Seong Ho: You look like the prince in American animation

683
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:33,440
Seong Ho: who became a villain in the end. You know?

684
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,490
Seon Woo: I know.

685
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:37,620
Seong Ho: I'm drawing you like that.

686
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:42,870
Seong Ho: I've finished the sketch.

687
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:44,990
-Seon Woo: Are you done? Okay.
-Yes.

688
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:46,710
Seon Woo: I'll see it later.

689
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:47,240
Turn around a bit. Stay like that.

690
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,860
(It's Seon Woo's turn to draw the sketch.)
Turn around a bit. Stay like that.

691
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:50,520
Turn around a bit. Stay like that.

692
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:54,490
(Carefully observing Seong Ho's face for the first time.)

693
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:58,980
Seon Woo: I never noticed the shape of your brows.

694
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,490
Seong Ho: What are you talking about? I did my brows many times.

695
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:02,740
Seon Woo: Look at me.

696
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:05,630
Seong Ho: Are you good at drawing?

697
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,220
Seon Woo: No.

698
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:09,000
Seong Ho: Then I won't look forward to it.

699
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,050
Seong Ho: I was looking forward to seeing it, but I don't know.

700
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:13,590
Seon Woo: It's easy to draw you because you look like a painting.

701
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:17,970
Seon Woo: Wait. I can see the likeness now. That's it.

702
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,290
(Slightly)
(Seon Woo: Yes. Good.)

703
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:21,760
Yes. Good.
(Slightly)
(Seon Woo: Yes. Good.)

704
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,030
Seon Woo: Sorry. Turn back.

705
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:27,040
I want to draw well.

706
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,390
Seon Woo: I wanted to draw well.

707
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:33,990
Seon Woo: I wanted him to like my painting.

708
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:36,930
Seon Woo: Therefore, I wanted to do a good job.

709
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,430
Seon Woo: Your chin is round.

710
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:42,500
What? My chin is round?

711
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,860
(Speechless Seong Ho What) Your chin is round?
What? My chin is round?

712
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,050
I feel like I'm drawing an impression.
(Speechless Seong Ho What) Your chin is round?
What? My chin is round?

713
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:46,850
I feel like I'm drawing an impression.

714
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,490
Seong Ho: I'm not a criminal.

715
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:51,260
Seon Woo: The police can catch you with it.

716
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:56,120
Seong Ho: I drew your eyes too mean.

717
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,780
Seon Woo: Do I look mean?

718
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,860
Seong Ho: No, no.

719
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,430
Seon Woo: You look mean.

720
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:05,170
Seong Ho: What?

721
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:07,720
Seong Ho: Did you think before saying that?

722
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,540
Seon Woo: You're the first person I met.

723
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,680
Seon Woo: You're completely different from my first impression.

724
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,220
Seong Ho: Really? I made a bad first impression?

725
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:22,500
Seon Woo: It's not bad.

726
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:26,870
Seon Woo: I just didn't think I'd ask you for a date at that time.

727
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:29,530
Seong Ho: I see.

728
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:34,860
Seon Woo: What about me? Am I different from your first impression of me?

729
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:34,910
(-Seong Ho: No. You're how you impressed me.
-Seon Woo: Really?)
Seon Woo: What about me? Am I different from your first impression of me?

730
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:37,140
Seong Ho: No. You're how you impressed me.
(-Seong Ho: No. You're how you impressed me.
-Seon Woo: Really?)

731
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,500
-Really?
-Yes.
(-Seong Ho: No. You're how you impressed me.
-Seon Woo: Really?)

732
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,140
Seong Ho: Very easy-going.

733
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,850
Seong Ho: Good with words and talkative.

734
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:47,530
Seong Ho: You looked like you were good at blending in.

735
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:49,440
Seong Ho: And you indeed are.

736
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,320
Seong Ho: What made you think of me that way?

737
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,230
Seon Woo: It was obvious.

738
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,480
Seong Ho: Obvious?

739
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,610
Seon Woo: I'll just be frank.

740
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,840
Seong Ho: It's obvious.

741
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,890
Seong Ho: I hate to hear people say that.

742
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:08,850
Seong Ho: They think I like playing, drinking, and smoking, and don't care about anything.

743
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:11,600
Seong Ho: Many people labeled me as immature.

744
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,320
Seong Ho: I don't like that label

745
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,710
Seong Ho: so I take things seriously and work hard.

746
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,830
Seong Ho: I don't like that kind of remark.

747
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,810
Seon Woo: By obvious,

748
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:25,020
Seon Woo: I mean it was obvious that there wouldn't be

749
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:28,020
Seon Woo: any chemistry between us.

750
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,650
Seon Woo: But as I said,

751
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:37,160
Seon Woo: you're quite different from my first impression of you.

752
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,590
Seon Woo: You have many surprising sides.

753
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:48,430
Seon Woo: Things about you that I thought I wouldn't like

754
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:50,620
Seon Woo: are growing on me now.

755
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,450
Seon Woo: And you are very capable.

756
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:55,820
Seong Ho: I can take good care of myself.

757
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:59,130
Seon Woo: You're very able and hard-working.

758
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:03,030
(He seems to know what I mean.) (Seong Ho smiles.)

759
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:05,510
Seong Ho: What are you like when you're in a relationship?

760
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:10,719
Seon Woo: I won't make it eventful.

761
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,179
Seon Woo: I just want it to last.

762
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:14,960
-Seon Woo: Because breakups are...
-Seong Ho: I know, hard.

763
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,130
Seon Woo: I usually don't complain.

764
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,449
Seon Woo: So there won't be fights.

765
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:24,840
Seon Woo: But I'll frown, which is an obvious sign of annoyance.

766
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,139
Seong Ho: Why do you want to avoid fights?

767
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:31,199
Seong Ho: Are you afraid that quarrels may affect the relationship and lead to a breakup?

768
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:35,139
Seon Woo: I want to be a perfect lover.

769
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:36,810
Seon Woo: That's why.

770
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:39,449
Seon Woo: Although I know it's impossible.

771
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:42,960
Seong Ho: Are you a perfectionist too at work?

772
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,489
Seon Woo: Yes. I want everything perfect.

773
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:49,989
Seon Woo: Sometimes I find this trait of mine unbearable.

774
00:34:49,989 --> 00:34:54,330
Seon Woo: So this time, I told myself not to think so much

775
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:55,620
Seon Woo: and just go on the show.

776
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,990
Seon Woo: I think I do need a push like this

777
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:01,820
Seon Woo: to help me change.

778
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,930
Seon Woo: I felt comfortable.

779
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:09,010
Seon Woo: Both Seong Ho and I are honest people.

780
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:14,850
Seon Woo: Besides, we were talking while drawing.

781
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:17,030
Seon Woo: That made speaking our minds more easily.

782
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:20,130
Seon Woo: We just said what we thought. It was good.

783
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:22,920
-I…
-It's good.

784
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:26,220
(Taking a photo for Seong Ho who is focusing on drawing.)

785
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:29,250
Seong Ho: You don't have to look at me. You look good already.

786
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:35,900
(-Seong Ho: You can't see my drawing.
-Seon Woo: Sorry. I almost did.)

787
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,910
I can't see my drawing.
(-Seong Ho: You can't see my drawing.
-Seon Woo: Sorry. I almost did.)

788
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:37,910
I almost did.
(-Seong Ho: You can't see my drawing.
-Seon Woo: Sorry. I almost did.)

789
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:38,690
You can't see it.
(-Seong Ho: You can't see my drawing.
-Seon Woo: Sorry. I almost did.)

790
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:39,330
You can't see it.

791
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:43,680
Seong Ho: When I'm taking photos, I find that I'm good that it.

792
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:49,010
One, two.

793
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:49,270
I should press the shutter when you smile.

794
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:50,480
(Seong Ho: I should press the shutter when you smile. It'd be a great picture.)
I should press the shutter when you smile.

795
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,780
-Maybe you should.
-You look amazing when you smile.
(Seong Ho: I should press the shutter when you smile. It'd be a great picture.)

796
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,610
-Maybe you should.
-You look amazing when you smile.

797
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,110
You drew quite well.

798
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,440
(Seong Ho: You drew quite well. Me.)
You drew quite well.

799
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,320
-What?
-Me.
(Seong Ho: You drew quite well. Me.)

800
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,180
Seon Woo: I didn't capture your cuteness.

801
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:09,210
Seon Woo: You're very cute but my painting is not.

802
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:10,640
Seong Ho: Did you draw everything?

803
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,340
Seon Woo: Yes, except for your cuteness.

804
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,720
Seon Woo: I drew everything except for your cuteness.

805
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,020
Seon Woo: Except your cuteness.

806
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,920
Seon Woo: But I think maybe you'll like it.

807
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,860
Are you sure?

808
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,290
Seon Woo: I'll be done when you're done. I'm almost there.

809
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:25,190
Seong Ho: I'm done.

810
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,130
-You're done?
-Yes.

811
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:27,540
One last stroke.

812
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,690
Seon Woo: Can I show it first?

813
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:31,510
Seong Ho: Go ahead.

814
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:32,850
I'll show it first.

815
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:35,240
(What are they like in each other's eyes?)

816
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,830
You can look forward to it.
(What are they like in each other's eyes?)

817
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:38,680
(What are they like in each other's eyes?)

818
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:40,050
I'll show you now.

819
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,000
But…

820
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,680
I can see the resemblance.

821
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,400
There is a resemblance, right?

822
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,710
Yes, there is.

823
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:50,490
Seon Woo: It looks like you, right?

824
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:52,200
Seong Ho: It reminds me of The Grudge.

825
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:57,750
Seong Ho: I drew you quite well.

826
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:00,090
Seon Woo: It's amazing.

827
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:00,150
(Seon Woo looks like a cute cartoon character.)
Seon Woo: It's amazing.

828
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:02,820
-It looks like fan art.
-I…
(Seon Woo looks like a cute cartoon character.)

829
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,030
Take it.

830
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:06,410
Seon Woo: I don't look so shifty when I smile, do I?

831
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:07,560
Seong Ho: Shifty?

832
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,470
When you hold it,

833
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:12,530
Seon Woo: it becomes a different style.

834
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,900
(Looking carefully)

835
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:18,430
Seong Ho: You spent 40 minutes drawing this?

836
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:22,720
Seong Ho: I look cute in his painting.

837
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,070
Seong Ho: I wasn't unhappy.

838
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:29,430
It's not a perfect painting but is the perfect painting for me.

839
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:31,700
But I don't think I'll hang it up.

840
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:35,200
Seon Woo: Seong Ho drew very well too.

841
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:37,860
His painting made me happy.

842
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:43,160
Seon Woo: I'll rate Seong Ho's painting eight out of ten, and mine 9.5.

843
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:46,150
(Cheek heart)
(Selfie time)

844
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,120
Wait.
(Cheek heart)
(Selfie time)

845
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,470
(Cheek heart)
(Selfie time)

846
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,290
Seong Ho: Do you know this?

847
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:51,500
What made you think I don't?

848
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,160
(Angry)
What made you think I don't?

849
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:54,930
I guess you know.

850
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:56,090
Okay.

851
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:01,370
Why are you acting cute?

852
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,250
Why are you acting cool? So annoying.

853
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,290
-Let's go.
-I'm annoyed.

854
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:09,280
Seong Ho: Let's go.

855
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:09,530
(They observed each other's faces to know each other better.)
Seong Ho: Let's go.

856
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:14,900
(They observed each other's faces to know each other better.)

857
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:20,040
Seong Ho: Draw other guys after you go home.

858
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:24,040
Seon Woo: I won't draw them like that.

859
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,530
Seong Ho: I won't use any color.

860
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:26,280
Seong Ho: So you did that for me.

861
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,100
Seon Woo: I even drew blush for you.

862
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,410
Seong Ho: Are you sure it's blush?

863
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,120
I look like I'm having a fever.

864
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,550
Seong Ho: This is so beautiful.

865
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,290
I'm really hungry.

866
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:37,610
Seong Ho: I'm really hungry.

867
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:39,760
Okay.

868
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,110
(Display the paintings.)
Okay.

869
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:40,410
(Display the paintings.)

870
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:41,270
You did a great job.
(Display the paintings.)

871
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:42,230
You did a great job.
(Display the paintings.)

872
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:42,980
(Display the paintings.)

873
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:48,940
I often see people with this face on the subway.

874
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:48,950
When you go to work?

875
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:49,800
(I got it.)
When you go to work?

876
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,720
No, after work.
(I got it.)

877
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,370
After work.
(I got it.)

878
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,160
After work.

879
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,830
Seong Ho: How do you like our date today?

880
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:54,680
Our date?

881
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,140
-Seon Woo: I enjoyed it very much.
-Seong Ho: Really?

882
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,550
Seon Woo: Both the painting and the date are great.

883
00:38:58,550 --> 00:38:59,760
Both the painting and the date.

884
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,250
Seong Ho: The scenery there is beautiful. What a pity.

885
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:07,770
Seon Woo: I was too focused to watch the sea.

886
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:11,060
Seon Woo: I didn't realize that time passed so fast.

887
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,620
(-Seon Woo: Time.
-Seong Ho: Time passed so fast.)

888
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,290
-We drew fast too.
-Yes.

889
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:15,740
Thank you.

890
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,110
(Pen)
(What's this?)

891
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:20,060
What's this?
(Pen)
(What's this?)

892
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:20,410
You can use the pen to draw on the cup.

893
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:22,480
(Pen)
(Shop owner: You can use the pen to draw on the cup.)
You can use the pen to draw on the cup.

894
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:22,830
I see.

You can use the pen to draw on the cup.

895
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:24,030
I see.

896
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,430
(Please draw.)

897
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:29,930
Seong Ho: Why didn't you order wine? You fool.

898
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,850
What are you writing?

899
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:35,890
(Can't hold my liquor.)
What are you writing?

900
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:37,220
(Can't hold my liquor.)

901
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:37,310
Is it that?

902
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:39,020
(Soft messages like beer were left on each other's glass.)
Is it that?

903
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,330
(Soft messages like beer were left on each other's glass.)

904
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:42,490
Soft like beer.
(Soft messages like beer were left on each other's glass.)

905
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:42,980
(Soft messages like beer were left on each other's glass.)

906
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:43,200
Cheers.
(Soft messages like beer were left on each other's glass.)

907
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,150
OK.

908
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:53,730
Seong Ho: It's great.

909
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,850
Seong Ho: Are you interested in anyone in the Men's House?

910
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:57,660
-Me?
-Yes.

911
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,370
Seon Woo: Yes.

912
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:02,620
Seon Woo: My feelings became stronger yesterday and today.

913
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:06,710
Seon Woo: One-on-one dates help me know people better.

914
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:07,890
Seong Ho: Did you learn anything new?

915
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:08,660
-Seon Woo: About you?
-Yeah.

916
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,830
Yeah.

917
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:11,050
Seon Woo: You're forthright.

918
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:13,190
-Forthright.
-Very forthright.

919
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:15,390
Seong Ho: You sound like an old man.

920
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,680
Seon Woo: You're also upbeat.

921
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:22,760
Seong Ho: Are you writing a teacher's comments?

922
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,780
Seon Woo: I feel that you always know what you want

923
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:27,970
Seon Woo: no matter what the situation is. I can't do that.

924
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:31,790
Seon Woo: You also have high self-esteem and work very hard.

925
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,270
You're amazing.

926
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,460
Seong Ho: You're talking like an old man.

927
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,930
Seon Woo: Clink glasses with your teacher.

928
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:38,950
(Seong Ho: You talk like an old man.)
Seon Woo: Clink glasses with your teacher.

929
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:41,150
-You talk like an old man.
-I can't hold my liquor.
(Seong Ho: You talk like an old man.)

930
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:46,080
Seong Ho: He said many times that I'm different from what he thought.

931
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:51,370
Seong Ho: He encouraged me and made me feel strong.

932
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:52,650
Seong Ho: I felt very happy.

933
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,350
Seong Ho: Can I ask you something?

934
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:00,330
Seong Ho: Who did you call for the first and the second time?

935
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:04,270
Seon Woo: I want to know who I called? I can't tell you.

936
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:07,870
Seong Ho: You don't have to tell me if you don't want.

937
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:09,810
Seong Ho: You don't have to tell me.

938
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:12,140
Seong Ho: I didn't know you'd be so reluctant.

939
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,010
Seong Ho: Don't tell me then.

940
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:15,620
Seon Woo: It would make me appear fickle.

941
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,070
Seong Ho: Is it that serious?

942
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:20,290
Well,

943
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:21,850
Seon Woo: I called people I was curious about

944
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:25,280
Seon Woo: instead of those I already had contact with.

945
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:26,980
Seong Ho: Did you call the same guy?

946
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:27,630
Seon Woo: No.

947
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:29,280
Those two days…

948
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:33,040
Seon Woo: I may call someone different again today.

949
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,080
Seon Woo: I never expected you to call me.

950
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,500
-Seong Ho: From the first day?
-Seon Woo: Yes.

951
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,210
-Seong Ho: Why?
-Seon Woo: Not even in my dreams.

952
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:44,950
Seon Woo: I wouldn't even dream about it.

953
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:46,420
Seong Ho: Why?

954
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:49,210
Seon Woo: I didn't think I was your type.

955
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:50,030
Really?

956
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:51,760
Seong Ho: I don't show my feelings.

957
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,380
Seon Woo: You don't?

958
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:57,320
Seong Ho: I don't like to express how I feel.

959
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,430
Seong Ho: Not even when I'm angry.

960
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,440
Seong Ho: I don't want others

961
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:05,400
Seong Ho: to see me influenced by emotions.

962
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,570
Seong Ho: I don't like that.

963
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:11,020
Seon Woo: Why are you so mature?

964
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,190
Seon Woo: I'm surprised.

965
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:13,960
Seon Woo: I thought he liked making himself look good

966
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,920
Seon Woo: and expressing himself.

967
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:20,570
Seon Woo: But to my surprise, he said he was quite reserved.

968
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,340
(Food to go with the booze is served.)

969
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,520
Thank you.
(Food to go with the booze is served.)

970
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:27,070
Seon Woo: You can have this directly.

971
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:32,580
Seon Woo: You're curious about others too, aren't you?

972
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,590
Seon Woo: You must be curious.

973
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:36,830
Seong Ho: Someone I'm curious about?

974
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:39,020
Seong Ho: I'm not interested in anyone.

975
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,510
Seong Ho: I didn't go on many one-on-one dates.

976
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:43,790
Seon Woo: So you chose me directly?

977
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:45,760
Seong Ho: You have an issue with that?

978
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,030
Seon Woo: Not really.

979
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:49,560
Seon Woo: You just need to talk about your feelings.

980
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,260
Seon Woo: If you keep quiet, no one will understand you.

981
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:53,070
Seong Ho: I don't talk much.

982
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,670
Seon Woo (The original subtitle is wrong): Not even when you're in a relationship?

983
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:58,140
Seong Ho: Things are clear in a relationship because there's only one direction.

984
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:02,670
Seong Ho: I was anxious back then.

985
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:06,470
Seong Ho: I have too many choices now.

986
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:09,010
Seong Ho: I think

987
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:13,730
Seong Ho: I may be curious about someone who's obviously not my type.

988
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:15,830
Seong Ho: I may feel like talking with him.

989
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:18,380
Seong Ho: It felt like magic.

990
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:19,580
Seon Woo: Are you talking about me?

991
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:20,650
Seong Ho: Yes.

992
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,770
Seong Ho: I have preconceived ideas

993
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:26,550
Seong Ho: about people like you.

994
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:29,550
Seong Ho: Someone as upright as you

995
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:32,120
Seong Ho: usually tries hard to live up to your parents' expectations.

996
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:32,300
I seem to feel pity for this kind of person.

997
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:35,850
(Nod)
(Seong Ho: I seem to feel pity for this kind of person.)
I seem to feel pity for this kind of person.

998
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:36,430
I seem to feel pity for this kind of person.

999
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:37,870
Seon Woo: Really?

1000
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:42,300
Seon Woo: Instead of my parents' expectations, I care more about others' expectations.

1001
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:42,450
-Others' expectations.
-I just do what's expected of me.

1002
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:45,470
(Seon Woo: I just do what's expected of me.)
-Others' expectations.
-I just do what's expected of me.

1003
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:49,860
I say proper words and do proper things.

1004
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:52,290
I don't have strong opinions.

1005
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,040
Seon Woo: It's always about what others expect of me.

1006
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:03,130
Seong Ho: Our conversation was deeper than mine with others.

1007
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:07,550
Seong Ho: I'm glad to know him more.

1008
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:12,890
Seon Woo: Seong Ho has many sides.

1009
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:15,970
Seon Woo: He's stronger than I thought.

1010
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:19,130
Seon Woo: I'm glad to know him better

1011
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:21,730
Seon Woo: and form a connection with him.

1012
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:26,730
Seon Woo: You said you can eat everything except seafood.

1013
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:28,210
Seon Woo: Is there anything you want to eat now?

1014
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:30,040
-I want Greek yogurt.
-Yogurt?

1015
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:33,140
Seong Ho: Yes. I want to have Greek yogurt with lots of honey.

1016
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:34,370
Let's go buy it.

1017
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:35,870
I really want it.

1018
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:39,140
Seong Ho: If there's a store nearby,

1019
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:40,520
Seong Ho: we can buy some for tomorrow's breakfast.

1020
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,550
Seon Woo: Okay. It sounds good.

1021
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:43,780
Seon Woo: Let's go.

1022
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:45,080
Seong Ho: OK.

1023
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,120
Let's go.

1024
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:50,840

1025
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:51,270
Give it a try.

-It's really good.

1028

Seong Ho: I hope it's delicious. It should be.

1029
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:55,980
Give it a try.

1030
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:57,910
Seong Ho: Greek yogurt is supposed to taste like honey.

1031
00:44:57,910 --> 00:45:00,960
Seon Woo: We bought yogurt again.

1032
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:02,980

Seon Woo: We want strawberry, sweet potato, tomato, yellow cheese,

1038
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:13,560
Seon Woo: and stewed chestnuts.

1039
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,480
Seon Woo: Five in total.

1040
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,820

-Bye.
-Bye.

1044
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:24,910

Seon Woo: The spoons?

1046
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,130
Seong Ho: They're couple spoons, aren't they?

1047
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:29,210
(They're happy because of the unexpected gift.)

1048
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:31,140

1053
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:43,120
Seon Woo: Even when we were just walking along the street.

1054
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,990
Seon Woo: It was a fantastic date.

1055

Chung-ook: I'll drive.

Hyeong Joon: Our jackets are important.

1064

00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:37,250
Chung-ook: and have been wanting to go on a date with you.

1075

Chung-ook: Then I saw you passing by

1076
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:41,610
Chung-ook: wearing the same jacket as mine.

1077
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:43,490
Chung-ook: I thought it was a sign.

1078
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:44,300
Really?

1079
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:45,670
I decided to ask you out today.

1081
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:50,840
I think it's destiny.

Chung-ook: Wearing matching clothes like we're a real couple

1083
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:03,150
Chung-ook: made me forget Yung Hee for a moment.

1084
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:07,270

1085

1096
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:33,580
Really? In Cheongdam?

1097
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:37,960
Chung-ook: I ranked high

1098
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:41,100

Hyeong Joon: Your father?

1101
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:47,810
Chung-ook: He hated me doing music.

1102
00:47:47,810 --> 00:47:50,430
Chung-ook: But in the end, I got into ‎Berklee College of Music

1103
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:52,640
Chung-ook: and got a scholarship.

1104
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,870
Chung-ook: Even if I can't make much money,

1105
00:47:54,870 --> 00:48:00,860
Chung-ook: I want to live my life freely.

1106

It's raining actually a lot. How do you feel?

1133
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:47,560
Not bad, but…

1134
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:49,470
The weather is really bad.

1135
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:50,320
-Cloud. Rain.
-What?

1136
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:53,810
(Cloud. Rain.)
-Cloud. Rain.
-What?

1137
00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:59,100
Chung-ook: I'm at ease with Hyeong Joon.

1138
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:02,340
Chung-ook: That situation was hilarious.

1139
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:06,000
(Where are they going for the date?)

1140
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:07,160
It's the perfect time to eat.

1141

It's the perfect time to eat.

1142

1143
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,020
Hyeong Joon: Hot water.

1144
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,550
Chung-ook: It's OK to drink hot water now.

1145
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:21,410
Chung-ook: I sang too much in the car.

1146
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:28,630
Hyeong Joon: I wanted to ask you this just now.

1147
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:31,770
(Expecting)
(Hyeong Joon: Did you notice anything different about me?)

1149

00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:38,510
(Paying attention)

1151
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:39,410
Chung-ook: Give me a moment.

1152
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:40,650
Just one moment.

1153
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:42,930
Hyeong Joon: Something is different from yesterday.

1154
00:49:43,370 --> 00:49:44,890
-Hold on.
-If you look carefully…

1155
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:45,260
I know. I see.

1156
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:48,160
(Pretending to know)
I know. I see.

1157
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:48,670
(Pretending to know)

1158
00:49:49,410 --> 00:49:50,350
Chung-ook: That's the difference.

1159
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:51,190
What?

1160
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:51,290
(Chung-ook: That. You know what I mean.)
What?

1161
00:49:51,290 --> 00:49:52,530
-That.
-What?
(Chung-ook: That. You know what I mean.)

1162
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:52,880
-You know what I mean.
-What?

1163
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,160
(Hyeong Joon: What?)
-You know what I mean.

-Chung-ook: Eyebrows.
-Hyeong Joon: Right.

1168
00:49:58,220 --> 00:49:59,920
Right?

1169
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,840
Hyeong Joon: I filled in my brows.

1170
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:04,800
Hyeong Joon: The scratch there is gone.

1171
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:09,100
Hyeong Joon: Today's theme is copy and paste, so I filled in my brows.

1172
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:09,230
(From jacket to eyebrows, the two men look exactly the same.)
Hyeong Joon: Today's theme is copy and paste, so I filled in my brows.

1176
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:14,390
(From jacket to eyebrows, the two men look exactly the same.)

1177
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:14,500
This is amazing.
(From jacket to eyebrows, the two men look exactly the same.)

1178
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:15,450
This is amazing.

1179
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:20,190
What are you like in a relationship?

1180
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:21,620
In a relationship?

1181
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:24,210
Because now

1182
00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:28,700
Chung-ook: our lifestyles

1183
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:28,790
(Chung-ook: May be very different from most people's.)
Chung-ook: our lifestyles

1184
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:31,560
-may be very different from most people's.
-Right.
(Chung-ook: May be very different from most people's.)

1185
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:36,140
Hyeong Joon: Recently, I've realized that lifestyle is important in some situations.

1186
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:39,630
Hyeong Joon: I fretted over that for a long time.

1187
00:50:39,630 --> 00:50:43,820
Hyeong Joon: I want someone who goes along with my lifestyle

1188
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:45,550
Hyeong Joon: or understands me.

1189
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:48,410
Hyeong Joon: Or to speak of aspect of one's appearance...

1190
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:53,090
Hyeong Joon: So far, most of the people I dated were shorter than me.

1191
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:55,880
Hyeong Joon: They're all cute people.

1192
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:57,820
Hyeong Joon: What about you?

1193
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:00,910
Chung-ook: Normally,

1194
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:03,780
Chung-ook: I prefer someone

1195
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:07,360
Chung-ook: who I can share my daily life with.

1196
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:07,930
(Oh)
Chung-ook: who I can share my daily life with.

1197
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:08,710
(Oh)

1198
00:51:09,030 --> 00:51:11,720
Chung-ook: Like someone who loves playing games with me,

1199
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,040
Chung-ook: watching movies with me,

1200
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,980
Chung-ook: and eating takeouts with me.

1201
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:17,480
Chung-ook: I love those things.

1202
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,600
Chung-ook: He can be a bit naughty.

1203
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:19,790
(Pout)
Chung-ook: He can be a bit naughty.

1204
00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:21,790
(Pout)

1205
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:21,920
Chung-ook: It's better if he's bigger than me.
(Pout)

1206
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:26,010
Chung-ook: It's better if he's bigger than me.

1207
00:51:26,010 --> 00:51:26,110
That kind of guy seems nice to me.

1208
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:28,270
(Straighten)
Chung-ook: That kind of guy seems nice to me.)
That kind of guy seems nice to me.

1209
00:51:28,270 --> 00:51:28,810
(Straighten)
Chung-ook: That kind of guy seems nice to me.)

1210
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:32,410
Hyeong Joon: Who did you call yesterday?

1211
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:33,800
Hyeong Joon: Can I know?

1212
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:35,130
Hyeong Joon: I'm suddenly curious.

1213
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,260
Hyeong Joon: But you don't have to answer if you don't want to.

1214
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:38,560
(A little nervous)
Hyeong Joon: But you don't have to answer if you don't want to.

1215
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:41,530
(A little nervous)

1216
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:45,770
Chung-ook: I'll be frank. On the first day,

1217
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:47,480
I called Min Seong.

1218
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:54,000
Hyeong Joon: I tried my best to control my expression at that moment.

1219
00:51:54,350 --> 00:51:57,340
Hyeong Joon: I was thinking that Min Seong must have received a lot of calls.

1220
00:51:57,340 --> 00:52:02,400
I also called him yesterday.

1221
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:04,080
I was thinking about these things.

1222
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:08,970
Hyeong Joon: And you called someone different on the second day?

1223
00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:09,110
-Another guy?
-Yeah, I called another guy on the second day.

1224
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:11,140
(Chung-ook: Yeah, I called another guy on the second day.)
-Another guy?
-Yeah, I called another guy on the second day.

1225
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:12,050
(Chung-ook: Yeah, I called another guy on the second day.)

1226
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:14,330
Hyeong Joon: You're the kind of person

1227
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:16,220
Hyeong Joon: who says what you think.
-Yeah.

1228
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:16,700
(Chung-ook: If I don't do that, I think I'll regret coming to the show.)

1229
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:21,310
If I don't do that, I think I'll regret coming to the show.
(Chung-ook: If I don't do that, I think I'll regret coming to the show.)

1230
00:52:21,310 --> 00:52:21,970
(Chung-ook: If I don't do that, I think I'll regret coming to the show.)

1231
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:25,340
Hyeong Joon: It's good.

1232
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:26,530
But…

1233
00:52:26,530 --> 00:52:26,920
Our food.

1234
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:27,900
(Food is served when they're talking.)
Our food.

1235
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:29,680
(Food is served when they're talking.)

1236
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,970
-Let's start eating.
-Let's start eating.

1237
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:38,830
(Filling)

1238
00:52:44,570 --> 00:52:45,580
It's so delicious.

1239
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:48,640
(Yes!)

1240
00:52:50,190 --> 00:52:50,860
Chung-ook: It tastes right.

1241
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:52,390
-Hyeong Joon: It tastes right?
-Yeah.

1242
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,040
(Happy)

1243
00:52:58,010 --> 00:53:01,560
Chung-ook: Among all the couples, I think we're having the best food.

1244
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:04,180
Hyeong Joon: It's really delicious.

1245
00:53:04,570 --> 00:53:05,800
Chung-ook: I'll brag about it when I go back.

1246
00:53:09,310 --> 00:53:11,380
Chung-ook: To be honest,

1247
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:15,170
Chung-ook: since I came here,

1248
00:53:15,170 --> 00:53:17,610
Chung-ook: I haven't enjoyed one meal relaxedly.

1249
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:20,570
Hyeong Joon: Yes. That's true.

1250
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,950
Hyeong Joon: I'll pick fish bones for you.

1251
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,070
(Hyeong Joon is taking care of Chung-ook who can finally enjoy the food.)

1252
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:27,360
Here.
(Hyeong Joon is taking care of Chung-ook who can finally enjoy the food.)

1253
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:27,610
(Hyeong Joon is taking care of Chung-ook who can finally enjoy the food.)

1254
00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:28,920
Thank you.
(Hyeong Joon is taking care of Chung-ook who can finally enjoy the food.)

1255
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:33,180
Chung-ook: I like him taking care of me like that,

1256
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:37,350
Chung-ook: because for me, sharing food is a way to express love.

1257
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:43,430
Chung-ook: So when he shared food with me, I felt touched.

1258
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,980
Hyeong Joon: What makes you

1259
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:48,690
Hyeong Joon: feel attractive about someone?

1260
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:53,730
For me, I'm sensitive to scents.

1261
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:55,680
Fragrance.

1262
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,130
Hyeong Joon: Someone I didn't have feelings for

1263
00:53:58,130 --> 00:53:59,590
Hyeong Joon: passed by me one day.

1264
00:53:59,590 --> 00:54:00,710
Hyeong Joon: After he passed by,

1265
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:05,470
Hyeong Joon: I turned around because of the perfume he was wearing

1266
00:54:05,470 --> 00:54:07,750
Hyeong Joon: and looked at him again.

1267
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,620
Hyeong Joon: I had experiences like that.

1268
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:11,970
-Hyeong Joon: So I like people who wear perfume.
-Chung-ook: Perfume.

1269
00:54:11,970 --> 00:54:13,980
Hyeong Joon: Perfume and fragrance.

1270
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:15,670
Hyeong Joon: What do you like?

1271
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:20,330
Chung-ook: I think communication is very important.

1272
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:20,940
-I care more about appearance.
-So,

1273
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:22,380
(Chung-ook: So,)
-I care more about appearance.
-So,

1274
00:54:22,450 --> 00:54:22,490
(Chung-ook: I love compliments.)

1275
00:54:22,490 --> 00:54:24,150
I love compliments.
(Chung-ook: I love compliments.)

1276
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:25,950
Chung-ook: Or complimentary remarks.

1277
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:28,190
Chung-ook: Sudden compliments like "You're so cute."

1278
00:54:28,190 --> 00:54:29,570
Chung-ook: They make me feel warm.

1279
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:31,350
Me too.

1280
00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:34,490
Chung-ook: Or enjoy the food I make.

1281
00:54:34,490 --> 00:54:35,440
I enjoyed it yesterday.

I really enjoyed it.

1285
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:42,340
Hyeong Joon: He's interesting, more interesting than I thought.

1286
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:44,410
Hyeong Joon: Can I say we have much in common?

1287
00:54:44,410 --> 00:54:47,030
Hyeong Joon: We're on the same wavelength in many aspects.

1288
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:49,120
Hyeong Joon: Chung-ook sings well.

1289
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,490
Hyeong Joon: I was surprised by his voice.

1290
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:52,250
Hyeong Joon: His voice is great.

1291
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:54,400
His voice is beautiful.

1292
00:54:55,720 --> 00:55:00,280
Chung-ook: It's amazing that I know every song he said.

1293
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:04,690
Chung-ook: We sang songs that brought back memories.

1294
00:55:04,690 --> 00:55:08,630
Chung-ook: I even sang notes that are usually too high for me.

1295
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:12,550
Chung-ook: I can't say I didn't feel anything.

1296
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:16,330
Chung-ook: I felt like I was in love at that moment.

1297
00:55:16,330 --> 00:55:18,140
It was very romantic.

1298
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:20,030
Let's go.

1299
00:55:20,030 --> 00:55:21,120
(Yung Hee and Hyeong Jin are on the way somewhere.)
Let's go.

1300
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:21,620
(Yung Hee and Hyeong Jin are on the way somewhere.)

1301
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:25,460
It's the first time I drive with my date, so I'm nervous.
(Yung Hee and Hyeong Jin are on the way somewhere.)

1302
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:26,060
It's the first time I drive with my date, so I'm nervous.

1303
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:29,280
Hyeong Jin: We're not in a restaurant or places like that.

1304
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,870
Hyeong Jin: We're sitting in the car alone and chatting. It feels nice.

1305
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:33,460
Yung Hee: It feels special, right?

1306
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:38,770
Yung Hee: Is it nice because of where we are or who we're with?

1307
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,850
It's nice because you're with me.

1308
00:55:41,850 --> 00:55:42,110
(Gosh)
It's nice because you're with me.

1309
00:55:42,110 --> 00:55:43,330
(Gosh)

1310
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:44,460
Yung Hee: You made me shy.

1311
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:49,210
-Hyeong Jin: Including me, there are eight men in total.
-Yung Hee: Yes.

1312
00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:52,420
Hyeong Jin: Among those guys,

1313
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:54,820
Hyeong Jin: there are four guys I'm not interested in.

1314
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:56,470
Yung Hee: Oh, I see.

1315
00:55:56,470 --> 00:56:00,580
Hyeong Jin: Among the three guys I want to go on a date with,

1316
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:01,640
Hyeong Jin: you're one of them.

1317
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:03,340
-Yung Hee: Really?
-Hyeong Jin: Yes.

1318
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:09,380
Yung Hee: You may think I'm not responding actively now.

1319
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:11,150
Yung Hee: That's because I can't multitask.

1320
00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:14,210
-Hyeong Jin: I'm not a straight-laced person.
-Yung Hee: Of course not.

1321
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:16,450
Yung Hee: I felt it when we talked.

1322
00:56:16,450 --> 00:56:19,300
Hyeong Jin: I'm stubborn, but not straight-laced.

1323
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:19,320
Sorry. I'll do my best.

1324
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:22,030
(Joking)
(Yung Hee: Sorry. I'll do my best.)
Sorry. I'll do my best.

1325
00:56:22,430 --> 00:56:25,770
Hyeong Jin: Although you said you can't multitask,

1326
00:56:25,770 --> 00:56:28,690
Hyeong Jin: you're doing quite well. Is it because you're focused?

1327
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:29,900
Yung Hee: I focus on driving now

1328
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:32,380
Yung Hee: and on you then.

1329
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:33,620
So sweet.

1330
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:35,100
Yes.

1331
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,880
Sweet.

1332
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:38,660
Hyeong Jin: I was a little excited.

1333
00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:43,880
Hyeong Jin: He drove better than I thought.

1334
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:44,970
Hyeong Jin: I was surprised.

1335
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:47,490
Let's go.

1336
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:51,770
(They reached the first date place.)

1337
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:53,970
Yung Hee: Thanks for driving.

1338
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:56,540
Hyeong Jin: You're welcome.

1339
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:58,410
Hyeong Jin: Aren't you cold?

1340
00:56:58,410 --> 00:57:01,190
Yung Hee: No. I'm fine. I feel warm.

1341
00:57:01,370 --> 00:57:02,640
-Hello.
-Hello.

1342
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:03,400
So cute.

1343
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:04,550
(A workshop where they can make dream catchers and couple bracelets.)
So cute.

1344
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:04,850
(A workshop where they can make dream catchers and couple bracelets.)

1345
00:57:04,850 --> 00:57:06,630
-Yeah.
-So this is it.
(A workshop where they can make dream catchers and couple bracelets.)

1346
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:06,930
(A workshop where they can make dream catchers and couple bracelets.)

1347
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:08,110
Dream catcher.
(A workshop where they can make dream catchers and couple bracelets.)

1348
00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:09,730
(-Teacher: Would you like to try it?
-Yung Hee: Okay. I know.)

1349
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:11,080
Okay. I know.
(-Teacher: Would you like to try it?
-Yung Hee: Okay. I know.)

1350
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,960
Yung Hee: Are you good at making stuff?
(Yung Hee: Are you good at making stuff?)

1351
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:14,970
(Hyeong Jin: Of course. I'm good at it.)
Yung Hee: Are you good at making stuff?
(Yung Hee: Are you good at making stuff?)

1352
00:57:14,970 --> 00:57:16,910
-Of course. I'm good at it.
-Really?
(Hyeong Jin: Of course. I'm good at it.)

1353
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:17,330
(Yung Hee: I'm a little scared of needles like this, so it may take some time.)

1354
00:57:17,330 --> 00:57:20,140
I'm a little scared of needles like this,
(Yung Hee: I'm a little scared of needles like this, so it may take some time.)

1355
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:21,160
-so it may take some time.
-Really?
(Yung Hee: I'm a little scared of needles like this, so it may take some time.)

1356
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:22,360
It's scary.
(Yung Hee: I'm a little scared of needles like this, so it may take some time.)

1357
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:28,510
Hyeong Jin: So we'll exchange the dream catchers we made?

1358
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:29,420
Yung Hee: Yes.

1359
00:57:29,790 --> 00:57:31,270
Hyeong Jin: Then I have to make it pretty.

1360
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,410
Yung Hee: Yeah. We need to make them pretty.

1361
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:35,130
Hyeong Jin: Can I look forward to it?

1362
00:57:35,130 --> 00:57:36,330
Yung Hee: Of course.

1363
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:39,810
Yung Hee: Since your job

1364
00:57:39,810 --> 00:57:44,480
Yung Hee: is related to arts and crafts. You'll do a great job, right?

1365
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:47,650
Hyeong Jin: Of course. You can look forward to it.

1366
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:52,450
(Making a dream catcher for each other.)

1367
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:00,610
Yung Hee: What's wrong?

1368
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,900
(Flustered)

1369
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:06,840
Hyeong Jin: Well, I accidentally...

1370
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:12,350
Hyeong Jin: Madam, it got tangled.

1371
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,360
Yung Hee: You're kind of adorkable.

1372
00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:19,350
-Hyeong Jin: Me?
-Yung Hee: I thought you were good at it.

1373
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:20,900
Hyeong Jin: I am.

1374
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:23,010
Yung Hee: Really? Prove it with the result.

1375
00:58:23,010 --> 00:58:23,650
Wait.

1376
00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:24,290
Yung Hee: Has it got tangled again?

1377
00:58:24,290 --> 00:58:26,230
Hyeong Jin: No, no.

1378
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:28,970
(Embarrassed)

1379
00:58:29,030 --> 00:58:30,540
Hyeong Jin: I want to go home.

1380
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:33,700
Hyeong Jin: I wanted to look cool and skillful,

1381
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:35,730
Hyeong Jin: but it was hard and confusing.

1382
00:58:35,730 --> 00:58:38,640
Hyeong Jin: I felt embarrassed.

1383
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:41,310
Wait.

1384
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:45,150
Hyeong Jin: Am I supposed to thread it through this hole?

1385
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:46,270
Here. Here.

1386
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:48,010
Ignore the little holes on it.

1387
00:58:48,010 --> 00:58:49,280
Thread it through the large ones.

1388
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:49,440
-Here.
-This hole?

1389
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:50,960
(Yung Hee explains to Hyeong Jin patiently.)
-Here.
-This hole?

1390
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,200
No. Get it out from this hole.
(Yung Hee explains to Hyeong Jin patiently.)

1391
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,450
-Right. Then there's a triangle, right?
-Yes.

1392
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:56,690
-Then here.
-Okay.

1393
00:58:56,690 --> 00:58:58,590
Yung Hee: Keep doing that.

1394
00:58:59,550 --> 00:59:01,170
Hyeong Jin: You said you're not good at this.

1395
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:02,600
Hyeong Jin: But you're doing very well.

1396
00:59:03,610 --> 00:59:05,140
Hyeong Jin: Have you been here many times?

1397
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:06,740
What?

1398
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:08,410
Yung Hee: Should I tell you it's my second job?

1399
00:59:08,410 --> 00:59:08,970
(Joking)
Yung Hee: Should I tell you it's my second job?

1400
00:59:08,970 --> 00:59:10,100
(Joking)

1401
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:11,260
Yung Hee: I've been keeping it a secret.

1402
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:17,880
Yung Hee: I need to make it perfect so that you can have good dreams.

1403
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:24,160
Hyeong Jin: He's mature for his age.

1404
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:28,080
Hyeong Jin: Very sweet and attentive.

1405
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,500
Hyeong Jin: Come here.

1406
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:34,800
Hyeong Jin: I think you look good when your bangs fall down.

1407
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:36,080
(Yung Hee: It's down?)
-It's down?
-Yes.

1408
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:36,140
Hyeong Jin: It's hanging down naturally, so you look great.
(Yung Hee: It's down?)
-It's down?
-Yes.

1409
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:38,580
Hyeong Jin: It's hanging down naturally, so you look great.

1410
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:41,250
Yung Hee: Really? But I think I look weird

1411
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:43,210
Yung Hee: when my bangs are down.

1412
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:46,440
Yung Hee: So I try to keep them up.

1413
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,060
Yung Hee: I'm done.

1414
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:49,260
Hyeong Jin: So pretty.

1415
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:50,120
-Isn't it pretty?
-Yes.

1416
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:50,850
I'm done too.

1417
00:59:50,850 --> 00:59:51,750
(With difficulty, a beautiful dream catcher was made.)
I'm done too.

1418
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:52,450
(With difficulty, a beautiful dream catcher was made.)

1419
00:59:52,450 --> 00:59:54,610
-Isn't it pretty?
-It's very pretty.
(With difficulty, a beautiful dream catcher was made.)

1420
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:54,790
(-Hyeong Jin: Let's take a picture of them.
-Yung Hee: Okay.)

1421
00:59:54,790 --> 00:59:55,980
Let's take a picture of them.
(-Hyeong Jin: Let's take a picture of them.
-Yung Hee: Okay.)

1422
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:56,770
Okay.
(-Hyeong Jin: Let's take a picture of them.
-Yung Hee: Okay.)

1423
00:59:56,770 --> 00:59:57,330
(-Hyeong Jin: Let's take a picture of them.
-Yung Hee: Okay.)

1424
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:02,040
One, two, three.

1425
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:03,690
(Hyeong Jin: So cute.)

1426
01:00:03,690 --> 01:00:05,210
-They look so cute in the picture.
-Okay.
(Hyeong Jin: So cute.)

1427
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:05,780
(Hyeong Jin: So cute.)

1428
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:05,980
I think this place…

1429
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:07,470
(-Yung Hee: I think this place…
-Hyeong Jin: Is great?)
I think this place…

1430
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:08,480
-Is great?
-Yes.
(-Yung Hee: I think this place…
-Hyeong Jin: Is great?)

1431
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,700
Yung Hee: I'm very happy now.

1432
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:11,510
Hyeong Jin: Do you like making stuff like this?

1433
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:13,130
Yung Hee: I didn't,

1434
01:00:13,130 --> 01:00:15,860
Yung Hee: but after coming here and making this, I think it's interesting.

1435
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:17,960
I don't know if it's this activity that's interesting

1436
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:20,270
or this situation.

1437
01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:23,780
Yung Hee: Everything is complicated but interesting.

1438
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:26,090
It's interesting because you're doing it with me.

1439
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:27,730
Yung Hee: Of course.

1440
01:00:27,730 --> 01:00:30,550
Hyeong Jin: Then why didn't you just say it?

1441
01:00:30,550 --> 01:00:32,580
-Hyeong Jin: Before I did.
-Yung Hee: Before I'm shy.

1442
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:38,300
They look good.

1443
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:40,860
Teacher: We're going to make couple bracelets.

1444
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:43,070
Yung Hee: I see. Couple bracelets.

1445
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:46,580
Teacher: They're wish bracelets. When they break, your wishes come true.

1446
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:48,590
-You mean breaking them by force?
-This is that kind of bracelet?

1447
01:00:48,590 --> 01:00:49,500
Teacher: Yes, yes.

1448
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,860
Yung Hee: Wish bracelets.

1449
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:53,410
Yung Hee: This is really easy.

1450
01:00:53,410 --> 01:00:54,350
Hyeong Jin: Yes, really easy.

1451
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:56,560
This is my level.
(More relaxed)
(Hyeong Jin: This is my level.)

1452
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:57,210
Yung Hee: This?

1453
01:00:57,210 --> 01:00:59,420
Hyeong Jin: Yes. It's not too hard for me.

1454
01:00:59,610 --> 01:01:02,230
Yung Hee: Are you making a wish? What's your wish?

1455
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:03,740
Hyeong Jin: My wish?

1456
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:04,830
Hyeong Jin: We can't say our wishes out.

1457
01:01:04,830 --> 01:01:06,760
Yung Hee: Then just tell me if you're making a wish.

1458
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:07,050
(Hyeong Jin: Of course I am.)
Yung Hee: Then just tell me if you're making a wish.

1459
01:01:07,050 --> 01:01:09,160
-Of course I am.
-You are?
(Hyeong Jin: Of course I am.)

1460
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:15,020
Yung Hee: We need to make it carefully and wish sincerely.

1461
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:21,010
Hyeong Jin: Making something for each other

1462
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:23,640
Hyeong Jin: feels great. Don't you think so?

1463
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:25,100
-It feels great?
-Yes.

1464
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:28,020
Hyeong Jin: If we wear this bracelet,

1465
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:30,350
Hyeong Jin: we'll keep thinking about each other.

1466
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:34,370
Yung Hee: I hope Hyeong Jin can be loved by someone great.

1467
01:01:34,370 --> 01:01:36,310
Yung Hee: That's my wish.

1468
01:01:36,310 --> 01:01:38,820
Yung Hee: Maybe I'll be the great guy in this wish.

1469
01:01:40,150 --> 01:01:42,550
Hyeong Jin: I'm glad that we have something

1470
01:01:42,550 --> 01:01:45,750
Hyeong Jin: to remind us of the time we spent together.

1471
01:01:49,450 --> 01:01:51,240
Yung Hee: Can you give me your wrist?

1472
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:51,840
(Grab)
Yung Hee: Can you give me your wrist?

1473
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:52,880
(Grab)
(A customized bracelet for Hyeong Jin)

1474
01:01:52,990 --> 01:01:54,070
(A customized bracelet for Hyeong Jin)

1475
01:01:54,070 --> 01:01:55,650
Wait. Let me check again.
(A customized bracelet for Hyeong Jin)

1476
01:01:55,650 --> 01:01:56,250
(A customized bracelet for Hyeong Jin)

1477
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:57,160
Okay. I'm done measuring.
(A customized bracelet for Hyeong Jin)

1478
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:58,090
Okay. I'm done measuring.

1479
01:01:58,390 --> 01:02:00,800
-Hyeong Jin: Which wrist do you want to wear it around?
-Yung Hee: The left.

1480
01:02:01,540 --> 01:02:04,500
-Hyeong Jin: Your wrist is so thin.
-Yung Hee: Yeah, my wrist is very thin.

1481
01:02:05,290 --> 01:02:07,110
Hyeong Jin: You're handcuffed now.

1482
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:10,130
Yung Hee: Let me put it on for you too. Which wrist?

1483
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:12,040
-Yung Hee: Left?
-Hyeong Jin: Yes.

1484
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:14,150
Yung Hee: You're handcuffed too.

1485
01:02:14,150 --> 01:02:14,400
-I feel very…
-Then the bracelets need to look the same.

1486
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,050
(Hyeong Jin: Then the bracelets need to look the same.)
-I feel very…
-Then the bracelets need to look the same.

1487
01:02:16,050 --> 01:02:16,600
(Hyeong Jin: Then the bracelets need to look the same.)

1488
01:02:17,050 --> 01:02:18,150
Yung Hee: It feels like we're putting on a ring for each other.

1489
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:21,190
Although they look different…

1490
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:22,040
(Can their wishes come true?)

1491
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:23,280
-This way?
-Yes.
(Can their wishes come true?)

1492
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,610
(Can their wishes come true?)

1493
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:26,040
Okay.
(Can their wishes come true?)

1494
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:28,360
(Can their wishes come true?)

1495
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:30,300
(Leaving the workshop, they came to a restaurant.)

1496
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:31,580
It's cold.
(Leaving the workshop, they came to a restaurant.)

1497
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:32,220
(Leaving the workshop, they came to a restaurant.)

1498
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:34,010
Let's go in.
(Leaving the workshop, they came to a restaurant.)

1499
01:02:34,010 --> 01:02:34,940
(Leaving the workshop, they came to a restaurant.)

1500
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:37,840
-Yung Hee: Have a seat. The atmosphere here is great.
-Hyeong Jin: Yes.

1501
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:43,230
Hyeong Jin: It feels like a real date.

1502
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:45,350
Yung Hee: It's like a real date and we're like a real couple.

1503
01:02:49,670 --> 01:02:50,810
Hyeong Jin: Come here.

1504
01:02:51,890 --> 01:02:54,630
(Hyeong Jin helps Yung Hee fix his tousled hair.)

1505
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,580
Hyeong Jin: It keeps getting up.

1506
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:00,690
Hyeong Jin: It should lie down like this.

1507
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:06,920
-Yung Hee: Should I use more wax?
-Hyeong Jin: No.

1508
01:03:08,590 --> 01:03:11,520
Yung Hee: I'm bad at it. Can you do my hair tomorrow?

1509
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:14,860
Hyeong Jin: Are you going on a date with me tomorrow?

1510
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:17,290
Yung Hee: Tomorrow? Can we date again tomorrow?

1511
01:03:17,290 --> 01:03:17,310
(Hyeong Jin: Should I do your hair too when you're going to date someone else?)
Yung Hee: Tomorrow? Can we date again tomorrow?

1512
01:03:17,310 --> 01:03:20,120
Should I do your hair too when you're going to date someone else?
(Hyeong Jin: Should I do your hair too when you're going to date someone else?)

1513
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:22,560
Yung Hee: You have a point.

1514
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:23,780
Yeah.

1515
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:28,480
Yung Hee: What will we do tomorrow?

1516
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:31,920
I just want to enjoy this moment.

1517
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:35,220
Yung Hee: I'll put tomorrow aside for now.

1518
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:40,240
-Yung Hee: I have a question.
-Hyeong Jin: What is it?

1519
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:43,850
Yung Hee: You received my Arrow Card today.

1520
01:03:43,850 --> 01:03:48,980
Yung Hee: How did you feel when you got the card?

1521
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:50,440
Hyeong Jin: Are you curious?

1522
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:53,840
(Nod)

1523
01:03:56,520 --> 01:04:01,100
Hyeong Jin: First, we didn't talk much before today.

1524
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:06,960
Hyeong Jin: I'm grateful that you're curious about me.

1525
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:10,720
Hyeong Jin: Just like I said on our way here,

1526
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:15,990
Hyeong Jin: you're one of the people I want to go on a date with.

1527
01:04:15,990 --> 01:04:18,600
Yung Hee: Then you must be happy.
Hyeong Jin: Yes, I'm happy.

1528
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:22,050
Hyeong Jin: But I want to explain something.

1529
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:23,730
Hyeong Jin: I don't know how you felt about it.

1530
01:04:23,730 --> 01:04:27,000
Hyeong Jin: I didn't look happy at that moment.

1531
01:04:27,170 --> 01:04:27,220
(Hyeong Jin: Because...)

1532
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:28,150
-Because…
-Ah, you mean when I gave you the card.
(Hyeong Jin: Because...)

1533
01:04:28,150 --> 01:04:29,950
-Because…
-Ah, you mean when I gave you the card.

1534
01:04:29,950 --> 01:04:32,440
Hyeong Jin: Because I was sitting with Chung-ook.

1535
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:36,710
Hyeong Jin: I didn't show my happiness

1536
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:39,420
Hyeong Jin: when I received the card.

1537
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:39,450
(Hyeong Jin: But if I had known Chung-ook got to choose first…)
Hyeong Jin: when I received the card.

1538
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:43,130
-But if I had known Chung-ook got to choose first…
-He got to choose first.
(Hyeong Jin: But if I had known Chung-ook got to choose first…)

1539
01:04:43,130 --> 01:04:43,940
If I had known Chung-ook got to choose first,
(Hyeong Jin: But if I had known Chung-ook got to choose first…)

1540
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:44,510
If I had known Chung-ook got to choose first,

1541
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:46,120
Hyeong Jin: I would've felt free

1542
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:49,560
Hyeong Jin: to show my feelings at that moment.

1543
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:53,320
Hyeong Jin: It seems that I'm always concerned about others' opinions.

1544
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:58,390
Hyeong Jin: So if the three are in the same space,

1545
01:04:58,390 --> 01:04:59,430
Hyeong Jin: I'll leave.

1546
01:04:59,430 --> 01:05:01,210
-Our food.
-Thank you.

1547
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:05,690
-Yung Hee: It looks delicious.
-Hyeong Jin: That's a big portion.

1548
01:05:05,690 --> 01:05:08,210
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1549
01:05:08,210 --> 01:05:11,020
-Mix it with cheese before eating.
-Okay. Thank you.

1550
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:16,320
-Hyeong Jin: Let's enjoy the food.
-Yung Hee: Let's enjoy the food.

1551
01:05:23,270 --> 01:05:25,200
-Hyeong Jin: Is it good?
-Yung Hee: Yeah. It's delicious.

1552
01:05:25,470 --> 01:05:25,480
(Hyeong Jin: It's good? That's a relief.)

1553
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:26,090
-It's good?
-Yes.
(Hyeong Jin: It's good? That's a relief.)

1554
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:26,950
That's a relief.
(Hyeong Jin: It's good? That's a relief.)

1555
01:05:26,950 --> 01:05:27,400
That's a relief.

1556
01:05:31,830 --> 01:05:31,840
(Hyeong Jin: It's really great. It's my favorite flavor.)

1557
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:33,220
-It's really delicious.
-Is it good?
(Hyeong Jin: It's really great. It's my favorite flavor.)

1558
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:34,950
-It's my favorite flavor.
-Really?
(Hyeong Jin: It's really great. It's my favorite flavor.)

1559
01:05:35,330 --> 01:05:39,170
Hyeong Jin: Let me cut it for you. I'm good at cutting meat.

1560
01:05:39,170 --> 01:05:42,270
-Yung Hee: You're good at cutting meat?
-Hyeong Jin: Yeah. It's my way to show my charm.

1561
01:05:42,270 --> 01:05:42,910
(Smiling)
-Yung Hee: You're good at cutting meat?
-Hyeong Jin: Yeah. It's my way to show my charm.

1562
01:05:42,910 --> 01:05:43,400
(Smiling)

1563
01:05:43,810 --> 01:05:47,420
-Yung Hee: A plus.
-Hyeong Jin: Are you sure it's a plus?

1564
01:05:48,190 --> 01:05:49,750
-Hyeong Jin: Eat comfortably.
-Yung Hee: Okay.

1565
01:05:52,630 --> 01:05:54,960
Yung Hee: When our jobs and ages were revealed yesterday,

1566
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:57,070
Yung Hee: what did you think after knowing my job and age?

1567
01:05:57,070 --> 01:06:02,800
Yung Hee: To be honest, everyone except me has a stable job.

1568
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:02,830
(Yung Hee: I'm a college student.)
Yung Hee: To be honest, everyone except me has a stable job.

1569
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:05,430
-I'm a college student.
-But…
(Yung Hee: I'm a college student.)

1570
01:06:05,430 --> 01:06:07,890
-Hyeong Jin: What's wrong with being a college student?
-Yung Hee: What?

1571
01:06:07,890 --> 01:06:10,240
Hyeong Jin: What's wrong with being a college student?

1572
01:06:11,070 --> 01:06:14,630
Yung Hee: It means I earn less than other guys.

1573
01:06:14,630 --> 01:06:18,490
Yung Hee: It's an ability that many people care about.

1574
01:06:18,490 --> 01:06:23,780
Hyeong Jin: I don't earn much either.

1575
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:26,710
Hyeong Jin: The one who earns more pays the bills. That's all.

1576
01:06:26,710 --> 01:06:31,360
Hyeong Jin: I don't consider that a shortcoming.

1577
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:34,120
Yung Hee: I'm fine with giving.

1578
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:35,850
Yung Hee: But strangely, I don't like to take from others.

1579
01:06:35,850 --> 01:06:37,520
Yung Hee: Perhaps it's because I'm too proud.

1580
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:39,820
Hyeong Jin: I share your feelings on that.

1581
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:42,050
Hyeong Jin: That…

1582
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:46,400
Hyeong Jin: Like you said, it's about pride.

1583
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:50,880
Yung Hee: I don't want to show my inept side.

1584
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:52,810
Hyeong Jin: Why is that inept?

1585
01:06:52,810 --> 01:06:56,880
Hyeong Jin: Don't you think too much pride makes you look more inept?

1586
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:00,040
Hyeong Jin: It's not like you're not doing anything

1587
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:01,510
Hyeong Jin: and just fiddling around.

1588
01:07:01,510 --> 01:07:05,790
Hyeong Jin: You're in college. You're doing something.

1589
01:07:05,790 --> 01:07:08,720
Hyeong Jin: I don't care much about that.

1590
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:13,620
Hyeong Jin: Don't think about that. Just focus on the present.

1591
01:07:13,620 --> 01:07:15,490
-Yung Hee: The present.
-Hyeong Jin: Now.

1592
01:07:18,790 --> 01:07:19,030
You consoled me.

1593
01:07:19,030 --> 01:07:21,070
("You consoled me.")
You consoled me.

1594
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:22,500
-What?
-You consoled me.
("You consoled me.")

1595
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:23,000
-What?
-You consoled me.

1596
01:07:23,910 --> 01:07:25,670
Yung Hee: I don't know how I feel.

1597
01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:27,520
Yung Hee: I was comforted.

1598
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:30,940
Yung Hee: Hyeong Jin comforted me.

1599
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:35,340
Yung Hee: He made me feel better.

1600
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:36,660
Yung Hee: I like Hyeong Jin more now.

1601
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:40,400
Yung Hee: Should I choose Seon Woo or Hyeong Jin?

1602
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:45,210
Yung Hee: To be honest, my mind was blank the whole day.

1603
01:07:45,970 --> 01:07:48,820
Hyeong Jin: Maybe because our personalities are more similar than I expected,

1604
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:50,580
Hyeong Jin: we had a lot to talk about.

1605
01:07:50,580 --> 01:07:54,890
Hyeong Jin: During the whole conversation, I felt very comfortable.

1606
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:59,380
(On the other side, at the Men's House)

1607
01:08:00,890 --> 01:08:06,490
(Min Seong and Jun Seong are still sleeping.)

1608
01:08:13,070 --> 01:08:15,430
(Up)

1609
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:20,439
(Jun Seong wakes up slowly.)

1610
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:30,140
(The Men's House is very quiet.)

1611
01:08:43,109 --> 01:08:44,609
Jun Seong: It was so quiet.

1612
01:08:47,819 --> 01:08:52,399
Jun Seong: I was the only one awake in the quiet house. It was…

1613
01:08:54,850 --> 01:08:59,050
Jun Seong: My feeling was subtle.

1614
01:09:03,410 --> 01:09:08,760
(At this moment, loneliness somehow becomes stronger.)

1615
01:09:17,450 --> 01:09:21,930
(The unusually quiet room is very strange.)

1616
01:09:45,350 --> 01:09:47,460
(Smile)

1617
01:09:53,859 --> 01:09:54,010
(Jun Seong: What the heck?)

1618
01:09:54,010 --> 01:09:56,210
Jun Seong: What the heck?
(Jun Seong: What the heck?)

1619
01:09:56,210 --> 01:09:56,890
(Jun Seong: What the heck?)

1620
01:10:02,310 --> 01:10:02,420
Real time.

1621
01:10:02,420 --> 01:10:03,420
(The real Jenga time begins.)
Real time.

1622
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:04,830
Question.
(The real Jenga time begins.)

1623
01:10:04,830 --> 01:10:06,590
Are sharp questions okay?

1624
01:10:06,590 --> 01:10:08,000
Sharp questions are okay.

1625
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,310
I'm interested in three people.

1626
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:12,670
Is there anyone you want to have physical contact with now?

1627
01:10:12,670 --> 01:10:15,090
I'm going to call him today.

1628
01:10:15,090 --> 01:10:17,460
Yes. I'm going to call him today.

1629
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:19,570
Seon Woo: I want to talk to them in person.

1630
01:10:19,570 --> 01:10:21,290
Jun Seong: Why are you saying this now?

1631
01:10:21,290 --> 01:10:22,780
Hyeong Jin: I almost cursed.

1632
01:10:22,780 --> 01:10:24,060
Wow. God.

1633
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:25,640
Hyeong Jin: They're very straightforward.

1634
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:27,100
Hyeong Jin: I'm a little scared.

1635
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:31,070
(And, someone received an unexpected call.)

1636
01:10:33,670 --> 01:10:34,960
Hello.

1637
01:10:37,430 --> 01:10:40,290
What? Why?

1638
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:46,750
When we talked, he wasn't talking about me.
