Mr. Yan.

54
00:06:26,287 --> 00:06:27,128
Fixed it?

55
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:46,008
Yes.

56
00:07:45,847 --> 00:07:46,727
It's been so long.

57
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,287
Lin Xirou should've already known

58
00:07:49,287 --> 00:07:50,688
Yan Tuo was rescued.

59
00:07:51,927 --> 00:07:53,568
But there is no news so far.

60
00:07:54,287 --> 00:07:55,648
That makes me feel uneasy.

61
00:07:58,167 --> 00:07:59,128
I'll be careful.

62
00:08:03,807 --> 00:08:06,568
Should I bring Lin Ling and Liu Changxi

63
00:08:06,847 --> 00:08:08,328
to the South Mountain base first?

64
00:08:09,287 --> 00:08:11,208
That can ease your pressure.

65
00:08:14,807 --> 00:08:15,968
That place doesn't suit them.

66
00:08:17,008 --> 00:08:18,727
I can handle it for now.

67
00:08:20,807 --> 00:08:22,367
Lin Xirou has no more cards to play.

68
00:08:23,487 --> 00:08:25,047
I have no idea what she might do.

69
00:08:28,128 --> 00:08:28,807
Got it.

70
00:08:32,088 --> 00:08:34,328
Update me anytime.

71
00:08:57,607 --> 00:08:59,367
We might take action recently.

72
00:09:01,328 --> 00:09:02,527
I suggested to Xing Shen

73
00:09:03,048 --> 00:09:04,288
that you could join us.

74
00:09:06,288 --> 00:09:07,448
Are you pitying me?

75
00:09:09,288 --> 00:09:10,208
I'm inviting you.

76
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,367
But I still feel

77
00:09:14,088 --> 00:09:15,487
I can't fully integrate with you.

78
00:09:20,808 --> 00:09:23,168
When badgers dig burrows,

79
00:09:23,727 --> 00:09:25,968
they drive animals out from underground,

80
00:09:26,168 --> 00:09:27,487
so coyotes can catch them.

81
00:09:28,247 --> 00:09:30,727
When coyotes chase prey,

82
00:09:30,928 --> 00:09:32,688
they also drive them into burrows,

83
00:09:32,887 --> 00:09:34,127
so badgers can catch them.

84
00:09:34,367 --> 00:09:35,767
They're different species,

85
00:09:36,168 --> 00:09:37,088
but working together

86
00:09:37,408 --> 00:09:38,647
is still a better choice.

87
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,208
Ever since meeting Jiang,

88
00:09:51,367 --> 00:09:53,408
my life has revolved around him.

89
00:09:55,168 --> 00:09:56,007
I used to think

90
00:09:56,968 --> 00:09:57,767
that without him,

91
00:09:57,887 --> 00:09:59,127
my life would collapse.

92
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:01,928
But now,

93
00:10:03,367 --> 00:10:05,607
even if I'm a badger hiding underground,

94
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,328
I can still meet coyote friends.

95
00:10:15,887 --> 00:10:16,647
Continue.

96
00:11:13,487 --> 00:11:15,367
Ms. Lu, where are the eggs?

97
00:11:15,647 --> 00:11:16,288
Over here.

98
00:11:24,847 --> 00:11:25,527
Eggs.

99
00:11:25,847 --> 00:11:26,487
Thanks.

100
00:11:30,127 --> 00:11:31,168
No more dumplings.

101
00:11:31,168 --> 00:11:32,767
The fridge can't hold anymore.

102
00:11:32,808 --> 00:11:33,568
This is different.

103
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:35,448
I'm making wontons this time.

104
00:11:35,448 --> 00:11:36,808
Don't those also go in the fridge?

105
00:11:38,247 --> 00:11:39,007
Tuo.

106
00:11:39,168 --> 00:11:40,007
Is this enough?

107
00:11:40,007 --> 00:11:41,288
Yes. Chop them, please.

108
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,007
Okay.

109
00:11:42,887 --> 00:11:44,007
What should I cut them into?

110
00:11:44,127 --> 00:11:45,847
Into small ones. Watch your fingers.

111
00:11:45,928 --> 00:11:46,487
Got it.

112
00:11:52,168 --> 00:11:53,448
You better think it through.

113
00:11:55,408 --> 00:11:56,448
What?

114
00:11:57,688 --> 00:11:58,767
Now,

115
00:11:58,767 --> 00:12:00,808
their whole family is here.

116
00:12:03,168 --> 00:12:05,288
You always complained
that the house was too quiet.

117
00:12:05,568 --> 00:12:07,208
Now, you're finding it annoying?

118
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:09,607
Your pleasure matters most.

119
00:12:16,408 --> 00:12:17,007
Morning.

120
00:12:20,288 --> 00:12:20,928
Morning.

121
00:12:27,487 --> 00:12:29,968
Mr. Yan is such a good cook.

122
00:12:30,887 --> 00:12:31,767
I can say

123
00:12:31,847 --> 00:12:33,847
Tuo is an instant noodle expert.

124
00:12:34,992 --> 00:12:36,688
Grew up pretty much on our own.

125
00:12:36,688 --> 00:12:37,887
So I made instant noodles

126
00:12:37,887 --> 00:12:39,087
for Lin Ling in various ways.

127
00:12:39,087 --> 00:12:40,247
Soaked, boiled, or dry mixed.

128
00:12:50,328 --> 00:12:51,127
Come on, Ling.

129
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:52,048
Try wontons.

130
00:12:56,727 --> 00:12:58,328
The other day, Mr. Lu asked me

131
00:12:58,416 --> 00:12:59,664
if I wanted to participate

132
00:12:59,664 --> 00:13:00,624
in a showcase exhibition

133
00:13:00,624 --> 00:13:01,607
of Lawrence Art Gallery.

134
00:13:02,328 --> 00:13:04,487
What's a showcase exhibition?

135
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:06,208
Ever had a fruit platter?

136
00:13:07,568 --> 00:13:08,607
A braised meat platter.

137
00:13:09,328 --> 00:13:11,527
It's like putting
similar things together.

138
00:13:11,527 --> 00:13:12,088
Mr. Changxi.

139
00:13:12,487 --> 00:13:13,288
It should be...

140
00:13:13,288 --> 00:13:14,288
a joint exhibition.

141
00:13:14,808 --> 00:13:16,247
That means gathering

142
00:13:16,247 --> 00:13:17,408
several talented sculptors

143
00:13:17,408 --> 00:13:18,048
in one place

144
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:19,088
for a major exhibition.

145
00:13:19,168 --> 00:13:20,048
Exactly.

146
00:13:21,007 --> 00:13:22,048
If I were exceptional,

147
00:13:22,048 --> 00:13:23,088
I'd get a solo exhibition.

148
00:13:23,247 --> 00:13:24,928
It also means I need to work harder.

149
00:13:25,328 --> 00:13:26,007
Not at all.

150
00:13:26,127 --> 00:13:27,127
It's fine.

151
00:13:27,527 --> 00:13:30,367
You need energy to work harder, right?

152
00:13:31,088 --> 00:13:32,088
Eat up.

153
00:13:32,288 --> 00:13:33,127
Let's eat.

154
00:13:34,192 --> 00:13:37,424
(Joy Comes Upon)

155
00:13:49,168 --> 00:13:50,480
(Mr. Lu)

156
00:13:54,568 --> 00:13:55,127
Hello.

157
00:13:55,688 --> 00:13:57,487
Have you prepared
all the required documents?

158
00:13:59,647 --> 00:14:01,127
I was just about to tell you.

159
00:14:01,448 --> 00:14:02,607
Some of my pieces

160
00:14:02,607 --> 00:14:03,647
don't suit the exhibition.

161
00:14:04,247 --> 00:14:05,208
Stop it.

162
00:14:05,448 --> 00:14:06,408
It's a rare chance.

163
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,168
It's just a joint exhibition,

164
00:14:08,328 --> 00:14:10,367
but every participating artist

165
00:14:10,408 --> 00:14:12,487
is a rising star gaining momentum.

166
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,487
If you can't decide,

167
00:14:14,568 --> 00:14:16,168
I'll just send over a Hermit Duck piece.

168
00:14:20,808 --> 00:14:21,887
Give me some time.

169
00:14:21,887 --> 00:14:23,568
Staying low-key

170
00:14:23,968 --> 00:14:25,127
and following your whims

171
00:14:25,487 --> 00:14:26,127
will leave us

172
00:14:26,127 --> 00:14:28,007
struggling to make ends meet.

173
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,088
After all, our talent has its limits.

174
00:14:30,568 --> 00:14:31,847
We need to face reality.

175
00:14:32,568 --> 00:14:33,767
Listen to me,

176
00:14:33,767 --> 00:14:34,647
you should...

177
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:58,247
You've just recovered,

178
00:14:58,568 --> 00:15:00,048
so focus on internal wellness.

179
00:15:00,568 --> 00:15:02,527
Once your blood circulates smoothly,

180
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:07,168
your internal organs like heart,
liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys

181
00:15:07,408 --> 00:15:10,487
can function properly.

182
00:15:11,288 --> 00:15:15,568
Next, drawing the bow.

183
00:15:18,068 --> 00:15:18,568
Mr. Changxi.

184
00:15:18,568 --> 00:15:20,088
I can't deal with this patience thing.

185
00:15:20,168 --> 00:15:22,048
These exercises are good
for you and Ms. Lu.

186
00:15:22,847 --> 00:15:24,887
Ling, how about I take you
for strength training?

187
00:15:25,328 --> 00:15:25,968
Me?

188
00:15:27,048 --> 00:15:28,048
All this stiff muscle

189
00:15:28,048 --> 00:15:29,808
is just for show.

190
00:15:30,288 --> 00:15:32,448
Nourishing yourself from the inside out

191
00:15:32,487 --> 00:15:34,928
is what truly benefits you.

192
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:37,408
These are treasures
passed down by our ancestors.

193
00:15:37,408 --> 00:15:38,328
You understand nothing.

194
00:15:38,887 --> 00:15:39,928
Ling, don't listen to him.

195
00:15:39,928 --> 00:15:40,767
Follow my pace.

196
00:15:41,767 --> 00:15:42,408
Straighten up.

197
00:15:57,168 --> 00:15:58,007
What's the matter?

198
00:16:00,928 --> 00:16:01,928
Do you think

199
00:16:02,247 --> 00:16:03,928
I have any real talent

200
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:06,127
on sculpting?

201
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:08,328
What's wrong?

202
00:16:09,288 --> 00:16:10,088
Just asking.

203
00:16:12,288 --> 00:16:13,328
Is it because

204
00:16:13,527 --> 00:16:15,168
the showcase exhibition?

205
00:16:20,887 --> 00:16:22,887
If you don't want to go, then don't.

206
00:16:23,127 --> 00:16:24,408
You can't excel at everything.

207
00:16:24,847 --> 00:16:25,647
What do you mean?

208
00:16:26,288 --> 00:16:27,007
Look,

209
00:16:28,527 --> 00:16:31,127
you're beautiful and highly skilled,

210
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:33,048
both smart and compassionate.

211
00:16:33,328 --> 00:16:34,928
Most importantly, you are discerning

212
00:16:35,007 --> 00:16:36,007
in judging people.

213
00:16:37,408 --> 00:16:38,048
Come on.

214
00:16:38,048 --> 00:16:39,288
Don't try to flatter me.

215
00:16:39,887 --> 00:16:41,127
I know my limits.

216
00:16:45,328 --> 00:16:46,767
Hard work pays off.

217
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:49,288
Just work hard,

218
00:16:49,288 --> 00:16:50,448
and you'll obtain something.

219
00:16:50,887 --> 00:16:51,607
Look at me.

220
00:16:52,328 --> 00:16:53,727
I've been exercising daily lately.

221
00:16:53,727 --> 00:16:55,208
I'm almost fully recovered now.

222
00:16:56,007 --> 00:16:56,847
I even feel

223
00:16:56,847 --> 00:16:58,727
bodyweight workouts
aren't cutting it anymore.

224
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,088
Any gyms around here?

225
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:01,408
Take it easy.

226
00:17:01,568 --> 00:17:03,048
You just got recovered.

227
00:17:03,168 --> 00:17:04,287
Don't overestimate yourself.

228
00:17:05,928 --> 00:17:07,567
And back when we were kids,

229
00:17:07,688 --> 00:17:09,208
there were no gyms at all.

230
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:11,247
We just used whatever was around.

231
00:17:12,047 --> 00:17:15,448
Like buckets, logs,

232
00:17:15,487 --> 00:17:17,608
stones, tires...

233
00:17:18,888 --> 00:17:19,648
Even

234
00:17:20,767 --> 00:17:21,487
training partners.

235
00:17:22,648 --> 00:17:23,368
Training partners?

236
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:35,727
Three.

237
00:17:48,928 --> 00:17:50,567
When you do more than ten,

238
00:17:50,567 --> 00:17:51,888
I'll get you a gym membership.

239
00:17:51,928 --> 00:17:52,527
Wait.

240
00:17:52,807 --> 00:17:54,727
I can't keep my balance like this.

241
00:17:55,047 --> 00:17:56,527
Why copy the Ninja Duck?

242
00:17:56,767 --> 00:17:57,608
That doesn't count.

243
00:18:00,928 --> 00:18:01,567
Fine.

244
00:18:01,968 --> 00:18:02,688
It doesn't count.

245
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:07,368
Can you keep your balance now?

246
00:18:12,487 --> 00:18:13,287
Four.

247
00:18:25,487 --> 00:18:26,087
Wait.

248
00:18:26,968 --> 00:18:29,327
You said you can't keep your balance.

249
00:18:29,327 --> 00:18:29,928
Wait.

250
00:18:30,047 --> 00:18:31,287
This one doesn't count either.

251
00:18:31,287 --> 00:18:32,368
I'm out of energy.

252
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,168
So what would make it count?

253
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:49,007
I...

254
00:18:51,247 --> 00:18:51,968
I want...

255
00:19:21,936 --> 00:19:23,408
(1 Message)

256
00:19:44,807 --> 00:19:45,928
The Earth Fiend replied.

257
00:19:58,168 --> 00:19:59,567
I tried to live

258
00:19:59,567 --> 00:20:02,567
among humans under rules and law,

259
00:20:02,928 --> 00:20:06,408
without offending
the South Mountain Hunters.

260
00:20:07,287 --> 00:20:10,848
But it was just my wild imagination
and wishful thinking.

261
00:20:11,527 --> 00:20:12,928
Even unwilling to do it,

262
00:20:13,567 --> 00:20:15,608
I must still do it.

263
00:20:17,287 --> 00:20:19,168
You can claim it a declaration of war,

264
00:20:19,608 --> 00:20:21,448
or just an invitation.

265
00:20:22,527 --> 00:20:23,807
Ten days from now,

266
00:20:23,888 --> 00:20:26,888
bring everyone you and I captured.

267
00:20:27,688 --> 00:20:29,848
Let's settle everything face-to-face.

268
00:20:30,368 --> 00:20:32,287
I've picked the location.

269
00:20:33,727 --> 00:20:36,448
The place where we first met,

270
00:20:37,727 --> 00:20:39,168
Twilight Chasm

271
00:20:39,767 --> 00:20:41,007
under the Golden Gate.

272
00:20:47,608 --> 00:20:49,688
Letting go of what I have

273
00:20:49,888 --> 00:20:51,688
does pain me deeply.

274
00:20:52,767 --> 00:20:54,527
But then again,

275
00:20:55,408 --> 00:20:56,807
what I've gained

276
00:20:57,767 --> 00:20:59,287
is more than enough.

277
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,208
Besides,

278
00:21:02,168 --> 00:21:03,608
I have time.

279
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:06,368
I have plenty of time.

280
00:21:07,688 --> 00:21:08,888
I can afford to wait

281
00:21:09,567 --> 00:21:11,007
and to waste.

282
00:21:13,007 --> 00:21:15,608
I remember every one of you,

283
00:21:16,087 --> 00:21:20,247
your families and descendants.

284
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:24,888
I'll keep caring for them in your stead.

285
00:21:25,968 --> 00:21:28,168
So go all out

286
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:31,247
and fulfill
your South Mountain Hunters duties.

287
00:21:32,247 --> 00:21:33,128
Tuo.

288
00:21:34,368 --> 00:21:35,928
I bet you hear this too.

289
00:21:37,247 --> 00:21:38,688
I've told you many

290
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,327
sincere words.

291
00:21:40,807 --> 00:21:42,928
I bet you heard them all.

292
00:21:45,287 --> 00:21:47,807
Your father would be thrilled

293
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,888
if he knew his mine

294
00:21:50,487 --> 00:21:52,208
became Roadsound Group.

295
00:21:53,648 --> 00:21:55,807
Your mother attempted to kill me.

296
00:21:56,888 --> 00:21:58,648
I even gave her a chance,

297
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,888
but she just missed it.

298
00:22:01,767 --> 00:22:04,767
You shouldn't have survived.

299
00:22:05,327 --> 00:22:06,807
I raised you

300
00:22:06,807 --> 00:22:08,247
to a grown man.

301
00:22:09,007 --> 00:22:11,408
Your whole family owes me gratitude.

302
00:22:12,567 --> 00:22:15,247
The little snake I nurtured
has grown fangs

303
00:22:15,807 --> 00:22:17,168
and tries to slip away.

304
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:20,487
I know I can't keep you.

305
00:22:21,848 --> 00:22:23,448
I know

306
00:22:24,047 --> 00:22:25,208
you'd leave me.

307
00:22:26,287 --> 00:22:28,888
But you bit me
with your poisonous fangs,

308
00:22:30,128 --> 00:22:34,007
which marks you
as disloyal and ungrateful.

309
00:22:36,168 --> 00:22:37,968
Since you're this heartless,

310
00:22:38,767 --> 00:22:42,368
you clearly don't care
about Yan Xin anymore.

311
00:22:43,527 --> 00:22:46,648
This time, I'll bring her
to Twilight Chasm.

312
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:48,608
Along with Jiang Baichuan

313
00:22:48,608 --> 00:22:51,287
and those South Mountain Hunters.

314
00:22:51,848 --> 00:22:55,168
Let my long-imprisoned kindred

315
00:22:55,888 --> 00:22:57,487
have a feast.

316
00:22:59,727 --> 00:23:01,648
I wish to see you

317
00:23:01,807 --> 00:23:04,487
and my old friends
from South Mountain again.

318
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:06,208
If fate doesn't grant me,

319
00:23:07,368 --> 00:23:09,208
consider this our farewell.

320
00:23:35,368 --> 00:23:36,208
For so long now,

321
00:23:37,287 --> 00:23:38,448
there's been no sign

322
00:23:38,448 --> 00:23:39,727
Yan Xin is in her grasp.

323
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:41,527
Her bringing it up now

324
00:23:41,767 --> 00:23:42,807
is just a bait.

325
00:23:46,767 --> 00:23:48,408
Jiang and those South Mountain Hunters

326
00:23:48,807 --> 00:23:50,968
were also just bait to lure you out.

327
00:23:55,047 --> 00:23:55,928
This time,

328
00:23:59,047 --> 00:24:01,408
it's far more than
a simple hostage swap or trade.

329
00:24:04,727 --> 00:24:06,087
It's time to end everything.

330
00:24:09,007 --> 00:24:10,208
Not just for me,

331
00:24:11,608 --> 00:24:12,448
but also for you.

332
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:32,247
(Burn After Reading: Heard the recording.
Both Yan Tuo and I will be there.)

333
00:24:38,168 --> 00:24:40,408
She wants us to go to her lair?

334
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:42,527
This is simply a trap.

335
00:24:43,368 --> 00:24:45,487
Maybe it's an act out of desperation.

336
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:48,287
Perfect. We could
wipe them out in one go.

337
00:24:50,007 --> 00:24:51,408
A cornered rabbit will also bite.

338
00:24:52,087 --> 00:24:53,208
A wounded beast,

339
00:24:53,648 --> 00:24:54,888
seeming abandoned,

340
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,408
is the most dangerous.

341
00:24:57,848 --> 00:24:58,567
Especially

342
00:24:58,567 --> 00:25:00,527
a female carnivore
who's just lost her cub.

343
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,727
Best be careful.

344
00:25:02,368 --> 00:25:04,047
Mad Blade has said

345
00:25:04,168 --> 00:25:05,567
she'll go to Twilight Chasm.

346
00:25:05,688 --> 00:25:06,767
What are we waiting for?

347
00:25:07,128 --> 00:25:08,128
Go rendezvous with her.

348
00:25:08,767 --> 00:25:09,368
Let's go.

349
00:25:11,208 --> 00:25:11,968
To rescue Jiang,

350
00:25:12,128 --> 00:25:12,888
count me in.

351
00:25:14,007 --> 00:25:14,567
Hey.

352
00:25:14,688 --> 00:25:15,688
Don't be ridiculous.

353
00:25:22,192 --> 00:25:23,312
(Roadsound Group)

354
00:25:30,608 --> 00:25:31,608
We have to go

355
00:25:32,727 --> 00:25:33,487
to Twilight Chasm.

356
00:25:34,928 --> 00:25:37,848
But we can't go unprepared.

357
00:25:39,128 --> 00:25:40,648
Our top priority is rescuing our men.

358
00:25:41,408 --> 00:25:43,128
First, rescue Jiang and others.

359
00:25:43,727 --> 00:25:45,807
Then we take them all out,
leaving none alive.

360
00:25:46,527 --> 00:25:48,648
The Youtang Mine is their escape route.

361
00:25:49,727 --> 00:25:51,327
We must seal it off completely.

362
00:25:52,208 --> 00:25:53,727
They may have the terrain advantage,

363
00:25:54,567 --> 00:25:55,767
but their numbers are limited.

364
00:25:57,168 --> 00:25:58,368
We're not exactly strangers

365
00:25:59,007 --> 00:26:00,408
to the Golden Gate area.

366
00:26:01,448 --> 00:26:02,807
We may still hold some advantage.

367
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,727
Moreover,

368
00:26:07,287 --> 00:26:09,128
we might have other helpers too.

369
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:12,408
You mean,

370
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:15,208
helpers besides Mad Blade?

371
00:26:19,368 --> 00:26:20,287
As usual.

372
00:26:21,208 --> 00:26:22,287
Vote by raising hands.

373
00:26:22,968 --> 00:26:24,287
Accept Lin Xirou's invitation,

374
00:26:24,688 --> 00:26:27,047
open the Golden Gate
and go to Twilight Chasm.

375
00:27:04,168 --> 00:27:04,807
Shen,

376
00:27:07,888 --> 00:27:09,168
you plan

377
00:27:09,368 --> 00:27:11,807
to let Yu Rong lead a team
to seal the Youtang mine?

378
00:27:14,888 --> 00:27:17,087
She has been there and knows the place.

379
00:27:18,047 --> 00:27:18,848
In my opinion,

380
00:27:18,896 --> 00:27:21,840
with Mad Dog, Ghost Whip, and Mad Blade
united at the Golden Gate,

381
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,216
cracking down the Twilight Chasm,

382
00:27:23,368 --> 00:27:25,208
that's the true spirit of the Hunters.

383
00:27:25,968 --> 00:27:28,208
I'm just worried
it'll end up like the last time.

384
00:27:28,208 --> 00:27:29,087
Spread power too thin.

385
00:27:30,767 --> 00:27:31,688
What do you suggest?

386
00:27:34,087 --> 00:27:35,287
I'll go to seal the mine.

387
00:27:38,567 --> 00:27:40,487
My family has been
the Hunters for generations.

388
00:27:41,087 --> 00:27:42,608
I've been trained since childhood.

389
00:27:43,168 --> 00:27:44,448
When I got tired from training,

390
00:27:44,688 --> 00:27:45,767
my father would say,

391
00:27:46,087 --> 00:27:47,767
"You can play the hero
whenever you want."

392
00:27:47,968 --> 00:27:49,688
"But never chicken out
at the key moment."

393
00:27:50,487 --> 00:27:51,247
This time,

394
00:27:51,247 --> 00:27:52,567
let me play the hero.

395
00:27:55,888 --> 00:27:57,408
Once entering the Twilight Chasm,

396
00:27:59,007 --> 00:28:00,527
fiends hunt human monsters.

397
00:28:04,208 --> 00:28:06,047
Blades and hounds
walk the Turquoise Land,

398
00:28:07,168 --> 00:28:09,208
and Ghost Whip cracks his glowing whip.

399
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,408
Seven hounds, two whips, and one blade.

400
00:28:14,247 --> 00:28:14,848
Okay.

401
00:28:15,208 --> 00:28:16,928
The Golden Gate
is fortified beyond defeat.

402
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:18,888
I'll assign two experienced men

403
00:28:20,007 --> 00:28:20,888
to join you.

404
00:28:27,608 --> 00:28:30,767
South Mountain shall see
no more unjust deaths.

405
00:28:35,928 --> 00:28:36,487
Come on.

406
00:28:36,487 --> 00:28:37,968
Start eating. Don't wait for me.

407
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:39,208
One more dish is almost ready.

408
00:28:39,767 --> 00:28:40,527
Mr. Changxi,

409
00:28:40,888 --> 00:28:42,368
you and Ms. Lu are

410
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,928
fattening us all up.

411
00:28:44,727 --> 00:28:45,767
Just let him stay busy.

412
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:46,527
He can't sit idly.

413
00:28:46,527 --> 00:28:48,128
He even suggested me to join him

414
00:28:48,128 --> 00:28:49,648
to dig wild herbs in the mountain.

415
00:28:50,087 --> 00:28:52,408
Spring Special for Changxi Dumplings.

416
00:28:52,527 --> 00:28:54,448
Shepherd's purse filling, super fresh.

417
00:28:54,968 --> 00:28:55,567
Mr. Changxi.

418
00:28:56,208 --> 00:28:58,168
Luo and I are going on a long trip.

419
00:28:58,168 --> 00:28:59,608
Make those when we come back.

420
00:29:01,368 --> 00:29:02,848
Where are you going?

421
00:29:04,608 --> 00:29:05,888
To get artistic inspiration.

422
00:29:06,128 --> 00:29:07,807
But we plan to visit several places.

423
00:29:10,408 --> 00:29:11,128
Mr. Changxi,

424
00:29:11,727 --> 00:29:13,688
when we're not around,

425
00:29:13,688 --> 00:29:15,440
hone your cooking skills with Ms. Lu.

426
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,888
When we return,
let's see if Lin Ling has gained weight.

427
00:29:17,968 --> 00:29:19,047
If she hasn't,

428
00:29:19,128 --> 00:29:20,608
it means you still need to practice.

429
00:29:20,928 --> 00:29:21,848
Deal.

430
00:29:22,287 --> 00:29:23,007
This time,

431
00:29:23,007 --> 00:29:25,047
I'll definitely learn properly

432
00:29:25,047 --> 00:29:26,807
how you make that filling.

433
00:29:27,087 --> 00:29:27,807
Alright.

434
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:28,727
Teach you everything.

435
00:29:29,368 --> 00:29:30,408
Eat up.

436
00:29:34,007 --> 00:29:34,727
Let's eat.

437
00:29:37,007 --> 00:29:37,688
Come on.

438
00:29:37,727 --> 00:29:38,608
Teach you everything.

439
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:56,128
What's wrong?

440
00:29:57,567 --> 00:29:58,968
Don't just sit right after eating.

441
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,287
Take a stroll after the meal.

442
00:30:02,287 --> 00:30:03,608
That's how you can live long.

443
00:30:03,727 --> 00:30:04,408
Understood?

444
00:30:08,527 --> 00:30:09,128
Tuo.

445
00:30:11,487 --> 00:30:12,727
Getting artistic inspiration

446
00:30:14,007 --> 00:30:15,287
was just a lie, right?

447
00:30:26,688 --> 00:30:28,247
We must end this.

448
00:30:30,888 --> 00:30:31,688
To Luo,

449
00:30:33,087 --> 00:30:33,888
to me.

450
00:30:35,247 --> 00:30:36,928
And it goes the same to you.

451
00:30:42,128 --> 00:30:44,047
We finally escaped

452
00:30:46,247 --> 00:30:47,928
and found peace.

453
00:30:50,888 --> 00:30:51,848
But this peace

454
00:30:51,848 --> 00:30:53,047
is only temporary.

455
00:30:54,888 --> 00:30:56,727
If we must hide

456
00:30:56,848 --> 00:30:58,648
and run in fear,

457
00:31:00,408 --> 00:31:01,848
then what's the difference between

458
00:31:02,168 --> 00:31:03,767
the current life and the previous one?

459
00:31:07,408 --> 00:31:09,247
I'd rather return to the previous life

460
00:31:10,208 --> 00:31:11,688
than see you get harmed.

461
00:31:18,968 --> 00:31:19,608
I swear,

462
00:31:20,567 --> 00:31:21,767
we'll come back safe.

463
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,007
Okay?

464
00:31:25,368 --> 00:31:26,007
Don't worry.

465
00:31:35,952 --> 00:31:39,984
(Moving Forward)

466
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:11,648
This time,

467
00:32:11,648 --> 00:32:13,767
many South Mountain Hunters
are going with us.

468
00:32:14,168 --> 00:32:14,688
We'll take

469
00:32:14,688 --> 00:32:16,688
the path we've trodden
countless times before.

470
00:32:16,688 --> 00:32:17,487
Don't worry.

471
00:32:18,047 --> 00:32:19,968
You must keep me updated.

472
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:21,567
Got it.

473
00:32:23,727 --> 00:32:24,848
When you two are not around,

474
00:32:25,208 --> 00:32:26,087
with me alone here,

475
00:32:26,087 --> 00:32:27,767
I don't know what to do.

476
00:32:29,327 --> 00:32:30,608
You can enter my room anytime.

477
00:32:30,767 --> 00:32:32,968
To read, paint, daydream,
or play with clay.

478
00:32:32,968 --> 00:32:33,888
Do whatever you like.

479
00:32:36,527 --> 00:32:38,087
I'm worried about you,

480
00:32:38,527 --> 00:32:40,688
but honestly, I really envy you.

481
00:32:41,648 --> 00:32:44,208
Envy that you always know your goals,

482
00:32:44,767 --> 00:32:46,247
and keep pursuing them.

483
00:32:52,767 --> 00:32:53,807
You're still young.

484
00:32:54,168 --> 00:32:55,487
Have time to chase your dreams.

485
00:33:00,047 --> 00:33:00,888
Promise me

486
00:33:01,287 --> 00:33:02,527
to come back safe.

487
00:33:04,648 --> 00:33:05,247
Sure.

488
00:33:06,287 --> 00:33:06,968
See?

489
00:33:07,287 --> 00:33:08,247
Good things ahead.

490
00:33:13,087 --> 00:33:13,688
Let's go.

491
00:33:15,007 --> 00:33:16,047
I'll walk you out.

492
00:33:16,208 --> 00:33:17,047
Okay, I'll get it.

493
00:33:25,744 --> 00:33:31,952
(Nanshan Rescue Team)

494
00:33:42,224 --> 00:33:46,832
(Entrusted by All, Aid from All Sides)

495
00:33:51,168 --> 00:33:52,247
Don't forget the gear.

496
00:33:53,327 --> 00:33:54,168
Take this too.

497
00:34:25,808 --> 00:34:27,408
Our ancestors battled in Turquoise Land,

498
00:34:28,487 --> 00:34:29,968
assailed by Earth Fiends.

499
00:34:31,664 --> 00:34:33,712
The ancient king founded
the South Mountain Hunters

500
00:34:34,007 --> 00:34:35,288
to fight the fiends unto death.

501
00:34:35,808 --> 00:34:37,047
We inherit this duty.

502
00:34:38,288 --> 00:34:39,888
Now Earth Fiends invade again.

503
00:34:40,968 --> 00:34:42,408
We summon the Hunter King Cauldron

504
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:45,848
to pray ancestors and protect the realm.

505
00:34:47,408 --> 00:34:50,888
May South Mountain purge the fiends
and bring peace to the people.

506
00:34:51,216 --> 00:34:53,007

Mad Dog bays, thunderous roar.

509

Iron hammers shatter fiend teeth.

526
00:37:11,288 --> 00:37:11,888
Ms. Lin.

527
00:37:20,368 --> 00:37:21,368
I thought

528
00:37:23,728 --> 00:37:25,288
you had forgotten me.

529
00:37:26,248 --> 00:37:27,607
This is the last chance.

530
00:37:28,487 --> 00:37:29,647
Where is the Mad Blade?

531
00:37:31,007 --> 00:37:32,007
If I'd tell you,

532
00:37:34,328 --> 00:37:35,607
I would've told you long ago.

533
00:37:36,408 --> 00:37:40,087
Why suffer such pain

534
00:37:40,087 --> 00:37:41,567
and hang in till now?

535
00:37:42,607 --> 00:37:43,207
Fine.

536
00:37:49,007 --> 00:37:50,167
Then, there's

537
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:52,448
no need to tell me anymore.

538
00:37:54,007 --> 00:37:54,647
Ms. Lin.

539
00:38:00,328 --> 00:38:01,288
If we kill him now,

540
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,448
we'd lose an important bargaining chip.

541
00:38:07,087 --> 00:38:08,848
Do you think I would

542
00:38:08,848 --> 00:38:10,207
let him off that easily?
