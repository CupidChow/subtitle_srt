Don't be scared. It's me.

It's me.

00:05:28,315 --> 00:05:29,076
Yan Tuo.

27
00:05:30,355 --> 00:05:31,315
Get up.

28
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,156
I'll get you out.

29
00:05:33,756 --> 00:05:35,875
Yan Tuo, I'll get you out.

30
00:05:35,995 --> 00:05:37,516
Get up, Yan Tuo.

31
00:05:37,756 --> 00:05:38,596
Get up.

32
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:40,219
I'll get you out, Yan Tuo.

33
00:05:40,867 --> 00:05:42,787
Yan Tuo, get up.

34
00:05:44,307 --> 00:05:45,107
Yan Tuo.

35
00:05:50,588 --> 00:05:51,748
Wait here.

36
00:06:19,388 --> 00:06:20,588
What new species is this?

37
00:06:21,028 --> 00:06:22,868
Whatever. Just take it down.

38
00:08:09,635 --> 00:08:10,555
Is he Sun Zhou?

39
00:08:10,795 --> 00:08:12,074
Explain later.

40
00:08:55,075 --> 00:08:57,059
(Roadsound Mining)

41
00:10:02,579 --> 00:10:03,418
Go to the hospital

42
00:10:03,418 --> 00:10:05,058
for body checks first?

43
00:10:05,418 --> 00:10:06,178
You look...

44
00:10:06,178 --> 00:10:06,778
No need.

45
00:10:22,058 --> 00:10:23,178
About Sun Zhou,

46
00:10:24,219 --> 00:10:24,819
I...

47
00:10:26,219 --> 00:10:27,178
No need to explain.

48
00:10:29,018 --> 00:10:30,658
I don't think it was your call.

49
00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:38,859
Let's get him home first.

50
00:10:40,138 --> 00:10:41,538
I'll handle it then.

51
00:11:01,099 --> 00:11:01,979
Mr. Xing.

52
00:11:02,658 --> 00:11:04,459
Dinner is ready. Come inside.

53
00:11:06,859 --> 00:11:09,058
No need. Thanks.

54
00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:13,658
I'll bring it to you.

55
00:11:14,658 --> 00:11:15,339
Appreciate it.

56
00:11:41,979 --> 00:11:43,219
I've been thinking,

57
00:11:43,819 --> 00:11:45,178
from Li Ergou's disappearance

58
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:47,819
to Lin Xirou becoming human,

59
00:11:48,778 --> 00:11:50,099
it happened remarkably fast.

60
00:11:53,499 --> 00:11:55,099
But in the next twenty years,

61
00:11:55,898 --> 00:11:57,258
Lin Xirou only transformed

62
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,619
a dozen humanoid Earth Fiends.

63
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:00,219
Could it be

64
00:12:00,643 --> 00:12:02,819
her transformation into a human
was just a coincidence,

65
00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:05,499
and she's been trying
to replicate it ever since?

66
00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:13,619
It takes five hundred years

67
00:12:13,619 --> 00:12:14,979
for a snake to become a spirit.

68
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:16,898
Turning Earth Fiends human

69
00:12:17,699 --> 00:12:18,938
can't be that simple either.

70
00:12:26,298 --> 00:12:27,459
Maybe besides blood bags,

71
00:12:29,258 --> 00:12:30,859
something else is needed.

72
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:34,099
Something rarer.

73
00:12:35,898 --> 00:12:37,339
I envy the older generation.

74
00:12:38,018 --> 00:12:39,099
Everything's simple.

75
00:12:40,018 --> 00:12:42,418
Easy to distinguish
between fiends and humans.

76
00:12:43,778 --> 00:12:44,898
But anyway,

77
00:12:45,178 --> 00:12:46,499
we can't be sure

78
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:47,699
the records

79
00:12:47,699 --> 00:12:49,418
are complete.

80
00:12:55,499 --> 00:12:56,699
Contact me anytime.

81
00:12:57,938 --> 00:12:58,658
Thanks.

82
00:13:00,859 --> 00:13:02,499
Though there were more rational options,

83
00:13:03,538 --> 00:13:04,538
what he did

84
00:13:04,979 --> 00:13:06,018
wasn't exactly wrong.

85
00:13:07,939 --> 00:13:08,859
Don't blame Xing Shen.

86
00:13:10,099 --> 00:13:11,499
He just did it for South Mountain.

87
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:22,738
I've brought Lin Ling
and Mr. Changxi here.

88
00:14:28,658 --> 00:14:29,698
When I'm not around,

89
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:31,698
South Mountain Hunters
will be on guard around.

90
00:14:31,859 --> 00:14:32,898
They stay safe.

91
00:14:33,178 --> 00:14:34,138
Don't worry.

92
00:14:37,498 --> 00:14:38,938
Miss Nie, you're back.

93
00:14:40,099 --> 00:14:40,859
This is...

94
00:14:41,498 --> 00:14:42,339
Mr. Yan?

95
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:43,418
How did he...

96
00:14:43,539 --> 00:14:44,898
He was on a business trip

97
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:47,059
and met some ruthless competitors.

98
00:14:47,379 --> 00:14:48,859
They locked him in a coal mine.

99
00:14:49,698 --> 00:14:51,218
It's a long story.

100
00:14:51,418 --> 00:14:52,579
I'll tell you later.

101
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,698
Alright, get in.

102
00:14:57,059 --> 00:14:57,698
Let's go.

103
00:15:00,498 --> 00:15:02,579
Ling just fell asleep.

104
00:15:02,738 --> 00:15:03,978
Should I wake her?

105
00:15:04,658 --> 00:15:05,379
Ms. Lu.

106
00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:09,059
Thank you.

107
00:15:21,418 --> 00:15:22,819
You go in with Ms. Lu first.

108
00:15:22,859 --> 00:15:23,819
I'll be back later.

109
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:26,978
Ms. Lu.

110
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:29,978
Don't let Lin Ling
and Mr. Changxi know for now.

111
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:31,099
Understood.

112
00:15:31,819 --> 00:15:32,978
Mr. Yan, please.

113
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:35,418
Go.

114
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:23,539
Mr. Yan.

115
00:17:00,003 --> 00:17:03,751
(Peace and Joy, All Things Go Well)

116
00:17:03,751 --> 00:17:07,491
(Joy Comes Upon)

117
00:17:46,259 --> 00:17:46,978
Thank you.

118
00:17:48,339 --> 00:17:49,178
No problem.

119
00:17:54,218 --> 00:17:55,339
I saw Sun Zhou.

120
00:18:00,658 --> 00:18:01,738
Didn't you say

121
00:18:01,978 --> 00:18:03,259
you'd try your best to help him?

122
00:18:04,218 --> 00:18:05,458
Since we can't save him,

123
00:18:06,379 --> 00:18:07,299
making him alive

124
00:18:07,738 --> 00:18:08,859
and become one of us

125
00:18:09,619 --> 00:18:10,779
is kind of help.

126
00:18:10,938 --> 00:18:12,458
Just like Locust you raised?

127
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:16,059
In your eyes,

128
00:18:16,738 --> 00:18:18,458
any difference
between humans and fiends?

129
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:19,299
Of course yes.

130
00:18:23,178 --> 00:18:25,059
Locust wasn't successfully tamed.

131
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:27,299
I underestimated it.

132
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,458
Sun Zhou has red threads
piercing his pupils,

133
00:18:29,978 --> 00:18:31,498
but he still remains his humanity.

134
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:32,898
After being trained by Yu Rong,

135
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:33,579
he could've...

136
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:34,418
He's dead.

137
00:18:41,259 --> 00:18:42,339
Today in the mine,

138
00:18:42,691 --> 00:18:43,539
we saw an Earth Fiend

139
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,779
that didn't fully transform
into human form.

140
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:49,099
Indeed,

141
00:18:49,698 --> 00:18:50,859
he did become one of us

142
00:18:50,859 --> 00:18:51,978
and fought alongside us.

143
00:18:52,819 --> 00:18:55,138
But he couldn't live like us.

144
00:19:01,579 --> 00:19:02,418
You may leave.

145
00:19:02,738 --> 00:19:04,259
You are not needed here anymore.

146
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:00,418
Miss Nie.

147
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:01,619
I've searched.

148
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:03,458
There's no Xicang instant noodles here.

149
00:22:03,619 --> 00:22:05,379
You usually don't eat
this kind of stuff.

150
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:06,898
Should I go out and look for some?

151
00:22:07,178 --> 00:22:07,898
Don't bother.

152
00:22:08,178 --> 00:22:09,339
These dried noodles will do.

153
00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:10,619
It's fine.

154
00:22:10,619 --> 00:22:11,938
Ms. Lu, you can go rest.

155
00:22:11,938 --> 00:22:12,898
I can handle it.

156
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:34,019
Let me do it.

157
00:22:52,619 --> 00:22:53,498
Miss Nie.

158
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:56,379
I've never seen you cook before.

159
00:22:57,938 --> 00:22:59,299
I'm worried he's starving.

160
00:23:03,555 --> 00:23:04,276
I'll do it.

161
00:23:58,243 --> 00:23:59,763
It's late now.

162
00:23:59,884 --> 00:24:01,203
I can only make something simple.

163
00:24:08,483 --> 00:24:10,763
How about I leave it by the door?

164
00:26:42,124 --> 00:26:42,844
Thanks.

165
00:26:48,804 --> 00:26:49,723
Get some rest.

166
00:27:09,324 --> 00:27:10,284
Over at the mine,

167
00:27:10,284 --> 00:27:11,276
Big Head and Shan Qiang

168
00:27:11,276 --> 00:27:13,003
temporarily restrained those underlings.

169
00:27:13,844 --> 00:27:15,203
The biggest gain this time

170
00:27:15,203 --> 00:27:17,283
is finding that Earth Fiend
down in the mine.

171
00:27:17,564 --> 00:27:21,683
So, that Earth Fiend down in the mine

172
00:27:23,084 --> 00:27:24,683
had already taken on human form

173
00:27:25,564 --> 00:27:28,084
but still retained some brutish nature.

174
00:27:28,683 --> 00:27:30,604
In the middle of a humanoid Earth Fiend

175
00:27:31,364 --> 00:27:33,564
and a primal Earth Fiend.

176
00:27:33,564 --> 00:27:34,164
Exactly.

177
00:27:34,644 --> 00:27:35,604
That mine

178
00:27:35,604 --> 00:27:37,164
was likely a transition spot

179
00:27:37,164 --> 00:27:39,084
for Earth Fiends freshly
transformed into humans.

180
00:27:39,644 --> 00:27:41,683
They need a transition spot

181
00:27:42,003 --> 00:27:44,203
to adapt and learn
how to live on the ground.

182
00:27:46,763 --> 00:27:49,283
Could there be more
humanoid Earth Fiends down there?

183
00:27:49,483 --> 00:27:50,243
Not sure.

184
00:27:50,804 --> 00:27:51,963
Without Sun Zhou,

185
00:27:52,243 --> 00:27:54,203
we couldn't even handle that big guy.

186
00:27:55,124 --> 00:27:56,404
No time to explore further.

187
00:27:59,324 --> 00:28:01,203
This mine must be

188
00:28:02,283 --> 00:28:03,723
critical to them.

189
00:28:06,283 --> 00:28:07,364
Must make good use of it.

190
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:25,723
(Tuo.)

191
00:28:28,963 --> 00:28:31,283
(Your biggest helper all along)

192
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:33,124
(was me.)

193
00:28:33,844 --> 00:28:34,884
(But such things)

194
00:28:35,683 --> 00:28:36,804
(won't happen again.)

195
00:28:37,963 --> 00:28:40,124
(Everything is clear now.)

196
00:28:41,243 --> 00:28:42,763
(So you have nothing to fear.)

197
00:28:43,884 --> 00:28:45,283
(Starting today,)

198
00:28:46,164 --> 00:28:48,523
(we draw distinct lines)

199
00:28:49,044 --> 00:28:51,483
between humans and fiends.

200
00:30:28,683 --> 00:30:29,524
Still awake?

201
00:30:31,604 --> 00:30:32,363
I'm exhausted,

202
00:30:33,524 --> 00:30:34,444
but can't sleep.
