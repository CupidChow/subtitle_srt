15

(This story is a work of fiction)

16
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,832
=Episode 32=

17
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,479
Luo?

18
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,559
Luo?

19
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,319
Early this morning,

20
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:07,680
she had me book a train ticket.

21
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,840
And just one ticket.

22
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,639
And the destination?

23
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:11,879
Where to?

24
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:12,599
Central Plaza?

25
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,440
Central Plaza?

26
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,039
Liangxi! One more to go!

27
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:16,280
Beauty, going to Central Plaza?

28
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,199
20 yuan. 20 yuan only.

29
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:17,960
No need.

30
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,479
Liangxi?

31
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,560
- Just need one more to go.
- No.

32
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,120
Liangxi.

33
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,520
Last spot. Cheap now.

34
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,479
Going to Liangxi?

35
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,440
(Welcome to Anta Station)
To Liangxi, young man?

36
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,608
Liangxi? Leaving immediately.

37
00:02:25,832 --> 00:02:26,759
Get in and we'll go.

38
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,680
Liangxi? Just one person needed.

39
00:02:50,929 --> 00:02:53,489
Dad!

40
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,570
Little girl, leave here first.

41
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,209
Be good.

42
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,769
He jumped from the rooftop?

43
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:02,049
That's so high.

44
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:09,690
Mom.

45
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:13,810
Luo.

46
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:15,489
Luo.

47
00:03:21,937 --> 00:03:23,177
Why do you keep following me?

48
00:03:24,096 --> 00:03:24,976
I keep following you?

49
00:03:25,536 --> 00:03:26,937
You ran off without a word.

50
00:03:27,136 --> 00:03:28,217
I've been looking for you.

51
00:03:29,017 --> 00:03:29,897
I left without a word

52
00:03:29,897 --> 00:03:31,376
just to stop you from following.

53
00:03:32,297 --> 00:03:33,457
If I lost you,

54
00:03:33,777 --> 00:03:35,256
Ms. Lu would chop me up

55
00:03:35,337 --> 00:03:36,656
for Mr. Changxi's meat filling.

56
00:03:39,985 --> 00:03:45,961
(Sweet Bamboo Dessert Shop)

57
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,830
This shop is still open until now.

58
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,470
You remember it?

59
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,470
I'd forget anyplace before here.

60
00:04:02,897 --> 00:04:04,368
(Ice Cream)

61
00:04:04,368 --> 00:04:05,728
As a child I always wondered

62
00:04:05,728 --> 00:04:07,368
what flavor this really was.

63
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,009
You never tried it?

64
00:04:12,248 --> 00:04:13,928
This ice cream cost three yuan each.

65
00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:16,529
Aunt couldn't bear to buy two.

66
00:04:17,368 --> 00:04:18,688
So every time we passed,

67
00:04:19,848 --> 00:04:21,649
she bought one for her daughter.

68
00:04:24,168 --> 00:04:25,089
Just once.

69
00:04:26,209 --> 00:04:27,529
Uncle took me out

70
00:04:28,409 --> 00:04:29,368
and secretly bought me

71
00:04:29,368 --> 00:04:30,608
a fifty-cent popsicle.

72
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,048
After my dad died,

73
00:04:36,368 --> 00:04:38,329
Aunt sold our place

74
00:04:39,329 --> 00:04:41,488
to fund her daughter's overseas studies.

75
00:04:42,608 --> 00:04:43,928
Uncle couldn't object.

76
00:04:45,808 --> 00:04:48,488
They wanted me
to attend vocational school

77
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:49,409
and marry early.

78
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:51,488
So that life would be easier.

79
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:54,449
If not for meeting Jiang,

80
00:04:58,188 --> 00:04:58,688
who knows

81
00:04:58,688 --> 00:05:00,569
what kind of life I'd be living now?

82
00:05:09,808 --> 00:05:11,209
Excuse me. May I ask something?

83
00:05:11,368 --> 00:05:12,728
When did the people here move?

84
00:05:14,248 --> 00:05:15,368
Years ago.

85
00:05:15,728 --> 00:05:17,009
Demolition's been talked about.

86
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:18,569
Still not done to this day.

87
00:05:19,168 --> 00:05:21,048
Do you know where they moved to?

88
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:22,409
Who knows?

89
00:05:23,209 --> 00:05:24,329
Each finds their own fate.

90
00:05:36,248 --> 00:05:36,889
How about

91
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:39,129
I ask the neighborhood committee?

92
00:05:39,329 --> 00:05:40,330
They'll surely know where

93
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,680
your uncle and aunt moved to.

94
00:05:42,168 --> 00:05:43,048
No need.

95
00:05:49,995 --> 00:05:52,881
(Peace, Joy, and All Things Auspicious;
Joy Comes Upon)

96
00:06:26,129 --> 00:06:28,048
Don't forget today's five stars...

97
00:06:31,848 --> 00:06:33,209
Alright, eat first.

98
00:06:45,048 --> 00:06:46,209
You love this so much?

99
00:06:46,848 --> 00:06:47,928
Here, have some more.

100
00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:52,409
You don't like it?

101
00:07:17,553 --> 00:07:19,313
(Day 10 of Yan Tuo's disappearance.)

102
00:07:19,512 --> 00:07:22,032
(He'll come back safely. Definitely.)

103
00:07:22,272 --> 00:07:23,593
I almost died in the mine,

104
00:07:23,593 --> 00:07:24,713
and you risked saving me.

105
00:07:24,713 --> 00:07:25,512
Recall anything?

106
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:26,593
How often must I say it?

107
00:07:26,752 --> 00:07:27,632
I remember nothing.

108
00:08:07,504 --> 00:08:08,560
What?

109
00:08:09,073 --> 00:08:11,393
Uh... It's business. Work.

110
00:08:31,409 --> 00:08:32,409
Are you finally

111
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:33,970
getting it now?

112
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:35,730
Get to the point.

113
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,490
Ever watch The Female Artists?

114
00:08:38,889 --> 00:08:41,049
That variety show blew up everywhere.

115
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:43,250
They gather some female artists

116
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,730
together in a place for two weeks

117
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,009
to jointly create a work of art

118
00:08:46,049 --> 00:08:46,850
for later auction.

119
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,809
Doesn't matter if it sells or not.

120
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,409
The real juice is watching them feud.

121
00:08:50,409 --> 00:08:51,610
Absolute fireworks.

122
00:08:54,169 --> 00:08:55,250
Well, I'm just...

123
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,210
Are you serious?

124
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:59,090
But there's no need for that anymore.

125
00:09:00,169 --> 00:09:00,970
Your body of work

126
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:02,929
deserves its own exhibition.

127
00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:05,090
Are you sure?

128
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:09,049
W-Where did

129
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,850
the new inspiration come from?

130
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:18,649
No idea.

131
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,450
I woke up, and it just hit me.

132
00:09:49,872 --> 00:09:51,296
Per Xicang Meteorological Station's

133
00:09:51,296 --> 00:09:52,977
latest monitoring data,

134
00:09:52,977 --> 00:09:53,857
our city has issued

135
00:09:53,857 --> 00:09:55,617
a blue rainstorm warning.

136
00:09:55,857 --> 00:09:57,496
Extreme rainfall is expected

137
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:58,776
across most districts

138
00:09:58,776 --> 00:10:00,977
within hours.

139
00:10:01,097 --> 00:10:02,577
Avoid nonessential travel.

140
00:10:02,577 --> 00:10:03,977
Steer clear of rivers, mountains,

141
00:10:03,977 --> 00:10:06,536
and areas prone
to landslide and mudslide.

142
00:10:07,496 --> 00:10:08,697
A couple of years back,

143
00:10:09,256 --> 00:10:11,057
this courtyard got flooded.

144
00:10:11,057 --> 00:10:12,937
Water rushed right into the house.

145
00:10:13,817 --> 00:10:16,176
Miss Nie and I
hauled furniture all night.

146
00:10:16,457 --> 00:10:17,737
Hopefully,

147
00:10:18,296 --> 00:10:19,697
it doesn't rain so hard this time.

148
00:10:22,737 --> 00:10:24,016
If furniture gets waterlogged,

149
00:10:24,577 --> 00:10:25,817
we can buy replacements.

150
00:10:27,016 --> 00:10:28,256
If the first floor floods,

151
00:10:28,296 --> 00:10:29,376
we can move to the second.

152
00:10:30,256 --> 00:10:31,496
If the second floods too,

153
00:10:31,496 --> 00:10:32,416
we still have the roof.

154
00:10:35,097 --> 00:10:35,857
Look at you.

155
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:39,776
Miss Nie has really
honed your resilience.

156
00:10:55,176 --> 00:10:56,136
Storm's coming.

157
00:10:56,337 --> 00:10:57,337
Are the windows shut?

158
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:20,337
Luo!

159
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:24,057
Luo!

160
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:18,217
Luo.

161
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:19,737
Give me five.

162
00:13:23,617 --> 00:13:24,577
This isn't a weapon,

163
00:13:24,776 --> 00:13:26,817
but something helps you escape
at critical moments.

164
00:13:27,457 --> 00:13:28,656
It can't launch an attack.

165
00:13:29,697 --> 00:13:31,176
Luo!

166
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:14,577
Yan Tuo?

167
00:14:15,536 --> 00:14:16,176
Yan Tuo?

168
00:14:51,297 --> 00:14:52,017
Yan Tuo.

169
00:14:58,777 --> 00:14:59,656
You're back?

170
00:15:00,337 --> 00:15:01,097
You're back.

171
00:15:07,216 --> 00:15:08,376
Long time no see.

172
00:15:54,097 --> 00:15:54,817
You're awake.

173
00:15:58,656 --> 00:16:00,857
Any plans for today?

174
00:16:04,337 --> 00:16:05,017
I was thinking

175
00:16:06,376 --> 00:16:07,696
about seeing my mom.

176
00:16:14,456 --> 00:16:15,337
Okay.

177
00:16:17,696 --> 00:16:18,577
I'll go with you.

178
00:18:17,976 --> 00:18:19,057
You're a grown-up now.

179
00:18:20,617 --> 00:18:21,936
Don't be a crybaby anymore.

180
00:18:24,017 --> 00:18:24,696
Mom.

181
00:18:41,057 --> 00:18:42,057
Be good, Luo.

182
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:43,577
Mom.

183
00:18:44,176 --> 00:18:45,376
I'm really happy.

184
00:18:46,257 --> 00:18:46,976
Mom.

185
00:18:47,017 --> 00:18:47,936
I don't regret it.

186
00:18:48,497 --> 00:18:49,777
Mom.

187
00:18:50,376 --> 00:18:51,777
Mom.

188
00:18:53,136 --> 00:18:53,817
Be good.

189
00:18:54,896 --> 00:18:55,857
(Live well.)

190
00:18:56,537 --> 00:18:58,216
(Live the life you want.)

191
00:18:59,497 --> 00:19:00,136
Mom!

192
00:19:02,216 --> 00:19:03,136
Mom!

193
00:19:07,216 --> 00:19:08,136
Mom!

194
00:19:11,696 --> 00:19:12,777
Mom.

195
00:20:07,136 --> 00:20:07,896
My mom

196
00:20:10,216 --> 00:20:11,497
doesn't regret it.

(Nie Jiuluo, Pei Ke)

199
00:21:30,737 --> 00:21:31,737
We could say

200
00:21:33,257 --> 00:21:34,497
it's all settled now.

201
00:22:06,577 --> 00:22:07,136
By the way,

202
00:22:07,497 --> 00:22:09,176
where is the Earth Fiend Xing Shen kept?

203
00:22:10,817 --> 00:22:11,376
Locust?

204
00:22:12,737 --> 00:22:14,737
We contacted a team of biologists.

205
00:22:15,057 --> 00:22:16,217
They've taken it away.

206
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,217
No fiends in South Mountain.

207
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:48,856
Peace for all living things.

208
00:22:51,577 --> 00:22:53,696
- No fiends in South Mountain.
- No fiends in South Mountain.

209
00:22:54,057 --> 00:22:56,136
- Peace for all living things.
- Peace for all living things.

210
00:23:06,737 --> 00:23:08,376
Come on. Careful.

211
00:23:08,376 --> 00:23:10,537
Careful.

212
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:12,176
No peeking.

213
00:23:12,817 --> 00:23:13,497
- Are you ready?
- Alright.

214
00:23:13,497 --> 00:23:14,696
Where are we going?

215
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:16,217
You'll know when we get there.

216
00:23:16,217 --> 00:23:17,136
We're already inside.

217
00:23:17,376 --> 00:23:18,896
It's fine. Just keep walking forward.

218
00:23:19,257 --> 00:23:20,217
Almost there.

219
00:23:20,537 --> 00:23:21,057
Okay.

220
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:22,737
Get ready.

221
00:23:23,017 --> 00:23:25,096
Three, two, one.

222
00:23:28,537 --> 00:23:29,136
How is it?

223
00:23:30,704 --> 00:23:31,896
(Return Safely)

224
00:23:31,896 --> 00:23:33,616
I didn't know you had such skills.

225
00:23:34,297 --> 00:23:35,257
I can't make sculptures,

226
00:23:35,257 --> 00:23:36,696
but restoring them isn't a problem.

227
00:23:36,977 --> 00:23:38,497
Does that mean I can break things

228
00:23:38,497 --> 00:23:39,777
without feeling guilty?

229
00:23:39,777 --> 00:23:40,977
Since you can fix them all.

230
00:23:41,616 --> 00:23:43,537
You're someone
about to have a solo exhibition.

231
00:23:43,537 --> 00:23:44,856
Treasure your own work.

232
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:47,136
How is the preparation?

233
00:23:47,977 --> 00:23:49,297
Most of it is ready,

234
00:23:49,456 --> 00:23:50,817
except the grand finale piece.

235
00:23:50,817 --> 00:23:52,057
It still needs some polishing.

236
00:23:53,217 --> 00:23:54,297
How about I show it to you?

237
00:23:54,297 --> 00:23:55,057
Give some feedback?

238
00:23:55,176 --> 00:23:55,696
No,

239
00:23:56,497 --> 00:23:58,176
let's save the surprise for last.

240
00:23:59,616 --> 00:24:00,337
Alright.

241
00:24:00,537 --> 00:24:01,896
But don't get your hopes too high.

242
00:24:02,217 --> 00:24:03,616
So you won't be disappointed.

243
00:24:03,856 --> 00:24:05,096
How could that be?

244
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,696
Is the theme decided?

245
00:24:20,936 --> 00:24:21,577
Stripping?

246
00:24:24,777 --> 00:24:25,656
For so many years,

247
00:24:26,977 --> 00:24:27,737
I felt like

248
00:24:27,737 --> 00:24:29,577
I was trapped within a thin membrane.

249
00:24:30,896 --> 00:24:32,416
My relationship with this world

250
00:24:34,577 --> 00:24:36,656
was visible and touchable,

251
00:24:37,257 --> 00:24:39,096
yet always hazy and indistinct.

252
00:24:41,017 --> 00:24:42,616
You saved me from the Twilight Chasm.

253
00:24:43,696 --> 00:24:45,337
It felt like stripping that membrane.

254
00:24:46,096 --> 00:24:47,416
It brought me sudden clarity

255
00:24:47,856 --> 00:24:48,656
and sharpness.

256
00:24:51,057 --> 00:24:51,656
See?

257
00:24:51,896 --> 00:24:52,977
I told you before,

258
00:24:53,297 --> 00:24:55,497
(Stripping)
your work expresses rebirth.

259
00:24:58,017 --> 00:24:58,696
No.

260
00:25:02,936 --> 00:25:03,777
It's resurrection.

261
00:25:16,777 --> 00:25:17,537

00:27:08,737 --> 00:27:09,257
Here?

276
00:27:09,257 --> 00:27:09,817
Yes.

Yeah, no problem.

282
00:27:20,656 --> 00:27:21,257
Done.

Okay.

284

Isn't your writing a bit sloppy?

285
00:27:28,936 --> 00:27:29,904
Just make do for now.

Oh no.

Stop.

An exhibition this big

Half the credit.

314
00:31:02,622 --> 00:31:03,122
Right?

315
00:31:03,122 --> 00:31:04,081
Yes, half my credit.

This way, please.

324

Press on that side.

325
00:31:21,817 --> 00:31:22,317
Okay.

326
00:31:23,498 --> 00:31:24,777
Today's theme is...

327
00:31:25,257 --> 00:31:25,898
Stripping.

328
00:31:26,297 --> 00:31:26,898
Stripping.

329
00:31:27,078 --> 00:31:28,817
- Yes. Stripping.
- Say cheese.

330
00:31:28,817 --> 00:31:30,257
One, two, three.

331
00:31:30,257 --> 00:31:31,898
- Cheese.
- Cheese.

332
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:42,538
Though Nie Jiuluo is young,

333
00:31:42,978 --> 00:31:45,657
she's already entered

334
00:31:45,657 --> 00:31:47,297
her artistic maturity.

335
00:31:48,418 --> 00:31:50,137
She's endured so much lately,

336
00:31:50,697 --> 00:31:52,137
even grappling with inner emptiness.

337
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:54,098
The depth of time and spaces

338
00:31:54,098 --> 00:31:54,777
she's lived

339
00:31:54,777 --> 00:31:56,337
transcends her peers

340
00:31:56,337 --> 00:31:57,737
and fellow artists alike.

341
00:31:59,378 --> 00:32:00,978
So you're late to recognize her.

342
00:32:01,018 --> 00:32:01,618
Well,

343
00:32:02,538 --> 00:32:03,458
actually, she...

344
00:32:03,458 --> 00:32:06,297
She has created
her definitive masterpiece.

345
00:32:07,817 --> 00:32:09,538
Both artistically and commercially,

346
00:32:09,538 --> 00:32:12,538
it has reached unprecedented heights.

347
00:32:13,217 --> 00:32:15,137
I-I'm not saying
she has no room to grow further.

348
00:32:16,418 --> 00:32:17,697
I-I mean...

349
00:32:20,697 --> 00:32:21,498
Mr. Yan.

350
00:32:22,297 --> 00:32:24,098
The piece she unveiled today

351
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:26,578
is not just new work

352
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:28,737
but also a signature piece.

353
00:32:30,618 --> 00:32:31,618
So that means

354
00:32:32,737 --> 00:32:33,458
it must be

355
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:35,378
expensive.

356
00:32:39,337 --> 00:32:40,137
Mr. Lu,

357
00:32:41,058 --> 00:32:42,378
today I'm here to discuss

358
00:32:43,137 --> 00:32:44,337
not only that piece

359
00:32:45,498 --> 00:32:46,297
but also...

360
00:32:48,458 --> 00:32:49,737
but also all the other exhibits.

361
00:32:50,378 --> 00:32:51,177
I'll take them all.

362
00:32:51,857 --> 00:32:52,857
Next Thursday,

363
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,458
no need to handle the takedown.

364
00:32:55,378 --> 00:32:56,817
I'll have all of them collected.

365
00:33:01,657 --> 00:33:02,618
You want them all?

366
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:06,137
Clearing out the whole exhibition?

367
00:33:07,737 --> 00:33:08,697
Well,

368
00:33:09,058 --> 00:33:10,578
I can't offer a discount.

369
00:33:11,538 --> 00:33:13,018
Right. After all,

370
00:33:13,177 --> 00:33:14,737
you know artistic creation...

371
00:33:18,817 --> 00:33:20,098
Send me your bank details first.

372
00:33:25,137 --> 00:33:26,137
No rush on the contract.

373
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,058
It's so quiet.

374
00:33:42,697 --> 00:33:44,018
Have you ever experienced that?

375
00:33:45,297 --> 00:33:46,697
At night, when trying to sleep,

376
00:33:46,697 --> 00:33:47,777
it seems silent.

377
00:33:47,938 --> 00:33:49,378
But inside your ears,

378
00:33:49,538 --> 00:33:51,378
there's this constant rumbling.

379
00:33:51,938 --> 00:33:52,777
Yes.

380
00:33:53,938 --> 00:33:55,378
Sometimes when I close my eyes,

381
00:33:55,657 --> 00:33:57,137
I see colorful patterns too.

382
00:34:01,697 --> 00:34:02,498
So,

383
00:34:03,137 --> 00:34:05,098
does true absolute silence exist?

384
00:34:09,938 --> 00:34:11,538
As long as you feel grounded inside,

385
00:34:12,018 --> 00:34:14,018
and you bring peace to those around you,

386
00:34:14,217 --> 00:34:15,297
that's true tranquility.

387
00:34:15,498 --> 00:34:16,058
Right?

388
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:18,938
Just like now?

389
00:34:30,378 --> 00:34:31,177
If...

390
00:34:31,578 --> 00:34:32,817
I mean hypothetically speaking,

391
00:34:34,578 --> 00:34:35,618
if one day

392
00:34:35,857 --> 00:34:37,137
Earth Fiends reappear,

393
00:34:37,898 --> 00:34:38,817
what would you do?

394
00:34:48,618 --> 00:34:49,737
The old me

395
00:34:51,058 --> 00:34:53,618
would foolishly think dodging and hiding

396
00:34:53,857 --> 00:34:55,418
could bring peace.

397
00:34:56,777 --> 00:34:57,498
And now?

398
00:34:58,817 --> 00:34:59,697
Now,

399
00:35:02,458 --> 00:35:04,498
I finally have the life I want.

400
00:35:04,817 --> 00:35:06,578
If anyone tries to ruin it,

401
00:35:06,578 --> 00:35:08,098
I'll fight them tooth and nail.

402
00:35:12,378 --> 00:35:13,058
Alright.

403
00:35:14,098 --> 00:35:14,777
Then

404
00:35:15,538 --> 00:35:17,777
whether you're enjoying peace

405
00:35:18,378 --> 00:35:19,697
or fighting tooth and nail,

406
00:35:20,058 --> 00:35:21,418
always include me, Miss Nie.

407
00:35:22,337 --> 00:35:24,378
Count on it, Mr. Yan.

408
00:35:48,257 --> 00:35:49,217
It's worth the trip.

409
00:35:50,257 --> 00:35:51,378
What shall we eat later?

410
00:35:52,578 --> 00:35:53,498
Let's check nearby.

411
00:35:53,498 --> 00:35:54,217
Okay.

412
00:35:55,177 --> 00:35:56,217
I know a restaurant.

413
00:35:56,217 --> 00:35:56,938
Okay.

414
00:36:07,177 --> 00:36:09,018
Grandpa, everything's settled.

415
00:36:09,618 --> 00:36:12,058
The sculptures will be delivered
to you next Thursday.

416
00:36:13,018 --> 00:36:14,098
I don't need the others.

417
00:36:15,177 --> 00:36:16,737
Just get me that particular piece.

418
00:36:20,058 --> 00:36:22,177
What's so special about that piece,

419
00:36:22,697 --> 00:36:24,697
worth buying the entire exhibition for?

420
00:36:29,297 --> 00:36:30,498
It reminds me

421
00:36:31,777 --> 00:36:33,137
of my hometown.

422
00:36:36,217 --> 00:36:37,458
When you're old,

423
00:36:38,378 --> 00:36:40,297
you tend to get homesick.

424
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:06,212
