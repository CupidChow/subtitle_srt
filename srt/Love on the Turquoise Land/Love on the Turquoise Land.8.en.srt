17
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,004
Then,

18
00:01:58,644 --> 00:01:59,323
goodbye.

19
00:02:00,924 --> 00:02:02,404
We're unlikely to meet again.

20
00:02:06,963 --> 00:02:09,043
If you want to thank me
for saving your life,

21
00:02:09,124 --> 00:02:10,603
promise me two things.

22
00:02:11,723 --> 00:02:12,404
Go ahead.

23
00:02:13,804 --> 00:02:14,763
No matter

24
00:02:15,643 --> 00:02:17,323
who asks about recent events,

25
00:02:17,323 --> 00:02:18,483
never mention me.

26
00:02:19,483 --> 00:02:20,684
I want no more ties

27
00:02:20,684 --> 00:02:22,364
to South Mountain Hunters
or Earth Fiends.

28
00:02:24,483 --> 00:02:25,284
And second?

29
00:02:28,244 --> 00:02:30,163
The South Mountain Hunters have chosen

30
00:02:30,203 --> 00:02:31,524
a difficult yet righteous path.

31
00:02:32,923 --> 00:02:34,524
Though I'm not in a position to judge,

32
00:02:35,323 --> 00:02:36,084
I still hope

33
00:02:36,084 --> 00:02:37,603
you'll keep cooperating with them.

34
00:02:38,364 --> 00:02:39,763
This could be your chance

35
00:02:40,923 --> 00:02:42,443
to avenge your mother

36
00:02:43,323 --> 00:02:44,723
and find your sister.

37
00:02:46,763 --> 00:02:47,923
If you agree,

38
00:02:48,323 --> 00:02:49,524
I can help arrange contact.

39
00:02:51,364 --> 00:02:51,964
Deal.

40
00:03:23,564 --> 00:03:24,284
You actually

41
00:03:24,964 --> 00:03:27,323
do have some redeeming qualities.

42
00:03:31,483 --> 00:03:32,524
After all this time,

43
00:03:33,203 --> 00:03:34,163
it's the highest praise

44
00:03:34,163 --> 00:03:35,524
I've ever gotten from you.

45
00:03:48,284 --> 00:03:49,163
Miss Nie.

46
00:03:51,163 --> 00:03:52,483
You're finally back.

47
00:03:54,004 --> 00:03:54,832
What's for the meal?

48
00:03:55,923 --> 00:03:56,964
Whatever you make is fine.

49
00:03:57,923 --> 00:03:58,603
Let me help.

50
00:03:58,603 --> 00:03:59,163
No need.

51
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:00,723
I can handle it myself.

52
00:04:35,536 --> 00:04:39,248
(Nie Jiuluo)

53
00:05:36,643 --> 00:05:37,804
The long blade dispels life.

54
00:05:39,044 --> 00:05:40,164
The short one pursues death.

55
00:05:41,364 --> 00:05:42,164
Luo,

56
00:05:44,724 --> 00:05:45,924
with the Life-Death Blade,

57
00:05:47,244 --> 00:05:48,564
you are Mad Blade.

58
00:06:59,203 --> 00:07:01,044
Miss Nie, you should rest.

59
00:07:01,203 --> 00:07:02,963
I'll make soup dumplings quickly.

60
00:07:03,124 --> 00:07:04,244
Let me help.

61
00:07:04,523 --> 00:07:05,724
No need to trouble yourself.

62
00:07:06,484 --> 00:07:08,604
It's okay. I'm just idling anyway.

63
00:07:11,604 --> 00:07:13,724
Weren't you supposed to help Mom?

64
00:07:13,963 --> 00:07:15,484
Why are you crafting alone?

65
00:07:18,883 --> 00:07:20,604
Luo, this is the last one.

66
00:07:20,883 --> 00:07:22,124
We can't waste food.

67
00:07:22,883 --> 00:07:24,564
See how skillful our daughter is.

68
00:07:29,523 --> 00:07:30,523
Keep praising her.

69
00:07:30,523 --> 00:07:31,564
We'll run out of dough.

70
00:07:31,643 --> 00:07:32,564
This is on you.

71
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:33,843
So what?

72
00:07:34,323 --> 00:07:35,804
We can turn the rest of the filling

73
00:07:36,484 --> 00:07:37,164
into meatballs.

74
00:07:40,604 --> 00:07:41,443
Press here.

75
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:44,523
Spin faster.

76
00:07:44,523 --> 00:07:45,283
Your method...

77
00:07:46,124 --> 00:07:46,843
isn't working.

78
00:07:52,484 --> 00:07:55,164
You remembered something happy?

79
00:08:02,684 --> 00:08:03,484
Nothing.

80
00:08:04,203 --> 00:08:06,484
Just feels nice like this.

81
00:08:08,484 --> 00:08:09,443
That's good.

82
00:08:10,124 --> 00:08:11,083
Then in the future,

83
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,763
stop wandering off so often.

84
00:08:12,924 --> 00:08:13,763
Come home more.

85
00:08:14,164 --> 00:08:15,484
No place compares to home.

86
00:08:32,283 --> 00:08:33,084
You...

87
00:08:33,163 --> 00:08:34,604
I didn't let you in.

88
00:08:35,643 --> 00:08:36,484
Miss Nie.

89
00:08:39,763 --> 00:08:41,283
It's okay, Ms. Lu. He's my friend.

90
00:08:41,484 --> 00:08:42,163
You can go.

91
00:08:43,364 --> 00:08:44,004
Alright.

92
00:08:48,643 --> 00:08:49,683
Jiang's in trouble.

93
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,016
(Massage, Foot Spa, Wellness)

94
00:09:16,016 --> 00:09:18,046
(Nutritious Breakfast)

95
00:09:19,728 --> 00:09:21,084
(Free Checkups)

96
00:09:21,084 --> 00:09:22,923
Keep it dry. Avoid irritants.

97
00:09:22,923 --> 00:09:24,283
I shouldn't need to remind you.

98
00:09:24,403 --> 00:09:26,160
Return in three days
for a dressing change.

99
00:09:26,324 --> 00:09:26,844
Got it.

100
00:09:27,364 --> 00:09:28,923
You're practically a doctor by now.

101
00:09:28,923 --> 00:09:29,883
So no need to return.

102
00:09:30,124 --> 00:09:31,364
Buy gauze and do it yourself.

103
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:33,283
Say hi to Xiong.

104
00:09:33,563 --> 00:09:34,724
- Okay.
- Okay.

105
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,512
(Massage)

106
00:09:58,604 --> 00:09:59,523
What?

107
00:09:59,763 --> 00:10:00,763
Forget something?

108
00:10:03,484 --> 00:10:05,563
Can't you read 'Closed'?

109
00:10:16,163 --> 00:10:19,124
Front shop, back clinic.
This is shady business.

110
00:10:19,883 --> 00:10:21,043
Don't say that.

111
00:10:21,563 --> 00:10:23,043
If the Dragon King needs a jade bed,

112
00:10:23,163 --> 00:10:24,643
Xicang's Wanbao Tower has it.

113
00:10:25,244 --> 00:10:26,324
My dream was to open

114
00:10:26,724 --> 00:10:29,204
an East-meets-West place

115
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:31,403
where food is medicine.

116
00:10:31,604 --> 00:10:33,444
Whether you're injured

117
00:10:33,444 --> 00:10:34,643
or ill or something,

118
00:10:34,724 --> 00:10:36,244
you can find solutions here.

119
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:37,964
What about Xiong Hei?

120
00:10:38,403 --> 00:10:39,444
What 'solutions' for them?

121
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:42,964
Aren't they doing business?

122
00:10:43,964 --> 00:10:45,124
Working in all weathers,

123
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:46,403
illnesses and ailments

124
00:10:47,043 --> 00:10:47,643
are normal.

125
00:10:50,204 --> 00:10:51,084
Seems like

126
00:10:51,563 --> 00:10:53,643
Ms. Lin hasn't funded
your education or business

127
00:10:53,643 --> 00:10:55,484
entirely for charity.

128
00:10:55,883 --> 00:10:57,163
You apply what you've learned.

129
00:11:02,124 --> 00:11:03,403
Aren't you from Roadsound too?

130
00:11:04,683 --> 00:11:05,364
What?

131
00:11:05,923 --> 00:11:07,763
Are you turning in your own?

132
00:11:10,163 --> 00:11:11,763
Now you accept me as your own?

133
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,803
Weren't you guarding against me earlier?

134
00:11:19,964 --> 00:11:21,124
What do you want?

135
00:11:22,244 --> 00:11:23,124
What's with you?

136
00:11:24,004 --> 00:11:25,324
After all these years, what now?

137
00:11:25,403 --> 00:11:26,923
You came all this way to expose me?

138
00:11:30,403 --> 00:11:32,844
Fine. If you truly consider me your own,

139
00:11:34,604 --> 00:11:35,403
examine me.

140
00:11:41,484 --> 00:11:42,883
I got injured from a hiking fall.

141
00:11:50,964 --> 00:11:53,204
Yes. It doesn't look
like hiking injuries.

142
00:11:53,444 --> 00:11:54,204
No questions.

143
00:11:54,484 --> 00:11:55,724
Just find me a resting place.

144
00:11:59,683 --> 00:12:01,163
It's definitely from hiking.

145
00:12:02,043 --> 00:12:02,923
I can tell.

146
00:12:03,324 --> 00:12:03,923
Stop that.

147
00:12:04,484 --> 00:12:05,124
After you.

148
00:13:23,964 --> 00:13:25,403
Why did you leave Jiang here?

149
00:13:27,563 --> 00:13:28,883
It was urgent,

150
00:13:29,563 --> 00:13:30,803
and he insisted on staying.

151
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:32,244
So I didn't argue...

152
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:33,523
But you should've insisted too.

153
00:13:36,364 --> 00:13:37,204
I'm sorry, Luo.

154
00:13:38,043 --> 00:13:39,124
It's my mistake.

155
00:13:56,084 --> 00:13:56,883
If

156
00:13:58,124 --> 00:13:59,283
I had stayed to cover

157
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:02,244
and gotten captured instead,

158
00:14:05,043 --> 00:14:06,444
would you be blaming Jiang

159
00:14:07,563 --> 00:14:08,683
the way you are now?

160
00:14:47,004 --> 00:14:47,923
Laobanzhang Tea,

161
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:49,604
an ancient tree tea.

162
00:14:58,484 --> 00:14:59,163
You people

163
00:15:00,563 --> 00:15:01,364
know tea?

164
00:15:02,724 --> 00:15:04,403
With millennia of tea culture,

165
00:15:04,763 --> 00:15:07,004
we newcomers wouldn't claim expertise.

166
00:15:08,084 --> 00:15:09,604
Yet you presume mastery.

167
00:15:10,124 --> 00:15:11,444
With history merely a blink

168
00:15:11,643 --> 00:15:14,004
in the eyes of heaven and earth,

169
00:15:14,724 --> 00:15:17,124
how dare you pose as nature's overlords?

170
00:15:20,844 --> 00:15:22,803
Arrogance didn't bring humanity

171
00:15:22,803 --> 00:15:23,844
to its current state.

172
00:15:25,283 --> 00:15:27,364
Most of our progress

173
00:15:27,763 --> 00:15:30,803
comes from exploration, curiosity,

174
00:15:31,004 --> 00:15:32,283
and constant error correction,

175
00:15:32,283 --> 00:15:32,844
and yes,

176
00:15:34,324 --> 00:15:35,283
some luck.

177
00:15:36,324 --> 00:15:37,964
That's how we've achieved this.

178
00:15:38,364 --> 00:15:39,484
If you just imitate us

179
00:15:39,763 --> 00:15:42,964
without understanding,

180
00:15:44,563 --> 00:15:46,204
you'll stumble through endless detours.

181
00:15:48,523 --> 00:15:51,724
So how did
the South Mountain Hunters decline

182
00:15:52,124 --> 00:15:53,004
to this state?

183
00:15:53,844 --> 00:15:54,604
Underestimation?

184
00:15:55,364 --> 00:15:56,043
Complacency?

185
00:15:56,084 --> 00:15:57,283
Or fractured organization?

186
00:16:01,324 --> 00:16:03,643
Once the Blade, Hound, and Whip clans

187
00:16:03,643 --> 00:16:05,563
worked seamlessly together.

188
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:08,324
Yet this time,

189
00:16:09,004 --> 00:16:11,124
only Mad Dog fought seriously.

190
00:16:12,364 --> 00:16:15,444
When will we see the Whip Clan

191
00:16:16,523 --> 00:16:17,883
and Blade Clan's prowess?

192
00:16:25,643 --> 00:16:26,683
Do you feel sorry?

193
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:33,004
I'd say

194
00:16:33,484 --> 00:16:34,803
you should be grateful.

195
00:16:35,803 --> 00:16:38,324
Had you encountered all three,
Ghost Whip,

196
00:16:38,844 --> 00:16:39,523
Mad Dog,

197
00:16:40,043 --> 00:16:40,883
and Mad Blade,

198
00:16:41,964 --> 00:16:43,484
you wouldn't live to see the sun.

199
00:16:43,604 --> 00:16:44,724
No need to summon them.

200
00:16:45,283 --> 00:16:47,004
I'll visit them myself.

201
00:16:47,163 --> 00:16:49,244
So Mr. Jiang,

202
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:52,283
please reveal Mad Blade's identity.

203
00:16:53,643 --> 00:16:55,084
Or you won't live to see

204
00:16:55,084 --> 00:16:56,604
tonight's moon.

205
00:17:00,084 --> 00:17:02,163
So this tea meeting is about this?

206
00:17:03,043 --> 00:17:04,123
Should've said so earlier.

207
00:17:06,523 --> 00:17:08,283
Our generation's Mad Blade
was Old Blade.

208
00:17:08,884 --> 00:17:10,323
You've already fought him.

209
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:12,684
He was

210
00:17:13,884 --> 00:17:15,123
badly wounded by him.

211
00:17:18,763 --> 00:17:19,404
Old Blade!

212
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:54,884
Sir?

213
00:17:54,884 --> 00:17:56,204
What's happening, sir?

214
00:17:57,164 --> 00:17:58,083
Where are we going?

215
00:18:00,323 --> 00:18:01,004
Sir?

216
00:18:04,523 --> 00:18:05,204
Jiang?

217
00:18:07,724 --> 00:18:08,523
You ask me?

218
00:18:09,244 --> 00:18:10,924
I should be questioning you.

219
00:18:11,884 --> 00:18:13,283
Will you rescue me

220
00:18:14,283 --> 00:18:15,283
and my brothers or not?

221
00:18:31,843 --> 00:18:34,843
Jiang! Jiang!

222
00:18:38,164 --> 00:18:38,884
Jiang!

223
00:18:52,404 --> 00:18:53,484
Sir,

224
00:18:54,363 --> 00:18:55,843
I want to change the destination.

225
00:18:56,043 --> 00:18:57,884
The meter's running. It's up to you.

226
00:18:59,724 --> 00:19:01,924
I'm going to South Mountain.
It might be a bit far.

227
00:19:03,363 --> 00:19:05,283
Anywhere within the province is fine.

228
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:15,964
You risked your life

229
00:19:15,964 --> 00:19:17,884
covering your team's retreat.

230
00:19:18,244 --> 00:19:19,964
Now you're suddenly being candid?

231
00:19:20,763 --> 00:19:21,843
How can I trust you?

232
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:39,924
I

233
00:19:42,763 --> 00:19:44,004
am in your custody now.

234
00:19:44,964 --> 00:19:46,684
And we've lost Mad Blade
as our trump card.

235
00:19:47,204 --> 00:19:49,603
There's no reason for me
to bluff with you.

236
00:19:55,644 --> 00:19:56,444
Maybe...

237
00:19:57,843 --> 00:19:59,444
maybe it's just as you said.

238
00:20:00,563 --> 00:20:02,644
The South Mountain Hunters
declined to this state

239
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,843
because of underestimation, complacency,

240
00:20:06,283 --> 00:20:07,563
and fractured organization.

241
00:20:10,964 --> 00:20:12,283
Moreover, my candor

242
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:15,123
is meant to secure
my companions' freedom.

243
00:20:19,244 --> 00:20:21,123
They have their own lives to live.

244
00:20:21,884 --> 00:20:23,523
For them, being South Mountain Hunters

245
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:25,404
is just a job,

246
00:20:26,283 --> 00:20:27,204
not a calling.

I haven't seen Yan Tuo
these past few days.

"Xiong,

250
00:21:01,204 --> 00:21:03,363
I met this girl recently.

251
00:21:03,644 --> 00:21:04,684
Feisty one.

252
00:21:05,043 --> 00:21:06,964
I'm taking her hiking
for a couple of days.

253
00:21:07,523 --> 00:21:08,924
If Ms. Lin asks,

254
00:21:09,043 --> 00:21:10,523
cover for me.

255
00:21:10,724 --> 00:21:12,363
Say I'm on a business trip."

More like South Mountain prey.

263
00:21:50,523 --> 00:21:51,884
Enough talk.

264
00:21:54,283 --> 00:21:56,204
I'll pull seniority to speak first.

265
00:21:57,244 --> 00:21:58,363
With Baichuan gone,

266
00:21:58,363 --> 00:21:59,644
we can't remain leaderless.

267
00:22:00,164 --> 00:22:01,164
The priority

268
00:22:01,444 --> 00:22:02,724
is finding someone to lead.

269
00:22:03,603 --> 00:22:04,444
That should be you.

270
00:22:04,724 --> 00:22:06,283
You're the most senior and respected.

271
00:22:06,724 --> 00:22:07,444
Right, Mr. Crip.

272
00:22:07,924 --> 00:22:08,884
You should lead us.

273
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:10,043
We'd all follow.

274
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:12,244
If I lead,

275
00:22:12,684 --> 00:22:14,323
I won't let us be humiliated like this.

276
00:22:14,644 --> 00:22:16,204
Those inhuman beings,

277

278
00:22:17,644 --> 00:22:18,684

- Great!
- Great!

281
00:22:24,603 --> 00:22:25,204
Great?

282
00:22:27,244 --> 00:22:28,763
Who attacked us?

283
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:30,603
Who are they?

284
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:31,484
Where are they now?

285
00:22:31,523 --> 00:22:32,244
Do you know?

286
00:22:32,924 --> 00:22:33,884
And

287
00:22:34,563 --> 00:22:36,363
which direction should we investigate?

288
00:22:43,843 --> 00:22:45,004
At my age,

289
00:22:46,004 --> 00:22:47,803
I know my limitations.

290
00:22:48,603 --> 00:22:50,684
I'm more temper than talent.

291
00:22:51,404 --> 00:22:52,363
In real crises,

292
00:22:52,724 --> 00:22:55,283
I might not stay calm
like you youngsters.

293
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,363
So I can't lead.

294
00:22:58,964 --> 00:23:00,123
But if you

295
00:23:00,244 --> 00:23:01,803
truly respect me as your elder,

296
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:04,004
I'll name someone.

297
00:23:19,563 --> 00:23:20,484
Xing Shen

298
00:23:20,884 --> 00:23:22,283
has lived here for years

299
00:23:23,603 --> 00:23:25,603
and knows South Mountain
better than any of us.

300
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:27,843
I watched him grow up.

301
00:23:28,444 --> 00:23:29,563
Everything he does

302
00:23:30,004 --> 00:23:32,004
prioritizes the Hunters' interests

303
00:23:32,004 --> 00:23:33,004
above all else.

304
00:23:34,724 --> 00:23:36,763
With Mad Blade and Ghost Whip gone,

305
00:23:37,563 --> 00:23:39,563
Mad Dog should naturally lead.

306
00:23:41,204 --> 00:23:43,004
Someone who kept an Earth Fiend
leading us?

307
00:23:43,724 --> 00:23:45,283
It's like a rat among the cats' ranks.

308
00:23:45,763 --> 00:23:46,763
I don't know about you,

309
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:48,083
but this disgusts me.

310
00:23:48,484 --> 00:23:49,323
About that matter,

311
00:23:49,484 --> 00:23:51,043
Jiang already concluded it

312
00:23:51,043 --> 00:23:52,164
with proper resolution.

313
00:23:52,843 --> 00:23:55,043
Hadn't that Earth Fiend
appeared that day,

314
00:23:55,563 --> 00:23:56,803
disrupting the enemy's plans,

315
00:23:57,244 --> 00:23:58,724
we'd have suffered heavier losses.

316
00:23:58,843 --> 00:24:00,244
Since when did that fiend help?

317
00:24:00,323 --> 00:24:00,884
Exactly.

318
00:24:00,884 --> 00:24:01,644
I think...

319
00:24:02,404 --> 00:24:03,603
We need long-term planning.

320
00:24:03,603 --> 00:24:04,924
Enough arguing.

321
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:13,843
Let's vote then.

322
00:24:16,523 --> 00:24:19,603
I agree Xing Shen
should lead temporarily.

323
00:24:20,004 --> 00:24:20,884
Show of hands.

324
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:39,763
Shen will help us all.

325
00:24:41,763 --> 00:24:43,204
Ma trusts him.

326
00:24:43,644 --> 00:24:44,803
Ma trusts in Shen.

327
00:24:47,123 --> 00:24:47,924
In the past,

328
00:24:49,724 --> 00:24:51,803
Mom trusted Shen too.

329
00:25:18,724 --> 00:25:21,404
The ink line on wood becomes the rule.

330
00:25:21,924 --> 00:25:22,964
It's majority support.

331
00:25:23,323 --> 00:25:23,803
Done.

332
00:25:28,004 --> 00:25:29,484
South Mountain is in your hands now.

333
00:25:33,644 --> 00:25:34,803
Don't let me down.

334
00:26:09,043 --> 00:26:10,404
Thank you for your trust.

335
00:26:11,244 --> 00:26:12,323
I'll

336
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:15,484
temporarily take Jiang's position.

337
00:26:16,043 --> 00:26:18,603
I've contacted Ghost Whip and Mad Blade.

338
00:26:19,404 --> 00:26:21,043
They've confirmed participation.

339
00:26:22,724 --> 00:26:24,444
With unity,

340
00:26:24,803 --> 00:26:26,803
we'll rescue Jiang quickly.

341
00:26:27,763 --> 00:26:28,724
Ghost Whip is one thing,

342
00:26:28,724 --> 00:26:29,444
but Mad Blade

343
00:26:30,164 --> 00:26:32,484
was difficult even when Jiang led us.

344
00:26:33,004 --> 00:26:33,964
Will she come?

345
00:26:35,043 --> 00:26:35,644
Right.

346
00:26:39,244 --> 00:26:40,004
She will.

347
00:26:45,763 --> 00:26:46,763
It's fine.

348
00:26:47,004 --> 00:26:48,123
Don't worry.

349
00:26:49,603 --> 00:26:51,083
You've worked hard these years.

350
00:26:52,283 --> 00:26:53,404
Spend time with family.

351
00:26:54,724 --> 00:26:55,924
In these peaceful times,

352
00:26:56,004 --> 00:26:57,123
what could go wrong?

353
00:26:57,323 --> 00:26:57,924
Right?

354
00:26:58,323 --> 00:26:59,484
Even if trouble comes,

355
00:26:59,724 --> 00:27:01,964
Banya Mountain and Qiaotou Gully

356
00:27:02,444 --> 00:27:04,603
have sent reinforcements recently.

357
00:27:05,803 --> 00:27:07,603
You just rest another fortnight.

358
00:27:08,123 --> 00:27:08,964
We got this.

359
00:27:10,763 --> 00:27:11,803
No need.

360
00:27:12,724 --> 00:27:14,684
I just check on the mountains
once in a while.

361
00:27:15,563 --> 00:27:16,363
Stop worrying.

362
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:19,843
Alright, it's settled then.

363
00:27:20,004 --> 00:27:20,603
I need to go.

364
00:27:25,523 --> 00:27:27,164
Why not recruit your team

365
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:28,884
to join us?

366
00:27:29,924 --> 00:27:31,523
At least we'd look formidable.

367
00:27:32,123 --> 00:27:33,444
Might scare others.

368
00:27:38,363 --> 00:27:39,684
Can't even shut you up with food?

369
00:27:41,964 --> 00:27:43,763
'Peaceful times'?

370
00:27:44,444 --> 00:27:45,123
What's wrong?

371
00:27:45,283 --> 00:27:47,083
Having food is peace.

372
00:27:48,763 --> 00:27:50,763
But some can't eat anymore.

373
00:27:51,884 --> 00:27:53,843
Sun Zhou is starving himself.

374
00:27:54,763 --> 00:27:55,283
Really?

375
00:27:57,043 --> 00:27:58,083
He's been refusing meals,

376
00:27:58,083 --> 00:28:00,004
saying cooked food disgusts him.

377
00:28:00,283 --> 00:28:01,763
I think it's time.

378
00:28:04,043 --> 00:28:05,763
I need to check on him.

379
00:28:06,244 --> 00:28:07,763
We already have one Earth Fiend.

380
00:28:07,924 --> 00:28:10,004
Can't handle another biter.

381
00:29:14,644 --> 00:29:15,444
Today,

382
00:29:19,283 --> 00:29:20,363
I spoke harshly.

383
00:29:20,363 --> 00:29:22,083
I should've stayed behind

384
00:29:23,404 --> 00:29:25,323
instead of letting Jiang take the risk.

385
00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:33,164
No one expected

386
00:29:33,684 --> 00:29:34,763
that situation.

387
00:29:35,283 --> 00:29:36,244
It's not your fault.

388
00:29:38,884 --> 00:29:40,083
Besides apologizing,

389
00:29:41,164 --> 00:29:42,323
I want to say

390
00:29:43,684 --> 00:29:44,724
I have a friend

391
00:29:45,484 --> 00:29:47,164
who might help rescue Jiang.

392
00:29:48,283 --> 00:29:49,083
But

393
00:29:50,924 --> 00:29:52,004
it's risky.

394
00:29:54,164 --> 00:29:54,843
A friend?

395
00:29:56,004 --> 00:29:57,244
Sun Zhou's gone!

396
00:29:57,684 --> 00:29:58,924
Sun Zhou's gone!

397
00:30:21,484 --> 00:30:22,484
All this time,

398
00:30:22,684 --> 00:30:23,924
Sun Zhou has been locked up?

399
00:30:26,563 --> 00:30:28,283
He has red threads through his pupils.

400
00:30:29,523 --> 00:30:31,404
We should've sent him to Golden Gate,

401
00:30:32,123 --> 00:30:33,603
but Jiang stopped us.

402
00:30:38,563 --> 00:30:40,924
I begged Jiang to save him.

403
00:30:45,444 --> 00:30:46,884
You're too softhearted.

404
00:30:48,523 --> 00:30:50,043
It's South Mountain Hunters' duty

405
00:30:50,404 --> 00:30:51,563
to protect civilians

406
00:30:51,563 --> 00:30:52,684
from Earth Fiends.

407
00:30:53,363 --> 00:30:54,523
How's that softhearted?

408
00:30:58,083 --> 00:31:00,043
We called you 'Nine Oxen' as kids.

409
00:31:00,763 --> 00:31:01,523
Do you remember?

410
00:31:06,803 --> 00:31:07,803
I'd forgotten.

411
00:31:09,563 --> 00:31:10,684
Jiang said

412
00:31:11,444 --> 00:31:13,004
you seem obedient,

413
00:31:14,283 --> 00:31:15,603
yet stand firmest.

414
00:31:17,043 --> 00:31:18,004
Not even nine oxen

415
00:31:19,363 --> 00:31:20,684
can turn you from your course.

416
00:31:23,563 --> 00:31:24,404
If we delay,

417
00:31:24,684 --> 00:31:26,043
even nine horses won't catch him.

418
00:31:26,644 --> 00:31:27,244
Sit tight.

419
00:31:35,843 --> 00:31:37,323
How'd you track Sun Zhou?

420
00:31:37,644 --> 00:31:38,924
He stole Big Head's phone

421
00:31:38,924 --> 00:31:40,244
while escaping.

422
00:31:41,164 --> 00:31:42,244
It has GPS.

423
00:31:43,763 --> 00:31:45,523
Jiang's phone doesn't?

424
00:31:47,123 --> 00:31:48,363
Big Head uses the rescue team's

425
00:31:48,363 --> 00:31:49,684
dedicated tracking system.

426
00:31:54,123 --> 00:31:55,404
Maybe we didn't need it before.

427
00:31:56,684 --> 00:31:58,843
Let's get everyone equipped
in the future.

428
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:04,404
Given his movement speed,

429
00:32:04,803 --> 00:32:05,763
let's go faster.

430
00:32:34,123 --> 00:32:35,043
I'm back.

431
00:32:37,644 --> 00:32:38,763
It's too remote here.

432
00:32:39,283 --> 00:32:40,563
This was all I could get.

433
00:32:41,244 --> 00:32:43,644
Make do with this for now.

434
00:32:48,523 --> 00:32:49,244
(Cang Water)
Have some water.

435
00:32:55,924 --> 00:32:56,724
What are you doing?

436
00:33:05,523 --> 00:33:06,484
Are you in trouble?

437
00:33:07,563 --> 00:33:10,444
You came alone to this wilderness,

438
00:33:11,484 --> 00:33:13,404
saying you were hiding at your uncle's.

439
00:33:19,204 --> 00:33:20,283
Let me go.

440
00:33:21,563 --> 00:33:22,684
I'll get mad.

441
00:33:42,244 --> 00:33:43,204
Let me go.

442
00:34:36,243 --> 00:34:38,163
She's fine, no bites.

443
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:39,312
I'll get her to hospital.

444
00:34:40,844 --> 00:34:42,163
I'll take Sun Zhou back then.

445
00:34:43,804 --> 00:34:45,523
He's innocent.
He just got dragged into it.

446
00:34:46,243 --> 00:34:47,163
Try to help him.

447
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:50,844
I will.

448
00:36:43,964 --> 00:36:45,924
(Nie Jiuluo: 9:00, Spring Return Road)

449
00:36:51,203 --> 00:36:54,243
(Just saw it. On my way now,)

450
00:36:54,243 --> 00:36:56,563
(but I'll be a few minutes late.)

451
00:37:08,804 --> 00:37:09,643
Miss Nie,

452
00:37:09,643 --> 00:37:11,083
breakfast will be ready soon.

453
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:12,884
Miss Nie?

454
00:37:13,243 --> 00:37:14,203
Ms. Lu, you have it.

455
00:37:14,203 --> 00:37:15,163
I need to go out.

456
00:37:15,324 --> 00:37:17,083
Leaving again right after coming back?

457
00:37:18,364 --> 00:37:20,043
Don't young people today ever sleep?

458
00:37:35,444 --> 00:37:36,203
He left so early?

459
00:37:38,444 --> 00:37:39,764
Do you want me to call and check?

460
00:37:41,804 --> 00:37:42,924
Leave him for now.

461
00:38:15,324 --> 00:38:17,683
No beating around the bush today, okay?

462
00:38:22,563 --> 00:38:23,404
You look exhausted.

463
00:38:23,643 --> 00:38:25,004
Skip the formalities too.

464
00:38:25,364 --> 00:38:26,203
No small talk.

465
00:38:27,484 --> 00:38:28,563
Alright, go ahead.

466
00:38:31,563 --> 00:38:34,284
Someone named Jiang Baichuan
was captured by Lin Xirou.

467
00:38:35,203 --> 00:38:37,043
He's crucial
to the South Mountain Hunters.

468
00:38:37,404 --> 00:38:38,723
And to me too.

469
00:38:39,643 --> 00:38:41,123
I hope you can help me rescue him.

470
00:38:41,924 --> 00:38:42,523
Of course,

471
00:38:42,523 --> 00:38:43,884
you might not be able to help.

472
00:38:43,884 --> 00:38:45,163
Okay, I'll help you.

473
00:38:46,683 --> 00:38:47,364
You will?

474
00:38:48,683 --> 00:38:49,444
So straightforward?

475
00:38:50,563 --> 00:38:51,563
Wasn't it you who said,

476
00:38:51,563 --> 00:38:53,123
'No beating around the bush'?

477
00:38:56,683 --> 00:38:57,683
I did say that.

478
00:38:57,924 --> 00:38:59,203
But you didn't ask anything.

479
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:00,683
Isn't that rash?

480
00:39:02,324 --> 00:39:03,484
You contacted me proactively.

481
00:39:03,563 --> 00:39:05,404
It shows the situation is urgent.

482
00:39:06,404 --> 00:39:07,964
You asked me for help.

483
00:39:07,964 --> 00:39:10,203
It means he's very important to you.

484
00:39:10,404 --> 00:39:11,844
If I help with this,

485
00:39:12,243 --> 00:39:13,364
at least I'll gain a chance

486
00:39:13,364 --> 00:39:14,404
to ask for your help.

487
00:39:15,804 --> 00:39:17,404
Moreover, if I successfully rescue him,

488
00:39:17,404 --> 00:39:19,364
you'll owe me a huge favor.

489
00:39:19,444 --> 00:39:20,484
Therefore,

490
00:39:20,484 --> 00:39:22,563
helping you
is my best option either way.

491
00:39:23,123 --> 00:39:24,444
Still think I'm being rash now?

492
00:39:25,203 --> 00:39:26,563
I won't owe you favors.

493
00:39:26,804 --> 00:39:27,683
I'll pay you.

494
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:34,603
Wait,

495
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:36,563
I'm helping you with a huge favor.

496
00:39:36,563 --> 00:39:37,804
