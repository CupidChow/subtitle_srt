(Unknown Caller)

18
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:10,376
We can cooperate.

19
00:02:10,935 --> 00:02:11,696
How?

20
00:02:11,895 --> 00:02:13,536
I've had people verify

21
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:15,976
the Earth Fiend info you gave me.

22
00:02:17,376 --> 00:02:19,215
Once we gather sufficient intel,

23
00:02:20,935 --> 00:02:22,416
we'll make concrete plans.

24
00:02:22,856 --> 00:02:24,335
What else do I need to do?

25
00:02:25,296 --> 00:02:26,055
To wait

26
00:02:27,096 --> 00:02:27,856
and cooperate.

27
00:02:28,895 --> 00:02:30,335
Don't cause further trouble.

28
00:02:30,895 --> 00:02:32,296
After each call ends,

29
00:02:32,296 --> 00:02:34,055
I'll give you a new number.

30
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,215
For any emergencies,

31
00:02:37,576 --> 00:02:38,976
inform me immediately.

32
00:02:52,144 --> 00:02:53,838
(Yan Tuo)

33
00:02:58,416 --> 00:02:59,016
Hello.

34
00:02:59,136 --> 00:03:00,055
Xing Shen agreed.

35
00:03:03,256 --> 00:03:04,096
That's great.

36
00:03:05,136 --> 00:03:05,856
Thanks.

37
00:03:06,615 --> 00:03:08,655
Why do you thank me?

38
00:03:09,895 --> 00:03:11,096
Without you,

39
00:03:11,215 --> 00:03:12,455
they'd never have trusted me.

40
00:03:15,016 --> 00:03:16,335
Let me ask you.

41
00:03:17,055 --> 00:03:18,455
If one day,

42
00:03:18,655 --> 00:03:20,376
all these issues get properly resolved,

43
00:03:21,215 --> 00:03:22,615
what would you do?

44
00:03:24,976 --> 00:03:26,136
What a tough question.

45
00:03:26,735 --> 00:03:27,935
I never thought about it.

46
00:03:28,615 --> 00:03:29,935
Or,

47
00:03:30,856 --> 00:03:31,615
I never dared.

48
00:03:31,976 --> 00:03:33,136
Then think about it now.

49
00:03:39,495 --> 00:03:40,816
I think

50
00:03:41,935 --> 00:03:43,175
being like you would be nice.

51
00:03:44,296 --> 00:03:45,096
How am I?

52
00:03:45,576 --> 00:03:47,655
Having your own small world,

53
00:03:48,136 --> 00:03:50,536
and doing what you love peacefully.

54
00:03:50,775 --> 00:03:52,576
To grow some plants

55
00:03:52,696 --> 00:03:53,495
and pet cats.

56
00:03:54,175 --> 00:03:56,536
So your inner world is so peaceful.

57
00:03:57,136 --> 00:03:57,856
Exactly.

58
00:03:58,615 --> 00:04:00,935
Actually, you get bored
living in a big villa,

59
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:02,775
and now covet my small courtyard.

60
00:04:03,615 --> 00:04:04,615
I'll get you one.

61
00:04:06,335 --> 00:04:07,495
You are so generous.

62
00:04:08,935 --> 00:04:10,136
I'll mold you a clay version.

63
00:04:10,215 --> 00:04:11,615
Just look at it when you crave one.

64
00:04:12,536 --> 00:04:13,256
Fine.

65
00:04:13,495 --> 00:04:14,895
At least it's an artwork.

66
00:04:15,016 --> 00:04:15,935
Not a bad deal.

67
00:04:22,415 --> 00:04:23,095
Alright.

68
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:25,855
Talk later. Bye then.

69
00:04:34,176 --> 00:04:35,576
Ms. Lin. You startled me.

70
00:04:35,736 --> 00:04:36,855
When did you get here?

71
00:04:42,295 --> 00:04:43,016
What's wrong?

72
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,256
Do you need something?

73
00:04:44,855 --> 00:04:46,295
Same girl as last time?

74
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:50,016
Net friend.

75
00:04:50,095 --> 00:04:51,056
Just chatting.

76
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,335
Never realized

77
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:54,816
you were so attractive to girls.

78
00:04:56,215 --> 00:04:57,295
What's wrong?

79
00:04:58,136 --> 00:04:59,136
Feeling guilty

80
00:04:59,376 --> 00:05:01,215
for only worrying
about Lin Ling's marriage,

81
00:05:01,215 --> 00:05:01,936
and now,

82
00:05:01,936 --> 00:05:03,056
you're anxious about me?

83
00:05:03,775 --> 00:05:04,576
No need.

84
00:05:05,376 --> 00:05:06,696
You meet important people.

85
00:05:07,295 --> 00:05:08,895
You must know many quality girls.

86
00:05:09,016 --> 00:05:10,095
Just make a match.

87
00:05:10,095 --> 00:05:11,660
I'll be more cooperative than Lin Ling.

88
00:05:15,095 --> 00:05:16,736
A beautiful,

89
00:05:17,736 --> 00:05:19,176
cultured

90
00:05:20,455 --> 00:05:23,335
and independent artist.

91
00:05:23,936 --> 00:05:25,335
I don't know

92
00:05:25,335 --> 00:05:27,376
any better girls than this.

93
00:05:29,256 --> 00:05:31,455
This girl is perfect

94
00:05:31,975 --> 00:05:33,496
and pleasing in every way.

95
00:05:34,415 --> 00:05:35,775
Except one thing

96
00:05:36,016 --> 00:05:37,415
I'm not assuring.

97
00:05:38,895 --> 00:05:40,256
Her background.

98
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,627
(Nie Jiuluo's Island)

99
00:05:52,376 --> 00:05:52,975
Hey, you.

100
00:05:54,095 --> 00:05:54,895
Did it on purpose?

101
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:56,535
What do you mean?

102
00:05:57,455 --> 00:05:58,056
Come on.

103
00:05:58,975 --> 00:05:59,655
Stop pretending.

104
00:06:00,855 --> 00:06:02,176
Roadsound Group

105
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:03,576
called me today,

106
00:06:04,576 --> 00:06:05,975
and requested you

107
00:06:07,016 --> 00:06:09,335
to create large sculptures

108
00:06:09,895 --> 00:06:11,295
for display in their compound.

109
00:06:12,256 --> 00:06:13,215
Roadsound Group?

110
00:06:13,936 --> 00:06:15,256
Ms. Lin, to be honest,

111
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:17,576
many girls

112
00:06:17,655 --> 00:06:18,616
pursue me.

113
00:06:18,855 --> 00:06:20,415
But this artist girl

114
00:06:20,496 --> 00:06:22,136
plays hard-to-get

115
00:06:22,335 --> 00:06:23,455
and catches my attention.

116
00:06:24,376 --> 00:06:25,895
Thought I could've won her over

117
00:06:25,895 --> 00:06:27,616
after one night together.

118
00:06:27,895 --> 00:06:29,264
But I got too drunk that night

119
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:30,264
and said something wrong.

120
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:32,335
The next day, she just blocked me.

121
00:06:32,696 --> 00:06:34,256
Now I can't even reach out to her.

122
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:35,975
Forget it. Doesn't matter.

123
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:37,616
Since childhood,

124
00:06:38,095 --> 00:06:39,816
you can always get

125
00:06:40,016 --> 00:06:41,215
whatever you want.

126
00:06:41,775 --> 00:06:43,895
I can't stand seeing you
wronged like this.

127
00:06:44,176 --> 00:06:45,936
Don't worry. There are plenty of girls.

128
00:06:45,936 --> 00:06:46,816
You can make a match.

129
00:06:47,535 --> 00:06:48,455
All set.

130
00:06:49,415 --> 00:06:50,256
Her then.

131
00:06:52,016 --> 00:06:53,215
Lin Xirou, CEO of the group,

132
00:06:53,696 --> 00:06:54,895
invited you

133
00:06:55,455 --> 00:06:57,256
to their family dinner.

134
00:06:57,975 --> 00:06:59,455
Remember, it's a family dinner.

135
00:07:00,376 --> 00:07:01,576
I've already invited her.

136
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:02,535
What do you mean?

137
00:07:02,535 --> 00:07:03,616
Invited her?

138
00:07:03,696 --> 00:07:04,855
Lin Xirou

139
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,295
invited me to dinner?

140
00:07:08,056 --> 00:07:09,256
I'll meet her.

141
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:11,215
Mad Hound.

142
00:07:11,576 --> 00:07:12,655
Mad Hound, right.

143
00:07:13,056 --> 00:07:14,535
Curator of the Mad Hound Art Gallery.

144
00:07:15,376 --> 00:07:16,215
Did it on purpose?

145
00:07:17,215 --> 00:07:18,576
Before, I connected you

146
00:07:18,576 --> 00:07:19,895
with Mr. Yan, the heir.

147
00:07:20,095 --> 00:07:22,176
And he connected you
with Lin Xirou, his mother.

148
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:24,616
You have to one-up me, right?

149
00:07:24,975 --> 00:07:25,816
If it works,

150
00:07:26,176 --> 00:07:27,376
I'll play matchmaker.

151
00:07:27,936 --> 00:07:28,936
If it doesn't work,

152
00:07:29,576 --> 00:07:31,736
I will definitely vent your anger

153
00:07:33,376 --> 00:07:34,576
for you.

154
00:07:38,535 --> 00:07:39,335
Great!

155
00:07:39,616 --> 00:07:40,295
Thanks, Ms. Lin.

156
00:07:41,016 --> 00:07:41,576
Go.

157
00:07:42,215 --> 00:07:43,016
You must go.

158
00:07:43,775 --> 00:07:46,056
I want to see whether that Mad Hound

159
00:07:46,095 --> 00:07:48,736
can seal the deal
for you without my help.

160
00:08:09,496 --> 00:08:11,736
The dumplings and wontons
are frozen in the fridge.

161
00:08:12,095 --> 00:08:13,535
And a marinated beef

162
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:14,936
is in the chiller.

163
00:08:14,975 --> 00:08:16,736
Slice it when you want to eat.

164
00:08:17,256 --> 00:08:18,936
I've cleaned the two fish Mr. Lu brought

165
00:08:18,936 --> 00:08:20,256
last time.

166
00:08:20,496 --> 00:08:22,056
You might feel troublesome to cook,

167
00:08:22,056 --> 00:08:23,095
so just keep them frozen.

168
00:08:23,496 --> 00:08:24,655
There are eggs.

169
00:08:24,936 --> 00:08:26,655
But I didn't stock many vegetables.

170
00:08:26,855 --> 00:08:28,496
Fresh ones are better.

171
00:08:28,696 --> 00:08:30,295
Mark my words.

172
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:33,175
Eat less takeout

173
00:08:33,175 --> 00:08:34,575
and instant noodles.

174
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:37,895
I'll wash the clothes,
bedsheets, and towels

175
00:08:38,336 --> 00:08:39,655
when I'm back.

176
00:08:42,096 --> 00:08:42,856
Miss Nie.

177
00:08:43,616 --> 00:08:44,496
Happy New Year.

178
00:08:46,535 --> 00:08:47,775
Happy New Year, Ms. Lu.

179
00:08:48,175 --> 00:08:49,456
Enjoy the time with your family.

180
00:08:50,055 --> 00:08:50,655
Leaving.

181
00:09:20,775 --> 00:09:22,216
They got the hotel

182
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:23,895
surveillance footage

183
00:09:23,895 --> 00:09:25,016
when we were in Heyang.

184
00:09:25,695 --> 00:09:27,775
Then she knew about me

185
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:31,496
and invited me through Lu for dinner.

186
00:09:32,136 --> 00:09:32,895
My bad.

187
00:09:33,895 --> 00:09:35,775
I was careless. Sorry.

188
00:09:39,096 --> 00:09:41,096
Who could've known
Lin Xirou would check there?

189
00:09:42,736 --> 00:09:44,016
Now we need to figure out

190
00:09:44,136 --> 00:09:45,456
how much she knows

191
00:09:45,695 --> 00:09:46,736
and what she suspects.

192
00:09:51,695 --> 00:09:53,415
If I don't go meet her,

193
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,096
how can I figure it out?

194
00:09:59,055 --> 00:09:59,935
You would go?

195
00:10:01,256 --> 00:10:02,976
Since she found out about me,

196
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:04,376
then she could come to my place

197
00:10:04,376 --> 00:10:05,376
any time.

198
00:10:06,376 --> 00:10:07,096
If I go,

199
00:10:07,456 --> 00:10:09,096
we don't know what'd happen.

200
00:10:10,256 --> 00:10:11,295
But if I don't go,

201
00:10:11,336 --> 00:10:12,895
it shows we're guilty

202
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:14,616
and suspicious.

203
00:10:16,736 --> 00:10:18,496
I'll choose the better option.

204
00:10:19,295 --> 00:10:19,976
If I go,

205
00:10:21,336 --> 00:10:22,616
at least there's a chance.

206
00:10:23,616 --> 00:10:24,175
No.

207
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,175
Absolutely not.

208
00:10:26,256 --> 00:10:27,496
You find somewhere to hide.

209
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,216
Join the South Mountain Hunters.

210
00:10:32,935 --> 00:10:34,096
I can hide,

211
00:10:34,695 --> 00:10:36,136
but what about you?

212
00:10:36,895 --> 00:10:38,575
That'd make all our previous efforts

213
00:10:38,575 --> 00:10:40,415
and risks go in vain.

214
00:10:52,336 --> 00:10:53,535
Are you sure?

215
00:10:54,216 --> 00:10:55,655
If you take this step,

216
00:10:56,096 --> 00:10:57,535
there's no turning back.

217
00:10:58,456 --> 00:10:59,856
For Lin Xirou,

218
00:11:00,616 --> 00:11:02,376
this is also a risky move.

219
00:11:03,055 --> 00:11:05,256
Isn't she worried we'll just

220
00:11:05,736 --> 00:11:06,815
take her life?

221
00:11:15,456 --> 00:11:16,856
I don't want you to go,

222
00:11:17,895 --> 00:11:18,935
but if you insist,

223
00:11:20,775 --> 00:11:21,895
I'll go with you.

224
00:11:29,496 --> 00:11:30,895
I'll tell Xing Shen

225
00:11:31,415 --> 00:11:33,016
that if anything happens to us,

226
00:11:34,775 --> 00:11:35,695
he should immediately

227
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,415
start to capture
those four Earth Fiends.

228
00:11:38,336 --> 00:11:39,016
Alright.

229
00:11:43,376 --> 00:11:44,336
Coming back from Heyang,

230
00:11:44,815 --> 00:11:46,336
we've always been separate.

231
00:11:47,575 --> 00:11:48,496
Anyway,

232
00:11:49,655 --> 00:11:51,175
we can fight side by side again.

233
00:11:57,655 --> 00:11:59,456
How did you tell Lin Xirou

234
00:11:59,456 --> 00:12:00,695
about our relationship?

235
00:12:02,136 --> 00:12:03,216
We're lovers.

236
00:12:05,055 --> 00:12:06,096
But I hurt you,

237
00:12:06,655 --> 00:12:07,695
so you ignored me.

238
00:12:10,415 --> 00:12:11,256
Lovers?

239
00:12:12,295 --> 00:12:12,895
Exactly.

240
00:12:14,016 --> 00:12:14,976
I thought

241
00:12:15,216 --> 00:12:16,655
I should tell a lie

242
00:12:16,655 --> 00:12:18,016
that has room for any excuses.

243
00:12:20,976 --> 00:12:22,616
A lie?

244
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,256
So we aren't lovers?

245
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:26,136
Right.

246
00:12:35,256 --> 00:12:37,415
Do you mean it's not a lie,

247
00:12:38,415 --> 00:12:39,535
but a truth?

248
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:19,535
I wish it were a truth.

249
00:13:45,815 --> 00:13:46,815
Miss Nie, please.

250
00:14:11,856 --> 00:14:13,976
No, thanks. It's a bit cold.

251
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:15,976
Then...

252
00:14:19,376 --> 00:14:20,175
Thank you.

253
00:14:33,575 --> 00:14:34,616
Welcome, Miss Nie.

254
00:14:35,456 --> 00:14:36,575
Hello, Ms. Lin.

255
00:14:38,895 --> 00:14:39,815
Hi.

256
00:14:41,496 --> 00:14:43,815
Ms. Lin, may I ask

257
00:14:44,295 --> 00:14:45,856
you invited me here today

258
00:14:45,895 --> 00:14:47,655
for my artwork

259
00:14:48,415 --> 00:14:50,575
or as a front for someone?

260
00:14:51,295 --> 00:14:52,136
Don't misunderstand.

261
00:14:52,736 --> 00:14:54,736
It's my mother who invited you here.

262
00:14:54,815 --> 00:14:56,096
I wasn't informed beforehand.

263
00:14:56,815 --> 00:14:58,016
If my presence

264
00:14:58,175 --> 00:14:59,376
will ruin your appetite

265
00:14:59,376 --> 00:15:01,216
or even jeopardize your collaboration,

266
00:15:01,216 --> 00:15:02,256
I can excuse myself.

267
00:15:04,295 --> 00:15:05,175
Go inside.

268
00:15:05,736 --> 00:15:06,655
We'll talk over dinner.

269
00:15:33,415 --> 00:15:34,376
Let me introduce you.

270
00:15:35,256 --> 00:15:37,655
Feng Mi,
a toxicology researcher from R&D.

271
00:15:37,695 --> 00:15:39,175
Xiong Hei, quality control manager.

272
00:15:39,695 --> 00:15:41,415
We were in a meeting this afternoon.

273
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:44,175
They heard you'd come

274
00:15:44,175 --> 00:15:45,456
and wanted to meet you.

275
00:15:46,295 --> 00:15:48,136
Such a beautiful artist.

276
00:15:48,336 --> 00:15:50,216
You must sell works very well.

277
00:15:51,815 --> 00:15:53,016
In that case,

278
00:15:53,175 --> 00:15:54,775
Roadsound Group's success

279
00:15:54,775 --> 00:15:56,136
was due to Ms. Lin's beauty?

280
00:15:57,216 --> 00:15:59,055
Miss Nie, you look familiar.

281
00:15:59,935 --> 00:16:01,655
Have we met before?

282
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:02,976
Have we?

283
00:16:05,456 --> 00:16:07,336
I don't socialize much.

284
00:16:07,575 --> 00:16:08,655
Especially

285
00:16:08,655 --> 00:16:09,775
medical big shots like you,

286
00:16:09,775 --> 00:16:11,096
I have no chance to interact.

287
00:16:15,616 --> 00:16:16,256
Glad to see you.

288
00:16:19,695 --> 00:16:20,376
Likewise.

289
00:16:22,336 --> 00:16:24,256
Shall we take a seat
before the flattery?

290
00:16:25,775 --> 00:16:26,415
Please.

291
00:16:44,055 --> 00:16:44,976
A toast

292
00:16:45,736 --> 00:16:46,736
to today's meeting.

293
00:16:47,695 --> 00:16:48,856
Thanks for your invitation.

294
00:17:04,135 --> 00:17:04,815
How is it?

295
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,855
I'm no wine expert,

296
00:17:10,456 --> 00:17:13,575
but I detect floral notes.

297
00:17:14,095 --> 00:17:14,775
Rose?

298
00:17:16,456 --> 00:17:17,575
What a wine expert.

299
00:17:17,976 --> 00:17:19,696
We put carefully chosen oak barrels

300
00:17:19,855 --> 00:17:21,535
in the climate-controlled cellars

301
00:17:21,736 --> 00:17:23,335
for over a decade

302
00:17:23,496 --> 00:17:25,575
just to refine that hint of rose.

303
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,815
Makes this vintage
worth tenfold of new wine.

304
00:17:30,256 --> 00:17:31,416
Worth it.

305
00:17:32,256 --> 00:17:33,896
Between artwork and commodity,

306
00:17:34,256 --> 00:17:36,736
sometimes there's only
a thin line apart.

307
00:17:37,696 --> 00:17:38,976
Yet that very line

308
00:17:39,135 --> 00:17:41,615
is what artists
spend lifetimes pursuing.

309
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:44,375
Well said.

310
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:46,896
Between a wine taster and a drunkard,

311
00:17:47,896 --> 00:17:50,016
reason and nonsense,

312
00:17:50,456 --> 00:17:51,696
there's also a thin line apart.

313
00:17:58,696 --> 00:18:00,216
Miss Nie, you're too refined

314
00:18:00,335 --> 00:18:02,256
for a sculptor.

315
00:18:04,615 --> 00:18:06,216
When I was moving clay alone,

316
00:18:06,216 --> 00:18:07,135
I did regret

317
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:08,815
why I didn't choose painting.

318
00:18:08,936 --> 00:18:10,855
I could've traveled the world sketching.

319
00:18:11,615 --> 00:18:13,416
Why bother confining myself
to the studio

320
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:14,696
covered in dust and grime?

321
00:18:16,976 --> 00:18:18,375
Sculpting

322
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:21,135
requires knives, right?

323
00:18:25,775 --> 00:18:26,456
Yes.

324
00:18:26,936 --> 00:18:28,496
Sculpting knives are the primary tools,

325
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:31,855
but we also use
hammers, chisels, shovels,

326
00:18:32,055 --> 00:18:34,135
chainsaws, drills,
and polishing machines.

327
00:18:34,295 --> 00:18:36,736
Like construction workers.

328
00:18:38,216 --> 00:18:39,416
Such hard work.

329
00:18:39,575 --> 00:18:40,736
You need proper nourishment.

330
00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:44,295
Have some giant grouper soup.

331
00:18:45,095 --> 00:18:46,335
It's okay. I'll serve myself.

332
00:19:02,936 --> 00:19:03,855
No cilantro.

333
00:19:12,216 --> 00:19:12,976
Doesn't matter.

334
00:19:13,615 --> 00:19:15,456
Certain ingredients must be combined

335
00:19:15,456 --> 00:19:16,696
to enhance the aroma.

336
00:19:17,496 --> 00:19:18,295
While some are

337
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:20,375
clearly incompatible,

338
00:19:20,696 --> 00:19:21,736
if forced together,

339
00:19:22,016 --> 00:19:23,216
it'd only ruin the soup.

340
00:19:31,335 --> 00:19:32,216
Miss Nie,

341
00:19:33,335 --> 00:19:35,375
if I claim this invitation

342
00:19:35,615 --> 00:19:37,656
has nothing to do with Tuo,

343
00:19:37,896 --> 00:19:38,936
that would be a lie.

344
00:19:39,736 --> 00:19:41,256
You must've

345
00:19:41,335 --> 00:19:43,055
anticipated this before coming.

346
00:19:43,896 --> 00:19:44,575
Ms. Lin,

347
00:19:45,656 --> 00:19:47,775
no matter what your purpose is
for inviting me,

348
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,535
I only came

349
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:50,936
for the collaboration

350
00:19:50,936 --> 00:19:52,615
with you.

351
00:19:53,016 --> 00:19:53,936
Not just today,

352
00:19:54,095 --> 00:19:55,016
so will the future.

353
00:19:59,936 --> 00:20:01,095
Let's end here today.

354
00:20:01,696 --> 00:20:02,775
Come on, bottoms up.

355
00:20:07,896 --> 00:20:09,976
Business discussions
seem inappropriate now.

356
00:20:11,095 --> 00:20:12,055
How about this?

357
00:20:12,615 --> 00:20:13,896
I'll arrange another venue

358
00:20:13,936 --> 00:20:15,216
to host you privately.

359
00:20:17,335 --> 00:20:18,615
You even rejected a toast.

360
00:20:19,095 --> 00:20:20,176
Forget about it.

361
00:20:20,775 --> 00:20:22,736
Ms. Lin invited me today.

362
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,216
Everyone present

363
00:20:24,575 --> 00:20:25,936
are Roadsound's leadership,

364
00:20:27,095 --> 00:20:27,815
including you,

365
00:20:28,176 --> 00:20:29,575
the distinguished Mr. Yan.

366
00:20:30,976 --> 00:20:32,335
I'm just a sculptor.

367
00:20:32,736 --> 00:20:33,896
I can't offend anyone.

368
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,976
Let me toast Ms. Lin,
Ms. Feng, and Mr. Xiong.

369
00:20:37,256 --> 00:20:38,135
I'll take my leave.

370
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:39,256
You enjoy the meal.

371
00:20:41,095 --> 00:20:41,936
Miss Nie,

372
00:20:42,896 --> 00:20:44,135
I'm sorry

373
00:20:44,575 --> 00:20:46,295
to invite you suddenly,

374
00:20:46,815 --> 00:20:48,335
offending you.

375
00:20:49,896 --> 00:20:51,016
As you wish,

376
00:20:51,615 --> 00:20:53,176
we'll talk about the collaboration.

377
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:00,855
Tuo,

378
00:21:01,896 --> 00:21:03,216
finalize the afternoon's project

379
00:21:03,216 --> 00:21:05,176
with Xiong Hei and Feng Mi.

380
00:21:05,775 --> 00:21:06,775
I want to see

381
00:21:06,775 --> 00:21:10,016
the Shanjiang Institute
ribbon-cutting news this month.

382
00:21:11,256 --> 00:21:13,295
B-But I haven't eaten yet.

383
00:21:14,896 --> 00:21:16,295
Take this with you.

384
00:21:16,535 --> 00:21:17,815
Let's discuss while eating.

385
00:21:18,855 --> 00:21:20,016
Such a feast, and you...

386
00:21:20,016 --> 00:21:20,855
Let's go, Mr. Yan.

387
00:21:21,335 --> 00:21:22,055
Go work overtime.

388
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:27,375
Okay, let's go.

389
00:21:39,936 --> 00:21:40,736
Where to?

390
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:42,016
Come here.

391
00:21:43,216 --> 00:21:44,375
My apologies, Ms. Lin.

392
00:21:46,135 --> 00:21:47,256
I...

393
00:21:49,216 --> 00:21:51,135
A female artist commanding respect

394
00:21:51,456 --> 00:21:53,496
isn't easily established.

395
00:21:54,216 --> 00:21:57,095
It's tough for a woman
pursuing achievements

396
00:21:57,696 --> 00:21:58,615
independently.

397
00:22:01,976 --> 00:22:03,496
It's the voice of experience.

398
00:22:05,216 --> 00:22:06,456
Let me be frank.

399
00:22:07,016 --> 00:22:08,216
Collaborating with Roadsound

400
00:22:08,815 --> 00:22:09,775
worries me.

401
00:22:10,656 --> 00:22:11,256
How so?

402
00:22:11,335 --> 00:22:12,976
Though I loved art since childhood,

403
00:22:13,896 --> 00:22:15,295
I lack true talent,

404
00:22:15,496 --> 00:22:16,416
never reaching mastery.

405
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:18,896
Thus, sculpture became

406
00:22:19,335 --> 00:22:20,295
my safe harbor.

407
00:22:21,055 --> 00:22:23,256
I'm content to find peace
on this harbor.

408
00:22:24,055 --> 00:22:25,176
I have no

409
00:22:26,696 --> 00:22:27,335
grand ambitions.

410
00:22:28,135 --> 00:22:30,615
Hence, what worries you
does not come from Roadsound,

411
00:22:30,775 --> 00:22:32,335
but your limitations to yourself.

412
00:22:36,736 --> 00:22:37,936
And Mr. Yan's affection.

413
00:22:42,575 --> 00:22:43,295
What now?

414
00:22:43,535 --> 00:22:44,456
I won't drink.

415
00:22:45,216 --> 00:22:46,176
If you don't mind,

416
00:22:46,176 --> 00:22:47,135
I'll check on Lin Ling.

417
00:22:47,135 --> 00:22:48,375
Tell me when Ms. Lin's done.

418
00:22:51,016 --> 00:22:52,696
You don't have to drink.

419
00:22:53,815 --> 00:22:54,696
Let's chat.

420
00:22:56,095 --> 00:22:56,936
About what?

421
00:22:58,696 --> 00:22:59,456
Girls.

422
00:23:03,535 --> 00:23:04,295
Alright.

423
00:23:05,696 --> 00:23:06,416
I've

424
00:23:07,416 --> 00:23:09,256
never felt timid

425
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:11,615
when facing a girl.

426
00:23:12,216 --> 00:23:13,496
My heart raced.

427
00:23:14,256 --> 00:23:15,256
I couldn't meet her gaze.

428
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:18,896
The first time I saw her,

429
00:23:19,936 --> 00:23:22,016
I didn't even clearly see her face.

430
00:23:22,615 --> 00:23:24,615
In our first encounter,

431
00:23:25,896 --> 00:23:27,535
we got a violent collision.

432
00:23:28,335 --> 00:23:29,335
(It's not his fault,)

433
00:23:30,095 --> 00:23:31,256
(but mine.)

434
00:23:32,256 --> 00:23:33,216
From then on,

435
00:23:34,335 --> 00:23:35,815
I completely captivated her.

436
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:37,775
What?

437
00:23:38,295 --> 00:23:39,016
Let me go.

438
00:23:39,575 --> 00:23:40,575
In his eyes,

439
00:23:41,456 --> 00:23:42,896
perhaps I betrayed him.

440
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:47,335
This man works for the Earth Fiend.

441
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:49,456
But I only wanted to escape his control.

442
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,896
I stormed into her studio out of anger.

443
00:23:52,135 --> 00:23:52,896
Yet she

444
00:23:53,016 --> 00:23:54,135
dared to lay hands on me.

445
00:23:58,535 --> 00:24:00,696
He shattered
what I cherished most in my heart.

446
00:24:05,295 --> 00:24:05,855
I...

447
00:24:06,936 --> 00:24:08,535
I had no choice but to let go.

448
00:24:09,976 --> 00:24:10,775
For her,

449
00:24:11,615 --> 00:24:12,976
I completely reinvented myself,

450
00:24:13,775 --> 00:24:14,896
and even considered

451
00:24:15,775 --> 00:24:16,896
running away with her.

452
00:24:20,696 --> 00:24:22,295
He completely lost his mind,

453
00:24:24,256 --> 00:24:25,775
dragging me into an abyss.

454
00:24:29,216 --> 00:24:30,295
But women...

455
00:24:30,855 --> 00:24:32,135
I genuinely admire your work.

456
00:24:32,135 --> 00:24:33,575
Just cater to their preferences

457
00:24:33,815 --> 00:24:35,176
and sweet-talk them,

458
00:24:35,176 --> 00:24:36,456
there is room to maneuver.

459
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:37,375
Later,

460
00:24:39,176 --> 00:24:40,936
we did have several meals together.

461
00:24:43,855 --> 00:24:45,295
(We dated for a few times.)

462
00:24:46,896 --> 00:24:48,775
We did some crazy foolish things.

463
00:24:48,775 --> 00:24:50,496
You don't know what's in your own bag?

464
00:24:51,416 --> 00:24:52,656
No.

465
00:24:56,335 --> 00:24:57,936
We both made sacrifices for each other.

466
00:25:09,135 --> 00:25:11,496
But we can't forget the pain we endured.

467
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:13,095
The pain is too deep...

468
00:25:17,216 --> 00:25:18,416
to ignore.

469
00:25:23,535 --> 00:25:25,295
I completely understand your stance

470
00:25:26,615 --> 00:25:27,896
and good intentions.

471
00:25:32,176 --> 00:25:33,016
But we

472
00:25:34,615 --> 00:25:35,775
can't truly go back.

473
00:25:36,656 --> 00:25:37,896
She would remain

474
00:25:39,416 --> 00:25:40,696
in my memory.

475
00:25:41,135 --> 00:25:42,456
Yet I hope

476
00:25:42,815 --> 00:25:44,256
that with time's passage,

477
00:25:45,936 --> 00:25:46,976
it could fade away.

478
00:25:59,176 --> 00:26:00,375
Ms. Lin wants you to see

479
00:26:01,295 --> 00:26:02,016
the guest out.

480
00:26:20,775 --> 00:26:22,256
The past is set in stone.

481
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:23,775
While the future is yet to come.

482
00:26:24,456 --> 00:26:25,416
Regarding collaboration,

483
00:26:26,016 --> 00:26:27,775
we'll respect your opinion.

484
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:31,135
But please let Tuo escort you home.

485
00:26:31,615 --> 00:26:32,775
Or I won't rest easy.

486
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:33,815
Alright.

487
00:26:34,055 --> 00:26:34,736
Go ahead.

488
00:27:04,896 --> 00:27:05,535
Are you okay?

489
00:27:12,575 --> 00:27:13,976
Ms. Lin, go back.

490
00:27:14,135 --> 00:27:14,896
We're leaving.

491
00:27:25,216 --> 00:27:26,176
Verified?

492
00:27:26,575 --> 00:27:27,416
Kind of.

493
00:27:28,736 --> 00:27:30,736
You really think she's clean?

494
00:27:33,055 --> 00:27:34,135
Her figure from behind

495
00:27:34,416 --> 00:27:36,855
resembles the one who burned the farm.

496
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:38,815
Then why let her leave?

497
00:27:39,016 --> 00:27:40,295
The New Year's coming.

498
00:27:40,696 --> 00:27:42,575
Let's settle all outstanding matters.

499
00:27:43,095 --> 00:27:45,656
So they won't plague the coming year.

500
00:27:47,095 --> 00:27:49,936
You're deliberately
sending Yan Tuo away?

501
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:52,656
Summon Xiong Hei and Yang Zheng.

502
00:27:52,656 --> 00:27:54,256
I need you three to do something for me.

503
00:27:54,575 --> 00:27:55,176
Okay.

504
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,176
Ms. Lin.

505
00:28:03,216 --> 00:28:05,535
Happy New Year!
May you grow ever younger.

506
00:28:06,055 --> 00:28:08,095
May you

507
00:28:08,295 --> 00:28:10,016
be free from others' envy,

508
00:28:10,535 --> 00:28:12,055
schemes from petty minds,

509
00:28:12,135 --> 00:28:13,295
worries about children,

510
00:28:13,416 --> 00:28:14,616
and anger toward subordinates.

511
00:28:15,295 --> 00:28:16,896
Coming here today

512
00:28:16,976 --> 00:28:18,855
not just to flatter me, right?

513
00:28:22,855 --> 00:28:23,456
Right.

514
00:28:24,055 --> 00:28:25,775
I also wanted to ask if Lin Ling

515
00:28:26,216 --> 00:28:28,095
wants to join me
for the New Year's countdown.

516
00:28:32,976 --> 00:28:33,775
Ms. Lin,

517
00:28:34,815 --> 00:28:35,855
I think

518
00:28:36,016 --> 00:28:37,176
this is a good opportunity.

519
00:28:38,095 --> 00:28:40,936
There are some things
I need to say to her privately.

520
00:28:42,216 --> 00:28:44,535
Don't let Sis and the others follow us.

521
00:28:46,496 --> 00:28:47,295
Don't worry.

522
00:28:48,095 --> 00:28:49,936
I'll keep sharing my location with you.

523
00:28:50,496 --> 00:28:53,016
I'll bring her back
safe and sound before dawn.

524
00:28:56,256 --> 00:28:56,896
Go ahead.

525
00:28:58,815 --> 00:28:59,815
Stay safe.

526
00:29:01,456 --> 00:29:02,295
Thank you, Ms. Lin.

527
00:29:02,815 --> 00:29:04,176
Happy New Year!

528
00:29:20,335 --> 00:29:21,256
Go to the hospital?

529
00:29:22,575 --> 00:29:23,335
No need.

530
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:25,936
Fortunately, Lin Xirou didn't know it.

531
00:29:35,936 --> 00:29:37,135
What did you talk about?

532
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,496
Just as what we thought.

533
00:29:43,936 --> 00:29:44,615
What about you?

534
00:29:47,095 --> 00:29:49,016
Kind of fooled Xiong Hei and Feng Mi.

535
00:29:53,176 --> 00:29:54,176
But I think

536
00:29:55,976 --> 00:29:57,375
Lin Xirou wasn't fooled.

537
00:29:59,256 --> 00:29:59,936
Of course.

538
00:30:01,335 --> 00:30:02,936
But since she let us leave,

539
00:30:03,936 --> 00:30:05,456
we should be safe for now.

540
00:30:07,016 --> 00:30:08,535
I've been watching our backs.

541
00:30:08,535 --> 00:30:09,335
No one's tailing us.

542
00:30:12,055 --> 00:30:12,896
Let's hope so.

543
00:30:14,295 --> 00:30:16,375
Hope this isn't the calm
before the storm.

544
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:24,936
Why do doors in dramas

545
00:30:24,936 --> 00:30:26,176
always open so smoothly?

546
00:30:29,896 --> 00:30:31,055
Where are we going?

547
00:30:32,295 --> 00:30:34,615
Taking you to see New Year's Eve stuff.

548
00:30:35,615 --> 00:30:36,456
What's it?

549
00:30:49,976 --> 00:30:51,375
It's okay, not that severe.

550
00:31:00,496 --> 00:31:01,335
I'm hungry too.

551
00:31:01,496 --> 00:31:03,256
Didn't get to eat anything.

552
00:31:03,976 --> 00:31:04,575
Right.

553
00:31:04,815 --> 00:31:06,375
Who could eat in that situation?

554
00:31:08,615 --> 00:31:09,575
What do you want to eat?

555
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:15,335
I'll make noodles.

556
00:31:16,335 --> 00:31:17,216
With two poached eggs.

557
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:18,575
Okay.

558
00:31:38,575 --> 00:31:39,375
Nie Jiuluo!

559
00:31:39,976 --> 00:31:40,775
Nie Jiuluo!

560
00:31:42,256 --> 00:31:43,216
What's happening?

561
00:31:43,216 --> 00:31:44,575
Shut the water valve! Shut it!

562
00:31:44,575 --> 00:31:45,456
Where is it?

563
00:31:45,456 --> 00:31:46,456
This is your house.

564
00:31:46,456 --> 00:31:47,496
How would I know?

565
00:31:47,496 --> 00:31:49,135
I-I never handle these things.

566
00:31:49,135 --> 00:31:50,295
Ms. Lu handled them.

567
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:53,135
Down there!

568
00:31:53,855 --> 00:31:54,815
Everything's soaked.

569
00:31:54,815 --> 00:31:55,736
Which one?

570
00:31:56,095 --> 00:31:57,216
Shut them all off!

571
00:31:59,936 --> 00:32:01,535
It's not working. None of these work.

572
00:32:01,615 --> 00:32:02,416
Can't shut it off.

573
00:32:02,416 --> 00:32:03,416
Here, hold this.

574
00:32:03,416 --> 00:32:04,416
I'll do it.

575
00:32:31,696 --> 00:32:32,976
Looks like it stopped.

576
00:32:33,496 --> 00:32:34,496
Yes.

577
00:32:37,016 --> 00:32:38,775
The bandage got wet. Needs redressing.

578
00:32:38,775 --> 00:32:39,736
It's fine. I'll...

579
00:32:39,736 --> 00:32:40,815
I'll handle it myself.

580
00:32:41,696 --> 00:32:43,095
Go take a shower.

581
00:32:43,095 --> 00:32:43,855
Don't catch a cold.

582
00:32:46,416 --> 00:32:47,016
Okay.

583
00:33:24,016 --> 00:33:24,656
This...

584
00:33:31,575 --> 00:33:32,416
Ms. Lu's not here,

585
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,976
so we'll have to make do.

586
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:36,775
Make do?

587
00:33:37,016 --> 00:33:38,216
This is the good stuff.

588
00:33:38,736 --> 00:33:40,295
A New Year's Eve feast.

589
00:33:40,416 --> 00:33:41,095
Of course.

590
00:33:41,095 --> 00:33:42,896
I even got you dessert.

591
00:33:44,496 --> 00:33:46,135
Have a tangerine. Wish for good fortune.

592
00:33:48,176 --> 00:33:49,936
Thank you then.

593
00:33:54,216 --> 00:33:56,535
Past midnight and no fireworks?

594
00:33:56,656 --> 00:33:57,696
Not lively at all.

595
00:34:07,736 --> 00:34:09,255
How did you light these candles?

596
00:34:10,255 --> 00:34:11,095
With a lighter.

597
00:34:11,496 --> 00:34:12,856
Where is it? Let me see.

598
00:34:15,055 --> 00:34:15,655
What for?

599
00:34:30,095 --> 00:34:31,095
What are you doing?

600
00:34:31,896 --> 00:34:32,776
You'll know then.

601
00:34:35,535 --> 00:34:36,615
Don't break it.

602
00:34:36,615 --> 00:34:38,416
I need it for incense and candles.

603
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,376
Don't worry.

604
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:46,544
(Do Not Imitate)

605
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:53,000
(Do Not Imitate)

606
00:34:53,776 --> 00:34:54,575
Ready?

607
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:56,215
For what?

608
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:57,776
Nie Jiuluo.

609
00:34:58,936 --> 00:34:59,655
Happy New Year.

610
00:35:15,215 --> 00:35:15,856
How is it?

611
00:35:16,896 --> 00:35:18,296
This is your fireworks?

612
00:35:21,336 --> 00:35:22,135
Too short?

613
00:35:22,135 --> 00:35:23,456
Then I'll do it again.

614
00:35:23,856 --> 00:35:24,496
Wait...

615
00:35:40,856 --> 00:35:41,655
Thank you.

616
00:35:42,016 --> 00:35:43,336
It's nothing.

617
00:35:44,135 --> 00:35:46,095
Still a bit of a pity that we missed it.

618
00:35:46,376 --> 00:35:47,055
What's wrong?

619
00:35:48,215 --> 00:35:49,416
We missed the countdown.

620
00:35:50,175 --> 00:35:51,016
Doesn't matter.

621
00:35:51,615 --> 00:35:53,135
At least we didn't miss the fireworks.

622
00:35:54,336 --> 00:35:55,296
What?

623
00:35:55,735 --> 00:35:57,976
Who'd miss fireworks
they set off themselves?

624
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:00,496
Make a wish.

625
00:36:09,215 --> 00:36:10,055
Tell me.

626
00:36:11,655 --> 00:36:13,016
Why do people always make wishes

627
00:36:13,055 --> 00:36:15,016
before fleeting things?

628
00:36:16,936 --> 00:36:19,175
Like shooting stars, fireworks,

629
00:36:19,535 --> 00:36:21,976
and birthday candles.

630
00:36:24,336 --> 00:36:26,735
Even if a wish comes true,

631
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:29,135
would it also be fleeting?

632
00:36:34,095 --> 00:36:34,776
No way.

633
00:36:35,856 --> 00:36:36,776
Just think like this.

634
00:36:37,535 --> 00:36:39,856
When you pray to deities in temples,

635
00:36:40,496 --> 00:36:42,135
the Taoist statues just stand there.

636
00:36:42,496 --> 00:36:44,175
Make wishes or not, they'll be there.

637
00:36:47,936 --> 00:36:48,936
And I'll be here for you.

638
00:36:50,456 --> 00:36:51,016
Make a wish.

639
00:38:46,416 --> 00:38:47,095
Downstairs.

640
00:40:07,496 --> 00:40:08,496
Found anything?

641
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:12,255
Nothing.

642
00:40:20,976 --> 00:40:22,496
Told you to search,

643
00:40:22,535 --> 00:40:24,215
not to wreck the place.

644
00:40:38,016 --> 00:40:39,896
He's always so tightly wound.

645
00:40:40,016 --> 00:40:41,095
I thought his house

646
00:40:41,095 --> 00:40:42,856
must have violent comics

647
00:40:42,856 --> 00:40:44,175
or dirty movies.

648
00:40:44,535 --> 00:40:45,936
Turns out we found nothing.

649
00:40:46,055 --> 00:40:47,816
Boring.

650
00:40:48,215 --> 00:40:49,016
Meaningless.
