=Episode 11=

17
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:50,960
Get the door.

18
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,119
Open up.

19
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:02,039
The door is knocked off.

20
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:02,860
Xiong.

21
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,920
Business is picking up?

22
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,399
I found it yesterday.

23
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,599
Have you had blood drawn recently?

24
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,240
Not recently.

25
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,200
The last time

26
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:28,839
was during last year's
physical examination.

27
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:39,999
Last night when I was sleeping,

28
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,439
I felt it was strange.

29
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:46,559
Like I was passing out.

30
00:02:48,559 --> 00:02:49,800
It was hazy.

31
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,040
I felt...

32
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:54,920
I felt like...

33
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,839
someone was touching me.

34
00:03:04,399 --> 00:03:05,439
Don't panic yet.

35
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,879
You might've been exhausted lately

36
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:09,719
and had a bad dream.

37
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:15,999
Was this a dream too?

38
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:25,800
If this happens again,

39
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,960
call me immediately.

40
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,520
I did call,

41
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,480
but you were busy.

42
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,119
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,439
It was my oversight.

44
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:52,920
I'm sorry.

45
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,080
Hello?

46
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,080
Well?

47
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,679
Tell me, am I sharp or not?

48
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,279
I told you to leave early.

49
00:04:08,279 --> 00:04:08,999
Wasn't I right?

50
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:09,879
What's wrong?

51
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:10,960
You know what?

52
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,679
Xiong Hei carried someone in.

53
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,080
He looked rushed.

54
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,200
Looks like

55
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,159
it was a real struggle for them
to nab him.

56
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,039
No idea what that man did wrong.

57
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,560
Xiong Hei and his men
kept slapping him around.

58
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,279
They wanted me
to wake him up immediately.

59
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,560
Do you know who he is?

60
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,599
I didn't dare ask.

61
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:29,640
That's not protocol.

62
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:32,399
Heard them call him 'Gou' or something.

63
00:04:32,719 --> 00:04:33,520
Gou Ya?

64
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,440
Yes.

65
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,680
Does that even sound like a decent name?

66
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:37,640
When I looked,

67
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,880
he looked like gang muscle.

68
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,479
Maybe even a top enforcer.

69
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:42,320
Even Xiong Hei's goons

70
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,880
got beaten to a pulp by him.

71
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,200
Got it.

72
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:46,479
Talk later.

73
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:04,239
Don't let Ms. Lin find out
that you've noticed this.

74
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:09,479
Keep your head down.

75
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:12,000
Don't confront them.

76
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,760
Give me more time.

77
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,719
I'll fix this.

78
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,440
Okay?

79
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,919
If he hadn't run,

80
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,880
maybe it wouldn't have come to this.

81
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,960
Should we follow protocol?

82
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:49,640
Or let the group decide?

83
00:06:05,719 --> 00:06:07,599
Ms. Lin, you have guests?

84
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,880
Perfect, let me introduce them.

85
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,440
Who doesn't know Ms. Lin's prized jewel?

86
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,560
We can introduce ourselves.

87
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:22,880
Hi, I'm Yan Tuo.

88
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:24,760
Sorry,

89
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,399
Ms. Lin never mentioned you all.

90
00:06:28,719 --> 00:06:30,599
We've heard plenty
about you from Ms. Lin.

91
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:33,640
Ms. Lin, playing favorites?

92
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,200
The one who can't speak properly

93
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,279
is Yang Zheng.

94
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,320
Among the names we saw earlier,

95
00:06:40,719 --> 00:06:42,760
(Roadsound Group List)
those who are still active...

96
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,520
That woman

97
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:45,760
is Li Yueying.

98
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:47,839
(They are all coming to Xicang.)

99
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,359
Let me formally introduce myself.

100
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,760
Feng Mi.

101
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,239
Mi as in 'honey.'

102
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:57,479
Hello.

103
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:05,359
That bracelet's gorgeous.

104
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,880
Where'd you get it?

105
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,960
From a client.

106
00:07:16,239 --> 00:07:16,919
Ms. Lin,

107
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,560
something's come up at work. Got to go.

108
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,520
My treat later.

109
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,799
Go ahead.

110
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,599
Okay.

111
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,560
Stay a bit longer.

112
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,279
Got shut down, huh?

113
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,520
Ms. Lin,

114
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:34,440
your eldest son's quite the character.

115
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,919
I like him.

116
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,239
Enough.

117
00:07:56,599 --> 00:07:57,440
How is Gou Ya doing?

118
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,120
Not badly hurt. He's fine.

119
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,560
Xiong Hei said they'll take him
when he wakes.

120
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:05,120
He ordered his men
to prepare at some farm.

121
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:06,200
Farm?

122
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,760
Lv Xian.

123
00:08:11,799 --> 00:08:13,640
Mr. Lv, you're my savior.

124
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,039
Help me one more time.

125
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:16,919
Find any way to keep him here longer.

126
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,479
How am I supposed to do that?

127
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,640
Should I tell him,
"We haven't bonded enough

128
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,080
and should drink and chat,"

129
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,159
when he wakes up?

130
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:26,320
Why not just keep him under?

131
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:27,880
This is urgent.

132
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:29,839
You really need to help me again.

133
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,999
What's going on?

134
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,839
Fine.

135
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,560
Then you should think carefully.

136
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,280
About what?

137
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:40,280
Obviously, how to thank me properly.

138
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,479
How to keep him?

139
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,759
They've all been treated.

140
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:11,759
Rest assured.

141
00:09:12,359 --> 00:09:13,999
Those pals are all fine too.

142
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:14,999
Superficial wounds.

143
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:16,080
Except these two.

144
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,599
You should've come earlier for stitches.

145
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,119
Now it's too late.

146
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:23,960
Might leave a scar.

147
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,800
Your wrist needs rest to heal.

148
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,040
Can't be helped.
Bone injuries need three months.

149
00:09:29,239 --> 00:09:29,879
Right?

150
00:09:31,119 --> 00:09:32,080
By the way, Xiong,

151
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,359
are you feeling alright?

152
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,320
It's a stupid question.

153
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,519
You're as tough as forged iron.

154
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:44,599
So go back and rest.

155
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:45,999
I'll tell you when he wakes.

156
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:47,280
No need.

157
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,119
We'll take him immediately
when he wakes.

158
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:52,400
At least eat something first.

159
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,680
You've been up all night.

160
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,160
Xiong,

161
00:09:55,479 --> 00:09:57,519
the noodle shop to the right is good.

162
00:09:57,776 --> 00:09:58,896
Try the green pepper noodle.

163
00:09:58,896 --> 00:10:00,200
Tell their owner I sent you.

164
00:10:00,304 --> 00:10:02,200
- You'll get extra toppings.
- Are you hungry?

165
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,080
No.

166
00:10:05,359 --> 00:10:06,160
No.

167
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,160
Fully dedicated to your duties.

168
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,599
Selfishly embracing the world.

169
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,519
T-Then I'll refill his IV fluids.

170
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:23,719
Not hungry?

171
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:26,160
Yet who ate my takeout?

172
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:26,879
Not hungry?

173
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,599
Xiong.

174
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:48,400
What's that?

175
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,639
Medication. I'm switching it.

176
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,440
Why's the color different?

177
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,680
T-This is stronger.

178
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,800
You wanted him awake fast, right?

179
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,200
Wait.

180
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,359
W-What's with this?

181
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:06,639
What are you doing?

182
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,800
Xiong, you don't trust me?

183
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:18,719
Remember this.

184
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,800
Roadsound Group helped me.

185
00:11:21,479 --> 00:11:22,359
Ms. Lin isn't my mom.

186
00:11:22,359 --> 00:11:23,160
But she raised me.

187
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,920
I know where my loyalty lies.

188
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:26,960
All these years,

189
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,800
you've come through here so many times.

190
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,119
Did I ever ask questions?

191
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,680
Did I demand a single cent?

192
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,879
Why?

193
00:11:33,119 --> 00:11:34,519
I care about you buddies.

194
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,599
I know

195
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,400
your work's tough and thankless,

196
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,599
righteous but unseen.

197
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:41,599
I understand. I feel for you.

198
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,080
But who cares about me?

199
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:45,479
You keep coming here,

200
00:11:45,479 --> 00:11:46,439
not holding back at all.

201
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:47,839
One day, you'll attract the police.

202
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,264
What becomes of Wanbao Tower then?

203
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,719
So I wanted to use strong medicine

204
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,239
to wake him fast.

205
00:11:53,239 --> 00:11:54,440
So he can be taken away soon.

206
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,200
For you and me,

207
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,680
and for everyone, it's good, right?

208
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:02,560
You don't trust me? Fine.

209
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:05,800
Let's stick to conservative treatment.

210
00:12:07,239 --> 00:12:08,320
Give back my fried noodles.

211
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,080
Why not use it earlier?

212
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,759
That medicine

213
00:12:16,359 --> 00:12:17,920
has some side effects.

214
00:12:18,032 --> 00:12:19,216
It might damage his brain.

215
00:12:23,719 --> 00:12:25,759
He's brainless. Use it.

216
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,519
Are you sure?

217
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:29,960
Buy some fried noodles.

218
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:32,239
Make it a large.

219
00:12:34,599 --> 00:12:35,400
Fine.

220
00:12:37,999 --> 00:12:38,680
Bro.

221
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,719
You and I have a history.

222
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:41,960
After all we've been through,

223
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,560
drop the tough act.

224
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:44,999
Alright?

225
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,119
Xiong.

226
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,879
Hei.

227
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,119
Get back to work.

228
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,479
You two still haven't finished?

229
00:13:13,479 --> 00:13:14,280
Almost done.

230
00:13:14,719 --> 00:13:16,320
Alright, I'll do it.

231
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,160
Come on.

232
00:13:17,719 --> 00:13:18,320
Unbelievable.

233
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,359
Is it shift change time?

234
00:13:20,719 --> 00:13:21,479
Not yet.

235
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:24,479
What? Am I early?

236
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,160
Then you continue.

237
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:26,999
No.

238
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:28,320
You've already started.

239
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,040
Not my shift yet.

240
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,479
You take over. I'm leaving.

241
00:13:30,479 --> 00:13:30,999
Wait.

242
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:32,920
- Let's go.
- You two... I...

243
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:35,359
How utterly shameless.

244
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,080
Unbelievable.

245
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,719
What...

246
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,960
(Lv Xian)

247
00:15:00,528 --> 00:15:02,639
(Lv Xian)

248
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,048
(Gou Ya is unnatural.)

249
00:15:04,048 --> 00:15:05,519
(I gave strong meds. But he woke.)

250
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,639
(Xiong Hei took him away.)

251
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:17,839
Do you think Ms. Lin

252
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:19,359
will spare Gou Ya's life?

253
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:22,560
Why keep him? Let him bite you later?

254
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,296
(Roadsound Group)

255
00:17:35,728 --> 00:17:38,768

(Clue Map)

258
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,239
You actually found him.

(Humanoid Earth Fiends)

260
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,608
(Lin Xirou, Be Substituted, Xiong Hei,
Created Earth Fiend, Attacker, Human)

261
00:18:46,608 --> 00:18:52,656
(Primal Earth Fiend,
Humanoid Earth Fiend)

262
00:19:03,632 --> 00:19:04,976
(Mr. Changxi)

263
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,600
Ms. Lin.

264
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:27,960
Xiong.

265
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:35,559
Ms. Lin,

266
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:38,479
I was wrong.

267
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,799
Gou Ya...

268
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,559
Gou Ya was wrong.

269
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:47,440
Gou Ya was wrong.

270
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,799
Ms. Lin, his mistakes

271
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:54,519
deserve multiple deaths.

272
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,920
But with our current shortage,

273
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,519
keeping him

274
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,200
even as experimental material
to improve root removal...

275
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,360
If it were just occasional omnivory,

276
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,840
maybe we could spare him.

277
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,039
But fleeing recklessly
and nearly exposing us

278
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:20,440
endangered all of us.

279
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,920
We're already on thin ice.

280
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,440
There's no room for error.

281
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,279
My bottom line is absolute.

282
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:32,999
It's crossed by no human

283
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,719
and defied by no kin.

284
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:11,319
He's to be executed.

285
00:21:11,999 --> 00:21:13,239
Is this necessary?

286
00:21:13,999 --> 00:21:15,279
Baring fangs at Ms. Lin

287
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,424
is intolerable.

288
00:21:17,424 --> 00:21:18,512
(Mr. Changxi: It's me. Are you okay?)

289
00:21:18,512 --> 00:21:19,400
Exactly.

290
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:21,519
(It's me. Are you okay?)
Baring fangs at kin is taboo.

291
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:23,319
Especially toward Ms. Lin.

292
00:21:34,239 --> 00:21:34,960
Prepare.

293
00:22:05,712 --> 00:22:06,800
(Inbox, Tuo)

294
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,799
(Watching Gou Ya's execution.)

295
00:22:08,999 --> 00:22:10,519
Gou Ya?

298
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,239

(Sent)

302
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,960
It's our first time executing a kin.

303
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,360
Hope it's also the last.

304
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,999
With the internal threat resolved,

305
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,680
it's time for external ones.

306
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,680
How's Jiang Baichuan's situation?

307
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,600
Xiong Hei says he's being pampered,

308
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:36,799
turning Rare Stone Garden
into his personal home.

309
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:49,840
(Entrusted by All, Aid from All Sides)

310
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:53,719
Need something? Speak up.

311
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,319
You think we'd lock you up?

312
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:56,600
Leaving without a word?

313
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,559
Why is that?

314
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,440
I haven't had time to explain.

315
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:01,319
The train departs in two hours.

316
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,600
'Haven't had time'?

317
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:05,440
I'd never seen an Earth Fiend before.

318
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,479
I wasn't scared.

319
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:07,799
Now,

320
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,960
with so many
humanoid Earth Fiends out there,

321
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:12,600
can we tell them apart?

322
00:26:13,719 --> 00:26:14,600
Even Shen

323
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,200
secretly kept
a live Earth Fiend at the base.

324
00:26:18,239 --> 00:26:18,999
Tell me,

325
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:20,440
shouldn't I be scared?

326
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:21,960
I'm scared.

327
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,680
I fear death.

328
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:25,920
I fear my wife and my kids losing me

329
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,239
and my parents having to bury me.

330
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:29,079
Working with you,

331
00:26:29,999 --> 00:26:30,960
it doesn't feel safe.

332
00:26:35,999 --> 00:26:37,079
Anyone else leaving?

333
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,680
Anyone?

334
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,120
Speak up now.

335
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,920
Sorry, Big Head.

336
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,400
Any others?

337
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:30,759
Names once etched in fiend bones
are now burned to be sealed.

338
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,479
Leaving South Mountain behind,
no more fellowship remains.

339
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,864
The Ghost Whip cracks.

340
00:29:07,719 --> 00:29:08,559
Fiend bones tremble.

341
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,160
You're the Ghost Whip, Yu Rong?

342
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,680
You're back.

343
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,160
Shen, we've got a chance.

344
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,160
Sorry, who are you?

345
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:19,920
No one else leaving?

346
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:22,960
We'll introduce each other later.

347
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,400
Burn the bones.

348
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:27,600
Open the cauldron.

349
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,039
Stealing the Whip Clan's job?

350
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:48,999
Now you're secretly taming a fiend.

351
00:30:51,999 --> 00:30:53,559
I've replicated 70% to 80%

352
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,120
of the Earth Fiends'
communication frequency.

353
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,279
With proper training,

354
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,999
it could become our ultimate weapon.

355
00:31:11,719 --> 00:31:13,279
True, certain acoustic devices exist

356
00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:16,680
to drive away protected marine species

357
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,600
and mammals.

358
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,759
But

359
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,519
we're far from fully controlling them

360
00:31:25,239 --> 00:31:26,799
or communicating

361
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,799
with them.

362
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:30,960
Earth Fiends

363
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:33,880
aren't like trained seals

364
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:35,759
at an aquarium,

365
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,440
clapping on command

366
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,559
or balancing balls.

367
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:50,160
Whether to keep that Earth Fiend

368
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,319
can be put to a vote.

369
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,999
I vote to keep it.

370
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,120
To let it go, where could it go?

371
00:32:08,239 --> 00:32:08,999
To keep it,

372
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,680
here's the safest place.

373
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:17,239
Our priority is rescuing Jiang.

374
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:20,999
I have no time for that thing.

375
00:32:50,704 --> 00:32:53,744
(Wanbao Tower)

376
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:07,039
Can't you see the sign says 'Closed'?

377
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,559
Come back tomorrow.

378
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,039
Open up.

379
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,600
I wondered who'd be so clueless.

380
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,840
What's your act now?

381
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:33,279
I keep asking for favors,

382
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:34,600
so I came to repay the debt.

383
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,160
As Wanbao Tower's esteemed owner,

384
00:33:37,239 --> 00:33:38,519
shouldn't you dress sharply

385
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:39,440
and presentably?

386
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:41,079
Impossible.

387
00:33:41,999 --> 00:33:43,479
From the out-of-season discount rack?

388
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,759
Or gifts from someone

389
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:46,440
in the wrong size? My gain then.

390
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,200
Don't want them?

391
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,920
Fine, I'll take them back.

392
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:51,559
Put them down.

393
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,519
After careful consideration,

394
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,440
you're up to no good.

395
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,720
As your sworn brother
from another mother,

396
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,960
I feel for you.

397
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:12,240
I can't bear seeing you rot

398
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,039
in this gloomy shack all day.

399
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,920
So change into these new clothes

400
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:19,199
and join me for some hiking.

401
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,519
No way.

402
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:25,999
No way.

403
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,479
Wait.

404
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:29,519
Wearing such expensive clothes
for hiking?

405
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,639
You've lost it.

406
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,720
Actually, fair point.

407
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,559
I brought something more practical.

408
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,679
If I return it, is it still mine?

409
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,240
This isn't meant for me, is it?

410
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,720
A deal is a deal.

411
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,440
We're here.

412
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,840
Master Wang, please.

413
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,880
Hurry up, or should I drag you?

414
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,360
Commit to the act fully.

415
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:29,800
Here we go.

416
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,840
Marvel at this.

417
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,800
Master Wang.

418
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:36,079
My humble collectibles

419
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,440
are displayed inside.

420
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,920
I've never really appreciated
those intricately crafted gold, silver,

421
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,519
and jade ornaments.

422
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:44,360
Elegant.

423
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:45,679
Very elegant.

424
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,360
Having your esteemed presence

425
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,639
truly brings radiance
to our modest venue.

426
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,440
You flatter me.

427
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,199
Please help me with your expert opinion.

428
00:35:56,199 --> 00:35:57,240
Of course.

429
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,039
After you.

430
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,400
Hello, Mr. Yan.

431
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,119
Ms. Lin previously said

432
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:03,559
the Rare Stone Garden

433
00:36:03,559 --> 00:36:05,400
won't be open to outsiders for now.

434
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,679
To outsiders?

435
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,679
Who is the 'outsider'?

436
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:08,880
Me or Master Wang?

437
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,479
Step aside...

438
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,720
Yan,

439
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,679
all matters
require proper timing and affinity.

440
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,960
If today is not the day,
we can try another day.

441
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,960
Actually, I have dinner plans tonight...

442
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,639
Such great patina.

443
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:26,199
With important clients and executives.

444
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,519
I should go get ready now.

445
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:28,479
It's about time anyway.

446
00:36:28,479 --> 00:36:29,519
No.

447
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:30,400
Master Wang.

448
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,479
Please wait a moment.

449
00:36:31,479 --> 00:36:32,559
My apologies.

450
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,920
What's wrong with you?

451
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,519
He's a notable guest for us.

452
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:42,199
Yanguan Province's urban plan
was designed

453
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:43,479
using his feng shui.

454
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,639
Do you know how much effort it took

455
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,199
to invite him
to inspect our Rare Stone Garden?

456
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:50,559
But it's closed to outsiders now.

457
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,400
Let me report this.

458
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,320
To whom?

459
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,440
I'm the General Manager.

460
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,599
Who will you report to?

461
00:36:57,079 --> 00:36:57,800
Listen.

462
00:36:58,119 --> 00:36:59,280
If you mess this up today,

463
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,320
I'll skin you alive.

464
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:01,440
Treat him properly.

465
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:02,280
Now.

466
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,479
Master Wang.

467
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,360
Come on.

468
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,119
Master.

469
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:06,760
After you.

470
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,159
My apologies. Just a minor hiccup.

471
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,232
- Right.
- Not forcing you?

472
00:37:09,232 --> 00:37:09,760
Not at all.

473
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,519
What are you talking about?

474
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,440
Please come inside.

475
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,240
As you can see,
this is our Rare Stone Garden.

476
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,599
Master Wang, what should

477
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,159
my mom be cautious about?

478
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,400
Don't all parents say,

479
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:25,320
"Your wings have hardened,
and you no longer listen"?

480
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,999
So the root cause

481
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,639
lies in the wings.

482
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,639
The wings?

483
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,240
Make your mom believe
your wings aren't fully developed

484
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,599
and you can't fly far yet.

485
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,639
This will ease her mind.

486
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,039
How to achieve this?

487
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,079
She must avoid certain foods.

488
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,559
Certain foods?

489
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:43,280
Avoid anything with wings.

490
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:45,400
Like chickens and geese.

491
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,599
Well...

492
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,400
Quail.

493
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:51,440
Quail.

494
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,639
Ducks.

495
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,760
Cicadas, butterflies.

496
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,800
She can't have those.

497
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:58,920
That makes sense.

498
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,440
But my mom is a vegetarian.

499
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,240
Master, please come in.

500
00:38:04,656 --> 00:38:06,159
Of course I know she's a vegetarian.

501
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,280
I was testing you.

502
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:10,280
Never mind.

503
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,960
Let me consult the hexagrams
for your mom

504
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,599
and create a dietary plan

505
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:16,599
to ensure absolute safety.

506
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,559
Excellent, Master Wang.

507
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,599
Master Wang,

508
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:27,800
this way, please.

509
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,800
Troubling.

510
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,720
What's wrong?

511
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:33,199
Don't scare me like that.

512
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,519
I rushed out this morning

513
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:38,199
and didn't cast a hexagram.

514
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,920
But getting angry just now
made me realize today is auspicious

515
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:43,920
for travel, weddings, and construction.

516
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,079
Everything's good to go,

517
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,999
just can't slip up.

518
00:38:47,999 --> 00:38:49,199
What does that mean?

519
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,039
Can't have

520
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:53,880
slip-up lions.

521
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:57,199
Master Wang?

522
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,039
What did you say to him?

523
00:38:59,039 --> 00:38:59,679
What happened?

524
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:00,479
Nothing.

525
00:39:00,479 --> 00:39:01,519
We talked about my mom.

526
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:02,920
Then he suddenly became like this.

527
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,760
Right.

528
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:05,199
It's... It's Mom

529
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:07,039
Oh, my God.

530
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,800
From ancient times,

531
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,920
my great-grandmother is calling me.

532
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,039
Take care of him.

533
00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:16,960
I'll get help.

534
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:20,280
You, come here and help.

535
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,400
Hurry up.

536
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,840
Help him.

537
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:24,119
Press his philtrum.

538
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,800
Check his pockets for medicine.

539
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,920
I'll call an ambulance.

540
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,639
Take care of him.

541
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,920
Any chance for a change in the menu?

542
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:45,240
Make the dough softer.

543
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,999
Who uses unleavened dough
for steamed buns?

544
00:39:47,479 --> 00:39:48,159
Jiang Baichuan.

545
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,400
What? You're interested in this too?

546
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,720
Very interested.

547
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,560
Then you should thank Mr. Yan.

548
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,000
Mr. Yan.

549
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,080
Please come in.

550
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:05,920
You're Zhang, right?

551
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:06,920
Yes.

552
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,800
After eating your mulberries,

553
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,400
let me give you some advice.

554
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,880
Lean closer. I have some wisdom for you.

555
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,080
Yes, Master Wang?

556
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,160
Judging from your facial features,

557
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,760
tell your mom
to watch her digestive health.

558
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,640
You can tell my mom's

559
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,280
health condition from my face?

560
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,040
Of course.

561
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,120
Longing is a mysterious thing.

562
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,560
Your mom's concern for you

563
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,440
is like an invisible hand,

564
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,120
following you everywhere.

565
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,640
It rests on your shoulders,

566
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,920
weighs on your chest,

567
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,120
and manifests in your complexion.

568
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,200
Please continue, Master Wang.

569
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,480
