=Episode 25=

17
00:01:55,888 --> 00:01:56,767
Azure Scale Incense.

18
00:01:58,287 --> 00:02:00,287
During South Mountain Hunters' patrols,

19
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:02,927
mosquitoes swarm everywhere
and the terrain's uneven.

20
00:02:03,168 --> 00:02:04,368
It's hard to get proper rest.

21
00:02:04,728 --> 00:02:06,088
So we carry this incense

22
00:02:06,487 --> 00:02:07,608
to help with sleep.

23
00:02:14,928 --> 00:02:16,287
I haven't lit it in ages.

24
00:02:17,248 --> 00:02:18,727
It smells just like when I was a kid.

25
00:02:22,007 --> 00:02:22,847
It's great.

26
00:02:27,088 --> 00:02:27,887
If...

27
00:02:28,968 --> 00:02:30,648
If I'd had this in the mine,

28
00:02:31,968 --> 00:02:33,407
it would've been more bearable.

29
00:02:53,687 --> 00:02:55,368
I'm sorry I couldn't rescue you sooner.

30
00:02:56,607 --> 00:02:57,727
You've suffered a lot.

31
00:03:03,928 --> 00:03:04,727
Honestly,

32
00:03:07,328 --> 00:03:10,167
I can endure physical pain.

33
00:03:12,488 --> 00:03:14,607
It's the hopelessness

34
00:03:15,968 --> 00:03:16,808
that eats you alive.

35
00:03:20,768 --> 00:03:22,167
Before meeting you,

36
00:03:22,407 --> 00:03:24,328
I was just as trapped.

37
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:29,648
Enduring, waiting,

38
00:03:31,447 --> 00:03:33,808
with no way out or escape.

39
00:03:36,808 --> 00:03:38,407
Same as my mom back then.

40
00:03:46,447 --> 00:03:48,528
Mom, where are we going?

41
00:03:49,768 --> 00:03:51,968
We're taking a family trip with Dad.

42
00:03:55,968 --> 00:03:57,768
(Marriage Certificate, Work Manual)
Where are we going?

43
00:04:00,328 --> 00:04:02,127
Somewhere far away.

44
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:12,336
(Ganzhou, Yunzhou,
Passengers First, Service First)

45
00:04:20,568 --> 00:04:22,847
(First Waiting Room Departures)
Anywhere out of Yanguan.

46
00:04:22,847 --> 00:04:24,128
What's the earliest train?

47
00:04:24,128 --> 00:04:25,247
To Ganzhou.

48
00:04:25,247 --> 00:04:26,328
Boarding in ten minutes.

49
00:04:29,088 --> 00:04:30,208
And after that?

50
00:04:30,367 --> 00:04:32,528
To Yunzhou at eleven o'clock.

51
00:04:32,727 --> 00:04:33,528
Which one?

52
00:04:36,367 --> 00:04:37,648
Hurry up. The line's waiting.

53
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:42,088
The eleven one.

54
00:04:42,088 --> 00:04:43,128
To Yunzhou at eleven.

55
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:43,927
How many tickets?

56
00:04:44,487 --> 00:04:45,167
Four.

57
00:04:45,287 --> 00:04:46,528
But Dad said

58
00:04:46,528 --> 00:04:48,807
to get tickets for the earliest train?

59
00:04:49,047 --> 00:04:49,847
Just wait.

60
00:04:49,888 --> 00:04:51,448
We're leaving together.

61
00:04:52,448 --> 00:04:53,768
(Yunzhou East)
Here, two adults and two children.

62
00:04:53,768 --> 00:04:54,328
Hold these.

63
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:55,487
Okay. Thanks.

64
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,678
(Bizhou, Departure 15:35)

65
00:05:01,688 --> 00:05:02,847
Sit over here.

66
00:05:02,968 --> 00:05:03,648
Sit right here.

67
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,247
Scoot over inside.

68
00:05:06,448 --> 00:05:07,448
Look, ducklings.

69
00:05:08,287 --> 00:05:10,407
Let's feed the ducklings.

70
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:13,128
Where are you going?

71
00:05:13,367 --> 00:05:15,528
We agreed you wouldn't wander off.

72
00:05:15,768 --> 00:05:16,968
Sorry, Mom.

73
00:05:17,128 --> 00:05:19,807
We wanted to give them cookies.

74
00:05:20,807 --> 00:05:21,607
I see.

75
00:05:21,768 --> 00:05:23,208
Now stay close to me.

76
00:05:23,487 --> 00:05:24,407
When Dad gets here,

77
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,088
he'll buy each of you a duck. Okay?

78
00:05:26,088 --> 00:05:26,807
Okay.

79
00:05:30,287 --> 00:05:32,768
I've never told anyone about this.

80
00:05:44,568 --> 00:05:45,487
Whatever it is,

81
00:05:46,968 --> 00:05:48,208
don't bottle it up.

82
00:05:49,927 --> 00:05:51,768
Talking might help.

83
00:06:11,247 --> 00:06:12,727
All aboard!

84
00:06:12,727 --> 00:06:14,407
Dashan, over here!

85
00:06:14,727 --> 00:06:15,528
Dashan.

86
00:06:15,648 --> 00:06:18,287
Mom, the duckling.

87
00:06:18,287 --> 00:06:19,047
Over here.

88
00:06:19,047 --> 00:06:19,568
Mom.

89
00:06:19,568 --> 00:06:21,167
- I'm here.
- The duckling.

90
00:06:22,167 --> 00:06:23,448
Dashan, I'm here.

91
00:06:23,648 --> 00:06:25,328
Look at the duckling, Mom.

92
00:06:25,727 --> 00:06:26,888
Dashan, over here.

93
00:06:42,768 --> 00:06:43,568
Tuo!

94
00:06:43,727 --> 00:06:44,528
Tuo!

95
00:06:44,727 --> 00:06:45,448
Xinxin!

96
00:06:45,994 --> 00:06:46,793
Tuo!

97
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,050
Tuo!

98
00:06:52,266 --> 00:06:53,066
Xinxin!

99
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:55,907
(So much I thought I'd forgotten.)

100
00:06:57,746 --> 00:06:59,746
(Guess I didn't want to remember.)

101
00:06:59,946 --> 00:07:01,547
(Yunzhou)
(Selective amnesia, maybe?)

102
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:18,091
(But later,)

103
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,370
(when Mr. Changxi gave my mom's diary)

104
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:22,130
(to me,)

105
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:26,250
(every memory flooded in.)

106
00:07:28,011 --> 00:07:29,290
Ms. Shuangxiu.

107
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:35,690
I'm begging you.

108
00:07:36,651 --> 00:07:38,170
Give Xinxin back to me.

109
00:07:39,851 --> 00:07:41,290
I'll do anything.

110
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,130
Anything?

111
00:07:45,411 --> 00:07:47,891
Yes, anything.

112
00:07:51,091 --> 00:07:52,451
I want Yan Huanshan.

113
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,211
I want Roadsound Mine.

114
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:57,810
And I also want

115
00:08:07,651 --> 00:08:08,610
you gone.

116
00:08:21,738 --> 00:08:22,699
Mr. Changxi told me

117
00:08:22,818 --> 00:08:24,659
everything about what happened next.

118
00:08:29,618 --> 00:08:31,339
He's really open with you.

119
00:08:33,658 --> 00:08:35,299
Ms. Lu's quite open with you too.

120
00:08:41,579 --> 00:08:45,219
That shows we're quite trustworthy.

121
00:08:52,219 --> 00:08:54,378
Since you've shared so openly,

122
00:08:55,658 --> 00:08:57,738
I'll share my childhood with you too.

123
00:08:59,579 --> 00:09:01,699
That dirty old man?

124
00:09:12,074 --> 00:09:12,994
Do you know

125
00:09:14,873 --> 00:09:16,234
why I'm afraid of water?

126
00:09:21,234 --> 00:09:22,834
My mom was also a South Mountain Hunter.

127
00:09:23,873 --> 00:09:25,234
She went on patrol 20 years ago,

128
00:09:25,954 --> 00:09:26,994
ran into an Earth Fiend,

129
00:09:28,033 --> 00:09:29,273
and never returned.

130
00:09:32,033 --> 00:09:33,714
My dad was heartbroken.

131
00:09:34,314 --> 00:09:35,633
He kept saying he'd go find her.

132
00:09:36,553 --> 00:09:38,273
My biggest fear back then

133
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:42,434
was that my dad would leave me too.

134
00:09:52,434 --> 00:09:53,153
Dad.

135
00:09:58,666 --> 00:09:59,507
Dad.

136
00:10:00,227 --> 00:10:02,227
Dad, weren't you taking me boating?

137
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,546
Come over quickly.

138
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:06,306
Dad.

139
00:10:08,027 --> 00:10:08,826
Come here.

140
00:10:31,754 --> 00:10:33,173
Dad, are you ready yet?

141
00:11:05,514 --> 00:11:06,234
Luo.

142
00:11:14,914 --> 00:11:16,673
Look, they're selling ice pops
over there.

143
00:11:18,274 --> 00:11:19,274
I'm thirsty.

144
00:11:20,114 --> 00:11:21,634
Buy an ice pop for me

145
00:11:22,673 --> 00:11:24,394
and one for yourself too, okay?

146
00:11:29,234 --> 00:11:30,073
Okay.

147
00:11:54,826 --> 00:11:55,505
Luo,

148
00:11:57,505 --> 00:11:58,346
thank you.

149
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:43,691
Here, little one.

150
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:44,730
Thank you.

151
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:45,451
You're welcome.

152
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:54,036
(Ice Pop)

153
00:12:56,595 --> 00:13:01,779
(Deep Water; Risk of Drowning)

154
00:13:15,331 --> 00:13:16,211
Dad!

155
00:13:16,211 --> 00:13:17,610
Dad!

156
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:32,411
Dad!

157
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,411
Dad! Dad!

158
00:13:39,331 --> 00:13:40,211
Dad!

159
00:13:42,691 --> 00:13:44,571
Dad!

160
00:13:45,171 --> 00:13:48,530
Dad, come here, please!

161
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,490
Dad!

162
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:53,730
Dad, please come here!

163
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:59,490
Dad!

164
00:14:00,091 --> 00:14:01,971
Dad, come here!

165
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,931
(Thankfully, my dad was rescued.)

166
00:14:11,691 --> 00:14:13,370
(But he became a different person.)

167
00:14:14,971 --> 00:14:15,971
(From then on,)

168
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:17,850
(I've been afraid of water.)

169
00:14:22,986 --> 00:14:23,826
I'm sorry.

170
00:14:24,986 --> 00:14:28,545
I-I was terrible before.

171
00:14:35,978 --> 00:14:37,897
As a child, I didn't understand

172
00:14:38,857 --> 00:14:41,377
what 'severe depression'
on his medical record meant.

173
00:14:42,938 --> 00:14:44,617
I just knew he shut himself indoors

174
00:14:44,737 --> 00:14:46,017
and wouldn't eat anything.

175
00:14:47,537 --> 00:14:50,377
In the end, I still couldn't keep him.

176
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:10,563
The Laogong acupoint.

177
00:15:11,923 --> 00:15:13,002
My mom taught me.

178
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:24,113
Come on, time for school.

179
00:15:27,954 --> 00:15:28,833
What's wrong?

180
00:15:32,034 --> 00:15:32,993
Don't worry.

181
00:15:32,993 --> 00:15:34,873
You will be fine.

182
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:37,113
You've memorized that poem perfectly.

183
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,074
But, Mom,

184
00:15:39,274 --> 00:15:42,833
I've never recited it
before the whole class.

185
00:15:43,194 --> 00:15:44,194
I see.

186
00:15:44,674 --> 00:15:45,394
Alright.

187
00:15:45,794 --> 00:15:47,394
I will teach you a trick.

188
00:15:48,753 --> 00:15:50,394
Give me your hand.

189
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:56,233
This spot is the Laogong acupoint.

190
00:15:56,394 --> 00:15:58,113
When you're nervous or anxious,

191
00:15:58,113 --> 00:15:59,233
press here.

192
00:15:59,674 --> 00:16:01,593
It'll calm you quickly.

193
00:16:02,274 --> 00:16:03,873
Mom, it hurts a little.

194
00:16:04,314 --> 00:16:06,674
That soreness means it's working.

195
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:10,314
Now try it yourself.

196
00:16:24,753 --> 00:16:27,554
Seems effective, Dr. Yan.

197
00:16:29,314 --> 00:16:30,753
I'm no doctor.

198
00:16:33,873 --> 00:16:36,113
We both lost our parents young.

199
00:16:36,713 --> 00:16:38,034
Just kindred spirits.

200
00:16:39,314 --> 00:16:41,434
More like therapy buddies.

201
00:16:42,074 --> 00:16:43,833
Don't say therapy buddies.

202
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:44,593
It's bad luck.

203
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:46,554
Okay.

204
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,714
(No Entry)

205
00:21:51,073 --> 00:21:51,753
Shen.

206
00:21:53,394 --> 00:21:54,394
How is it down there?

207
00:21:57,154 --> 00:21:58,594
That humanoid Earth Fiend

208
00:21:59,713 --> 00:22:01,273
and Sun Zhou's corpse

209
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:03,273
are both down there.

210
00:22:03,273 --> 00:22:04,753
How many humanoid Earth Fiends exist?

211
00:22:04,914 --> 00:22:06,194
Why are they in this mine too?

212
00:22:08,114 --> 00:22:09,914
He must be the one named You Peng

213
00:22:10,154 --> 00:22:11,394
in the file.

214
00:22:12,954 --> 00:22:14,233
Hope they don't have a second

215
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:15,114
or a third file.

216
00:22:16,674 --> 00:22:17,674
It's hard to say.

217
00:22:19,394 --> 00:22:20,634
But for now,

218
00:22:21,793 --> 00:22:22,793
Lin Xirou probably

219
00:22:22,793 --> 00:22:24,594
doesn't know what happened here.

220
00:22:27,073 --> 00:22:27,793
Shan Qiang

221
00:22:27,793 --> 00:22:29,033
has been using their phone

222
00:22:29,033 --> 00:22:29,954
to keep them updated.

223
00:22:30,473 --> 00:22:31,793
But it won't last much longer.

224
00:22:32,354 --> 00:22:33,594
They do regular inspections.

225
00:22:34,313 --> 00:22:36,233
Why don't we clean up down there

226
00:22:36,233 --> 00:22:36,993
to cover it up?

227
00:22:39,354 --> 00:22:40,473
That's unnecessary now.

228
00:22:43,586 --> 00:22:50,050
(Roadsound Mining)

229
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:55,233
Any new discoveries?

230
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:03,073
The South Mountain Ocarina.

231
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:05,273
Soil was taken from Turquoise Land

232
00:23:05,993 --> 00:23:07,914
and tempered with natural fire

233
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:11,354
to craft an instrument with ten holes.

234
00:23:11,753 --> 00:23:14,594
Its five tones and eight sounds
govern heaven and earth

235
00:23:14,594 --> 00:23:15,993
with the Dao as its score.

236
00:23:16,513 --> 00:23:19,354
Humans follow earth, earth follows
heaven, and heaven follows Dao.

237
00:23:19,954 --> 00:23:22,993
Its profound sound
reaches the underworld.

238
00:23:23,753 --> 00:23:26,073
The underworld is where fiends dwell.

239
00:23:26,434 --> 00:23:30,394
Lurking beneath Turquoise Land,
they heed the ocarina's call.

240
00:23:30,394 --> 00:23:33,233
Humans and fiends share paths,
merging into South Mountain.

241
00:23:35,033 --> 00:23:36,033
Which book is this from?

242
00:23:36,513 --> 00:23:38,674
South Mountain Hunters' Miscellany.

243
00:23:39,594 --> 00:23:40,993
(The South Mountain Ocarina)
Humans and fiends share paths,

244
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,194
merging into South Mountain.

245
00:23:49,313 --> 00:23:50,713
Does the book mention

246
00:23:51,674 --> 00:23:52,793
where this thing is located?

247
00:23:53,922 --> 00:23:56,033
Village...

248
00:23:56,233 --> 00:23:56,793
Village...

249
00:23:56,993 --> 00:23:58,273
Village Four.

250
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:55,938
(Open, Welcome)

251
00:24:56,066 --> 00:24:59,650

252

253
00:25:16,834 --> 00:25:19,233
I'll take this one then.

254
00:25:19,233 --> 00:25:20,473
Good choice.

255
00:25:20,473 --> 00:25:21,553
- Let's go.
- What?

256
00:25:21,793 --> 00:25:22,834
Take care.

257
00:25:22,834 --> 00:25:23,874
Don't look back.

258
00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:29,094
(Wake up.)

259
00:25:34,434 --> 00:25:35,674
You'll be free soon.

260
00:25:37,594 --> 00:25:38,834
Who are you really?

261
00:25:40,273 --> 00:25:41,394
Not a bad person, anyway.

262
00:25:42,954 --> 00:25:43,674
Give me your hand.

263
00:26:00,194 --> 00:26:03,778
(Lin Ling; How are you lately?)

264
00:26:14,018 --> 00:26:17,026
(Are you okay?)

265
00:26:18,018 --> 00:26:20,354
(I...)

266
00:26:54,274 --> 00:26:56,322
(To Mr. Yan)

267
00:27:29,442 --> 00:27:36,109
(Frostbite Ointment)

268
00:29:17,114 --> 00:29:17,834
Come in.

269
00:29:25,594 --> 00:29:27,713
Lin Ling and Mr. Changxi
know you're back.

270
00:29:28,354 --> 00:29:30,154
Do you want to say hello?

271
00:29:42,834 --> 00:29:43,594
I...

272
00:29:45,273 --> 00:29:46,434
I want

273
00:29:48,634 --> 00:29:49,434
a haircut.

274
00:29:52,834 --> 00:29:53,553
Sure.

275
00:29:54,713 --> 00:29:55,674
Eat your meal first.

276
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:27,594
Don't worry. Just relax.

277
00:33:49,474 --> 00:33:51,434
(Peace and Joy, All Things Go Well)

278
00:33:51,434 --> 00:33:53,073
To some degree,

279
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:54,434
a haircut is a sculpture too.

280
00:33:54,674 --> 00:33:56,834
Bit by bit, from outline to detail.

281
00:34:00,394 --> 00:34:01,033
How is it?

282
00:34:03,273 --> 00:34:03,874
Thanks.

283
00:34:06,874 --> 00:34:07,874
Time to shave.

284
00:34:10,834 --> 00:34:11,794
I'll do it myself.

285
00:34:18,834 --> 00:34:20,993
No rush. Take your time.

286
00:34:31,914 --> 00:34:33,073
The dumplings are ready.

287
00:34:33,794 --> 00:34:34,754
What are you doing?

288
00:34:34,754 --> 00:34:36,113
Cooking dumplings in the hot pot?

289
00:34:36,834 --> 00:34:37,993
For hot pot staple food,

290
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:39,354
instant noodles are the best.

291
00:34:44,754 --> 00:34:45,394
Tuo.

292
00:34:49,673 --> 00:34:51,834
Is there room for me?

293
00:34:54,754 --> 00:34:56,473
Of course, we have room for you.

294
00:34:56,874 --> 00:34:58,234
Tuo, hurry and join us.

295
00:34:58,234 --> 00:34:59,673
The pot's boiling, Mr. Yan.

296
00:34:59,673 --> 00:35:00,394
Come join us.

297
00:35:00,394 --> 00:35:00,954
Okay.

298
00:35:02,954 --> 00:35:03,513

299
00:35:03,993 --> 00:35:04,633

300
00:35:05,033 --> 00:35:06,354
Come on. Take your seats.

301
00:35:08,434 --> 00:35:09,394
Sit down, everyone.

302
00:35:13,553 --> 00:35:14,593
Tuo, want some of this?

303
00:35:20,274 --> 00:35:22,394
Here, have some meat.

304
00:35:26,354 --> 00:35:27,434
Are they shooting stars?

305
00:35:29,633 --> 00:35:31,434
Yes, they are.

306
00:35:32,394 --> 00:35:34,033
So many. Must be a meteor shower.

307
00:35:34,033 --> 00:35:34,834
