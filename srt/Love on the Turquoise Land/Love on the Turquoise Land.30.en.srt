Where are you going?

22
00:02:44,258 --> 00:02:45,298
To find Luo.

23
00:02:46,577 --> 00:02:47,376
Luo?

24
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:50,017
What happened to her?

00:03:07,216 --> 00:03:08,017

29
00:03:28,232 --> 00:03:29,313

We're free now.

32
00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:52,002
You all promised me

33
00:03:54,602 --> 00:03:55,881
to come back safe.

34
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,602
I will bring her back.

35
00:04:00,593 --> 00:04:01,393
I definitely will.

00:04:19,056 --> 00:04:20,368
(Entrusted by All, Aid from All Sides)

38
00:04:26,864 --> 00:04:32,048
(Entrusted by All, Aid from All Sides)

39
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:35,081
Are you sure it was her?

40
00:04:35,761 --> 00:04:36,561
It must be.

41
00:04:37,561 --> 00:04:38,680
Luo once told me

42
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,321
her mother died while repairing

43
00:04:41,321 --> 00:04:42,321
the Golden Gate.

44
00:04:42,321 --> 00:04:43,697
But no one ever found her body.

45
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,081
Once enter the Twilight Chasm,

46
00:04:49,641 --> 00:04:50,761
no human can be alive.

47
00:04:51,841 --> 00:04:53,120
So, in the very beginning,

48
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,761
whenever Hunters got wounded
by Earth Fiends,

49
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,872
to prevent harming others
after transforming,

50
00:04:58,096 --> 00:04:59,800
they'd exile themselves
in the Golden Gate.

51
00:05:00,761 --> 00:05:02,720
We inherit this tradition.

52
00:05:05,441 --> 00:05:07,480
But the Hunters back then didn't realize

53
00:05:08,281 --> 00:05:09,600
that once those wounded by fiends

54
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,160
entered the Twilight Chasm,

55
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,161
they would transform into something
neither human nor fiend.

56
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,161
Earth Demons.

57
00:05:15,312 --> 00:05:18,000
They lose consciousness gradually,
and can only act on instinct.

58
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,760
So Luo's mother is

59
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,400
a South Mountain Hunter
who exiled herself

60
00:05:25,081 --> 00:05:26,120
and has survived

61
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,281
as an Earth Demon.

62
00:05:29,921 --> 00:05:31,640
Survived as an Earth Demon?

63
00:05:35,281 --> 00:05:36,400
Luo is still alive.

64
00:05:38,201 --> 00:05:39,281
She might be protected

65
00:05:39,281 --> 00:05:41,120
by her mother somewhere
in the Twilight Chasm.

66
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,441
Have you forgotten?

67
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,480
Back in the Twilight Chasm,

68
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,161
Earth Demons

69
00:05:45,161 --> 00:05:46,640
attacked even us.

70
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,240
No.

71
00:05:48,921 --> 00:05:50,640
I think they're different
from Earth Fiends.

72
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,161
I saw her by the riverbank.

73
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,240
She still had consciousness

74
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,600
and wanted to protect Luo.

75
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:03,161
I believe so.

76
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,640
Check one more time.

77
00:06:08,841 --> 00:06:11,600
The Life-Death Blade, Ghost Whip,
Copper Hammer, War Ocarina.

78
00:06:11,921 --> 00:06:13,240
Don't worry. We have everything.

79
00:06:13,801 --> 00:06:15,161
Done your War Ocarina practice?

80
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,321
Almost done.

81
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,600
I practice according
to Ma Hanzi's old score.

82
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,921
Let's hope it works.

83
00:06:20,201 --> 00:06:20,760
But what if...

84
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,760
No "what ifs".

85
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:38,700
Let's go.

86
00:10:39,841 --> 00:10:40,561
Put that down.

87
00:10:46,281 --> 00:10:47,480
You're Pei Ke,

88
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:49,640
Luo's mother, right?

89
00:10:53,321 --> 00:10:54,480
Where is Luo?

90
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,801
Can you understand me?

91
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,681
I'm looking for Nie Jiuluo.

92
00:11:00,801 --> 00:11:02,000
Do you know where she is?

93
00:11:18,921 --> 00:11:21,400
Do you mean she fell into the river?

94
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,281
Pei Ke.

95
00:12:21,873 --> 00:12:22,833
The wind was so strong

96
00:12:22,954 --> 00:12:24,208
that it blew the window open.

97
00:12:30,033 --> 00:12:32,593
Luo's agent came today.

98
00:12:33,873 --> 00:12:36,154
He suspected something happened to Luo

99
00:12:36,234 --> 00:12:37,873
and made a scene here.

100
00:12:40,474 --> 00:12:41,273
I see.

101
00:12:42,873 --> 00:12:43,553
It's fine.

102
00:12:44,194 --> 00:12:45,434
At least besides us,

103
00:12:45,793 --> 00:12:47,033
someone else cares about her.

104
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:55,313
Take this.

105
00:12:57,328 --> 00:12:58,576
The password is your birthday.

106
00:13:01,873 --> 00:13:02,633

107
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,154
What do you mean?

108
00:13:06,234 --> 00:13:07,154
I don't know

109
00:13:07,994 --> 00:13:09,514
when I'll be back.

110
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,273
I bet you don't want to go back

111
00:13:12,714 --> 00:13:13,833
to the Roadsound house.

112
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:16,434
So live here peacefully.

113
00:13:18,313 --> 00:13:19,914
If you get bored, go out and have fun.

114
00:13:20,593 --> 00:13:21,754
Don't worry about anything.

115
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,073
Be bold, be free.

116
00:13:28,154 --> 00:13:29,674
Don't live for anyone,

117
00:13:30,073 --> 00:13:31,273
only for yourself.

118
00:13:38,033 --> 00:13:40,714
You could go travel,

119
00:13:41,714 --> 00:13:42,553
study abroad,

120
00:13:43,474 --> 00:13:45,194
or invest in a business.

121
00:13:45,313 --> 00:13:45,914
Or you can...

122
00:13:45,914 --> 00:13:47,033
I won't go anywhere.

123
00:13:49,793 --> 00:13:51,194
I'll wait here for you.

124
00:14:14,736 --> 00:14:18,000
(No Signal)

125
00:14:26,714 --> 00:14:29,593
Even if Luo was still alive
when she fell into the water,

126
00:14:30,593 --> 00:14:31,833
it's been so long now,

127
00:14:32,674 --> 00:14:35,313
and the environment here...

128
00:14:38,474 --> 00:14:39,434
No offense.

129
00:14:40,353 --> 00:14:42,873
Just want you to be mentally prepared
for any situation.

130
00:14:46,033 --> 00:14:46,793
Actually,

131
00:14:48,394 --> 00:14:50,154
I'm not doing so only to save her,

132
00:14:50,896 --> 00:14:52,434
but also to get an answer for myself.

133
00:14:53,353 --> 00:14:54,553
Otherwise, I'll live

134
00:14:54,553 --> 00:14:56,273
in guilt and regret.

135
00:15:03,394 --> 00:15:04,714
Glad that you thought it through.

136
00:15:48,633 --> 00:15:49,633
Stay safe.

137
00:16:37,793 --> 00:16:38,633
Can you hear me?

138
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:41,434
Everything's normal.

139
00:17:15,754 --> 00:17:16,994
Monitor the oxygen supply.

140
00:17:17,754 --> 00:17:19,113
Don't descend too quickly.

141
00:17:36,553 --> 00:17:37,434
From my perspective,

142
00:17:38,608 --> 00:17:39,714
this scene looks like

143
00:17:39,714 --> 00:17:41,328
the ultrasound during prenatal checkups.

144
00:17:42,672 --> 00:17:44,208
Before I met Jiang,

145
00:17:44,944 --> 00:17:46,544
I interned in obstetrics and gynecology.

146
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,353
In my very first year there,

147
00:17:51,033 --> 00:17:52,714
I saw a pregnant woman got miscarried.

148
00:17:53,793 --> 00:17:55,273
She kept blaming herself.

149
00:17:57,073 --> 00:17:58,113
No one can comfort her.

150
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:01,633
She said

151
00:18:02,394 --> 00:18:04,873
children choose families
filled with love to be born into.

152
00:18:06,273 --> 00:18:07,514
Her child didn't come to her,

153
00:18:07,514 --> 00:18:09,648
because he noticed his parents
didn't love him enough.

154
00:18:10,914 --> 00:18:13,234
True parents

155
00:18:13,234 --> 00:18:14,914
are those who would sacrifice all

156
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:16,633
for their child.

157
00:18:17,793 --> 00:18:19,514
This is why during childbirth,

158
00:18:19,994 --> 00:18:21,793
the mothers suffer
such excruciating pain.

159
00:18:44,553 --> 00:18:45,273
Wait.

160
00:18:46,474 --> 00:18:47,633
The temperature is rising.

161
00:18:48,073 --> 00:18:49,394
There's a heat source beneath.

162
00:18:53,553 --> 00:18:55,194
Might be a unique geological structure.

163
00:18:55,353 --> 00:18:56,674
It's hard to tell what it is.

164
00:18:56,954 --> 00:18:57,674
Come back now.

165
00:19:17,113 --> 00:19:18,474
