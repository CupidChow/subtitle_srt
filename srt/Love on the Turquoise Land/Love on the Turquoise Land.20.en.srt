she's been monitoring Lin Ling.

No problem so far.

could stop causing trouble,

Yes.

Sis, you look well.

66
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,536
Dr. Lv, what's wrong?

67
00:10:10,536 --> 00:10:11,776
I went for a home consultation.

68
00:10:11,857 --> 00:10:13,896
Just dropped off some tonic herbs
for Ms. Lin.

69
00:10:14,536 --> 00:10:16,776
Ms. Lin is not here.
I'll pass them to her.

70
00:10:27,576 --> 00:10:28,617
Ms. Lin is not here.

71
00:10:28,737 --> 00:10:30,176
Can't I visit others?

72
00:10:34,337 --> 00:10:35,617
Perfect timing.

73
00:10:36,377 --> 00:10:38,536
Today, Ms. Lin is not here.

74
00:10:38,656 --> 00:10:40,737
I don't want to eat alone.

75
00:10:41,296 --> 00:10:42,056
Sis.

76
00:10:42,457 --> 00:10:44,176
Please keep Dr. Lv for dinner.

77
00:10:44,257 --> 00:10:46,296
What? No need.

78
00:10:46,377 --> 00:10:48,416
Making it seem like I came for dinner.

79
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:50,696
What's on the menu?

80
00:11:05,296 --> 00:11:06,337
Don't exhaust yourself.

81
00:11:06,377 --> 00:11:08,296
I'll just finish up any leftovers.

82
00:12:15,696 --> 00:12:16,416
This is too much.

83
00:12:17,217 --> 00:12:18,936
Can't you just make simple dishes?

84
00:12:24,457 --> 00:12:26,457
Since Ms. Lin is away, sit down and eat.

85
00:12:26,737 --> 00:12:27,457
Heard me?

86
00:12:27,977 --> 00:12:28,656
Just be casual.

87
00:12:28,656 --> 00:12:29,337
No need.

88
00:12:32,296 --> 00:12:32,896
Fine.

89
00:12:39,457 --> 00:12:41,017
I never realized this table was huge.

90
00:12:41,776 --> 00:12:43,776
Ms. Lin's presence dominated the space.

91
00:12:44,337 --> 00:12:45,176
Now look.

92
00:12:47,656 --> 00:12:48,457
People always say,

93
00:12:49,296 --> 00:12:50,617
"Comfort beats a full meal."

94
00:12:52,017 --> 00:12:53,857
This table is big enough
to eat lying down.

95
00:13:02,497 --> 00:13:06,457
You mentioned
practicing pour-over coffee.

96
00:13:06,737 --> 00:13:07,857
How's it going?

97
00:13:08,017 --> 00:13:10,056
Forget it. I gave up.

98
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:13,936
I couldn't even maintain
the proper water temperature.

99
00:13:14,656 --> 00:13:15,857
Taste was even worse.

100
00:13:16,617 --> 00:13:17,257
True.

101
00:13:17,776 --> 00:13:19,936
I brew coffee at Wanbao Tower.

102
00:13:19,936 --> 00:13:21,936
It always ends up
tasting like herbal residue.

103
00:13:22,377 --> 00:13:23,536
Forget it. I can't master it.

104
00:13:24,017 --> 00:13:25,337
I'll just drink

105
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:26,617
the coffee from coffee maker.

106
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:31,056
Guess you influenced me.

107
00:13:31,776 --> 00:13:34,656
Lately I've been obsessed with mixology.

108
00:13:37,497 --> 00:13:38,536
Got such a refined hobby?

109
00:13:39,536 --> 00:13:41,337
Ms. Lin has every liquor here.

110
00:13:41,857 --> 00:13:43,137
I just mix it for fun.

111
00:13:43,576 --> 00:13:44,497
I don't drink it,

112
00:13:45,337 --> 00:13:47,776
but enjoy mixing it.

113
00:13:48,497 --> 00:13:50,017
It feels good when doing it.

114
00:13:50,017 --> 00:13:50,656
Right?

115
00:13:52,776 --> 00:13:55,017
Any single bottle
from Ms. Lin's collection

116
00:13:55,017 --> 00:13:56,377
costs half my monthly earnings.

117
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,416
Yet you mix it for fun?

118
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:58,416
What a waste!

119
00:14:00,217 --> 00:14:01,257
I'll mix one for you.

120
00:14:01,696 --> 00:14:02,377
Now?

121
00:14:06,017 --> 00:14:08,977
Comfort beats a full meal.

122
00:14:09,576 --> 00:14:12,056
It's perfect
to get one drink with dishes.

123
00:14:15,776 --> 00:14:16,457
Just wait.

124
00:14:19,056 --> 00:14:20,816
Wait, don't pour so much.

125
00:14:20,816 --> 00:14:21,857
I don't hold my liquor.

126
00:14:28,936 --> 00:14:29,617
Peng.

127
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:31,936
Come on.

128
00:14:34,617 --> 00:14:35,816
How much is your salary?

129
00:14:35,936 --> 00:14:37,017
You're so principled.

130
00:14:45,857 --> 00:14:49,017
Since when did you start liking this?

131
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:54,936
Do you think I truly like it?

132
00:14:56,217 --> 00:14:57,097
What do you mean?

133
00:15:01,696 --> 00:15:03,176
What do you

134
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:05,497
think of Lv Xian?

135
00:15:09,137 --> 00:15:12,457
Ms. Lin is always right.

136
00:15:16,696 --> 00:15:17,816
I didn't

137
00:15:18,056 --> 00:15:19,536
like him at first,

138
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,017
but after spending time together,

139
00:15:24,097 --> 00:15:26,017
I felt he's quite approachable.

140
00:15:26,896 --> 00:15:28,896
Dr. Lv has always been easygoing.

141
00:15:32,857 --> 00:15:34,737
I wonder how well he holds his liquor.

142
00:15:37,776 --> 00:15:38,816
How much wine

143
00:15:39,617 --> 00:15:40,776
can get him drunk

144
00:15:41,776 --> 00:15:43,176
and let him stay tonight?

145
00:16:11,857 --> 00:16:12,576
Sis.

146
00:16:15,097 --> 00:16:18,056
Did you change my bedsheets?

147
00:16:39,257 --> 00:16:39,977
What's wrong?

148
00:16:40,977 --> 00:16:41,737
Let me check.

149
00:16:42,857 --> 00:16:44,296
Lin Ling.

150
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,072
(Cargo handling zone, no parking here)

151
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,417
Why are you parking here?

152
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:26,977
What's wrong?

153
00:17:30,296 --> 00:17:31,217
Drive away now!

154
00:17:33,217 --> 00:17:34,977
Can't you see the "No Parking" sign?

155
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:40,737
Open your eyes to see,
or I'll pluck them out.

156
00:17:41,257 --> 00:17:43,217
Keep your mouth shut,
or I'll rip it apart.

157
00:17:51,257 --> 00:17:51,816
What now?

158
00:17:52,897 --> 00:17:53,776
Don't touch me.

159
00:17:58,096 --> 00:18:00,217
Don't pull on tricks. I'm warning you.

160
00:18:00,457 --> 00:18:02,296
I've seen plenty of scam artists.

161
00:18:02,897 --> 00:18:04,217
Get lost now!

162
00:18:11,737 --> 00:18:12,457
Goodbye, Miss.

163
00:18:12,457 --> 00:18:13,457
Okay, goodbye.

164
00:18:16,017 --> 00:18:16,576
Hello.

165
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:17,697
Hello.

166
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:19,897
I want to know more about the courses.

167
00:18:21,136 --> 00:18:22,657
Meng Tong, you go home.

168
00:18:22,856 --> 00:18:24,017
Come on time tomorrow.

169
00:18:24,056 --> 00:18:24,657
Bye.

170
00:18:25,417 --> 00:18:26,177
This way, please.

172
00:18:52,897 --> 00:18:54,217
Going that far at night?

173
00:18:56,616 --> 00:18:57,417
For fun?

174
00:18:58,697 --> 00:19:00,017
We're birdwatching.

175
00:19:00,657 --> 00:19:02,937
Some rare species are nocturnal.

176
00:19:06,177 --> 00:19:07,376
(Hello.)

00:19:07,376 --> 00:19:10,697

Madam.

180
00:19:22,737 --> 00:19:23,977
Two bowls of noodles, please.

181
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,257
We're closed.

182
00:19:26,497 --> 00:19:28,096
We'll leave right after eating.

183
00:19:35,937 --> 00:19:36,576
Come in.

184
00:19:36,977 --> 00:19:37,576
Thanks.

185
00:21:15,937 --> 00:21:17,616
Peng, start the car.

186
00:21:17,897 --> 00:21:18,457
Okay.

187
00:21:18,776 --> 00:21:19,737
Hang in there, Lin Ling.

188
00:21:19,856 --> 00:21:20,776
Wanbao Tower isn't far.

189
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:25,616
I said don't touch me.

190
00:21:30,336 --> 00:21:31,257
Don't touch me.

191
00:21:34,217 --> 00:21:35,497
I told you.

192
00:21:39,697 --> 00:21:41,497
It's okay.

193
00:21:44,776 --> 00:21:45,417
It's okay.

194
00:21:48,697 --> 00:21:49,776
Who are you?

195
00:21:50,136 --> 00:21:50,897
I'm

196
00:21:51,616 --> 00:21:52,417
a doctor,

197
00:21:53,616 --> 00:21:54,376
veterinary doctor.

198
00:22:18,017 --> 00:22:20,257
Actually, we won't teach children
to draw realistically.

199
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:23,257
But to inspire them
to unlock their imagination

200
00:22:23,457 --> 00:22:25,056
and find their own style.

201
00:22:25,616 --> 00:22:27,336
Otherwise, at their age,

202
00:22:27,336 --> 00:22:28,937
they'd end up with improper imitation.

203
00:22:31,296 --> 00:22:34,336
Improper imitation?

204
00:22:36,136 --> 00:22:37,136
I remember a saying.

205
00:22:37,136 --> 00:22:39,657
It's difficult

206
00:22:40,096 --> 00:22:42,376
to draw common things well.

207
00:22:46,816 --> 00:22:47,417
Indeed.

208
00:22:48,737 --> 00:22:51,856
It's difficult to draw

209
00:22:51,977 --> 00:22:53,136
common things from life well.

210
00:22:53,296 --> 00:22:55,257
Because the slightest deviation

211
00:22:55,336 --> 00:22:56,296
gets noticed easily.

212
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:58,897
You're absolutely right.

213
00:23:00,056 --> 00:23:02,536
It's difficult to imitate human.

214
00:23:03,897 --> 00:23:05,336
Even if one imitates perfectly,

215
00:23:05,856 --> 00:23:07,657
one will still slip up, right?

216
00:23:14,457 --> 00:23:16,217
If you put down the pencil,

217
00:23:16,376 --> 00:23:17,737
we can talk properly.

218
00:23:50,257 --> 00:23:51,497
Forgot to ask.

219
00:23:53,336 --> 00:23:54,697
You kill human and drink blood.

220
00:23:56,697 --> 00:23:58,177
Is the meat in these noodles

221
00:23:59,457 --> 00:24:00,977
human flesh?

222
00:24:40,816 --> 00:24:42,457
Are you sure this is
the right direction?

223
00:24:43,657 --> 00:24:44,856
It shouldn't be much farther.

224
00:24:48,776 --> 00:24:49,977
You two take another taxi.

225
00:24:50,737 --> 00:24:51,536
I'm off work.

226
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:55,336
There's a birdwatching platform ahead.

227
00:24:55,856 --> 00:24:56,616
Quite noticeable.

228
00:24:57,296 --> 00:24:58,737
Drive a bit further forward, please.

229
00:25:00,257 --> 00:25:02,536
What can you even see
in this pitch darkness?

230
00:25:04,017 --> 00:25:04,616
Listen.

231
00:25:05,497 --> 00:25:06,856
Can you hear the bird chirping?

232
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,497
This is the bird we're looking for.

233
00:25:09,856 --> 00:25:10,536
What?

234
00:25:11,616 --> 00:25:12,616
Can't you even hear that?

235
00:25:13,497 --> 00:25:15,056
It's been chirping nonstop.

236
00:25:15,657 --> 00:25:16,977
The fiend.

237
00:27:11,576 --> 00:27:13,217
This batch of Yuwang Meat

238
00:27:13,336 --> 00:27:14,376
is really nice.

239
00:27:14,376 --> 00:27:16,056
Even though Conversion Shed
No. 4 is gone,

240
00:27:16,056 --> 00:27:17,417
as long as we have Yuwang Meat,

241
00:27:17,417 --> 00:27:18,657
we still have chances.

242
00:27:18,897 --> 00:27:19,856
Today's batch

243
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:22,296
is enough for one buddy's root removal.

244
00:27:24,536 --> 00:27:25,217
Hurry!

245
00:27:25,217 --> 00:27:26,096
Here!

246
00:27:26,497 --> 00:27:28,417
Help her onto that bench. Hurry!

247
00:27:30,257 --> 00:27:31,056
Easy, easy.

248
00:27:31,296 --> 00:27:32,336
Check on her.

249
00:27:32,336 --> 00:27:34,257
I can't find what I need.
You go get the gauze.

250
00:27:34,336 --> 00:27:35,937
- Where's it?
- The room to change dressing.

251
00:27:35,937 --> 00:27:37,257
You've been there a lot. Hurry!

252
00:27:37,816 --> 00:27:39,056
Apply pressure.

253
00:27:39,056 --> 00:27:40,096
Easy, easy.

254
00:27:40,376 --> 00:27:41,217
Why did she faint?

255
00:27:41,217 --> 00:27:42,096
Anemia, right?

256
00:27:42,096 --> 00:27:43,017
A little.

257
00:27:43,737 --> 00:27:45,336
Did you get it? What took you so long?

258
00:27:45,737 --> 00:27:46,776
Go help him.

259
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:47,977
I...

260
00:27:48,457 --> 00:27:49,296
Or you hold this.

261
00:27:49,296 --> 00:27:50,697
Hurry up, okay?

262
00:27:51,776 --> 00:27:54,096
Hurry up. It might be a severe wound.

263
00:27:54,096 --> 00:27:55,536
Her fingers might get stiff.

264
00:28:10,816 --> 00:28:11,657
Found it?

265
00:28:24,096 --> 00:28:24,937
Wake up.

266
00:28:25,536 --> 00:28:26,257
Stop pretending.

267
00:28:29,017 --> 00:28:30,096
You'll be free soon.

268
00:28:33,497 --> 00:28:34,576
Who exactly are you?

269
00:28:36,897 --> 00:28:37,977
Not a bad guy, anyway.

270
00:28:54,737 --> 00:28:56,296
It's fine. She's a friend of Tuo.

271
00:28:56,977 --> 00:28:57,737
Are you okay?

272
00:28:58,417 --> 00:28:58,897
She's okay.

273
00:28:58,897 --> 00:29:00,217
I taught her this little trick.

274
00:29:00,336 --> 00:29:01,257
Just looks bloody.

275
00:29:01,977 --> 00:29:03,336
But she's got real grit.

276
00:29:03,737 --> 00:29:04,937
She was merciless on herself.

277
00:29:06,657 --> 00:29:07,457
We should go.

278
00:29:08,937 --> 00:29:10,536
Follow her to a safe place.

279
00:29:11,336 --> 00:29:12,017
Use my car.

280
00:29:15,017 --> 00:29:16,737
I checked it. It won't be tracked.

281
00:29:18,816 --> 00:29:19,417
Thanks.

282
00:29:20,296 --> 00:29:21,697
What about you?

283
00:29:21,776 --> 00:29:23,177
Ms. Lin will suspect you.

284
00:29:27,776 --> 00:29:29,737
Miss Nie has to do me a small favor.

285
00:29:30,536 --> 00:29:31,417
What would you do?

286
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:34,616
To leave him minor injuries like you.

287
00:29:35,697 --> 00:29:37,056
Don't worry. I can handle it.

288
00:29:40,576 --> 00:29:41,217
Let's go.

289
00:30:19,056 --> 00:30:20,897
Don't worry. No one is following us.

290
00:30:21,017 --> 00:30:21,776
I'm keeping watch.

291
00:30:25,177 --> 00:30:27,697
Lv Xian said you're Tuo's friend.

292
00:30:29,576 --> 00:30:30,856
A very trustworthy friend.

293
00:30:32,296 --> 00:30:33,616
Girlfriend?

294
00:30:38,816 --> 00:30:39,937
He told you so?

295
00:30:41,937 --> 00:30:44,697
No. Just guessing.

296
00:30:45,457 --> 00:30:47,336
Tuo doesn't trust people easily.

297
00:30:47,576 --> 00:30:49,096
He entrusted me to you.

298
00:30:50,897 --> 00:30:52,576
I bet your relationship must be special.

299
00:30:55,457 --> 00:30:56,536
You told Lv Xian

300
00:30:57,296 --> 00:30:59,657
Tuo is confined at home now, right?

301
00:31:02,257 --> 00:31:03,497
From what I remember,

302
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:07,177
Ms. Lin never confined him like this.

303
00:31:09,536 --> 00:31:11,816
So she must've discovered something.

304
00:31:14,257 --> 00:31:14,897
Don't worry.

305
00:31:16,177 --> 00:31:17,376
After settling you in,

306
00:31:17,657 --> 00:31:19,136
I'll find a way to rescue him.

307
00:31:31,096 --> 00:31:32,177
Be careful, Shen.

308
00:31:32,296 --> 00:31:33,177
Don't get bitten.

309
00:31:33,336 --> 00:31:34,776
Though she won't risk omnivory.

310
00:31:35,336 --> 00:31:36,177
Focus on driving.

311
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,921
(Xing Shen)

312
00:31:49,376 --> 00:31:50,576
Someone is here. Be brief.

313
00:31:51,336 --> 00:31:52,737
All four rats are in the cage.

314
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,657
Is the cat unharmed?

315
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:56,296
Perfectly unharmed.

316
00:31:57,616 --> 00:31:59,257
Good. Talk later.

317
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,056
(Wanbao Tower)

318
00:32:52,536 --> 00:32:53,136
Sis.

319
00:32:53,336 --> 00:32:55,536
Ms. Lin, Lin Ling has been taken away.

320
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,768
(Changxi Dumplings)

321
00:33:15,017 --> 00:33:16,816
Who is it at this hour?

322
00:33:24,136 --> 00:33:24,977
Miss Nie.

323
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:25,937
Mr. Changxi.

324
00:33:26,816 --> 00:33:28,376
Sorry to bother you at this hour.

325
00:33:29,136 --> 00:33:30,417
This is Yan Tuo's sister,

326
00:33:30,417 --> 00:33:31,136
Lin Ling.

327
00:33:32,336 --> 00:33:33,217
Hello, Mr. Changxi.

328
00:33:33,737 --> 00:33:34,457
Hello.

329
00:33:35,977 --> 00:33:38,056
Tuo mentioned you before. You...

330
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:41,017
Come in first.

331
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:46,937
Have a seat.

332
00:33:51,897 --> 00:33:52,616
Well...

333
00:33:53,697 --> 00:33:54,457
Mr. Changxi,

334
00:33:54,816 --> 00:33:56,296
we've run into some trouble.

335
00:33:56,417 --> 00:33:57,457
Lin Ling might need

336
00:33:57,457 --> 00:33:58,856
to stay here for a while.

337
00:34:01,017 --> 00:34:02,776
Seems my place isn't a dumpling shop,

338
00:34:03,177 --> 00:34:05,217
but a Changxi Sanatorium.

339
00:34:06,536 --> 00:34:09,136
Every girl connected to Tuo

340
00:34:09,817 --> 00:34:11,417
gets sent here when injured.

341
00:34:12,616 --> 00:34:14,017
Where's Tuo?

342
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:18,777
Yan Tuo...

343
00:34:20,576 --> 00:34:21,337
Tuo...

344
00:34:23,337 --> 00:34:23,977
He...

345
00:34:28,417 --> 00:34:30,377
Wait, what's wrong with him?

346
00:34:31,216 --> 00:34:32,176
What happened to Tuo?

347
00:34:33,056 --> 00:34:34,656
Nothing, Mr. Changxi. Don't worry.

348
00:34:35,497 --> 00:34:37,096
Yan Tuo has been busy.

349
00:34:37,417 --> 00:34:39,297
But I don't know exactly
what he's doing.

350
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:41,256
When he returns,

351
00:34:41,656 --> 00:34:42,817
he'll explain it to you.

352
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:46,616
I see. You can't tell me.

353
00:34:46,937 --> 00:34:47,897
And I won't ask further.

354
00:34:48,096 --> 00:34:48,616
Alright then.

355
00:34:48,817 --> 00:34:49,736
Just one thing.

356
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:52,176
Don't do anything illegal.

357
00:34:52,696 --> 00:34:53,576
Don't worry.

358
00:34:54,216 --> 00:34:56,337
Don't you trust Yan Tuo?

359
00:34:58,136 --> 00:35:00,056
Alright, sit here for a bit.

360
00:35:00,337 --> 00:35:01,576
I'll go tidy up a room.

361
00:35:02,656 --> 00:35:03,216
Need help?

362
00:35:03,216 --> 00:35:03,817
No need.

363
00:35:04,377 --> 00:35:05,136
Thank you.

364
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:05,736
Okay.

365
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,056
Don't overthink it for now.

366
00:35:14,817 --> 00:35:15,656
Get some good rest.

367
00:35:19,736 --> 00:35:21,337
I've always wanted to escape that place.

368
00:35:23,937 --> 00:35:25,857
Now that I'm out,

369
00:35:27,817 --> 00:35:29,457
and I don't know what to do.

370
00:35:35,337 --> 00:35:36,457
Starting today,

371
00:35:36,937 --> 00:35:38,096
you'll have plenty of time

372
00:35:38,096 --> 00:35:39,696
to find a way to live freely.

373
00:35:42,417 --> 00:35:44,736
Trust me, you'll love it.

374
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:52,576
It's so late now.

375
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:54,497
Wait a bit longer.

376
00:35:54,696 --> 00:35:55,417
It'll be soon.

377
00:36:02,576 --> 00:36:03,297
They're here.
