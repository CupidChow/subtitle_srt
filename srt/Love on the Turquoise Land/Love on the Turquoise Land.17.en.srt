16

=Episode 17=

17
00:01:47,088 --> 00:01:49,808
(Wanbao Tower, Welcome)

18
00:01:56,136 --> 00:01:56,815
Well,

19
00:01:57,615 --> 00:01:59,255
you came personally to pick up medicine?

20
00:01:59,696 --> 00:02:00,615
You could've told me.

21
00:02:00,615 --> 00:02:01,776
I could've delivered it.

22
00:02:02,615 --> 00:02:03,815
Ms. Lin instructed me to come.

23
00:02:05,255 --> 00:02:06,136
Ms. Lin?

24
00:02:07,136 --> 00:02:08,615
Was it really Ms. Lin's instruction?

25
00:02:09,016 --> 00:02:10,296
Or did you want to come yourself

26
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,976
to chat with me
and vent some frustrations?

27
00:02:21,175 --> 00:02:21,775
Lin Ling,

28
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:24,215
lately,

29
00:02:25,215 --> 00:02:27,016
I've had this persistent feeling.

30
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:28,455
Help me analyze this.

31
00:02:31,935 --> 00:02:33,296
Should I not

32
00:02:34,215 --> 00:02:35,976
have the surname Lv?

33
00:02:37,335 --> 00:02:38,416
I should be named 'Pin.'

34
00:02:40,856 --> 00:02:42,256
For the character's extra mouth?

35
00:02:42,335 --> 00:02:43,455
No, that's not what I meant.

36
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:45,495
'Pin' for 'savor.'
I'm someone worth savoring.

37
00:02:46,696 --> 00:02:47,856
The more you savor me,

38
00:02:48,136 --> 00:02:49,296
the more you appreciate me.

39
00:02:51,576 --> 00:02:54,495
Like stinky tofu, durian,
or river snail noodles?

40
00:02:55,296 --> 00:02:56,215
Close enough.

41
00:02:56,895 --> 00:02:58,615
They're all addictive foods.

42
00:02:58,816 --> 00:02:59,935
Once hooked, you can't quit.

43
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:02,416
I'm like traditional medicine.

44
00:03:03,655 --> 00:03:06,136
The longer it brews,
the more potent it becomes.

45
00:03:06,615 --> 00:03:08,696
And the longer it brews,
the richer the flavor.

46
00:03:13,495 --> 00:03:14,735
Check me out then.

47
00:03:15,376 --> 00:03:17,256
I feel like my life's been flavorless.

48
00:03:24,296 --> 00:03:25,335
I can't cure that.

49
00:03:27,175 --> 00:03:28,735
My medicine treats bodies, not hearts.

50
00:03:30,495 --> 00:03:31,935
For emotional wounds,

51
00:03:32,376 --> 00:03:33,455
go wander around more.

52
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,215
Having fun works best.

53
00:03:51,215 --> 00:03:51,816
Don't you think

54
00:03:51,816 --> 00:03:53,935
I'm just like caged livestock?

55
00:03:55,215 --> 00:03:56,215
I have no future

56
00:03:57,455 --> 00:03:58,495
and nowhere to escape.

57
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:03,335
Give me the medicine.

58
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,895
Tell Ms. Lin

59
00:04:06,895 --> 00:04:08,495
the dosage remains the same as before.

60
00:04:09,296 --> 00:04:10,576
This soup's for you.

61
00:04:12,136 --> 00:04:13,055
No medicinal effects.

62
00:04:13,615 --> 00:04:14,455
Just tastes good.

63
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,535
We usually check girls' pulses
on the right hand.

64
00:04:42,016 --> 00:04:42,816
You're back.

65
00:04:43,295 --> 00:04:43,975
Tuo.

66
00:04:44,455 --> 00:04:45,455
Whatever I say later,

67
00:04:45,455 --> 00:04:46,736
just play along with me.

68
00:04:47,775 --> 00:04:48,936
Lots of good food today

69
00:04:48,936 --> 00:04:49,696
waiting for you.

70
00:04:49,696 --> 00:04:50,335
Come join us.

71
00:05:19,295 --> 00:05:20,376
You went to Wanbao Tower?

72
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,095
To get Ms. Lin's medicine.

73
00:05:27,975 --> 00:05:29,056
Is Lv Xian doing well?

74
00:05:33,736 --> 00:05:34,736
He's perfectly fine.

75
00:05:37,816 --> 00:05:39,376
So you two are getting along?

76
00:05:45,056 --> 00:05:47,215
Tuo, what are you doing?

77
00:05:49,535 --> 00:05:51,535
If it works, take it further.

78
00:05:51,616 --> 00:05:53,335
If not, make a clean break.

79
00:05:53,496 --> 00:05:55,176
Ms. Lin cares about you two.

80
00:05:55,256 --> 00:05:56,736
At least give her a clear answer.

81
00:05:59,535 --> 00:06:00,256
I...

82
00:06:04,376 --> 00:06:05,095
I...

83
00:06:07,496 --> 00:06:08,855
I don't know.

84
00:06:10,936 --> 00:06:12,775
Afraid of misjudging? Uncertain, huh?

85
00:06:17,936 --> 00:06:20,215
Let me give you some advice.

86
00:06:22,576 --> 00:06:24,696
Alright, go ahead.

87
00:06:27,775 --> 00:06:28,975
Take a trip together.

88
00:06:29,335 --> 00:06:30,496
Spend a few days together.

89
00:06:30,496 --> 00:06:31,855
Any flaws will surface naturally.

90
00:06:33,496 --> 00:06:34,816
Where should we go?

91
00:06:35,335 --> 00:06:36,335
Somewhere nearby.

92
00:06:36,335 --> 00:06:37,935
Ms. Lin wouldn't approve of long trips.

93
00:06:38,455 --> 00:06:39,056
Listen.

94
00:06:39,655 --> 00:06:41,576
Xicang in the north,
Heyang in the south.

95
00:06:42,056 --> 00:06:43,855
Hanlin for landscapes
and Luhang for cuisine.

96
00:06:44,016 --> 00:06:45,496
Hanlin's scenery is quite nice.

97
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:46,535
Why not go there?

98
00:06:49,696 --> 00:06:50,855
I'm fine with that.

99
00:06:51,736 --> 00:06:54,295
Anyway, I've never been anywhere.

100
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:57,056
Look at you being shy.

101
00:06:57,895 --> 00:06:58,855
If you're so shy,

102
00:06:58,855 --> 00:06:59,816
I'll come with you.

103
00:07:09,136 --> 00:07:11,215
Aren't you supposed to play matchmaker?

104
00:07:11,895 --> 00:07:14,215
Why be a third wheel?

105
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:19,895
She's bad with words.

106
00:07:19,895 --> 00:07:20,775
If things go south,

107
00:07:20,775 --> 00:07:22,576
I'll need to feed her lines.

108
00:07:22,696 --> 00:07:23,256
Right?

109
00:07:28,095 --> 00:07:28,775
Feng Mi.

110
00:07:29,775 --> 00:07:30,895
You should go too.

111
00:07:31,335 --> 00:07:33,655
Good chance to relax and unwind.

112
00:07:33,816 --> 00:07:34,496
Sure.

113
00:07:34,936 --> 00:07:35,816
When do we leave?

114
00:07:38,056 --> 00:07:39,215
I'll contact Lv Xian first.

115
00:07:39,975 --> 00:07:40,936
It's settled then.

116
00:07:41,016 --> 00:07:41,655
To Hanlin.

117
00:07:45,816 --> 00:07:46,936
Okay, thanks.

118
00:07:52,975 --> 00:07:54,816
How about you try a bit harder?

119
00:07:55,256 --> 00:07:57,176
Just pair us up already.

120
00:07:57,855 --> 00:08:00,376
I can watch him 24/7 for you.

121
00:08:01,696 --> 00:08:03,616
You think this is a real vacation?

122
00:08:05,376 --> 00:08:07,576
After spending days together,

123
00:08:08,095 --> 00:08:10,496
I haven't noticed any major flaws.

124
00:08:12,335 --> 00:08:13,616
Your son

125
00:08:13,936 --> 00:08:15,415
is just perfect in every way.

126
00:08:19,016 --> 00:08:21,016
You're not taking this charade
for real, are you?

127
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:24,936
You taught me,

128
00:08:25,136 --> 00:08:26,215
"To act human,

129
00:08:26,535 --> 00:08:29,056
one must show real feelings."

130
00:08:30,295 --> 00:08:31,775
Blurring fake and real is one thing,

131
00:08:32,096 --> 00:08:33,575
but priorities matter most.

132
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:36,935
Ms. Lin,

133
00:08:37,295 --> 00:08:39,216
I'm just blowing off steam.

134
00:08:39,695 --> 00:08:40,775
I'd never lay a finger

135
00:08:40,775 --> 00:08:42,695
on your treasure.

136
00:08:45,216 --> 00:08:46,376
Gou Ya's gone.

137
00:08:46,535 --> 00:08:49,096
No word from Chen Fu either.

138
00:08:49,895 --> 00:08:51,935
Li Yueying sabotaged Qin Chi,

139
00:08:51,935 --> 00:08:53,456
so she couldn't remain.

140
00:08:54,655 --> 00:08:55,856
Our numbers dwindle,

141
00:08:56,376 --> 00:08:57,856
and problems grow.

142
00:09:00,336 --> 00:09:02,496
So you must keep Tuo in check for me.

143
00:09:03,096 --> 00:09:05,016
No more complications.

144
00:09:07,336 --> 00:09:09,376
Don't worry. I've got this.

145
00:09:31,736 --> 00:09:32,535
Folks,

146
00:09:33,496 --> 00:09:35,456
grab some buns for the road.

147
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:37,256
Dr. Lv, you're so thoughtful.

148
00:09:37,256 --> 00:09:38,336
It's just what we wanted.

149
00:09:40,136 --> 00:09:41,655
This is Feng Mi, right?

150
00:09:41,655 --> 00:09:42,192
Yes.

151
00:09:42,192 --> 00:09:43,175
Tuo often mentions you.

152
00:09:44,175 --> 00:09:45,695
I'm Lv Xian, a doctor.

153
00:09:46,016 --> 00:09:47,096
Doctor's compassion.

154
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,456
Have a bun.

155
00:09:49,776 --> 00:09:51,055
Men, no lotus. Women, no chives.

156
00:09:51,055 --> 00:09:51,976
It's pork and scallion.

157
00:09:53,616 --> 00:09:55,216
Eat more. You're too skinny.

158
00:09:55,496 --> 00:09:56,695
Your thigh loses to most arms.

159
00:09:57,856 --> 00:09:59,775
Ling, the soy milk's in the back.

160
00:10:01,376 --> 00:10:02,736
What fillings do you have?

161
00:10:05,175 --> 00:10:06,616
What's going on?

162
00:10:07,456 --> 00:10:08,456
I need to go to Hanlin.

163
00:10:08,456 --> 00:10:10,376
Cover for me with Lin Ling later.

164
00:10:11,935 --> 00:10:13,096
Keep this game going.

165
00:10:13,096 --> 00:10:13,496
Want some?

166
00:10:13,496 --> 00:10:15,175
Liven things up. Play it by ear.

167
00:10:15,736 --> 00:10:17,295
At least tell me the song's theme.

168
00:10:17,775 --> 00:10:18,415
Improvise.

169
00:10:18,575 --> 00:10:19,175
Let's go.

170
00:10:41,895 --> 00:10:42,736
What now?

171
00:10:43,415 --> 00:10:44,496
Food coma strikes?

172
00:10:45,055 --> 00:10:46,535
I'll play a tune.

173
00:10:47,016 --> 00:10:47,815
To wake you up.

174
00:10:55,295 --> 00:10:55,895
How's this?

175
00:10:56,016 --> 00:10:56,976
More lively, right?

176
00:11:02,535 --> 00:11:04,336
You're a medic.
Know about smelling salts?

177
00:11:05,016 --> 00:11:06,935
The stuff that wakes up
fainted patients?

178
00:11:07,216 --> 00:11:08,295
How do they work?

179
00:11:10,016 --> 00:11:11,376
Honestly? No fancy science.

180
00:11:11,815 --> 00:11:13,575
Just stink people awake.

181
00:11:13,736 --> 00:11:14,695
Exactly.

182
00:11:16,456 --> 00:11:18,376
Your tune works the same way.

183
00:11:18,376 --> 00:11:19,895
I'm wide awake now.

184
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:24,856
Not bad.

185
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:27,175
That was a slick clapback, huh?

186
00:11:28,815 --> 00:11:29,575
You,

187
00:11:29,976 --> 00:11:31,216
a spoiled brat,

188
00:11:31,456 --> 00:11:33,695
need to improve your artistic taste.

189
00:11:34,336 --> 00:11:36,376
The crassest is the classiest. Get it?

190
00:11:37,616 --> 00:11:38,256
By the way,

191
00:11:38,775 --> 00:11:41,175
aren't you a pro, Mi?

192
00:11:41,655 --> 00:11:43,175
Judge my tune, would you?

193
00:11:44,256 --> 00:11:46,976
Customers often request such music.

194
00:11:47,695 --> 00:11:48,616
See, Mr. Yan?

195
00:11:49,456 --> 00:11:51,136
You're too detached from common folks.

196
00:11:52,016 --> 00:11:53,456
For people like this,

197
00:11:53,456 --> 00:11:54,655
I don't call security.

198
00:11:54,695 --> 00:11:55,695
I kick them out myself.

199
00:11:55,695 --> 00:11:56,695
Right call.

200
00:11:58,376 --> 00:11:59,175
Fine.

201
00:11:59,376 --> 00:12:01,376
What, you guys study comic cross-talk?

202
00:12:01,376 --> 00:12:03,376
Can't roast
without setup-punchline routines?

203
00:12:04,216 --> 00:12:06,096
Alright. Mi,

204
00:12:06,376 --> 00:12:07,055
you're the pro.

205
00:12:07,055 --> 00:12:08,175
Play something decent

206
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:09,295
to cleanse my ears.

207
00:12:19,775 --> 00:12:20,695
Good grief.

208
00:12:22,856 --> 00:12:24,136
The tune suits you well.

209
00:12:36,815 --> 00:12:39,456
Find a rest area up ahead.

210
00:12:39,616 --> 00:12:40,736
My stomach's acting up.

211
00:12:41,175 --> 00:12:42,456
We just entered the highway.

212
00:12:42,456 --> 00:12:43,695
Where should I find one?

213
00:12:44,136 --> 00:12:45,695
Your buns must've been bad.

214
00:12:47,055 --> 00:12:48,616
Shouldn't have bought them.

215
00:12:48,616 --> 00:12:49,935
You bite the hand that feeds.

216
00:12:50,175 --> 00:12:50,815
Hurry.

217
00:13:06,016 --> 00:13:07,256
The youngsters are hanging out.

218
00:13:07,256 --> 00:13:08,736
Why make us follow them?

219
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:11,535
Because Ms. Lin isn't stupid.

220
00:13:13,256 --> 00:13:14,736
Xicang has enough space

221
00:13:14,935 --> 00:13:16,096
for the four of them.

222
00:13:17,655 --> 00:13:19,376
Running out to play at this time,

223
00:13:19,456 --> 00:13:20,895
they must be plotting something.

224
00:13:21,055 --> 00:13:22,376
Isn't Feng Mi with them?

225
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:25,256
Her petty schemes
can't outsmart Yan Tuo.

226
00:13:28,136 --> 00:13:28,935
True.

227
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:31,096
She's already been lured by him.

228
00:13:33,616 --> 00:13:34,415
I can't hold it.

229
00:13:35,496 --> 00:13:36,295
It's killing me.

230
00:13:36,295 --> 00:13:36,976
Drive faster.

231
00:13:36,976 --> 00:13:37,655
Hold it in.

232
00:13:37,655 --> 00:13:39,456
I really can't hold it.

233
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:40,775
Just hurry.

234
00:13:41,256 --> 00:13:43,655
Go.

235
00:13:44,175 --> 00:13:45,216
My stomach's cramping.

236
00:13:47,256 --> 00:13:48,496
What's happening?

237
00:13:48,496 --> 00:13:49,256
The toilet.

238
00:13:49,256 --> 00:13:50,456
I can't wait.

239
00:13:54,535 --> 00:13:55,376
Got to refuel.

240
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,895
Then I'll grab some food.

241
00:14:19,736 --> 00:14:20,856
Yan Tuo went to the toilet.

242
00:14:22,496 --> 00:14:24,016
The other guy got out too.

243
00:14:24,216 --> 00:14:25,415
He went to the nearby stall.

244
00:14:25,976 --> 00:14:26,695
And the girl?

245
00:14:27,775 --> 00:14:28,775
She's right by the car.

246
00:14:29,295 --> 00:14:31,055
The Earth Fiend's
guarding the toilet door.

247
00:14:32,016 --> 00:14:33,175
Yan Tuo's under close watch.

248
00:14:35,096 --> 00:14:37,096
A car's been following behind us.

249
00:14:37,575 --> 00:14:39,175
Probably Lin Xirou's people too.

250
00:15:00,096 --> 00:15:02,256
Hello? I'll reach Hanlin soon.

251
00:15:02,456 --> 00:15:03,575
Give me the exact location.

252
00:15:03,976 --> 00:15:06,096
Mr. Yan, plans have changed.

253
00:15:06,535 --> 00:15:07,376
See you in Licheng.

254
00:15:08,295 --> 00:15:09,175
Why?

255
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:10,775
Last-minute changes complicate it.

256
00:15:11,055 --> 00:15:12,336
Then you need to act fast.

257
00:15:13,175 --> 00:15:14,775
I won't wait long in Licheng.

258
00:15:15,096 --> 00:15:15,736
Wait.

259
00:15:25,736 --> 00:15:26,376
Licheng?

260
00:15:32,575 --> 00:15:33,336
Is this tasty?

261
00:15:33,856 --> 00:15:34,815
This one's sweet.

262
00:15:35,856 --> 00:15:36,535
Okay.

263
00:15:43,616 --> 00:15:44,336
Would you like it?

264
00:15:44,655 --> 00:15:45,456
Keep it.

265
00:16:27,456 --> 00:16:28,415
Put it down.

266
00:16:28,815 --> 00:16:29,935
He might drop his phone

267
00:16:29,935 --> 00:16:30,895
when reaching for it.

268
00:16:32,376 --> 00:16:34,096
Well, Tuo

269
00:16:34,415 --> 00:16:35,815
has plenty of good qualities.

270
00:16:36,136 --> 00:16:38,295
The punctual,
high-quality daily 'delivery'

271
00:16:38,295 --> 00:16:39,336
is one of them.

272
00:16:41,295 --> 00:16:43,815
He might skip meals,

273
00:16:43,935 --> 00:16:45,256
but never his toilet breaks.

274
00:16:45,856 --> 00:16:46,695
That's dedication.

275
00:16:47,616 --> 00:16:49,175
Wait, I'll hurry him up.

276
00:16:55,216 --> 00:16:56,535
Are you pinching it off?

277
00:16:58,295 --> 00:16:58,976
Here.

278
00:17:00,136 --> 00:17:00,775
Wait.

279
00:17:01,216 --> 00:17:01,815
What's wrong?

280
00:17:03,695 --> 00:17:06,736
Xiong Hei and some long-haired person
are in the parking lot too.

281
00:17:07,295 --> 00:17:08,696
They must've tailed us.

282
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:10,656
I knew it.

283
00:17:13,256 --> 00:17:14,456
Speed it up.

284
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:17,055
Stop dawdling.

285
00:17:19,095 --> 00:17:20,535
Xing Shen changed the meeting spot.

286
00:17:21,135 --> 00:17:22,375
And Feng Mi sticks close.

287
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:23,496
Are you ever done?

288
00:17:23,496 --> 00:17:24,575
Xiong Hei brought someone.

289
00:17:24,696 --> 00:17:25,815
They've been following.

290
00:17:26,095 --> 00:17:27,335
We have no chance now.

291
00:17:27,815 --> 00:17:29,575
- It keeps growing.
- We'll improvise.

292
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:35,496
Weak spleen and stomach.

293
00:17:36,335 --> 00:17:37,295
It needs attention.

294
00:17:37,615 --> 00:17:39,295
Even heroes can't endure diarrhea.

295
00:17:39,615 --> 00:17:40,095
Right.

296
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,456
Let alone making two ladies

297
00:17:41,456 --> 00:17:42,535
smell this while waiting

298
00:17:42,535 --> 00:17:43,575
doesn't make you heroic.

299
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:45,535
Mi's getting impatient.

300
00:17:45,936 --> 00:17:47,335
Right, my apologies.

301
00:17:47,456 --> 00:17:48,936
It's my stomach. Sorry for the wait.

302
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:55,095
I was scrolling through my phone

303
00:17:55,095 --> 00:17:57,055
and saw Licheng's having
a hotpot festival.

304
00:17:57,055 --> 00:17:58,216
Should we check it out?

305
00:17:59,855 --> 00:18:00,575
Licheng?

306
00:18:03,696 --> 00:18:05,095
The super popular one,

307
00:18:05,095 --> 00:18:06,696
the quadrennial hotpot event, right?

308
00:18:06,696 --> 00:18:07,416
Yeah.

309
00:18:07,855 --> 00:18:08,615
Perfect timing.

310
00:18:08,656 --> 00:18:09,335
Exactly.

311
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,456
We must go.

312
00:18:10,535 --> 00:18:11,335
Time waits for none.

313
00:18:11,496 --> 00:18:12,016
Let's go.

314
00:18:12,016 --> 00:18:12,775
Come on.

315
00:18:12,775 --> 00:18:15,496
Eating hotpot with your stomach?

316
00:18:17,016 --> 00:18:18,416
We can get a split pot.

317
00:18:18,696 --> 00:18:19,815
Plain for me, spicy for you.

318
00:18:19,815 --> 00:18:21,375
It suits our personalities, right?

319
00:18:22,775 --> 00:18:23,456
Brilliant.

320
00:18:24,016 --> 00:18:25,256
The symbolism is nice too.

321
00:18:25,575 --> 00:18:28,976
A split pot comes in pairs,
like people in love. Right?

322
00:18:34,256 --> 00:18:36,416
It's been ages since I had hotpot.

323
00:18:36,855 --> 00:18:38,575
Let's go.
I've already set the navigation.

324
00:18:38,815 --> 00:18:39,456
I'll drive.

325
00:18:39,456 --> 00:18:40,135
Perfect.

326
00:18:40,176 --> 00:18:42,135
You should eat more yam. Got it?

327
00:18:42,135 --> 00:18:43,736
It'll help your digestion.

328
00:18:45,496 --> 00:18:46,575
Wait, the snacks.

329
00:18:47,696 --> 00:18:48,815
Hotpot time.

330
00:18:51,936 --> 00:18:53,736
Yan Tuo and the others are out.

331
00:18:59,496 --> 00:19:00,976
Why change the meeting spot?

332
00:19:02,456 --> 00:19:03,696
The intel update was quick.

333
00:19:04,656 --> 00:19:06,575
Yan Tuo's being tailed by Earth Fiends.

334
00:19:06,575 --> 00:19:07,775
He can't shake them off.

335
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:08,575
You need to hurry.

336
00:19:08,575 --> 00:19:09,375
I know.

337
00:19:12,295 --> 00:19:13,335
You're following them too?

338
00:19:14,456 --> 00:19:15,936
I'm not sure if he's playing games.

339
00:19:15,936 --> 00:19:17,535
The escape could be disguised bait.

340
00:19:17,936 --> 00:19:19,216
Him feeding you intel

341
00:19:20,055 --> 00:19:21,696
could be part of a trap.

342
00:19:22,095 --> 00:19:23,496
I told you long ago.

343
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,095
Yan Tuo is trustworthy.

344
00:19:25,216 --> 00:19:25,896
Sorry.

345
00:19:26,615 --> 00:19:27,896
About whether he's trustworthy,

346
00:19:28,575 --> 00:19:29,656
I'll decide for myself.

347
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:11,696
(Roadsound Pharmaceuticals)

348
00:20:43,055 --> 00:20:44,736
(Luo: Xing Shen is after you.
Be careful.)

349
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,656
Who is that?

350
00:20:52,496 --> 00:20:53,335
I'm tuning out.

351
00:21:06,256 --> 00:21:07,696
Isn't that my tune?

352
00:21:40,775 --> 00:21:43,016
Driving this far for hotpot?

353
00:21:43,295 --> 00:21:44,256
Is it worth it?

354
00:21:45,976 --> 00:21:48,016
For authentic nine-grid hotpot,

355
00:21:48,095 --> 00:21:49,815
I'd fly to Yuxia if needed.

356
00:21:50,656 --> 00:21:53,815
Ms. Lin won't let us travel far.

357
00:21:54,295 --> 00:21:55,815
I guess Licheng will do.

358
00:21:57,256 --> 00:21:58,656
With your weak stomach,

359
00:21:58,855 --> 00:22:00,335
you still crave spicy food.

360
00:22:01,135 --> 00:22:01,936
Listen to me.

361
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:04,375
Let's just go to Yunxi.

362
00:22:04,976 --> 00:22:06,775
July and August bring fresh mushrooms.

363
00:22:07,055 --> 00:22:09,135
Mushroom soup base is nourishing.

364
00:22:09,575 --> 00:22:11,095
Might even hallucinate little fairies.

365
00:22:18,815 --> 00:22:19,456
Alright.

366
00:22:20,016 --> 00:22:20,775
Next time,

367
00:22:21,135 --> 00:22:22,775
I'll get approval
from Ms. Lin in advance.

368
00:22:22,896 --> 00:22:24,055
We can go together.

369
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,216
You'll pay for flights.

370
00:22:25,496 --> 00:22:27,295
Let's take a real trip. Deal?

371
00:22:27,815 --> 00:22:28,256
Deal.

372
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:29,575
Ling,

373
00:22:29,696 --> 00:22:30,976
any places you want to visit?

374
00:22:33,615 --> 00:22:34,615
Not sure.

375
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:39,656
Maybe somewhere by the sea.

376
00:22:40,976 --> 00:22:42,095
See that lake outside?

377
00:22:42,256 --> 00:22:43,176
Looks endless too.

378
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,575
It's no less than the sea.

379
00:22:45,456 --> 00:22:46,256
Just joking.

380
00:22:46,256 --> 00:22:46,976
(Welcome to Li Lake)

381
00:22:46,976 --> 00:22:47,615
What's that?

382
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:49,176
Naya Scenic Area.

383
00:22:49,896 --> 00:22:50,575
Right?

384
00:22:50,855 --> 00:22:51,615
North of Xicang,

385
00:22:51,976 --> 00:22:54,295
about 120 kilometers away.

386
00:22:54,335 --> 00:22:54,976
Roughly.

387
00:22:55,055 --> 00:22:55,855
Right?

388
00:22:56,216 --> 00:22:57,335
That beach is unmanaged.

389
00:22:57,335 --> 00:22:58,696
Part of the outer suburbs.

390
00:22:58,696 --> 00:23:00,736
You can set off fireworks there
during holidays.

391
00:23:01,216 --> 00:23:01,855
Awesome place.

392
00:23:04,815 --> 00:23:06,855
All your talking even made me thirsty.

393
00:23:06,855 --> 00:23:07,896
Let's get some drinks.

394
00:23:08,615 --> 00:23:09,216
Alright.

395
00:23:10,295 --> 00:23:11,016
Mi,

396
00:23:11,615 --> 00:23:12,815
why don't you come with me?

397
00:23:13,095 --> 00:23:13,976
If they go,

398
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,736
they'll pick terrible drinks.

399
00:23:16,656 --> 00:23:17,135
Then go.

400
00:23:17,135 --> 00:23:17,815
Makes sense.

401
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,055
Give me your phone.

402
00:23:22,055 --> 00:23:22,736
Careful.

403
00:23:27,055 --> 00:23:28,016
Not bad.

404
00:23:28,016 --> 00:23:29,016
Mi, let's go.

405
00:23:29,176 --> 00:23:29,936
Come with me.

406
00:23:31,575 --> 00:23:33,216
Watch for cars. It's right there.

407
00:23:34,295 --> 00:23:35,335
Get me some.

408
00:23:35,815 --> 00:23:36,936
Then I'll stay put too.

409
00:23:37,055 --> 00:23:37,656
Okay.

410
00:23:39,775 --> 00:23:40,375
Let's go.

411
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:55,095
Sir.

412
00:23:55,496 --> 00:23:56,216
Pick your drink.

413
00:23:56,736 --> 00:23:58,496
Mi, choose what you want.

414
00:23:59,176 --> 00:23:59,896
Anything can do.

415
00:24:01,496 --> 00:24:03,375
Coffee or milk tea?

416
00:24:03,456 --> 00:24:04,055
Milk tea.

417
00:24:06,335 --> 00:24:07,535
I won't look back.

418
00:24:07,575 --> 00:24:08,936
Check what's behind us.

419
00:24:10,135 --> 00:24:11,295
Xiong Hei's car stopped.

420
00:24:12,456 --> 00:24:14,295
A white SUV has been tailing us
the whole way.

421
00:24:14,295 --> 00:24:15,375
It stopped too.

422
00:24:20,496 --> 00:24:21,656
Keep talking to me casually.

423
00:24:21,736 --> 00:24:22,656
Just pretend it.

424
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:32,736
(Coffee)
Something's on your face.

425
00:24:32,736 --> 00:24:33,335
Hurry.

426
00:24:33,575 --> 00:24:34,575
Let me get it off.

427
00:24:34,967 --> 00:24:36,658
(Yan Tuo)

428
00:24:42,095 --> 00:24:43,335
I've reached Li Lake Highway.

429
00:24:43,496 --> 00:24:44,896
Licheng's just ahead. What now?

430
00:24:46,976 --> 00:24:49,496
(Xing Shen)
I said Licheng, not Li Lake.

431
00:24:49,896 --> 00:24:51,736
You're not there yet. No need to rush.

432
00:24:52,815 --> 00:24:53,936
White SUV.

433
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:55,824
Should I read the license plate?

434
00:24:57,456 --> 00:24:58,815
I can't keep accommodating you.

435
00:25:00,016 --> 00:25:01,976
Keep up if you still want this meeting.

436
00:25:05,416 --> 00:25:06,016
They're coming.

437
00:25:06,288 --> 00:25:07,248
Meet me on the way.

438
00:25:14,135 --> 00:25:15,095
What's the deal here?

439
00:25:15,736 --> 00:25:16,456
Let's wait.

440
00:25:17,216 --> 00:25:18,496
See what tricks he's got left.

441
00:25:19,855 --> 00:25:20,496
A snail.

442
00:25:21,176 --> 00:25:21,775
See it?

443
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,535
This way. Let's sit over there.

444
00:25:56,135 --> 00:25:57,095
These cameras

445
00:25:57,496 --> 00:25:59,496
aren't just monitoring
greenhouse plants, are they?

446
00:26:03,815 --> 00:26:05,216
Let's see who's faster.

447
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:12,775
I'm here to find something shady.

448
00:26:13,216 --> 00:26:15,656
You should know what I mean.

449
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:19,815
Are you curious

450
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,216
what this place is?

451
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:25,696
It's both the beginning

452
00:29:27,095 --> 00:29:28,375
and the end.

453
00:29:30,055 --> 00:29:31,416
It is both heaven

454
00:29:32,535 --> 00:29:33,896
and hell.

455
00:29:35,335 --> 00:29:37,575
But definitely not the mortal realm.

456
00:32:36,135 --> 00:32:36,775
Ms. Lin.

457
00:32:37,176 --> 00:32:38,896
Come back immediately. Trouble at home.

458
00:32:40,256 --> 00:32:40,815
Okay.

459
00:32:42,855 --> 00:32:43,976
There's trouble. Head home.

460
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:01,496
Got it.

461
00:33:02,095 --> 00:33:03,256
Home emergency. Turn around.

462
00:33:03,295 --> 00:33:03,976
Turn around?

463
00:33:04,456 --> 00:33:05,696
We're on the main road.

464
00:33:05,696 --> 00:33:07,095
Turn around now!

465
00:33:07,095 --> 00:33:07,775
Wait.

466
00:33:07,775 --> 00:33:08,615
Miss, my license...

467
00:33:08,615 --> 00:33:09,055
Shut up!

468
00:33:09,055 --> 00:33:09,696
I-I...

469
00:33:10,375 --> 00:33:11,216
Turn around!

470
00:33:19,575 --> 00:33:20,256
Are you okay?

471
00:33:21,135 --> 00:33:21,815
I'm fine.

472
00:33:22,216 --> 00:33:22,936
Stay put.

473
00:33:23,375 --> 00:33:24,855
I'll check outside.

474
00:33:27,375 --> 00:33:28,575
What happened?

475
00:33:30,055 --> 00:33:30,615
Go ahead.

476
00:33:33,656 --> 00:33:34,535
Look at this.

477
00:33:35,575 --> 00:33:36,815
Did your mom's ashes fall?

478
00:33:37,016 --> 00:33:38,615
Couldn't you signal and pull over?

479
00:33:38,696 --> 00:33:39,815
You had to slam the brakes?

480
00:33:39,896 --> 00:33:41,016
Can you talk properly?

481
00:33:41,016 --> 00:33:41,976
Insurance will cover it.

482
00:33:41,976 --> 00:33:43,176
You're bleeding.

483
00:33:43,815 --> 00:33:44,855
Lv Xian, what to do?

484
00:33:45,335 --> 00:33:46,736
A first-aid kit is in the back.

485
00:33:46,815 --> 00:33:47,456
Find it.

486
00:33:47,456 --> 00:33:47,815
Okay.

487
00:33:47,815 --> 00:33:48,775
We almost died there.

488
00:33:48,775 --> 00:33:49,295
Save that.

489
00:33:49,295 --> 00:33:49,936
Stop cursing me.

490
00:33:49,936 --> 00:33:51,330
You'll pay with your mom's ashes?

491
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:52,335
Do you know how to drive?

492
00:33:52,456 --> 00:33:53,295
Do you know?

493
00:33:53,416 --> 00:33:54,456
Was your dad on the road?

494
00:33:54,456 --> 00:33:55,016
Don't push me.

495
00:33:55,095 --> 00:33:55,656
Let me check.

496
00:33:55,736 --> 00:33:56,535
Don't push me.

497
00:33:56,656 --> 00:33:58,135
If I hadn't slammed the brakes...

498
00:33:58,135 --> 00:33:59,535
Move aside. Let me see.

499
00:33:59,615 --> 00:34:00,375
How are you?

500
00:34:00,416 --> 00:34:01,575
Your sudden braking...

501
00:34:01,575 --> 00:34:02,615
Let's talk this through.

502
00:34:02,896 --> 00:34:04,615
He stopped. He braked hard.

503
00:34:04,855 --> 00:34:06,815
I got too close, and then you hit me.

504
00:34:07,456 --> 00:34:08,336
Why brake suddenly?

505
00:34:08,336 --> 00:34:09,215
We meet again.

506
00:34:09,535 --> 00:34:10,655
All this hassle.

507
00:34:10,655 --> 00:34:11,575
Are you testing me?

508
00:34:13,336 --> 00:34:14,175
Not exactly.

509
00:34:16,016 --> 00:34:17,575
So you've got other concerns.

510
00:34:18,055 --> 00:34:18,896
To be blunt,

511
00:34:20,135 --> 00:34:21,215
I don't trust you.

512
00:34:24,856 --> 00:34:26,615
Luo already told you everything.

513
00:34:26,896 --> 00:34:28,175
I have no reason to lie to you.

514
00:34:29,896 --> 00:34:30,856
You...

515
00:34:30,856 --> 00:34:32,416
Sit still.

516
00:34:32,416 --> 00:34:34,055
Let him treat this injury for you.

517
00:34:34,055 --> 00:34:36,296
Right. Small wound, big care.

518
00:34:36,336 --> 00:34:37,856
Wait, he should pay the compensation.

519
00:34:38,135 --> 00:34:38,896
Wait... No...

520
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:41,615
Do you truly have some blood feud
with the Earth Fiends?

521
00:34:42,095 --> 00:34:44,496
Or is it all just an elaborate lie
you've fabricated?

522
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:46,535
I have no way to verify it.

523
00:34:47,135 --> 00:34:48,896
Are you leading
the South Mountain Hunters?

524
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:51,215
So what if I am?

525
00:34:53,336 --> 00:34:54,416
Your guess was correct.

526
00:34:54,936 --> 00:34:56,215
I'm with the Earth Fiends.

527
00:34:56,296 --> 00:34:58,296
I meticulously
gained Luo's trust through lies.

528
00:34:58,376 --> 00:34:59,776
Then I caught a big fish like you.

529
00:34:59,896 --> 00:35:01,376
We've got Jiang Baichuan already.

530
00:35:01,976 --> 00:35:03,215
If I just take out my phone

531
00:35:04,215 --> 00:35:06,095
and summon
the pre-positioned Earth Fiends

532
00:35:06,095 --> 00:35:07,135
to eliminate all of you,

533
00:35:08,695 --> 00:35:09,456
then the Hunters

534
00:35:09,456 --> 00:35:11,095
will completely
fall apart into disarray.

535
00:35:11,296 --> 00:35:12,896
No one could stop me then.

536
00:35:14,135 --> 00:35:14,655
What?

537
00:35:14,655 --> 00:35:17,055
Did I say something wrong?

538
00:35:17,055 --> 00:35:18,175
What about your car?

539
00:35:18,175 --> 00:35:19,175
What about my car?

540
00:35:19,175 --> 00:35:20,936
My front and...
Tell me, what about my car?

541
00:35:21,016 --> 00:35:22,695
I know you want to prove yourself,

542
00:35:23,735 --> 00:35:25,055
but for your own safety,

543
00:35:25,695 --> 00:35:27,615
you shouldn't make reckless jokes.

544
00:35:31,016 --> 00:35:33,055
I've held nothing back from the start.

545
00:35:34,695 --> 00:35:36,376
But cooperation requires mutual effort.

546
00:35:36,735 --> 00:35:38,376
I hope you're not joking either.

547
00:35:39,016 --> 00:35:40,896
How did you get such long legs?

548
00:35:40,896 --> 00:35:41,615
If...

549
00:35:42,095 --> 00:35:42,856
It's your head.

550
00:35:42,856 --> 00:35:43,615
Wait.

551
00:35:44,296 --> 00:35:45,535
What exactly is Yan Tuo doing?

552
00:35:45,535 --> 00:35:46,376
What's the delay?

553
00:35:46,896 --> 00:35:48,016
Move aside. I must get down.

554
00:35:48,416 --> 00:35:50,615
Where are you going? Your head...

555
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:51,856
I haven't finished treating it.

556
00:35:51,976 --> 00:35:53,456
What about it? Just call the police.

557
00:35:53,456 --> 00:35:55,135
- Police? No. Give me the money now.
- Be careful.

558
00:35:55,135 --> 00:35:56,615
- I won't waste time with you.
- Tuo.

559
00:35:56,615 --> 00:35:58,376
Tuo, just pay them.

560
00:35:58,376 --> 00:35:59,296
Mi is still bleeding.

561
00:35:59,296 --> 00:36:00,016
I'll wait for you.

562
00:36:00,016 --> 00:36:01,296
When did you and Luo

563
00:36:01,296 --> 00:36:02,416
become so close?

564
00:36:03,496 --> 00:36:04,255
Ask her.

565
00:36:04,416 --> 00:36:05,215
Her answer is final.

566
00:36:05,215 --> 00:36:06,135
What do you mean?

567
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:07,055
You pushed me?

568
00:36:07,535 --> 00:36:08,735
Are you okay?

569
00:36:08,735 --> 00:36:09,456
It's settled.

570
00:36:09,456 --> 00:36:11,135
We'll go through insurance.

571
00:36:11,456 --> 00:36:13,055
Let's go through insurance.

572
00:36:13,776 --> 00:36:14,175
Careful.

573
00:36:14,175 --> 00:36:15,135
Come on. Let's go.

574
00:36:15,376 --> 00:36:16,655
Get in the car.

575
00:36:16,655 --> 00:36:17,655
Mind your head.

576
00:36:18,535 --> 00:36:19,976
My car was stopped. You hit me.

577
00:36:22,255 --> 00:36:23,615
Sit still. Stop looking.

578
00:36:50,055 --> 00:36:50,655
Well?

579
00:36:50,976 --> 00:36:52,215
Did you meet with Yan Tuo?

580
00:36:53,816 --> 00:36:55,655
He's barely qualified as a collaborator.

581
00:36:56,175 --> 00:36:56,856
That's good then.

582
00:36:57,976 --> 00:36:59,896
I've found something.
Let's talk in person.

583
00:37:00,095 --> 00:37:00,655
Okay.

584
00:37:11,336 --> 00:37:12,175
What a coincidence.

585
00:37:13,095 --> 00:37:14,095
Right.

586
00:37:14,255 --> 00:37:15,896
How could it be such a coincidence?

587
00:37:17,016 --> 00:37:19,016
When Yang Zheng and I
went to surveil them,

588
00:37:19,336 --> 00:37:20,695
the farm had an incident.

589
00:37:21,135 --> 00:37:23,535
The moment I mentioned family trouble,
a car crash happened.

590
00:37:24,296 --> 00:37:27,055
If Ms. Lin hadn't been here,
this place would've been looted clean.

591
00:37:28,095 --> 00:37:29,016
Ms. Lin,

592
00:37:29,296 --> 00:37:30,496
to be blunt,

593
00:37:31,615 --> 00:37:33,416
among the four people
traveling together,

594
00:37:33,416 --> 00:37:34,255
except for Feng Mi,

595
00:37:34,776 --> 00:37:36,095
none are trustworthy.

596
00:37:38,615 --> 00:37:39,376
Lv Xian

597
00:37:40,255 --> 00:37:41,655
isn't smart enough.

598
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:44,896
Lin Ling

599
00:37:46,456 --> 00:37:47,936
isn't brave enough.

600
00:37:50,416 --> 00:37:51,856
So you mean?

601
00:38:04,776 --> 00:38:07,776
I truly hope my guess is wrong.

602
00:38:18,856 --> 00:38:19,936
You confronted her?

603
00:38:24,175 --> 00:38:25,976
I originally wanted to rescue Jiang

604
00:38:26,535 --> 00:38:28,376
but unexpectedly ran into Lin Xirou.

605
00:38:29,416 --> 00:38:30,496
But it should be fine.

606
00:38:31,016 --> 00:38:32,135
She didn't see my face.

607
00:38:34,456 --> 00:38:36,016
Why didn't you tell me beforehand?

608
00:38:36,095 --> 00:38:37,296
Without the Mad Blade,

609
00:38:38,376 --> 00:38:40,016
how could we
fight humanoid Earth Fiends?

610
00:38:41,376 --> 00:38:42,496
Given what we know,

611
00:38:43,416 --> 00:38:44,936
if we want to oppose the Earth Fiends,

612
00:38:45,296 --> 00:38:47,416
cooperating with Yan Tuo
is our only option.

613
00:38:49,296 --> 00:38:49,976
By the way,

614
00:38:50,496 --> 00:38:52,175
I found this at Lin Xirou's hideout.

615
00:38:53,215 --> 00:38:54,456
Looking like soil,

616
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,055
it ignites upon contact with fire.

617
00:38:56,336 --> 00:38:57,776
Not sure what purpose it serves.

618
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:07,735
Alright, I'll investigate this.

619
00:39:35,095 --> 00:39:36,735
If we keep talking like this every day,

620
00:39:37,055 --> 00:39:38,535
can we bring Jiang back?

621
00:39:39,376 --> 00:39:41,016
We don't even know where Jiang is.

622
00:39:41,255 --> 00:39:42,095
What else can we do?

623
00:39:42,655 --> 00:39:44,336
Are we really
trading Mad Blade for Jiang?

624
00:39:46,215 --> 00:39:47,175
Don't ask me.

625
00:39:47,175 --> 00:39:48,655
Ask Mad Blade.

626
00:39:49,776 --> 00:39:51,095
If it can save Jiang,

627
00:39:51,336 --> 00:39:52,095
I'm willing.

628
00:39:54,695 --> 00:39:55,936
When did you join us?

629
00:39:56,135 --> 00:39:57,175
Without a word.

630
00:39:57,215 --> 00:40:00,296
Leaving aside whether Earth Fiends
keep their promises.

631
00:40:01,456 --> 00:40:04,016
Even if we really trade Jiang back,

632
00:40:04,296 --> 00:40:05,215
when he finds out

633
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:07,095
we traded Mad Blade for him,

634
00:40:08,575 --> 00:40:10,296
giving away the Hunters' trump card

635
00:40:10,296 --> 00:40:11,376
to Earth Fiends for free,

636
00:40:11,816 --> 00:40:13,496
what do you think he'll say?

637
00:40:13,695 --> 00:40:15,016
I don't know what he'd say,

638
00:40:15,055 --> 00:40:16,016
but I do know

639
00:40:16,135 --> 00:40:17,936
he'd smash this place with a hammer.

640
00:40:18,976 --> 00:40:20,255
So much power, with no outlet.

641
00:40:21,095 --> 00:40:22,175
So frustrating.

642
00:40:28,976 --> 00:40:29,776
I know

643
00:40:31,615 --> 00:40:33,095
you've been enduring this.

644
00:40:33,535 --> 00:40:35,135
Thank you for trusting me.

645
00:40:36,255 --> 00:40:37,695
No one has acted recklessly.

646
00:40:39,135 --> 00:40:40,016
But now,

647
00:40:43,456 --> 00:40:44,695
we don't have to wait anymore.

648
00:40:45,095 --> 00:40:46,735
This contains all of Lin Xirou's

649
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:49,735
humanoid Earth Fiend allies
hidden across Yanguan.

650
00:40:53,376 --> 00:40:55,175
We can use this list

651
00:40:55,695 --> 00:40:56,976
to capture them all at once.

652
00:40:58,135 --> 00:40:59,535
Then use them as bargaining chips

653
00:41:00,255 --> 00:41:02,376
to negotiate Jiang's
and other Hunters' release

654
00:41:02,416 --> 00:41:03,615
from Lin Xirou.

655
00:41:03,976 --> 00:41:04,615
This way,

656
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,695
Mad Blade won't be exposed.

657
00:41:09,976 --> 00:41:10,816
Where did

658
00:41:12,615 --> 00:41:13,496
the list come from?

659
00:41:15,535 --> 00:41:17,615
I've had it for some time now.

660
00:41:18,575 --> 00:41:20,055
I waited to share it

661
00:41:20,856 --> 00:41:23,215
because I needed
to verify its reliability.

662
00:41:24,776 --> 00:41:25,936
I can guarantee that.

663
00:41:26,376 --> 00:41:27,135
It's trustworthy.
