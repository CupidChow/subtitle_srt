Nie Jiuluo, wake up!

19
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,200
Don't pass out.

20
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,359
Luo.

21
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:21,839
Luo.

22
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,160
Luo.

23
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,359
Wake up.

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,959
We're almost there.

25
00:02:31,399 --> 00:02:32,040
Luo.

26
00:02:32,359 --> 00:02:33,000
Mom.

27
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,399
Where are we going?

28
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,519
I promised you

29
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,119
a boat ride.

30
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,880
Forget about it?

31
00:02:58,839 --> 00:02:59,799
I won't go.

32
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:05,519
Nie Jiuluo.

33
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,880
Nie Jiuluo.

34
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,839
I won't go.

35
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,679
You're finally awake.

36
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,440
Let me help you.

37
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:36,920
I can manage.

38
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,119
Almost there.

39
00:03:52,119 --> 00:03:53,600
Wait for me. Just a moment.

40
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,600
What? You scared me.

41
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,600
Stop it. Get the door.

42
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:07,119
The clinic is not yours.

43
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,000
Bro, what's wrong?

44
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,559
Move!

45
00:04:18,119 --> 00:04:19,280
Let's go.

46
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:22,119
T-To the operating room.

47
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,280
A penetrating wound.

48
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,319
Lie down first.

49
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,808
I'll prepare for sterilization.

50
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,559
Don't just stand there.

51
00:04:44,679 --> 00:04:45,559
Cut the clothes open.

52
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,199
Wait, I...

53
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,520
Well, I...

54
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:25,720
Get out.

55
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,520
How is it?

56
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,439
Got no clues.

57
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:57,999
Did Mad Blade contact you?

58
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,640
Go on searching?

59
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:06,080
Retreat.

60
00:07:43,888 --> 00:07:46,832
(Herb)

61
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,040
She's stable for now.

62
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,400
If you're trying to poison her,

63
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,239
my surgery would be pointless.

64
00:08:32,199 --> 00:08:32,760
Thanks.

65
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,240
H-How long have we known each other?

66
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,920
Wanbao Tower didn't even exist
when we met.

67
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,079
Now it's becoming a century-old shop.

68
00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:53,000
So?

69
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,000
So, we're buddies.

70
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:55,959
Right?

71
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:00,880
Ms. Lin has been

72
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,240
more than a mother to us both.

73
00:09:03,319 --> 00:09:05,360
We never swore brotherhood,

74
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,799
but we are kind

75
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:08,120
of best buddies.

76
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:11,839
Fine.

77
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:14,640
You helped me today,

78
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,120
and I owe you this.

79
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:17,959
But

80
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,199
if you leak a word,

81
00:09:23,599 --> 00:09:25,400
especially to Ms. Lin,

82
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,799
you'll be out of Xicang.

83
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:28,599
Believe me?

84
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:34,839
Tuo.

85
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:38,520
You wouldn't come to me
unless desperate.

86
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,040
Stop the threats.

87
00:09:41,439 --> 00:09:43,040
If you don't trust me, take her away.

88
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,319
I won't leak a word.

89
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,040
Thanks.

90
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,439
Alright, enough.

91
00:09:55,439 --> 00:09:57,160
Stop it. Get me a bowl.

92
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,839
I'll test for poison.

93
00:10:04,599 --> 00:10:06,400
What did you put in?

94
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,599
Not worried about incompatibility?

95
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,120
Big Head, Shan Qiang.

96
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:37,920
Take a team each tomorrow

97
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,120
(Clues Map)
to find Chen Fu and Han Guan.

98
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:43,360
Said to find Jiang, yet found nothing.

99
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,240
A lot of nonsense.

100
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,520
Double-check vehicle info later.

101
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:47,839
Got it.

102
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,920
Even support Mad Blade
hunting Earth Fiends.

103
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,040
Found no Fiends,
yet Mad Blade's missing.

104
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,120
Humanoid Earth Fiends have no scent,

105
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,199
but put three Hounds in each team,

106
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,479
just in case.

107
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,679
The Hounds are sharp.

108
00:11:01,319 --> 00:11:02,799
They bark without smelling anything.

109
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:08,120
Rest up.

110
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:09,760
Assemble at 6 AM.

111
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:12,640
Alright.

112
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:13,760
Bedtime.

113
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,400
Exhausted.

114
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,240
If not for Jiang,

115
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:27,000
we wouldn't be alive.

116
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:28,719
Everything we're doing

117
00:11:28,719 --> 00:11:29,959
is for Jiang.

118
00:11:31,319 --> 00:11:32,719
I want to find Jiang too.

119
00:11:32,719 --> 00:11:34,160
But where is he anyway?

120
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:34,880
What do Han Guan

121
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,280
and Chen Fu have to do with me?

122
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,839
You're not the only one
thinking this way now.

123
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,520
But internal conflicts solve nothing.

124
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,640
We need someone to lead now.

125
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,719
Better than being in a mess,
no matter how you deny.

126
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:48,760
Fine, my mistake.

127
00:11:59,696 --> 00:12:05,200
(Clue Map)

128
00:12:06,599 --> 00:12:07,400
Sorry,

129
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,400
the subscriber you dialed
is unavailable.

130
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,240
Please try again later.

131
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,400
I already brushed my teeth.

132
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:30,479
Stop pushing yourself. Go take a nap.

133
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:32,719
It's fine.

134
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,120
Don't worry about me.

135
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,439
I'm not worried about you, okay?

136
00:15:37,439 --> 00:15:39,240
Having one critical patient exhausts me.

137
00:15:39,599 --> 00:15:41,439
If you collapse here from exhaustion,

138
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,079
how can I keep this clinic running?

139
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,479
I'm just worried about myself.

140
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,679
When will she wake up?

141
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,120
No idea.

142
00:15:52,479 --> 00:15:54,160
Don't you see her severe injure?

143
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,880
But luckily,

144
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,559
it's not fatal

145
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:00,240
and no vital organs were damaged.

146
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,439
Tuo.

147
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:04,559
What's her background?

148
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,559
She's slim,

149
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:08,120
but her wounds heal freakishly fast.

150
00:16:08,439 --> 00:16:09,880
Can't believe it.

151
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:12,040
She's like the Wolverine.

152
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:16,920
You're awake.

153
00:16:18,439 --> 00:16:19,959
How are those two Earth Fiends?

154
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:21,479
What?

155
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,240
W-What Fiends?

156
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:25,760
Filets.

157
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:26,920
She meant filets.

158
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,959
Probably hungry.

159
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:29,040
I'll go reheat the congee.

160
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,120
Wait. Hold on.

161
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:33,880
I'm being honest.

162
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,920
Don't stay here.

163
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:37,880
Xiong Hei could show up anytime.

164
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,199
What to explain if we get caught?

165
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,319
And, this is my only bed.

166
00:16:42,479 --> 00:16:43,360
Do you expect me

167
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,719
to sleep on the operating table?

168
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,719
Find her a proper recovery spot.

169
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,199
I've tended her wound

170
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:54,400
and got her tetanus shot.

171
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,719
Just help her change dressing.

172
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,880
Got it. Thanks.

173
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:04,080
She's awake. You stay with her.

174
00:17:04,239 --> 00:17:05,039
I'll get the congee.

175
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:07,800
Thanks.

176
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:22,999
Don't worry.

177
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,784
I'll handle the Earth Fiends.

178
00:17:27,719 --> 00:17:28,759
How are you feeling now?

179
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,959
Careful. Here.

180
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,479
Are you sure

181
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:25,600
you can clean up the mess alone?

182
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,039
Your injuries need attention.

183
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,640
I'll go handle it later.

184
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:32,920
Go now.

185
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,880
Can't delay any longer.

186
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:35,999
I'll take you home first.

187
00:19:35,999 --> 00:19:36,999
You need proper care.

188
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:38,719
I...

189
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:44,800
I don't want Ms. Lu

190
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,360
to see me like this.

191
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:51,400
Then what?

192
00:20:01,239 --> 00:20:02,199
Want some dumplings?

193
00:20:06,256 --> 00:20:09,616
(Changxi Dumplings)

194
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,544
(Dumplings)
Mr. Changxi.

195
00:20:15,479 --> 00:20:16,120
Mr. Changxi.

196
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:17,160
Coming.

197
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,800
This is the man I mentioned

198
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,199
on the way here.

199
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,120
He's a good man, great cook,

200
00:20:24,199 --> 00:20:26,519
old but vigorous,
and best at cooking dumplings.

201
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:27,239
Mr. Changxi.

202
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,320
Don't trust his nonsense.

203
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,840
Miss Nie, right?

204
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:32,519
Come on, hurry up.

205
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,120
Dumplings get cold.

206
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,239
Mr. Changxi, sorry for bothering you.

207
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,999
Don't mention it.

208
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,719
Tuo said you're unwell.

209
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:43,999
These fillings are light,
nutritious, and easy to digest.

210
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:44,920
Try some.

211
00:20:45,479 --> 00:20:47,039
Wipe your hands.

212
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,840
Here. Clean now.

213
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,320
You are so caring.

214
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,920
What a wonder.

215
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,759
Eat up.

216
00:21:12,719 --> 00:21:13,439
Thank you.

217
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:14,199
No problem.

218
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:16,719
Eat up.

219
00:21:22,672 --> 00:21:23,952
(Open)

220
00:21:23,952 --> 00:21:26,096
(Closed)

221
00:21:30,959 --> 00:21:32,759
Don't you like the food?

222
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,080
No, it's delicious.

223
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:40,600
Still feeling unwell?

224
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,560
I'll get you some broth.

225
00:21:42,959 --> 00:21:43,560
No need.

226
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,679
Just get some rest.

227
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:46,920
Eating and sleeping
are the best medicine.

228
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,800
The room's ready.
You can stay in my room.

229
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:51,199
What about you?

230
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,679
I'll take the back room.

231
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:53,959
Think I'd sleep on the streets?

232
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:57,880
Want more?

233
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,959
Go take her to her room.

234
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,360
Okay.

235
00:22:20,479 --> 00:22:21,400
Take a look around.

236
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,160
Let me know if you need anything.

237
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,080
Thank you.

238
00:22:27,439 --> 00:22:28,080
Thanks a lot.

239
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,239
Sit down and rest.

240
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,120
This isn't the time to rest.

241
00:22:43,239 --> 00:22:45,439
Don't worry. I'll handle those two.

242
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,320
We can't use

243
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:49,600
them to get Jiang back.

244
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:50,840
It'll only provoke Lin Xirou.

245
00:22:51,959 --> 00:22:53,600
Eliminate them as soon as possible.

246
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:55,519
Got it. Leave it to me.

247
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,999
I'll also try

248
00:22:56,999 --> 00:22:58,080
to get news about Jiang.

249
00:22:58,199 --> 00:22:58,719
Sit down.

250
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:00,539
Careful.

251
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,679
I've been away too long.

252
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:13,320
I need to show my face to Lin Xirou.

253
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,199
You need proper care.

254
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,160
Mr. Changxi

255
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,600
watched me grow up.

256
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,959
He's practically a father to me.

257
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:20,959
You can trust him.

258
00:23:35,199 --> 00:23:36,320
Rest up.

259
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,239
Sent it.

260
00:23:52,239 --> 00:23:53,039
Did you get it?

261
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:57,080
Codonopsis, astragalus, pseudoginseng,

262
00:23:57,719 --> 00:23:58,519
and pigeon?

263
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,120
Right.

264
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,959
Where am I supposed to catch a pigeon?

265
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:03,800
Get one in the morning market.

266
00:24:03,959 --> 00:24:05,120
Herbal shops open early.

267
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,160
The herbs are easy to get.

268
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:06,880
I checked it up.

269
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:09,424
It is helpful for replenishing
blood after an injury.

270
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:10,920
Thank you a lot.

271
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,120
Best if Miss Nie can drink this soup

272
00:24:13,439 --> 00:24:14,400
once she wakes tomorrow.

273
00:24:15,239 --> 00:24:16,600
Replenishing blood?

274
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:21,360
Tuo, did she go through a cesarean?

275
00:24:21,479 --> 00:24:22,959
What?

276
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:23,880
Not at all.

277
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:26,320
She just got an injury.

278
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,920
Tuo, be honest with me.

279
00:24:30,439 --> 00:24:31,640
Where did you find this girl?

280
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,640
Why is she injured?

281
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:37,439
I promised your parents.

282
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,600
I won't let you stray
down the wrong path.

283
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,800
Don't get fooled.

284
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,479
I understand. Don't worry.

285
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,400
Miss Nie is trustworthy.

286
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,080
She matters a lot to me.

287
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,560
But I have urgent matters

288
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,400
to attend to.

289
00:24:52,239 --> 00:24:54,199
And you're the person I trust most.

290
00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:55,239
Please take good care

291
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:56,999
of her for me.

292
00:24:57,199 --> 00:24:57,759
When I return,

293
00:24:57,759 --> 00:24:58,999
I'll explain everything to you.

294
00:24:58,999 --> 00:24:59,600
Okay?

295
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,120
I'm leaving.

296
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,199
Hold on.

297
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,800
If her injury

298
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,519
is related to you,

299
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:14,959
you have to take full responsibility.

300
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,239
Understood.

302
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,239
Is the room acceptable?

303
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,360
Sorry, it's a modest room.

304
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,039
Not at all, Mr. Changxi.

305
00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:10,719
I should thank you.

306
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,519
This is the new phone

307
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:16,479
Tuo got for me recently.

308
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,759
Please take it for now.

309
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,800
Here's the landline number downstairs.

310
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,759
Call me if you need something.

311
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,880
That's unnecessary, Mr. Changxi.

312
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,279
I'll be fine alone.

313
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,719
Tuo doesn't ask me for favors often.

314
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,120
He told me repeatedly

315
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,640
to take good care of you.

316
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,080
I can't let him down.

317
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,039
Alright.

318
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,039
Well, if he ever treats you badly,

319
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:52,920
just tell me.

320
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:53,759
I'll lecture him.

321
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,039
Mr. Changxi, you've misunderstood.

322
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,080
We are not in a relationship.

323
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:02,880
No?

324
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,199
Anyway,

325
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,920
I can still lecture him.

326
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,959
Thanks then.

327
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:11,199

so it's not greasy at all.

348
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,039
Have it.

Lv Xian is nice in any aspect.

383
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,280
For someone like you,

384
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,559
he's an excellent choice.

385
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:34,079
Self-awareness is a virtue.

386
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:35,479
For someone like you,

387
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:37,360
you don't have much room to be picky.

388
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:39,079
Why do you always make me

389
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:40,240
do things I hate?

390
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,159
All these years,

391
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,959
have you ever cared what I like to eat,

392
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,240
who I fancy,

393
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,240
or what life I want to live?

394
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:53,079
Are you truly doing this for me,

395
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:54,920
or just tormenting me?

396
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,320
What should you say to me?

397
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:16,840
I'm sorry.

398
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:17,880
Say it.

399
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,360
I'm sorry, Ms. Lin.

400
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,519
Sis will tell you

401
00:40:56,519 --> 00:40:57,800
the dinner location.

402
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:04,999
Ms. Lin.

403
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,840
You're finally back.

404
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,599
Logistics department

405
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:11,959
said customs seized some medicine.

406
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,680
It's urgent. We scrambled for help.

407
00:41:13,999 --> 00:41:14,639
And now?

408
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:16,880
All resolved. Don't worry.

409
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:22,200
Had a quarrel?

410
00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:28,360
Don't fret. I'll talk sense into her.

411
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,760
Ms. Lin.

412
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,079
My dear Ms. Lin.

413
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,400
Have you behaved lately?

414
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,079
Been behaving properly.

415
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,439
Ms. Lin.

416
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,119
You're here, and I'm relieved.

417
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:18,479
Yueying.

418
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,559
All these years,

419
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:25,920
you haven't changed a bit.

420
00:42:39,959 --> 00:42:40,840
You might as well

421
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,360
stay longer.

422
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,880
Let me help you recuperate.

423
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,400
Thank you, Ms. Lin.

424
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,632
Where are Han Guan and Chen Fu?

425
00:42:57,039 --> 00:42:59,240
Probably still dawdling on the way.

426
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:00,599
You're

427
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,959
the dawdling one.

428
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:03,479
Yueying and I

429
00:43:03,479 --> 00:43:04,999
had waited for you for long.

430
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,039
I can't hear you!

431
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:08,639
Blah blah blah!

432
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,599
Where's Xiong Hei? Why isn't he here?

433
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:19,559
Gou Ya escaped.

434
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,559
Xiong Hei took people to search for him.

435
00:43:22,439 --> 00:43:23,119
He escaped?

440
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,960
don't mind,

441
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,160
please leave.

442
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:02,680
Why?

443
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,960
If you don't leave,

444

I'll have to call the police.

We're waiting here for someone.

00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,480
Did we break the law?

447
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,120
Exactly.

448
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,760
You two didn't break the law.
