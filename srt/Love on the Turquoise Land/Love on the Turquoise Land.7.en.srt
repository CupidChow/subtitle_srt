Old Blade.

20
00:04:12,993 --> 00:04:13,873
How did you get here?

21
00:04:14,072 --> 00:04:14,993
Who did you come with?

00:05:04,368 --> 00:05:05,488
(Xing Shen)

23
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:10,232
Hello?

24
00:05:11,232 --> 00:05:12,073
Are you okay?

25
00:05:13,992 --> 00:05:14,593
I'm fine.

26
00:05:16,153 --> 00:05:17,633
Mr. Crip has been rescued.

27
00:05:18,633 --> 00:05:19,992
Our people are mostly unharmed.

28
00:05:21,593 --> 00:05:23,073
Heading to the usual to regroup.

29
00:05:26,273 --> 00:05:27,672
What's with that Earth Fiend?

30
00:05:34,872 --> 00:05:36,112
I'll explain it to you later.

31
00:05:37,753 --> 00:05:38,513
It escaped.

32
00:05:39,393 --> 00:05:40,633
Tell everyone to stay alert.

33
00:06:02,792 --> 00:06:04,153
They're calling for rain all week.

34
00:06:04,232 --> 00:06:05,193
If heaven doesn't help,

35
00:06:05,273 --> 00:06:06,112
I can't save you.

36
00:06:07,312 --> 00:06:08,193
What do you mean?

37
00:06:09,193 --> 00:06:10,232
An Earth Fiend wound

38
00:06:10,312 --> 00:06:11,792
must be cauterized with natural fire.

39
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:12,912
Or it'll keep festering.

40
00:06:13,112 --> 00:06:15,153
If red threads pierce your pupils,
you're done for.

41
00:06:16,352 --> 00:06:17,273
Natural fire?

42
00:06:18,513 --> 00:06:19,593
Stop asking.

43
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,073
I'll treat your wound briefly.

44
00:06:21,232 --> 00:06:22,513
The rest depends on your fate.

45
00:06:41,112 --> 00:06:41,833
This time,

46
00:06:42,352 --> 00:06:43,393
we can't

47
00:06:43,753 --> 00:06:44,792
settle payment per job.

48
00:07:09,953 --> 00:07:10,833
Cut the chatter.

49
00:07:11,552 --> 00:07:12,352
Bear with it.

50
00:07:56,513 --> 00:07:58,352
Tuo. Tuo.

51
00:07:59,033 --> 00:08:00,073
Where's Xinxin?

52
00:08:02,193 --> 00:08:03,432
Where's Xinxin?

53
00:08:03,953 --> 00:08:06,112
- Xinxin?
- Xinxin?

54
00:08:06,472 --> 00:08:08,552
- Xinxin?
- Xinxin?

55
00:08:09,033 --> 00:08:11,833
Xinxin. Xinxin.

56
00:08:12,672 --> 00:08:13,593
Where's Xinxin?

57
00:08:14,153 --> 00:08:15,312
Xinxin.

58
00:08:15,352 --> 00:08:16,312
Where's Xinxin?

59
00:08:36,993 --> 00:08:37,672
Xinxin!

60
00:08:56,672 --> 00:08:57,432
Where are we going?

61
00:08:59,552 --> 00:09:00,432
Milan Mountain,

62
00:09:00,993 --> 00:09:03,153
the highest peak in Xicang,
to wait for sunrise.

63
00:09:07,432 --> 00:09:09,473
If we don't see the sun
at the highest point,

64
00:09:10,513 --> 00:09:11,633
then don't blame me.

65
00:09:18,192 --> 00:09:18,912
Ms. Lin,

66
00:09:19,712 --> 00:09:21,592
we've lost the crippled old man.

67
00:09:24,033 --> 00:09:25,312
What about the other Hunters?

68
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,072
Haven't found them.

69
00:09:27,792 --> 00:09:31,312
But we saw a fiend.

70
00:09:32,192 --> 00:09:32,952
A fiend?

71
00:09:33,952 --> 00:09:35,753
A primal Earth Fiend
that wasn't transformed.

72
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:38,592
And it shows signs of domestication.

73
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:48,353
I need you to do something.

74
00:11:04,552 --> 00:11:05,353
I fought the leader

75
00:11:06,672 --> 00:11:08,753
earlier at the ice factory and hospital.

76
00:11:09,952 --> 00:11:11,113
Today I confirmed

77
00:11:12,192 --> 00:11:13,712
he reacts to my whip whistle.

78
00:11:15,273 --> 00:11:16,672
But no one knows how many

79
00:11:16,993 --> 00:11:18,473
humanoid Earth Fiends there are.

80
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:20,712
They can take human form

81
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:22,473
with no fiendish scent.

82
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:26,993
But before,

83
00:11:28,353 --> 00:11:29,712
the one Mad Blade sent over

84
00:11:29,993 --> 00:11:31,432
had a strong scent.

85
00:11:34,113 --> 00:11:35,592
They might have some way to cover it.

86
00:11:38,233 --> 00:11:39,312
My mind's a mess.

87
00:11:39,912 --> 00:11:41,113
My father never told me about

88
00:11:41,153 --> 00:11:41,952
such situations.

89
00:11:42,393 --> 00:11:43,432
What's really going on?

90
00:11:43,552 --> 00:11:44,513
You bet.

91
00:11:44,672 --> 00:11:45,552
That Earth Fiend...

92
00:11:45,792 --> 00:11:47,033
I don't mean the humanoid one.

93
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:49,432
Where did that genuine Earth Fiend
come from?

94
00:11:54,432 --> 00:11:55,832
It probably came for me.

95
00:11:58,952 --> 00:11:59,633
For you?

96
00:12:02,233 --> 00:12:03,672
It's been kept at the base,

97
00:12:05,672 --> 00:12:06,792
and I've been feeding it.

98
00:12:10,753 --> 00:12:13,912
You kept an Earth Fiend at the base?

99
00:12:16,513 --> 00:12:17,832
I wanted to study it,

100
00:12:19,233 --> 00:12:19,993
tame it,

101
00:12:21,513 --> 00:12:22,672
and make it serve us.

102
00:12:23,873 --> 00:12:26,192
Xing Shen, how long
had you been doing that?

103
00:12:26,952 --> 00:12:27,873
Such a major matter,

104
00:12:28,153 --> 00:12:29,672
and you decided behind our backs?

105
00:12:29,912 --> 00:12:31,552
Right. Keeping an Earth Fiend
in the base?

106
00:12:31,753 --> 00:12:32,753
- Right.
- Exactly.

107
00:12:33,113 --> 00:12:33,552
Exactly.

108
00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:34,792
That Earth Fiend

109
00:12:36,513 --> 00:12:40,113
was caught during patrol 20 years ago.

110
00:12:41,473 --> 00:12:42,473
Leaving it to Xing Shen

111
00:12:43,993 --> 00:12:46,033
was a decision

112
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,633
made by all Hunters back then.

113
00:12:51,192 --> 00:12:53,033
Both Mr. Crip and Mrs. Hua

114
00:12:54,993 --> 00:12:55,712
knew about it.

115
00:13:02,353 --> 00:13:04,712
Keeping an Earth Fiend was a huge risk.

116
00:13:05,873 --> 00:13:07,233
But there was no other way.

117
00:13:13,072 --> 00:13:14,592
Now isn't the time for arguments.

118
00:13:15,792 --> 00:13:17,513
They could catch up to us any moment.

119
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:26,993
Lightly wounded,

120
00:13:29,873 --> 00:13:31,113
on guard duty.

121
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,353
We must all return to base alive

122
00:13:34,952 --> 00:13:36,153
before discussing this.

123
00:14:23,024 --> 00:14:29,328
(In flight)

124
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:44,233
Xiong.

125
00:15:29,832 --> 00:15:30,993
Did you find Locust?

126
00:15:33,912 --> 00:15:36,633
I placed it in the cave
on the west slope.

127
00:15:38,993 --> 00:15:40,473
If we can't convince everyone,

128
00:15:41,552 --> 00:15:43,072
I can reinforce the cave

129
00:15:44,113 --> 00:15:45,432
to stop its return to the base.

130
00:15:46,072 --> 00:15:47,672
Did you think it was tamed?

131
00:15:48,993 --> 00:15:52,353
So you let it join the mission
without authorization?

132
00:15:53,473 --> 00:15:54,072
No.

133
00:15:55,552 --> 00:15:56,912
It escaped on its own.

134
00:15:59,552 --> 00:16:00,393
It seemed

135
00:16:02,672 --> 00:16:04,633
to sense that I was in danger.

136
00:16:10,353 --> 00:16:11,033
Jiang,

137
00:16:13,312 --> 00:16:14,432
for what happened this time,

138
00:16:15,873 --> 00:16:17,153
I take full responsibility.

139
00:16:19,072 --> 00:16:20,832
I'll abide by everyone's decisions.

140
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:25,312
We and Earth Fiends
have been foes for generations.

141
00:16:25,873 --> 00:16:27,912
I'll clearly explain everything
to everyone

142
00:16:28,952 --> 00:16:30,273
to handle Locust properly.

143
00:16:32,832 --> 00:16:33,873
The worst outcome

144
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:36,952
would be having Luo

145
00:16:38,033 --> 00:16:39,113
end its suffering.

146
00:17:08,072 --> 00:17:08,792
They're here.

147
00:17:10,352 --> 00:17:12,473
Mr. Crip and Old Blade
haven't recovered yet.

148
00:17:12,592 --> 00:17:13,673
Retreat with the wounded.

149
00:17:13,753 --> 00:17:14,832
Leave me strong fighters.

150
00:17:15,632 --> 00:17:16,273
No.

151
00:17:16,552 --> 00:17:17,513
If we all move together,

152
00:17:17,713 --> 00:17:18,792
we'll be overtaken quickly

153
00:17:18,832 --> 00:17:19,832
at our current pace.

154
00:17:19,953 --> 00:17:20,953
Someone must hold them.

155
00:17:20,953 --> 00:17:21,392
Jiang.

156
00:17:21,392 --> 00:17:22,632
I'm assigning missions.

157
00:17:22,673 --> 00:17:23,792
Not discussing it with you.

158
00:17:32,993 --> 00:17:34,473
South Mountain is in your hands now.

159
00:17:35,993 --> 00:17:37,152
Don't let me down.

160
00:18:55,953 --> 00:18:56,632
Where are they?

161
00:19:00,112 --> 00:19:01,673
All went home to rest.

162
00:19:02,753 --> 00:19:03,753
Dealing with you

163
00:19:04,872 --> 00:19:06,112
doesn't require many people.

164
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:08,193
Really?

165
00:19:09,953 --> 00:19:11,193
Those four at the entrance

166
00:19:13,312 --> 00:19:15,392
seemed quite fragile,
as if made of paper.

167
00:19:17,673 --> 00:19:19,072
Why not take a step forward?

168
00:19:22,273 --> 00:19:23,513
To see if I'm made of paper

169
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:25,953
or forged from iron.

170
00:19:26,072 --> 00:19:29,552
Well, you seem like the leader.

171
00:19:32,033 --> 00:19:32,713
That's right.

172
00:19:35,273 --> 00:19:35,993
But not exactly.

173
00:19:39,552 --> 00:19:42,913
Yet I don't think you're the leader.

174
00:19:43,832 --> 00:19:47,072
You've been anxious this
whole journey, haven't you?

175
00:19:48,273 --> 00:19:49,273
Wondering how you'll

176
00:19:51,312 --> 00:19:52,273
report this failure?

177
00:19:56,033 --> 00:19:57,033
Take him away first.

178
00:20:05,993 --> 00:20:06,592
Come on.

179
00:20:47,993 --> 00:20:48,832
Hello? Ms. Lin.

180
00:20:49,673 --> 00:20:50,433
How's it going?

181
00:20:52,392 --> 00:20:53,552
We didn't find that fiend.

182
00:21:01,473 --> 00:21:02,273
But

183
00:21:02,993 --> 00:21:06,193
we caught South Mountain's leader,
Jiang Baichuan.

184
00:21:10,072 --> 00:21:10,832
Is that so?

185
00:21:11,832 --> 00:21:13,832
Make sure to treat him properly.

186
00:21:14,513 --> 00:21:15,112
Understood.

187
00:21:56,392 --> 00:21:57,953
Your injuries aren't that bad.

188
00:21:58,513 --> 00:22:00,552
It's the infection
that makes you feel terrible.

189
00:22:01,552 --> 00:22:02,753
Try to stay conscious.

190
00:22:03,152 --> 00:22:04,193
You'll recover quickly

191
00:22:04,273 --> 00:22:05,392
treated by the natural fire.

192
00:23:45,392 --> 00:23:46,993
The sun truly came out.

193
00:23:47,832 --> 00:23:48,792
You're lucky.

194
00:23:56,233 --> 00:23:57,713
Bear with it. Don't move.

195
00:24:17,673 --> 00:24:19,753
I... I wasn't ready earlier.

196
00:24:23,832 --> 00:24:24,832
Then I'll count to three.

197
00:24:27,753 --> 00:24:28,273
One.

198
00:24:37,993 --> 00:24:38,953
Are you treating me

199
00:24:39,792 --> 00:24:40,552
or torturing me?

200
00:24:40,592 --> 00:24:41,872
Keep this, and you're a goner.

201
00:24:43,433 --> 00:24:44,233
Do it.

202
00:24:47,753 --> 00:24:48,792
We're not friends.

203
00:24:50,152 --> 00:24:51,993
Nor comrades fighting together.

204
00:24:52,913 --> 00:24:54,112
You're like Sun Zhou,

205
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:56,033
another innocent hurt by Earth Fiends.

206
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:59,513
I'm saving you out of duty
as a South Mountain Hunter.

207
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:02,473
It doesn't mean I trust you yet.

208
00:25:06,632 --> 00:25:07,673
There's time ahead.

209
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:09,792
I'll earn your trust.

210
00:25:50,233 --> 00:25:51,072
Where are my people?

211
00:25:51,673 --> 00:25:52,632
Same as you,

212
00:25:52,713 --> 00:25:54,072
being treated well

213
00:25:54,872 --> 00:25:55,753
and perfectly safe.

214
00:25:56,713 --> 00:25:57,552
At least

215
00:25:58,392 --> 00:25:59,392
for now.

216
00:26:02,033 --> 00:26:03,792
No matter where one stands

217
00:26:03,872 --> 00:26:05,433
and what motives they have,

218
00:26:05,632 --> 00:26:08,193
maintaining courtesy
and mutual respect is essential.

219
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:10,152
In this aspect,

220
00:26:10,832 --> 00:26:12,473
I believe we've done

221
00:26:12,953 --> 00:26:14,193
much better than you.

222
00:26:14,473 --> 00:26:15,152
You?

223
00:26:16,473 --> 00:26:17,473
We?

224
00:26:22,312 --> 00:26:25,433
Our relationship
actually holds multiple possibilities.

225
00:26:26,112 --> 00:26:27,872
Hunter and prey

226
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,513
is the most superficial layer.

227
00:26:32,953 --> 00:26:35,993
Archenemies
with millennia of grievances.

228
00:26:36,832 --> 00:26:40,673
Equally matched forces of good and evil.

229
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,352
Sworn enemies
who can't share the same sky.

230
00:26:44,552 --> 00:26:46,632
Counterbalancing rivals
meeting their match.

231
00:26:46,632 --> 00:26:48,392
Two even parties with bridged divides.

232
00:26:48,392 --> 00:26:49,993
Or even partners forging mutual gain.

233
00:26:50,632 --> 00:26:52,913
I believe all options remain possible.

234
00:26:55,993 --> 00:26:57,592
May I first know

235
00:26:59,673 --> 00:27:00,792
who I'm speaking with

236
00:27:02,072 --> 00:27:02,953
before deciding

237
00:27:04,513 --> 00:27:05,592
what should be said?

238
00:27:06,392 --> 00:27:09,552
You have a short lifespan
but impressive forgetfulness.

239
00:27:10,513 --> 00:27:13,552
We met at the Golden Gate 20 years ago.

240
00:27:20,433 --> 00:27:22,433
You were there
when we repaired the Golden Gate?

241
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:25,392
You remember how Mr. Crip lost his leg,

242
00:27:26,233 --> 00:27:27,112
don't you?

243
00:28:22,392 --> 00:28:23,033
Xue!

244
00:28:24,072 --> 00:28:24,713
Xue!

245
00:28:24,832 --> 00:28:25,513
Xue!

246
00:28:59,632 --> 00:29:00,832
How many more like you

247
00:29:01,792 --> 00:29:02,753
exist?

248
00:29:04,632 --> 00:29:06,193
How many South Mountain Hunters

249
00:29:06,193 --> 00:29:07,753
believe in Earth Fiends?

250
00:29:10,392 --> 00:29:11,152
How did you

251
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:15,233
become what you are now?

252
00:29:23,112 --> 00:29:25,913
Do you prefer our original forms?

253
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:31,033
Like that young Earth Fiend
you captured?

254
00:29:38,592 --> 00:29:40,433
The one in the woods yesterday

255
00:29:42,193 --> 00:29:43,392
was it, right?

256
00:29:47,592 --> 00:29:49,713
The big one that escaped back then

257
00:29:53,312 --> 00:29:54,233
was you?

258
00:30:21,872 --> 00:30:24,784
(Xiong Hei)

259
00:30:56,112 --> 00:30:58,832
So the natural fire is sunlight.

260
00:31:01,832 --> 00:31:03,433
It's pure thermal energy from nature.

261
00:31:03,632 --> 00:31:05,152
That excludes all artificial flames.

262
00:31:07,993 --> 00:31:08,953
The pain is killing me.

263
00:31:09,872 --> 00:31:11,112
But the results are immediate.

264
00:31:11,352 --> 00:31:13,392
Lightning works faster with zero pain.

265
00:31:13,753 --> 00:31:14,473
Try it next time.

266
00:31:18,872 --> 00:31:21,033
Dr. Nie, the divine healer, have mercy.

267
00:31:24,513 --> 00:31:25,592
If you're fine,

268
00:31:25,673 --> 00:31:27,233
pack your things and let's leave.

269
00:31:29,072 --> 00:31:31,632
Since we're here, eat before leaving.

270
00:31:32,832 --> 00:31:33,713
What's there to eat?

271
00:31:35,072 --> 00:31:37,112
Something good. Wait here.

272
00:31:37,513 --> 00:31:38,112
I'll fetch it.

273
00:31:52,312 --> 00:31:53,913
Modern client entertainment

274
00:31:54,033 --> 00:31:57,872
doesn't mean golf, nightclubs,

275
00:31:58,392 --> 00:32:00,112
or lavish feasts anymore.

276
00:32:01,872 --> 00:32:02,552
Take this.

277
00:32:03,913 --> 00:32:05,433
Camping, cycling,

278
00:32:05,953 --> 00:32:06,673
and fishing.

279
00:32:06,993 --> 00:32:08,072
Those are trendy now.

280
00:32:09,072 --> 00:32:10,913
So these gears

281
00:32:10,913 --> 00:32:12,913
stay permanently in my car.

282
00:32:16,713 --> 00:32:18,392
How old is this instant noodle pack?

283
00:32:19,193 --> 00:32:21,193
Relax, it's perfectly edible.

284
00:32:30,112 --> 00:32:30,792
Thank you.

285
00:32:31,392 --> 00:32:32,233
You saved my life.

286
00:32:34,273 --> 00:32:35,072
Your life's value

287
00:32:35,433 --> 00:32:36,832
equals one noodle pack?

288
00:32:41,792 --> 00:32:44,072
It depends if you
grant me future chances

289
00:32:44,112 --> 00:32:46,033
to properly express gratitude.

290
00:32:46,473 --> 00:32:47,592
If not,

291
00:32:47,673 --> 00:32:49,273
this humble offering becomes

292
00:32:49,273 --> 00:32:50,273
my most precious thanks.

293
00:33:14,152 --> 00:33:15,832
I remember in childhood,

294
00:33:16,233 --> 00:33:18,352
my mom made casserole noodles
for me and my sister.

295
00:33:18,352 --> 00:33:19,792
(Xicang Instant Noodles)
She used this Xicang brand.

296
00:33:20,753 --> 00:33:21,753
It's hard to find now.

297
00:33:21,913 --> 00:33:24,033
Not something you can get anytime.

298
00:33:27,473 --> 00:33:28,513
You have a sister?

299
00:33:34,193 --> 00:33:35,152
It was a long time ago.

300
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:36,673
She went missing.

301
00:33:41,433 --> 00:33:42,713
Is it also related to Lin Xirou?

302
00:34:09,473 --> 00:34:10,433
The sun's out.

303
00:34:11,353 --> 00:34:12,953
The others will heal too.

304
00:34:21,913 --> 00:34:24,033
Your wound
won't root and sprout anymore.

305
00:34:24,953 --> 00:34:26,833
But take the necessary antibiotics

306
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:28,152
and tetanus shots.

307
00:34:28,592 --> 00:34:29,592
And avoid hospitals.

308
00:34:30,513 --> 00:34:31,473
I assume you don't want

309
00:34:31,473 --> 00:34:32,632
to leave evidence trails.

310
00:34:33,632 --> 00:34:35,833
Understood. I have a doctor friend.

311
00:34:35,913 --> 00:34:36,752
He can help me.

312
00:34:39,473 --> 00:34:40,152
Trustworthy?

313
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:41,632
Sure.

314
00:34:46,513 --> 00:34:47,993
Good noodles. Thanks.

315
00:34:49,112 --> 00:34:50,152
Plenty more. Say it if...

316
00:34:50,152 --> 00:34:50,873
No need.

317
00:35:16,793 --> 00:35:19,192
One question's haunted me.

318
00:35:20,513 --> 00:35:21,112
Yes?

319
00:35:21,592 --> 00:35:24,192
Why are there five coins
hanging down here?

320
00:35:25,033 --> 00:35:26,033
Five Emperor Coins.

321
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:27,833
Round and square.

322
00:35:28,592 --> 00:35:29,592
Cosmic unity.

323
00:35:29,993 --> 00:35:31,072
They ward off evil.

324
00:35:33,232 --> 00:35:33,873
What?

325
00:35:34,793 --> 00:35:35,793
Do you think

326
00:35:37,033 --> 00:35:38,793
I've ruined the integrity
of your artwork?

327
00:35:40,232 --> 00:35:41,473
Not exactly 'ruined.'

328
00:35:42,353 --> 00:35:43,873
Hermit Duck was my early creation.

329
00:35:44,152 --> 00:35:45,513
It accidentally turned out well.

330
00:35:46,033 --> 00:35:48,072
No systematic creative philosophy
is behind it.

331
00:35:49,152 --> 00:35:50,953
I just feel they don't match well.

332
00:35:57,953 --> 00:35:58,752
A hermit

333
00:35:59,473 --> 00:36:00,752
retreats from worldly affairs,

334
00:36:01,953 --> 00:36:04,152
free from fame and wealth
and content with simplicity.

335
00:36:06,433 --> 00:36:09,913
Ducks sense the warmth
of spring rivers first.

336
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:13,232
It's an image full of spring vitality,
warm and cozy.

337
00:36:14,793 --> 00:36:15,712
Five Emperor Coins

338
00:36:16,953 --> 00:36:19,632
attract fortune, wealth, peace, and joy.

339
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:24,112
Hermit, duck, and coins.

340
00:36:24,552 --> 00:36:27,353
These three elements
complement each other.

341
00:36:27,833 --> 00:36:28,993
A perfect combination.

342
00:36:30,552 --> 00:36:32,513
You're pretending
to be knowledgeable again.

343
00:36:35,953 --> 00:36:38,552
I told you, you're an optimistic person.

344
00:36:41,712 --> 00:36:43,072
Since when does the heir

345
00:36:43,552 --> 00:36:45,272
of Roadsound buy this for himself?

346
00:36:53,232 --> 00:36:53,913
My sister

347
00:36:56,112 --> 00:36:56,953
had always

348
00:36:56,953 --> 00:36:59,033
loved yellow rubber ducks,

349
00:36:59,993 --> 00:37:01,552
and the sight of a real duckling

350
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:02,592
would melt her.

351
00:37:04,353 --> 00:37:05,953
So whenever I see ducks,

352
00:37:06,152 --> 00:37:07,192
I think of her.

353
00:37:09,112 --> 00:37:10,592
The Hermit Duck's image

354
00:37:11,592 --> 00:37:13,072
is restrained and disciplined.

355
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,632
It reminds me of myself.

356
00:37:18,353 --> 00:37:19,672
So when I saw this pendant,

357
00:37:19,913 --> 00:37:20,993
I immediately wanted it.

358
00:37:21,793 --> 00:37:22,632
I remember

359
00:37:23,672 --> 00:37:25,873
seeing it in some client's car.

360
00:37:26,152 --> 00:37:27,393
And I snatched it right off.

361
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:44,232
Still no news about your sister?

362
00:37:51,353 --> 00:37:52,473
I'll find her.

363
00:37:54,152 --> 00:37:54,953
When that day comes,

364
00:37:56,033 --> 00:37:57,192
I'll give her this duck.

365
00:37:57,953 --> 00:37:59,033
She'll love it.

366
00:38:08,272 --> 00:38:10,033
Then I'll make her a new one,

367
00:38:11,393 --> 00:38:12,632
the only one in the world.

368
00:38:34,793 --> 00:38:35,752
Say that again.

369
00:38:36,072 --> 00:38:36,793
I'll record it.

370
00:38:38,393 --> 00:38:39,632
Just focus on driving.
