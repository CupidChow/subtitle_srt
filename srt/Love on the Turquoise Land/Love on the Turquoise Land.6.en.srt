(Toxic and Hazardous)

18
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,802
Mad Blade sits in the central tent.

19
00:03:50,003 --> 00:03:53,122
Once entering the Twilight Chasm,

20
00:03:53,962 --> 00:03:58,362
fiends hunt human monsters.

21
00:04:00,763 --> 00:04:05,923
Blades and hounds
walk the Turquoise Land,

22
00:04:07,242 --> 00:04:12,682
and Ghost Whip cracks his glowing whip.

23
00:04:17,322 --> 00:04:19,083
Are you a South Mountain Hunter?

24
00:04:21,442 --> 00:04:22,603
Just wait.

25
00:04:23,442 --> 00:04:25,122
When Mad Blade arrives,

26
00:04:25,762 --> 00:04:27,603
your membranes will be split open,

27
00:04:28,483 --> 00:04:30,283
your rotten guts

28
00:04:31,163 --> 00:04:35,163
spilled to the sun.

29
00:04:35,523 --> 00:04:36,362
Listen to me.

30
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,483
I'm not an Earth Fiend.

31
00:04:37,483 --> 00:04:38,523
I'm here to help you.

32
00:04:38,723 --> 00:04:42,643
Seven hounds, two whips, and one blade.

33
00:04:43,762 --> 00:04:47,083
The Golden Gate
is fortified beyond defeat.

34
00:04:48,043 --> 00:04:50,643
Blades, hounds, and whips unite.

35
00:04:50,643 --> 00:04:55,643
None of you invaders will return alive.

36
00:04:58,723 --> 00:04:59,483
Have some water.

37
00:04:59,483 --> 00:05:00,843
Take your time. Speak slowly.

38
00:05:12,843 --> 00:05:17,802
A patrol checks
the Golden Gate every fourth year.

39
00:05:18,762 --> 00:05:24,002
No more wrongful deaths in Nanba.

40
00:05:56,643 --> 00:05:57,923
In this greenhouse of ours,

41
00:05:59,002 --> 00:06:01,122
the catalytic spray
activates periodically.

42
00:06:01,442 --> 00:06:04,723
It significantly improves
medicinal herb grafting success.

43
00:06:05,122 --> 00:06:07,283
But it's extremely harmful to humans.

44
00:06:07,843 --> 00:06:09,322
Hence the alarm system.

45
00:06:09,643 --> 00:06:10,283
See?

46
00:06:11,122 --> 00:06:12,682
The spraying will start any minute.

47
00:06:13,643 --> 00:06:15,362
You need to figure out quickly

48
00:06:15,362 --> 00:06:16,603
how to explain this to me.

49
00:06:23,923 --> 00:06:25,802
Am I the General Manager
of Roadsound Group?

50
00:06:26,202 --> 00:06:27,043
Yes.

51
00:06:28,403 --> 00:06:30,723
Then why do I always
feel like an outsider?

52
00:06:32,283 --> 00:06:34,163
I know less
about core operations and personnel

53
00:06:34,163 --> 00:06:35,483
than you do.

54
00:06:36,643 --> 00:06:37,523
I get it now.

55
00:06:38,643 --> 00:06:39,643
So,

56
00:06:39,643 --> 00:06:41,963
you're conducting field research?

57
00:06:42,362 --> 00:06:42,923
Right?

58
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:57,643
You're hiding things from me.

59
00:06:58,442 --> 00:07:01,403
Since I first met Ms. Lin as a kid,

60
00:07:01,442 --> 00:07:02,843
she hasn't aged a single day.

61
00:07:03,603 --> 00:07:04,242
Xiong,

62
00:07:04,403 --> 00:07:06,322
you've fought hard for the group

63
00:07:06,723 --> 00:07:08,682
and taken serious injuries
multiple times, right?

64
00:07:09,002 --> 00:07:10,403
But after resting for a few days,

65
00:07:10,523 --> 00:07:11,523
you recover completely.

66
00:07:11,523 --> 00:07:12,603
Do you think I buy that?

67
00:07:13,603 --> 00:07:15,083
I don't care what you're developing

68
00:07:15,603 --> 00:07:17,322
or if it's supposedly to protect me.

69
00:07:17,322 --> 00:07:18,562
But I'm not a child anymore.

70
00:07:18,562 --> 00:07:19,723
Nor am I a fool!

71
00:07:19,802 --> 00:07:21,603
I'm part of this family too!

72
00:07:29,762 --> 00:07:31,202
I won't be a mascot anymore,

73
00:07:31,723 --> 00:07:34,002
playing cards with this CEO

74
00:07:34,322 --> 00:07:35,762
or fishing with that president.

75
00:07:49,043 --> 00:07:50,083
To reach this day,

76
00:07:57,163 --> 00:08:00,122
to become my true self,

77
00:08:00,562 --> 00:08:02,122
I've exhausted myself.

78
00:08:06,562 --> 00:08:07,322
If...

79
00:08:07,643 --> 00:08:09,242
If I can't...

80
00:08:10,442 --> 00:08:13,562
If I can't become one of you,

81
00:08:18,442 --> 00:08:19,083
then today...

82
00:08:19,802 --> 00:08:20,923
let's end this all.

83
00:08:23,643 --> 00:08:24,283
Let me...

84
00:08:27,002 --> 00:08:27,802
finally...

85
00:08:28,682 --> 00:08:29,442
be free.

86
00:09:09,763 --> 00:09:11,442
Ms. Lin, you understand Yan Tuo best.

87
00:09:12,202 --> 00:09:14,763
The "invite-the-enemy-into-jar" trick
worked perfectly.

88
00:09:16,482 --> 00:09:17,562
He went to the farm?

89
00:09:19,363 --> 00:09:21,763
His reaction suggests no suspicion.

90
00:09:22,442 --> 00:09:24,643
Just curiosity and wanting to belong.

91
00:09:25,403 --> 00:09:27,842
But if we keep lying,

92
00:09:28,923 --> 00:09:30,202
and he discovers something

93
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:31,842
and then confronts you about it,

94
00:09:32,883 --> 00:09:33,602
that'll be worse.

95
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:35,763
Speak your mind directly.

96
00:09:37,363 --> 00:09:38,883
Once he truly understands

97
00:09:38,883 --> 00:09:41,482
he's not like us,

98
00:09:42,283 --> 00:09:43,602
he'll have two choices.

99
00:09:44,562 --> 00:09:45,722
Either assimilate

100
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,082
or leave.

101
00:09:48,802 --> 00:09:52,243
Assimilation requires
full disclosure from you.

102
00:09:52,243 --> 00:09:53,403
No reservations.

103
00:09:54,643 --> 00:09:56,123
If he chooses to leave,

104
00:09:57,562 --> 00:09:59,163
we have to eliminate him.

105
00:09:59,602 --> 00:10:01,243
He's not a blood bag after all.

106
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:03,523
Ms. Lin,

107
00:10:04,962 --> 00:10:06,602
it's time to decide.

108
00:10:09,403 --> 00:10:13,923
Whether we let the fox
in the henhouse remains uncertain,

109
00:10:15,202 --> 00:10:19,962
but it's time to lure the enemy out.

110
00:10:30,058 --> 00:10:32,656
(Nanshan Rescue Team,
Xicang City, Yanguan Province)

111
00:10:38,682 --> 00:10:39,442
You see,

112
00:10:39,763 --> 00:10:41,043
this is where we treat injuries

113
00:10:41,043 --> 00:10:42,202
at the base.

114
00:10:42,283 --> 00:10:43,682
Conditions aren't hospital-grade.

115
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:45,682
And this is the best equipment

116
00:10:45,682 --> 00:10:47,082
we can get.

117
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,802
Mrs. Hua is in a stable condition now.

118
00:10:52,283 --> 00:10:54,923
Let's arrange shifts then.

119
00:10:55,082 --> 00:10:55,962
Keep a close eye.

120
00:10:56,962 --> 00:10:59,123
All right. I'll take
the first shift tonight.

121
00:10:59,523 --> 00:11:02,003
Ma Hanzi and I are usually
at the base most of the time.

122
00:11:02,523 --> 00:11:03,842
He's familiar with this place.

123
00:11:04,283 --> 00:11:05,283
He can take more shifts.

124
00:11:06,283 --> 00:11:07,802
Our top priority right now is

125
00:11:07,962 --> 00:11:09,602
to find out any news about Mr. Crip.

126
00:11:13,202 --> 00:11:14,243
What's up, Jiang?

127
00:11:15,602 --> 00:11:16,523
It's from the hospital.

128
00:11:17,482 --> 00:11:18,802
They said they received

129
00:11:19,482 --> 00:11:20,842
a letter addressed to Mrs. Hua.

130
00:11:21,562 --> 00:11:22,523
The head nurse mentioned

131
00:11:23,602 --> 00:11:25,082
the envelope reads,

132
00:11:25,923 --> 00:11:27,482
"To the South Mountain Hunters,

133
00:11:28,523 --> 00:11:30,082
from an old friend at the Golden Gate."

134
00:11:43,883 --> 00:11:45,243
Since you like cats so much,

135
00:11:45,602 --> 00:11:48,643
why not properly adopt a pretty one?

136
00:11:48,923 --> 00:11:50,482
This scruffy calico cat

137
00:11:50,802 --> 00:11:51,842
eats and runs.

138
00:11:52,043 --> 00:11:53,363
It won't even let us pet it once.

139
00:11:55,003 --> 00:11:56,442
In the feline world,

140
00:11:56,722 --> 00:11:58,322
calicos are seen as the most beautiful.

141
00:11:58,682 --> 00:11:59,602
Don't you think it is

142
00:11:59,602 --> 00:12:01,043
independent and full of character?

143
00:12:01,842 --> 00:12:03,003
Free-spirited

144
00:12:03,043 --> 00:12:04,363
and reliant on no one.

145
00:12:04,482 --> 00:12:06,562
Then it shouldn't come here
for free meals.

146
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:07,763
Let it catch mice itself.

147
00:12:09,202 --> 00:12:11,043
That's exactly what makes it remarkable.

148
00:12:11,962 --> 00:12:13,283
No begging or groveling,

149
00:12:13,842 --> 00:12:15,363
yet it makes people care about it

150
00:12:15,363 --> 00:12:16,523
and want to pamper it.

151
00:12:16,763 --> 00:12:17,883
By your logic,

152
00:12:17,962 --> 00:12:19,523
when young people date,

153
00:12:19,962 --> 00:12:22,202
they should learn from stray cats?

154
00:12:23,403 --> 00:12:24,322
Not exactly.

155
00:12:25,163 --> 00:12:26,403
If humans acted like that,

156
00:12:26,403 --> 00:12:27,802
they'd become rather annoying.

157
00:12:33,842 --> 00:12:35,482
(Nobody)
(New updates. Same spot tonight?)

158
00:12:41,582 --> 00:12:42,082
Thank you.

159
00:12:42,082 --> 00:12:42,722
Enjoy your meal.

160
00:12:43,082 --> 00:12:43,763
You came.

161
00:12:54,163 --> 00:12:55,842
How did you know my favorite dishes?

162
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,442
You're a regular here.

163
00:12:58,163 --> 00:12:59,123
The owner knows.

164
00:13:02,763 --> 00:13:04,883
How did she know who you meant?

165
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:07,123
I asked her,

166
00:13:07,682 --> 00:13:09,283
"The exceptionally beautiful lady

167
00:13:09,283 --> 00:13:10,523
with sharp-tongued remarks

168
00:13:10,883 --> 00:13:12,523
and an artistic appearance,

169
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:15,722
but hiding countless secrets.

170
00:13:15,842 --> 00:13:16,962
What did she usually order?"

171
00:13:18,082 --> 00:13:19,322
She recognized you instantly.

172
00:13:20,763 --> 00:13:22,163
So that was a compliment?

173
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,082
What does Mad Blade mean?

174
00:13:26,802 --> 00:13:27,523
Mad Blade.

175
00:13:33,202 --> 00:13:36,523
A performing troupe
calls their year-end finale

176
00:13:36,562 --> 00:13:37,523
Closing the Chest.

177
00:13:38,003 --> 00:13:39,602
A footballer's farewell match

178
00:13:39,602 --> 00:13:40,722
is Hanging Up the Boots.

179
00:13:41,163 --> 00:13:41,842
So, I think

180
00:13:42,163 --> 00:13:43,883
it means retirement from the world

181
00:13:43,883 --> 00:13:44,763
of combat.

182
00:13:47,722 --> 00:13:48,403
Fine.

183
00:13:49,243 --> 00:13:50,923
Keep your secrets if you must.

184
00:13:51,763 --> 00:13:52,883
I just want you to know

185
00:13:52,883 --> 00:13:54,682
they're deeply concerned
about Mad Blade.

186
00:13:56,722 --> 00:13:58,202
This intel's on the house.

187
00:13:58,202 --> 00:13:59,442
Not included in the tally.

188
00:14:07,482 --> 00:14:08,163
Thanks.

189
00:14:08,923 --> 00:14:10,043
Shall we cut to the chase?

190
00:14:14,403 --> 00:14:15,283
I located the man.

191
00:14:16,482 --> 00:14:17,082
Where?

192
00:14:20,562 --> 00:14:21,523
Heavily guarded.

193
00:14:21,923 --> 00:14:24,163
Probably tortured too.

194
00:14:24,403 --> 00:14:25,523
His mind's gone foggy.

195
00:14:26,003 --> 00:14:27,363
But he's tight-lipped.

196
00:14:27,682 --> 00:14:28,523
He disclosed nothing.

197
00:14:31,923 --> 00:14:32,962
How can you be sure

198
00:14:33,482 --> 00:14:34,363
that the one you found

199
00:14:34,363 --> 00:14:35,682
is the one I mentioned?

200
00:14:40,043 --> 00:14:42,523
Disabled left calf, correct?

201
00:14:51,202 --> 00:14:54,003
Mad Blade... It's a person, isn't it?

202
00:14:55,802 --> 00:14:57,003
What's your real angle here?

203
00:14:57,322 --> 00:14:58,003
He said

204
00:14:58,883 --> 00:15:01,482
Mad Blade could pierce
the Earth Fiends' membranes,

205
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:04,202
exposing their guts to daylight.

206
00:15:06,043 --> 00:15:06,842
Therefore, Mad Blade

207
00:15:06,842 --> 00:15:09,082
must be your trump card
against the Earth Fiends.

208
00:15:11,763 --> 00:15:13,363
Not discussing this today.

209
00:15:14,763 --> 00:15:16,643
Only matters I care about.

210
00:15:17,123 --> 00:15:18,123
The man I want to save.

211
00:15:20,482 --> 00:15:21,003
Understood.

212
00:15:23,643 --> 00:15:25,082
He's still valuable to Lin Xirou.

213
00:15:25,322 --> 00:15:26,763
No immediate danger.

214
00:15:28,442 --> 00:15:29,283
But Xiong Hei

215
00:15:29,283 --> 00:15:31,243
threatens how long that'll hold.

216
00:15:31,523 --> 00:15:33,043
If you want to save him, act fast.

217
00:15:34,202 --> 00:15:36,043
Also, I need to make this clear upfront.

218
00:15:36,283 --> 00:15:37,802
In fact, I want to help you.

219
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:39,003
But this matter

220
00:15:39,163 --> 00:15:40,722
has made Xiong Hei suspect me.

221
00:15:41,403 --> 00:15:42,403
At this point,

222
00:15:42,403 --> 00:15:44,363
I consider the mission accomplished.

223
00:15:44,883 --> 00:15:46,682
Now, it's your turn to pay
per our agreement.

224
00:15:48,363 --> 00:15:49,322
No need to remind me.

225
00:15:53,802 --> 00:15:54,482
Say it.

226
00:15:58,962 --> 00:15:59,722
Next time,

227
00:16:00,602 --> 00:16:02,883
whenever and for whatever reason,

228
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,003
if I ask to meet you,

229
00:16:04,202 --> 00:16:05,243
you can't refuse.

230
00:16:17,722 --> 00:16:19,722
All of you are indispensable.

231
00:16:20,082 --> 00:16:22,322
They're trying
to wipe us all out at once.

232
00:16:24,082 --> 00:16:25,682
Inviting all of us

233
00:16:25,682 --> 00:16:27,123
shows they've got a solid plan.

234
00:16:28,482 --> 00:16:29,923
No dirty tricks, a straight fight.

235
00:16:30,283 --> 00:16:31,123
We fear nobody.

236
00:16:31,643 --> 00:16:32,722
At the ice factory,

237
00:16:33,082 --> 00:16:34,482
we were ambushed,

238
00:16:34,883 --> 00:16:36,202
which led to Mrs. Hua's injury.

239
00:16:36,802 --> 00:16:37,682
Underhanded tactics

240
00:16:37,962 --> 00:16:38,962
are their specialty.

241
00:16:40,562 --> 00:16:41,363
Then what do we do?

242
00:16:41,722 --> 00:16:42,802
Mrs. Hua's unconscious,

243
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:43,842
and Mr. Crip...

244
00:16:49,283 --> 00:16:50,403
Show of hands.

245
00:16:51,163 --> 00:16:51,842
Go or not?

246
00:16:54,562 --> 00:16:55,523
I absolutely must go.

247
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:58,482
I missed out last time,

248
00:16:59,202 --> 00:17:00,682
so I'm definitely going this time.

249
00:17:02,043 --> 00:17:03,322
Would anyone actually skip this?

250
00:17:43,843 --> 00:17:44,923
Mr. Crip has been captured.

251
00:17:46,323 --> 00:17:48,163
If you still won't take action,

252
00:17:49,762 --> 00:17:51,083
consider this visit nonexistent.

253
00:17:56,563 --> 00:17:57,242
Time?

254
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:58,722
Location?

255
00:17:59,762 --> 00:18:01,643
You should join our operation.

256
00:18:02,442 --> 00:18:02,962
That way...

257
00:18:02,962 --> 00:18:04,163
I told Jiang.

258
00:18:05,202 --> 00:18:06,603
After this mission ends,

259
00:18:06,603 --> 00:18:07,682
I'll quit completely.

260
00:18:08,163 --> 00:18:09,123
When peace returns,

261
00:18:10,603 --> 00:18:12,002
you can make new plans.

262
00:18:12,722 --> 00:18:14,202
But now that enemies have emerged,

263
00:18:14,603 --> 00:18:16,403
how could we not have the Mad Blade?

264
00:18:20,123 --> 00:18:21,682
We both have our own duties

265
00:18:21,682 --> 00:18:22,843
and desires.

266
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:25,442
I won't interfere with your choices,

267
00:18:26,202 --> 00:18:27,722
and I hope you'll respect mine.

268
00:18:28,923 --> 00:18:30,323
Send me the time and place.

269
00:18:31,282 --> 00:18:32,202
I'll be there on time.

270
00:18:39,482 --> 00:18:40,403
Tomorrow's a day off.

271
00:18:40,563 --> 00:18:42,123
I'll go to an art exhibition downtown.

272
00:18:42,323 --> 00:18:43,202
What about you?

273
00:18:48,363 --> 00:18:49,563
Not in good form today.

274
00:18:50,123 --> 00:18:51,403
Wrapped in a hide,

275
00:18:51,403 --> 00:18:52,643
the fiend bone is scentless.

276
00:18:55,323 --> 00:18:56,682
I'll try it alone tomorrow.

277
00:18:56,682 --> 00:18:57,962
Tomorrow's a day off.

278
00:18:58,323 --> 00:18:59,722
There's an art exhibition downtown.

279
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:00,242
I want to go.

280
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:01,682
What's your plan?

281
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:07,002
I heard.

282
00:19:07,962 --> 00:19:08,962
Go by yourself then.

283
00:19:10,923 --> 00:19:11,883
I want extra practice.

284
00:19:13,242 --> 00:19:14,563
Fine. Keep drilling.

285
00:19:16,962 --> 00:19:17,643
Luo.

286
00:19:20,482 --> 00:19:21,682
You know about Huoquan Pills?

287
00:19:24,923 --> 00:19:25,563
Yes.

288
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,762
But I don't believe they work.

289
00:19:28,403 --> 00:19:29,522
Hope you don't either.

290
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:32,482
The Hound Clan relies on smell,

291
00:19:33,163 --> 00:19:34,282
but our five senses

292
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:36,603
each drain energy.

293
00:19:38,202 --> 00:19:39,442
Sacrificing one

294
00:19:39,603 --> 00:19:40,803
to enhance another

295
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:42,883
seems worthwhile to me.

296
00:19:43,762 --> 00:19:45,042
Seems foolish to me.

297
00:19:58,123 --> 00:19:59,242
Huoquan Pills,

298
00:19:59,682 --> 00:20:01,042
the hunters' ancient formula,

299
00:20:02,002 --> 00:20:03,282
clear nasal passages,

300
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:05,202
remove congestion

301
00:20:05,883 --> 00:20:07,643
and help one detect fiends miles away.

302
00:20:11,482 --> 00:20:14,242
But effects and toxicity coexist.

303
00:20:16,163 --> 00:20:18,442
A clear nose brings blindness.

304
00:20:19,403 --> 00:20:20,403
Inferior medicine.

305
00:20:23,603 --> 00:20:24,563
Best left unconsumed.

306
00:20:27,042 --> 00:20:28,123
May not be fully blind.

307
00:20:28,482 --> 00:20:29,403
I've researched.

308
00:20:30,002 --> 00:20:32,522
Huoquan Pills only
dilate pupils in daylight,

309
00:20:32,762 --> 00:20:33,843
blinding glare vision.

310
00:20:34,282 --> 00:20:36,083
Night vision remains.

311
00:20:36,522 --> 00:20:38,323
All Mad Dog candidates

312
00:20:38,682 --> 00:20:41,843
can choose to take the pills or not,

313
00:20:43,002 --> 00:20:46,002
but consumption
doesn't guarantee selection.

314
00:20:47,242 --> 00:20:50,323
Consequences are your own.

315
00:20:55,323 --> 00:20:56,123
Jiang,

316
00:20:58,123 --> 00:20:59,123
I've made up my mind.

317
00:21:00,962 --> 00:21:01,803
Don't you want

318
00:21:03,242 --> 00:21:04,442
to talk to Luo first

319
00:21:05,323 --> 00:21:06,522
and hear what she thinks?

320
00:21:09,123 --> 00:21:10,242
Becoming a Mad Dog

321
00:21:11,123 --> 00:21:13,202
is about becoming
a stronger South Mountain hunter

322
00:21:14,722 --> 00:21:16,202
to protect everyone better.

323
00:21:26,123 --> 00:21:28,042
This is my decision
after careful consideration.

324
00:21:30,482 --> 00:21:31,803
No more discussions with anyone.

325
00:21:52,883 --> 00:21:53,803
Have you had a friend

326
00:21:55,923 --> 00:21:57,282
or perhaps a companion?

327
00:21:59,202 --> 00:22:00,123
I mean,

328
00:22:02,163 --> 00:22:03,442
someone other than me?

329
00:22:05,242 --> 00:22:06,083
Or rather

330
00:22:08,363 --> 00:22:09,923
before you came here,

331
00:22:12,482 --> 00:22:13,762
among your own kind,

332
00:22:15,843 --> 00:22:16,883
was there anyone

333
00:22:19,123 --> 00:22:20,603
you felt close to and trusted?

334
00:22:24,363 --> 00:22:25,442
If there was,

335
00:22:28,123 --> 00:22:30,282
and the one once inseparable from you

336
00:22:33,482 --> 00:22:35,042
gradually grows distant,

337
00:22:37,042 --> 00:22:38,202
becomes a stranger,

338
00:22:40,403 --> 00:22:41,803
and even no longer agrees with you

339
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:44,202
or understands you,

340
00:22:47,522 --> 00:22:48,403
what would you do?

341
00:22:56,123 --> 00:22:57,002
Resent her?

342
00:22:59,442 --> 00:23:00,363
Blame her?

343
00:23:04,803 --> 00:23:06,363
Though we're nothing alike,

344
00:23:09,202 --> 00:23:10,442
surely this feeling

345
00:23:14,363 --> 00:23:15,803
isn't hard for you to grasp.

346
00:23:25,643 --> 00:23:27,843
Only one bottle
contains fiend bone powder.

347
00:23:28,242 --> 00:23:29,403
Whoever finds it first

348
00:23:29,603 --> 00:23:31,323
gets to sleep in an hour tomorrow.

349
00:23:31,442 --> 00:23:32,002
Begin!

350
00:23:41,522 --> 00:23:42,722
It's diluted in water.

351
00:23:43,482 --> 00:23:44,762
How can we smell it?

352
00:23:45,603 --> 00:23:46,123
Exactly.

353
00:23:46,202 --> 00:23:46,803
Right.

354
00:23:48,403 --> 00:23:49,202
Left side.

355
00:23:52,522 --> 00:23:53,282
Third one.

356
00:24:02,282 --> 00:24:03,363
Xing Shen rests.

357
00:24:03,563 --> 00:24:04,762
You guys run three laps.

358
00:24:07,403 --> 00:24:08,883
Wait, wasn't the deal to reward us

359
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:10,123
with extra sleep?

360
00:24:10,123 --> 00:24:10,803
Five laps!

361
00:24:11,363 --> 00:24:12,002
Hurry up!

362
00:24:12,883 --> 00:24:13,522
- Go.
- Go.

363
00:24:15,682 --> 00:24:16,442
Run faster!

364
00:24:33,363 --> 00:24:34,643
But no matter what,

365
00:24:37,563 --> 00:24:38,883
companions remain companions.

366
00:24:41,682 --> 00:24:43,403
Even if we can't be open with each other

367
00:24:43,403 --> 00:24:44,603
like before,

368
00:24:45,843 --> 00:24:46,643
even if

369
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:49,603
one day in the future,

370
00:24:49,603 --> 00:24:51,643
we'll become strangers,

371
00:24:54,202 --> 00:24:56,563
right now we share the same struggle.

372
00:24:58,403 --> 00:25:00,123
We'll fight side by side.

373
00:25:02,242 --> 00:25:02,962
Otherwise,

374
00:25:05,363 --> 00:25:07,123
how could we call ourselves companions?

375
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:17,482
I'll be away soon.

376
00:25:18,282 --> 00:25:19,042
Be good.

377
00:25:19,923 --> 00:25:20,803
Wait for me to return.

378
00:25:22,962 --> 00:25:24,843
I'll bring your favorite wild boar.

379
00:26:01,083 --> 00:26:02,083
Xing Shen said

380
00:26:02,883 --> 00:26:04,282
you agreed to join the mission.

381
00:26:05,123 --> 00:26:06,163
Mr. Crip's in trouble.

382
00:26:06,563 --> 00:26:08,002
I can't just stand by.

383
00:26:08,923 --> 00:26:09,563
Good.

384
00:26:10,442 --> 00:26:11,403
Be careful.

385
00:26:13,762 --> 00:26:14,603
You too.

386
00:26:15,643 --> 00:26:17,163
These Earth Fiends we're facing now

387
00:26:17,163 --> 00:26:18,603
are unlike any we've encountered.

388
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:20,843
We must prepare thoroughly this time.

389
00:26:21,282 --> 00:26:22,442
South Mountain Hunters

390
00:26:22,762 --> 00:26:23,643
stay ever-ready.

391
00:26:24,762 --> 00:26:26,803
Though we haven't hunted
real fiends in years,

392
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,242
our skills remain sharp.

393
00:26:28,682 --> 00:26:30,323
Just like I never worry

394
00:26:30,962 --> 00:26:33,563
you'll lose your Mad Blade skills.

395
00:26:36,522 --> 00:26:37,843
This hardship is temporary.

396
00:26:39,403 --> 00:26:40,363
It will pass.

397
00:26:41,042 --> 00:26:41,843
Let's hope so.

398
00:26:43,002 --> 00:26:43,803
See you then.

399
00:27:09,843 --> 00:27:10,442
What's wrong?

400
00:27:10,563 --> 00:27:11,682
Tuo, where are you going?

401
00:27:13,163 --> 00:27:14,803
I saw Xiong Hei
rushing around anxiously.

402
00:27:15,242 --> 00:27:16,123
It must be serious.

403
00:27:16,123 --> 00:27:17,042
I'm following him.

404
00:27:17,323 --> 00:27:19,682
Isn't their rushing around normal?

405
00:27:20,123 --> 00:27:21,442
Maybe you should come back.

406
00:27:22,442 --> 00:27:23,242
I'm worried.

407
00:27:23,603 --> 00:27:24,403
Some things,

408
00:27:24,962 --> 00:27:26,202
once decided, must be faced

409
00:27:26,282 --> 00:27:27,442
sooner or later.

410
00:27:27,962 --> 00:27:30,242
But what if...?

411
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,083
Don't worry.

412
00:27:31,962 --> 00:27:32,722
I have my plan.

413
00:27:46,442 --> 00:27:47,242
Today,

414
00:27:48,042 --> 00:27:51,323
Ms. Lin brought up
me inviting Lv Xian to dinner again.

415
00:27:51,643 --> 00:27:53,002
You're not home.

416
00:27:55,363 --> 00:27:56,442
I don't want to go.

417
00:27:58,042 --> 00:27:59,403
It's strange how eager she is

418
00:27:59,522 --> 00:28:00,563
to push you two together.

419
00:28:00,722 --> 00:28:02,403
But we've known Lv Xian for ages.

420
00:28:02,962 --> 00:28:03,923
He's a bit talkative,

421
00:28:04,123 --> 00:28:05,202
but he's still reliable.

422
00:28:05,403 --> 00:28:07,242
Stop overthinking. Let it be.

423
00:28:07,643 --> 00:28:08,482
I know.

424
00:28:09,843 --> 00:28:10,883
But I really...

425
00:28:10,883 --> 00:28:11,722
Gotta go now.

426
00:28:11,843 --> 00:28:12,442
I'm losing him.

427
00:28:21,578 --> 00:28:23,952
(Entrusted by All, Aid from All Sides)

428
00:29:02,403 --> 00:29:03,403
Jiang.

429
00:29:08,282 --> 00:29:09,643
- Jiang.
- Jiang.

430
00:29:10,722 --> 00:29:11,722
Jiang.

431
00:29:28,843 --> 00:29:30,123
Everyone who could come is here.

432
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,768
Once entering the Twilight Chasm,
fiends hunt human monsters.

433
00:29:34,768 --> 00:29:36,643
Blades and hounds
walk the Turquoise Land,

434
00:29:36,843 --> 00:29:38,442
and Ghost Whip cracks his glowing whip.

435
00:29:38,603 --> 00:29:40,403
Seven hounds, two whips, and one blade.

436
00:29:40,843 --> 00:29:42,722
The Golden Gate
is fortified beyond defeat.

437
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:54,883
(We South Mountain Hunters,)

438
00:29:55,403 --> 00:29:57,202
(by imperial decree,)

439
00:29:57,442 --> 00:29:58,962
(traversed the Nanba Weald)

440
00:29:59,682 --> 00:30:02,323
(to brave fiends in battle.)

441
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:05,803
(Skilled in combat and sensing fiends,)

442
00:30:06,323 --> 00:30:08,002
(lurking in mountain shadows,)

443
00:30:08,563 --> 00:30:09,843
(indifferent to death,)

444
00:30:10,482 --> 00:30:12,442
(driving beasts from villages)

445
00:30:13,042 --> 00:30:15,202
(and protecting people from harm.)

446
00:30:16,403 --> 00:30:17,603
(Hounds)

447
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:20,442
(track by scent.)

448
00:30:20,643 --> 00:30:23,363
(Fiends find no hiding.)

449
00:30:24,682 --> 00:30:25,762
(Whips)

450
00:30:26,682 --> 00:30:28,363
(crack like thunder,)

451
00:30:29,002 --> 00:30:31,403
(binding fiends' steps.)

452
00:30:32,923 --> 00:30:34,002
(Blades)

453
00:30:34,482 --> 00:30:35,762
(feed their weapons with blood.)

454
00:30:36,123 --> 00:30:39,083
(Fiends die on sight.)

455
00:30:40,883 --> 00:30:43,883
Our ancestors fought
on the Turquoise Land,

456
00:30:44,522 --> 00:30:46,123
harassed by Earth Fiends.

457
00:30:46,843 --> 00:30:48,883
The king established
South Mountain Hunters

458
00:30:48,923 --> 00:30:50,363
to resist fiends unto death.

459
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:52,643
This legacy continues.

460
00:30:53,403 --> 00:30:54,843
Now, Earth Fiends return.

461
00:30:55,482 --> 00:30:56,962
We summon the Hunter King Cauldron

462
00:30:57,923 --> 00:30:59,083
and pray to our ancestors

463
00:31:00,163 --> 00:31:01,163
for protection.

464
00:31:03,163 --> 00:31:04,442
No fiends in the South Mountain,

465
00:31:05,762 --> 00:31:07,042
peace for all.

466
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,762
- No fiends in the South Mountain,
- No fiends in the South Mountain,

467
00:31:09,002 --> 00:31:10,603
- peace for all.
- peace for all.

468
00:31:53,883 --> 00:31:54,883
Let me introduce.

469
00:31:55,682 --> 00:31:56,843
This is Quecha who's been

470
00:31:57,603 --> 00:31:58,803
with me for over a decade.

471
00:32:00,403 --> 00:32:01,563
For this mission,

472
00:32:01,843 --> 00:32:03,803
we need home guards

473
00:32:04,163 --> 00:32:05,722
to watch Mrs. Hua

474
00:32:06,923 --> 00:32:07,843
and Ma Hanzi.

475
00:32:08,002 --> 00:32:08,762
Jiang,

476
00:32:09,123 --> 00:32:10,083
will Mad Blade come?

477
00:32:11,563 --> 00:32:12,202
Yes.

478
00:32:15,042 --> 00:32:16,202
She'll definitely come.

479
00:32:17,522 --> 00:32:19,803
Stars sink, mountains darken.

480
00:32:21,282 --> 00:32:23,482
Fiends rise on the Turquoise Land.

481
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,442
Wrap our heads and seal the gold.

482
00:32:27,363 --> 00:32:29,123
- Guard our home.
- Guard our home.

483
00:32:30,123 --> 00:32:32,242
- Old lineage,
- Old lineage,

484
00:32:32,962 --> 00:32:34,883
- shared duty.
- shared duty.

485
00:32:35,803 --> 00:32:37,762
- Gate opens.
- Gate opens.

486
00:32:38,282 --> 00:32:40,163
- Follow our ancestors.
- Follow our ancestors.

487
00:32:40,883 --> 00:32:42,522
- Gate opens!
- Gate opens!

488
00:32:42,843 --> 00:32:44,482
- Follow our ancestors!
- Follow our ancestors!

489
00:34:11,442 --> 00:34:14,203
South Mountain Hunters

490
00:34:16,203 --> 00:34:20,122
are not rabbit-shooting amateurs.

491
00:34:21,683 --> 00:34:24,243
Guns can't harm you.

492
00:34:25,883 --> 00:34:28,883
Today, you'll witness true power.

493
00:34:30,323 --> 00:34:33,162
Mad Blade alone could end you.

494
00:34:34,923 --> 00:34:37,803
Even our hounds' hammer strike

495
00:34:39,283 --> 00:34:44,042
hits harder than bullets.

496
00:34:44,723 --> 00:34:45,602
Xiong,

497
00:34:46,002 --> 00:34:47,923
can we silence this old man?

498
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:52,162
Sweet bait catches big fish.

499
00:34:55,082 --> 00:34:56,962
None of you invaders...

500
00:34:58,442 --> 00:35:00,363
None of you invaders...

501
00:35:01,403 --> 00:35:04,962
None of you invaders will return alive.

502
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,642
Jiang, we'll lead the charge.

503
00:35:50,243 --> 00:35:51,122
Leave some men

504
00:35:51,122 --> 00:35:52,403
to wait here with you,

505
00:35:52,602 --> 00:35:53,442
ready to support.

506
00:35:54,562 --> 00:35:55,243
Agreed.

507
00:35:56,122 --> 00:35:58,082
Retreat if things turn.

508
00:36:00,522 --> 00:36:01,522
We'll reinforce.

509
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,080
Dashuang, Xiaoshuang.

510
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:06,803
- Here.
- Here.

511
00:36:06,843 --> 00:36:07,522
Wu San.

512
00:36:07,522 --> 00:36:08,042
Here.

513
00:36:08,042 --> 00:36:09,162
- Pazi.
- Here.

514
00:36:09,323 --> 00:36:10,203
We'll stay here.

515
00:36:10,243 --> 00:36:11,002
The rest of you,

516
00:36:11,562 --> 00:36:12,243
move out.

517
00:36:12,363 --> 00:36:13,002
- Yes.
- Yes.

518
00:38:54,403 --> 00:38:54,923
Come on.

519
00:38:56,763 --> 00:38:57,363
Let's go.

520
00:39:15,642 --> 00:39:16,363
Fiends.

521
00:39:19,344 --> 00:39:20,400
Wu San, Dashuang!

522
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,122
- Here.
- Here.

523
00:39:21,122 --> 00:39:21,763
Follow me.

524
00:39:22,522 --> 00:39:23,363
You two stay behind.

525
00:39:23,602 --> 00:39:24,162
- Yes.
- Yes.

526
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,582
Old Blade.

527
00:41:08,843 --> 00:41:10,243
So this is what they look like.

528
00:41:11,522 --> 00:41:12,883
Hideously ugly.

529
00:41:13,323 --> 00:41:14,122
Right.

530
00:41:14,442 --> 00:41:15,283
Hammer formation!

531
00:41:36,162 --> 00:41:37,122
Whips, attack!

532
00:42:01,843 --> 00:42:02,343
