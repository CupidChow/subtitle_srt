(Yan Tuo, General Manager

(Legal Representative, Lin Xirou)

20
00:02:21,584 --> 00:02:23,280
(Mr. Lu)

21
00:02:25,652 --> 00:02:27,611
Could you stop rushing me?

22
00:02:28,932 --> 00:02:30,092
The world has changed.

23
00:02:30,411 --> 00:02:32,372
Aesthetic tastes
are growing more unpredictable.

24
00:02:33,252 --> 00:02:34,411
What are you talking about?

25
00:02:35,252 --> 00:02:36,652
Your unmarketable new creation

26
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:37,851
caught someone's eye.

27
00:02:38,332 --> 00:02:39,131
Really?

28
00:02:40,932 --> 00:02:41,812
I told him

29
00:02:42,131 --> 00:02:42,972
only drafts exist

30
00:02:42,972 --> 00:02:44,291
and the final product isn't done.

31
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:45,652
Yet he insisted

32
00:02:45,972 --> 00:02:47,812
it's okay and he'd wait.

33
00:02:49,972 --> 00:02:51,212
Don't joke with me.

34
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:52,652
Not sure if it's a joke.

35
00:02:53,052 --> 00:02:54,611
He prepaid for three pieces outright.

36
00:02:54,972 --> 00:02:55,772
He only wants

37
00:02:55,932 --> 00:02:56,972
to meet you

38
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:58,372
and discuss art in person.

39
00:02:59,052 --> 00:02:59,972
Who is he?

40
00:03:00,332 --> 00:03:03,212
We can't pry about his background.

41
00:03:03,571 --> 00:03:05,212
Anyway, he's declared

42
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,291
he'll buy whatever you produce.

43
00:03:07,972 --> 00:03:09,731
See? The world has changed.

44
00:03:35,652 --> 00:03:37,252
Are you sure nothing is wrong with him?

45
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:38,851
A decent business owner.

46
00:03:39,372 --> 00:03:41,611
He started from scratch
through honest work.

47
00:03:41,812 --> 00:03:43,731
Since when do decent people
meet in cemeteries?

48
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,492
It's why he's remarkable.

49
00:03:45,772 --> 00:03:46,451
Think about it.

50
00:03:46,652 --> 00:03:48,731
No invite to dinner
avoids dietary preferences.

51
00:03:48,932 --> 00:03:50,812
No invite to drinks
prevent seeming frivolous.

52
00:03:51,332 --> 00:03:53,972
No office meet avoids formal stiffness.

53
00:03:53,972 --> 00:03:54,812
No gallery meeting

54
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:57,372
presumes you've outgrown such spaces.

55
00:03:57,492 --> 00:04:00,411
Which place has serene
yet meaningful setting

56
00:04:00,411 --> 00:04:01,812
suitable for discussing art freely

57
00:04:01,812 --> 00:04:03,372
and contemplating life deeply?

58
00:04:03,372 --> 00:04:04,851
Hotel executive lounge?

59
00:04:04,851 --> 00:04:05,731
Too pedestrian.

60
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:07,372
Can a lounge allow you

61
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,492
to explore life's essence,

62
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:10,532
human destiny,

63
00:04:10,691 --> 00:04:12,812
or the end of life?

64
00:04:13,891 --> 00:04:14,812
I need to go.

65
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:16,012
I see him.

66
00:04:22,772 --> 00:04:24,132
Is this how you treat clients?

67
00:04:25,572 --> 00:04:26,652
I'll require a refund.

68
00:04:26,931 --> 00:04:28,731
No need. I won't sell it to you.

69
00:04:28,931 --> 00:04:30,811
Your work is about rebirth, right?

70
00:04:33,572 --> 00:04:34,371
Madman.

71
00:04:39,692 --> 00:04:40,931
Though newly created

72
00:04:41,212 --> 00:04:42,291
with limited impact,

73
00:04:43,012 --> 00:04:44,251
I've read critiques

74
00:04:44,972 --> 00:04:46,291
that mostly interpret your work

75
00:04:46,611 --> 00:04:50,212
as depicting suffocation and confinement

76
00:04:51,051 --> 00:04:52,652
and conveying dark emotions.

77
00:04:54,692 --> 00:04:55,652
If you continue,

78
00:04:55,652 --> 00:04:57,332
you'll expose your ignorance.

79
00:05:01,491 --> 00:05:02,452
Whenever I come here,

80
00:05:03,132 --> 00:05:05,212
I don't feel death or fear.

81
00:05:06,491 --> 00:05:07,572
Your sculptures

82
00:05:07,652 --> 00:05:08,411
inexplicably

83
00:05:08,411 --> 00:05:09,611
don't oppress me.

84
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:11,892
They evoke childbirth's struggle.

85
00:05:12,332 --> 00:05:14,692
Of course, it's agonizing

86
00:05:15,092 --> 00:05:16,371
for the mother and child,

87
00:05:17,171 --> 00:05:18,012
yet the miracle

88
00:05:18,012 --> 00:05:19,731
of new life emerging

89
00:05:20,132 --> 00:05:21,332
is the ultimate hope.

90
00:05:21,972 --> 00:05:22,491
So I believe

91
00:05:22,491 --> 00:05:23,772
you're fundamentally optimistic.

92
00:05:24,611 --> 00:05:26,452
True, I'm no art expert,

93
00:05:26,731 --> 00:05:27,772
but I'm not pretending.

94
00:05:27,892 --> 00:05:29,411
I genuinely admire your work.

95
00:05:33,772 --> 00:05:35,332
Let me share my interpretation.

96
00:05:35,332 --> 00:05:36,332
I'm all ears.

97
00:05:38,132 --> 00:05:39,332
Outsiders see

98
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:40,811
a pampered heir

99
00:05:40,972 --> 00:05:42,371
living carefree.

100
00:05:42,772 --> 00:05:44,931
Even you've bought into this facade,

101
00:05:45,092 --> 00:05:45,731
trapped in

102
00:05:45,731 --> 00:05:47,892
an identity and fate you despise.

103
00:05:48,652 --> 00:05:50,452
If you truly appreciated my art,

104
00:05:51,092 --> 00:05:52,452
you'd recognize

105
00:05:52,491 --> 00:05:54,332
the dark emotions, such as suffocation

106
00:05:54,332 --> 00:05:55,452
and confinement

107
00:05:56,411 --> 00:05:57,851
that mirror your reality,

108
00:05:58,811 --> 00:05:59,972
instead of standing

109
00:06:00,132 --> 00:06:01,051
in front of me,

110
00:06:01,171 --> 00:06:02,772
spouting empty praise.

111
00:06:07,572 --> 00:06:09,051
Surprising depth of understanding

112
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,851
for new acquaintances like us.

113
00:06:11,892 --> 00:06:14,452
I have no interest in understanding
a reckless madman

114
00:06:14,452 --> 00:06:15,931
who'd drown others with him in a car.

115
00:06:16,892 --> 00:06:18,452
My apologies. I acted rashly.

116
00:06:18,972 --> 00:06:20,772
I just wanted calm dialogue

117
00:06:20,772 --> 00:06:22,012
and honest communication.

118
00:06:22,411 --> 00:06:23,171
If you still think

119
00:06:23,171 --> 00:06:24,532
I'm mad after hearing me out,

120
00:06:25,491 --> 00:06:26,532
I'll put a stop to it.

121
00:06:26,532 --> 00:06:27,532
No more bothering.

122
00:06:35,772 --> 00:06:36,611
I'm not sure

123
00:06:36,611 --> 00:06:37,892
what you gain from being here.

124
00:06:38,772 --> 00:06:40,212
But this place makes me uneasy.

125
00:06:40,411 --> 00:06:41,132
Get to the point.

126
00:06:43,411 --> 00:06:46,332
I invited you here
to show you a piece of work.

127
00:06:48,212 --> 00:06:48,731
Work?

128
00:06:49,371 --> 00:06:50,012
A tombstone.

129
00:06:59,532 --> 00:07:00,411
A woman

130
00:07:01,611 --> 00:07:02,931
ruined my family.

131
00:07:04,012 --> 00:07:05,572
(Lin Xirou)
She even stole my mother's name.

132
00:07:06,572 --> 00:07:07,332
Lin Xirou is now

133
00:07:08,772 --> 00:07:10,652
in charge of the entire Roadsound Group,

134
00:07:10,652 --> 00:07:11,731
living carefree.

135
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:16,012
This tombstone was erected for my mother

136
00:07:16,611 --> 00:07:17,972
and will also eventually be hers.

137
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,291
Are you saying your biological mother
was named Lin Xirou,

138
00:07:22,092 --> 00:07:25,371
and the current Lin Xirou
of Roadsound Group

139
00:07:26,092 --> 00:07:27,491
is the one who killed her?

140
00:07:44,692 --> 00:07:45,892
I got you.

141
00:07:46,692 --> 00:07:47,411
Wait a bit longer.

142
00:07:47,532 --> 00:07:48,572
Dad will be home soon.

143
00:07:50,212 --> 00:07:50,811
Tuo.

144
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:52,572
Dad.

145
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:54,132
Sorry for being late.

146
00:07:54,371 --> 00:07:55,171
Here.

147
00:07:55,332 --> 00:07:57,371
Happy birthday.

148
00:07:57,371 --> 00:07:59,012
Such a beautiful toy car.

149
00:07:59,012 --> 00:07:59,972
Do you like it?

150
00:07:59,972 --> 00:08:01,851
Yes, I love it.

151
00:08:01,851 --> 00:08:04,051
Who is she?

152
00:08:05,692 --> 00:08:06,371
Honey,

153
00:08:07,532 --> 00:08:08,972
this is Li Ergou's sister,

154
00:08:09,132 --> 00:08:10,772
Shuangxiu. Li Shuangxiu.

155
00:08:12,332 --> 00:08:14,012
Since the baby you're carrying develops,

156
00:08:14,051 --> 00:08:15,772
and there's so much housework,

157
00:08:15,892 --> 00:08:17,731
Shuangxiu will stay here from now on.

158
00:08:17,851 --> 00:08:19,212
Order her around for chores

159
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,892
like she's one of our family.

160
00:08:20,892 --> 00:08:22,532
Let me show you the place.

161
00:08:23,851 --> 00:08:26,171
You're about to give birth
and you're still doing chores.

162
00:08:26,171 --> 00:08:27,772
Dashan went to pick Tuo up from school.

163
00:08:27,931 --> 00:08:29,171
I'll go meet them halfway.

164
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:08,731
Tuo,

165
00:09:10,812 --> 00:09:12,972
I have something very important to do.

166
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,771
Be good and wait here, okay?

167
00:09:36,731 --> 00:09:40,131
Tuo, you may call me
Ms. Lin from now on.

168
00:09:40,812 --> 00:09:41,812
Ms. Lin.

169
00:09:47,491 --> 00:09:48,812
My full name is Lin Xirou.

170
00:10:03,851 --> 00:10:04,771
After that,

171
00:10:05,212 --> 00:10:06,251
she became

172
00:10:06,251 --> 00:10:07,692
the lady of our household.

173
00:10:10,812 --> 00:10:12,371
As a kid, I was clueless.

174
00:10:12,692 --> 00:10:13,771
For years,

175
00:10:13,771 --> 00:10:15,491
I had genuinely considered
her my family.

176
00:10:19,011 --> 00:10:20,371
After I eventually found

177
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:21,651
my mother's diary,

178
00:10:21,771 --> 00:10:22,611
I realized...

179
00:10:27,212 --> 00:10:28,412
Why are you telling me this?

180
00:10:30,052 --> 00:10:30,972
Gou Ya

181
00:10:31,572 --> 00:10:33,452
was sent to the welfare home
by Lin Xirou.

182
00:10:34,692 --> 00:10:36,092
If he's truly an Earth Fiend,

183
00:10:37,251 --> 00:10:38,972
then Lin Xirou must control the key

184
00:10:39,052 --> 00:10:40,891
to transforming Earth Fiends
into human form.

185
00:10:42,292 --> 00:10:43,452
What else do you know?

186
00:10:43,812 --> 00:10:46,172
I've looked for a long time.
But she's too cautious.

187
00:10:47,292 --> 00:10:48,491
She has guarded against me.

188
00:10:49,292 --> 00:10:50,172
I found nothing.

189
00:10:50,812 --> 00:10:52,412
But now that Gou Ya is in trouble

190
00:10:52,932 --> 00:10:53,851
and I've met you

191
00:10:54,011 --> 00:10:55,172
and your organization,

192
00:10:55,771 --> 00:10:56,851
it gives me hope.

193
00:10:57,851 --> 00:10:58,972
I just want to know

194
00:10:58,972 --> 00:11:00,092
what I should do

195
00:11:00,371 --> 00:11:02,092
(Lin Xirou)
to avenge my mother.

196
00:11:03,651 --> 00:11:05,011
First, you need to find out

197
00:11:05,212 --> 00:11:06,572
exactly what Lin Xirou is.

198
00:11:06,891 --> 00:11:08,131
I don't care what she is.

199
00:11:09,891 --> 00:11:11,292
But I'm certain

200
00:11:11,531 --> 00:11:13,292
her connection
to Earth Fiends is unusual.

201
00:11:14,651 --> 00:11:15,851
If you truly oppose

202
00:11:15,851 --> 00:11:16,731
the Earth Fiends,

203
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:17,771
working with me

204
00:11:18,371 --> 00:11:19,731
is a golden opportunity.

205
00:11:21,052 --> 00:11:23,731
You said it you considered
her your family.

206
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,052
And she raised you.

207
00:11:26,011 --> 00:11:27,611
Do you think I'll take such a risk

208
00:11:27,731 --> 00:11:28,692
by working with you?

209
00:11:29,172 --> 00:11:31,292
If a hunter teams up with a wolf cub,

210
00:11:31,332 --> 00:11:32,972
they could destroy the entire wolf den.

211
00:11:32,972 --> 00:11:34,131
Isn't that worth the gamble?

212
00:11:34,332 --> 00:11:35,771
Don't flatter yourself as a wolf.

213
00:11:36,212 --> 00:11:38,332
You could be the snake
in the farmer's story.

214
00:11:41,371 --> 00:11:41,851
Fine.

215
00:11:43,692 --> 00:11:46,131
I know you're not afraid
of snakes or wolves.

216
00:11:48,011 --> 00:11:49,572
But you're afraid of water.

217
00:11:51,092 --> 00:11:53,251
I also know your home address
and workplace.

218
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:54,932
Even your artistic philosophy.

219
00:11:55,692 --> 00:11:56,972
Driving a car into water

220
00:11:57,611 --> 00:11:58,572
was me going too far.

221
00:11:59,092 --> 00:12:00,412
But I can't promise

222
00:12:00,412 --> 00:12:01,812
I won't do it again.

223
00:12:08,212 --> 00:12:10,011
You're truly something.

224
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,651
How rare to hear you say something kind.

225
00:12:13,491 --> 00:12:14,412
What do you mean?

226
00:12:16,052 --> 00:12:17,891
After hearing your life story earlier,

227
00:12:18,212 --> 00:12:19,172
I genuinely felt

228
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:20,851
a slight sense of empathy.

229
00:12:21,251 --> 00:12:22,172
I even forgot about

230
00:12:22,172 --> 00:12:23,251
our past unpleasantness.

231
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:24,932
But just now

232
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:26,212
your words

233
00:12:26,491 --> 00:12:28,531
revived my disgust toward you.

234
00:12:29,251 --> 00:12:30,412
You have a way with people.

235
00:12:31,771 --> 00:12:32,891
If that's the case,

236
00:12:33,092 --> 00:12:34,651
your being immune to all persuasion

237
00:12:34,651 --> 00:12:35,812
and your sarcastic skills

238
00:12:35,812 --> 00:12:36,972
are thoroughly impressive.

239
00:12:37,812 --> 00:12:39,092
A truly dedicated

240
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,572
and virtuous artist.

241
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:45,572
Come with me.

242
00:12:46,172 --> 00:12:46,851
To where?

243
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,491
I'll show you a sculpture.

244
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:17,332
(Temple of the Righteous Lord)

245
00:13:17,332 --> 00:13:18,452
In ancient times,

246
00:13:19,052 --> 00:13:22,131
a meteor fell
into South Mountain's ancient woods.

247
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,371
The meteor melted into the earth,

248
00:13:24,611 --> 00:13:25,771
turning the soil turquoise.

249
00:13:26,692 --> 00:13:30,212
Plants and animals mutated,
and strange occurrences multiplied.

250
00:13:31,092 --> 00:13:34,611
Then a type of light-fearing,

251
00:13:35,572 --> 00:13:36,651
carnivorous savage beasts

252
00:13:36,651 --> 00:13:38,172
started roaming South Mountain.

253
00:13:39,371 --> 00:13:40,812
The locals

254
00:13:40,932 --> 00:13:42,812
named those beasts Earth Fiends.

255
00:13:43,371 --> 00:13:45,731
Earth Fiends were brutal killers.

256
00:13:45,812 --> 00:13:47,131
People suffered terribly.

257
00:13:48,332 --> 00:13:48,972
Later,

258
00:13:49,692 --> 00:13:51,172
the emperor sent troops

259
00:13:51,692 --> 00:13:53,491
to drive the Earth Fiends underground.

260
00:13:54,572 --> 00:13:56,172
The soldiers who stayed

261
00:13:56,812 --> 00:13:58,611
abandoned their identities

262
00:13:58,891 --> 00:14:00,692
and called themselves
South Mountain Hunters.

263
00:14:00,692 --> 00:14:02,292
and swore enmity with Earth Fiends.

264
00:14:02,452 --> 00:14:03,731
This legacy continues today.

265
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:08,011
Such detailed settings?

266
00:14:08,212 --> 00:14:09,572
Not writing a novel wastes them.

267
00:14:09,692 --> 00:14:10,851
I've said my piece.

268
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:12,731
Believe what you will.

269
00:14:14,611 --> 00:14:15,212
Go on.

270
00:14:16,251 --> 00:14:17,572
Those injured by Earth Fiends

271
00:14:17,932 --> 00:14:19,092
develop filmy tissue

272
00:14:19,371 --> 00:14:21,371
over wounds after some time,

273
00:14:21,812 --> 00:14:23,011
like rooting and sprouting.

274
00:14:23,771 --> 00:14:25,412
Though revealing this to an outsider

275
00:14:25,771 --> 00:14:26,651
breaks our rules,

276
00:14:27,172 --> 00:14:28,531
soon I'll also be an outsider.

277
00:14:28,531 --> 00:14:29,332
It doesn't matter.

278
00:14:30,572 --> 00:14:31,371
Besides,

279
00:14:32,131 --> 00:14:33,172
what I described earlier

280
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:34,611
were beast-like Earth Fiends.

281
00:14:35,491 --> 00:14:37,651
Humanoid ones might differ entirely.

282
00:14:38,172 --> 00:14:39,011
So

283
00:14:39,692 --> 00:14:41,651
you're also a South Mountain Hunter,

284
00:14:41,771 --> 00:14:42,771
like my kidnappers?

285
00:14:44,292 --> 00:14:45,332
I've already answered

286
00:14:45,812 --> 00:14:46,932
your question.

287
00:14:47,771 --> 00:14:49,851
Thank you for your honesty, Miss Nie.

288
00:14:52,172 --> 00:14:53,332
You remember the way back?

289
00:14:54,172 --> 00:14:54,891
Excuse me.

290
00:16:49,851 --> 00:16:50,731
Don't panic.

291
00:16:52,572 --> 00:16:54,251
You've contracted a contagious disease

292
00:16:57,292 --> 00:16:58,452
requiring quarantine.

293
00:16:59,412 --> 00:17:00,292
Who are you fooling?

294
00:17:00,731 --> 00:17:02,972
This place isn't medical-looking.

295
00:17:03,692 --> 00:17:05,852
It's hard to explain briefly.

296
00:17:06,212 --> 00:17:06,771
It's fine.

297
00:17:07,011 --> 00:17:08,051
Explain slowly.

298
00:17:08,051 --> 00:17:08,811
I'll listen.

299
00:17:10,731 --> 00:17:11,571
Your condition

300
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:15,372
requires sunlight

301
00:17:15,771 --> 00:17:16,612
for treatment.

302
00:17:16,612 --> 00:17:17,776
(Nanshan Rescue)

303
00:17:18,811 --> 00:17:20,172
Earth Fiends fear fire and light.

304
00:17:20,811 --> 00:17:21,972
Within three days of injury,

305
00:17:23,011 --> 00:17:25,132
cauterize the injured
with natural fire to heal them.

306
00:17:25,531 --> 00:17:29,531
If the timing is missed,
red threads pierce pupils,

307
00:17:29,811 --> 00:17:30,652
and fate is sealed.

308
00:17:30,652 --> 00:17:31,412
Ma Hanzi.

309
00:17:31,652 --> 00:17:33,612
He's way worse than me.

310
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,172
Who's really sick here?

311
00:17:35,372 --> 00:17:36,892
Even if I'm sick,

312
00:17:36,892 --> 00:17:38,091
I can go to the hospital.

313
00:17:38,172 --> 00:17:39,051
Let me out. Come on.

314
00:17:39,811 --> 00:17:40,531
Sorry,

315
00:17:41,372 --> 00:17:43,212
you need to stay here longer.

316
00:17:45,091 --> 00:17:45,612
Bro?

317
00:17:46,412 --> 00:17:47,051
Bro?

318
00:17:47,212 --> 00:17:48,132
Bro?

319
00:17:49,852 --> 00:17:50,652
Bro!

320
00:17:56,132 --> 00:17:57,491
Back off now. Did you hear me?

321
00:17:57,491 --> 00:17:59,011
I just want to check on her.

322
00:17:59,571 --> 00:18:01,251
Mr. Crip, if you're this impatient,

323
00:18:01,251 --> 00:18:02,731
how can we get work done?

324
00:18:03,091 --> 00:18:04,692
I don't need your guidance for my work.

325
00:18:06,172 --> 00:18:07,452
Our ice factory base

326
00:18:07,452 --> 00:18:10,291
has been exposed.
There are too many people here.

327
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:11,811
We're exposed, and they're in shadows.

328
00:18:11,892 --> 00:18:12,652
What should we do?

329
00:18:12,652 --> 00:18:13,051
Exactly.

330
00:18:13,172 --> 00:18:15,132
So we should leave Mrs. Hua alone
in the ward?

331
00:18:15,571 --> 00:18:16,212
Move aside.

332
00:18:16,372 --> 00:18:17,132
Wait.

333
00:18:25,892 --> 00:18:27,972
Mrs. Hua's condition is stable now.

334
00:18:28,172 --> 00:18:29,531
Nursing staff is attending to her.

335
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:33,132
Nothing will go wrong.

336
00:18:34,652 --> 00:18:35,491
Stop yelling.

337
00:18:35,612 --> 00:18:36,452
This is a hospital.

338
00:18:38,212 --> 00:18:39,932
Are you all Zhang Shanqiang's relatives?

339
00:18:40,212 --> 00:18:42,372
Visiting hours don't allow
this many people.

340
00:18:42,811 --> 00:18:44,892
Sorry, we're leaving right away.

341
00:18:46,531 --> 00:18:47,811
My leg is broken. I can't move.

342
00:19:09,491 --> 00:19:11,172
Tuo, I brought you some food.

343
00:19:11,372 --> 00:19:11,972
Here.

344
00:19:14,051 --> 00:19:16,051
You should head back first.

345
00:19:16,172 --> 00:19:18,251
I'll personally escort Lin Ling
back to you later.

346
00:19:18,251 --> 00:19:18,932
Rest assured.

347
00:19:25,571 --> 00:19:26,331
Take care.

348
00:19:30,852 --> 00:19:32,852
I've checked all the files you sent me.

349
00:19:33,491 --> 00:19:34,771
It's mostly as you suspected.

350
00:19:35,011 --> 00:19:36,612
Gou Yan's identity is fabricated.

351
00:19:41,852 --> 00:19:43,212
I'm not in the mood.

352
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:52,811
I...

353
00:19:56,051 --> 00:19:57,212
I know some things.

354
00:19:58,412 --> 00:19:59,372
You may not believe it.

355
00:20:00,011 --> 00:20:01,251
But I still need to tell you.

356
00:20:03,692 --> 00:20:05,412
Tuo, you're scaring me.

357
00:20:08,051 --> 00:20:09,091
Do you remember

358
00:20:09,972 --> 00:20:11,932
when Xiong Hei lost two fingers

359
00:20:12,571 --> 00:20:13,491
and was badly wounded?

360
00:20:13,652 --> 00:20:15,051
He said it was a motorcycle crash.

361
00:20:15,372 --> 00:20:16,692
He was fully recovered in days.

362
00:20:18,652 --> 00:20:19,892
Ms. Lin said

363
00:20:19,932 --> 00:20:21,731
he had his fingers reattached
at the hospital.

364
00:20:21,932 --> 00:20:22,731
Right.

365
00:20:23,372 --> 00:20:24,531
But think about it now.

366
00:20:24,972 --> 00:20:26,011
Does that seem possible?

367
00:20:27,972 --> 00:20:29,212
Gou Yan is the same.

368
00:20:29,531 --> 00:20:31,491
I watched him fall from the building,

369
00:20:31,571 --> 00:20:32,452
severely injured.

370
00:20:33,571 --> 00:20:34,692
But within half a day,

371
00:20:34,892 --> 00:20:36,251
his wounds began healing.

372
00:20:36,852 --> 00:20:37,531
Tuo,

373
00:20:38,452 --> 00:20:40,852
what are you implying?

374
00:20:47,172 --> 00:20:49,251
There are creatures
known as Earth Fiends

375
00:20:49,892 --> 00:20:51,291
existing for centuries.

376
00:20:51,972 --> 00:20:53,531
But at some point,

377
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:56,212
they gained the ability
to take human form.

378
00:20:56,852 --> 00:20:58,811
Their human appearance is mere mimicry.

379
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:00,132
Or a disguise.

380
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:02,331
Beneath the human skin,

381
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:05,011
they remain beasts.

382
00:21:11,051 --> 00:21:11,692
What's wrong?

383
00:21:13,852 --> 00:21:15,452
When you had the accident,

384
00:21:17,011 --> 00:21:18,251
I secretly recorded this.

385
00:21:18,251 --> 00:21:20,251
(Recording)

386
00:21:22,172 --> 00:21:24,011
(We barely put his blood bag descendant)

387
00:21:24,011 --> 00:21:25,811
(in the welfare home.)

388
00:21:26,531 --> 00:21:27,811
Blood bag put in...

389
00:21:28,612 --> 00:21:29,251
Listen.

390
00:21:30,452 --> 00:21:31,692
(Bring him back first.)

391
00:21:34,692 --> 00:21:35,571
(Tuo?)

392
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:48,771
What's that sound?

393
00:21:49,972 --> 00:21:52,452
I was right outside that day.
I heard nothing.

394
00:21:53,212 --> 00:21:54,972
Only Ms. Lin was inside.

395
00:21:55,692 --> 00:21:56,491
But that night,

396
00:21:56,491 --> 00:21:58,612
when I reviewed the recording,

397
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:00,251
I heard it.

398
00:22:03,811 --> 00:22:06,571
It's like a peculiar frequency.

399
00:22:09,372 --> 00:22:13,692
If Xiong Hei and Gou Yan aren't human,

400
00:22:15,771 --> 00:22:18,132
could Ms. Lin also be what you said...

401
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:20,612
An Earth Fiend.

402
00:22:42,172 --> 00:22:43,291
I'm sorry, Ms. Lin.

403
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:44,251
I'm so sorry.

404
00:22:44,251 --> 00:22:45,172
(Deregistered)
I'm sorry, Ms. Lin.

405
00:22:53,011 --> 00:22:54,091
Let her clean it.

406
00:22:54,571 --> 00:22:55,132
Okay.

407
00:24:56,011 --> 00:24:56,652
Qiang! Qiang!

408
00:24:56,652 --> 00:24:57,412
Emergency!

409
00:25:48,731 --> 00:25:49,132
Qiang!

410
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:49,892
What are you doing?

411
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:50,892
What are you doing?

412
00:25:50,892 --> 00:25:52,452
Stop! What are you doing?

413
00:25:53,571 --> 00:25:54,811
Stop! I'm talking to you!

414
00:25:54,811 --> 00:25:55,412
Qiang?

415
00:25:57,731 --> 00:25:58,852
You! Stay where you are!

416
00:25:59,372 --> 00:26:00,412

418
00:26:02,731 --> 00:26:03,291
Stop the car!

419
00:26:03,692 --> 00:26:04,251
Stop the car!

420
00:26:05,212 --> 00:26:07,731
Medical, Lower Level 1. To the exit!

421
00:26:07,811 --> 00:26:08,652
Stop him!

422
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:20,912
(Breeding Report, Gou Yan)

423
00:27:43,571 --> 00:27:46,372
So this is the new skin?

424
00:27:47,331 --> 00:27:47,892
Right.

425
00:27:50,652 --> 00:27:51,771
Let me ask you something.

426
00:27:51,892 --> 00:27:55,251
About this bright green hat,

427
00:27:55,251 --> 00:27:56,331
what's its symbolism?

428
00:27:57,692 --> 00:27:59,132
The theme is forgiveness.

429
00:27:59,491 --> 00:28:00,452
It's Forgiveness Duck.

430
00:28:02,771 --> 00:28:03,452
Forgiveness?

431
00:28:05,652 --> 00:28:07,051
Then why not just make

432
00:28:07,172 --> 00:28:08,491
a duck in mourning attire?

433
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:09,612
That'd be so festive.

434
00:28:13,172 --> 00:28:13,852
Great idea.

435
00:28:18,251 --> 00:28:19,091
Nie Jiuluo.

436
00:28:20,852 --> 00:28:21,852
Just think about it.

437
00:28:23,291 --> 00:28:27,011
A duck wearing a green hat.

438
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:29,091
Who would buy this?

439
00:28:29,692 --> 00:28:31,491
I handle art, and you handle business.

440
00:28:31,491 --> 00:28:32,452
Wasn't this our

441
00:28:32,452 --> 00:28:33,452
agreed division of labor?

442
00:28:33,892 --> 00:28:35,731
You wanted new skins? I delivered.

443
00:28:35,731 --> 00:28:36,612
As for selling them,

444
00:28:36,692 --> 00:28:37,571
that's your job.

445
00:28:39,372 --> 00:28:40,452
If you put it that way,

446
00:28:41,051 --> 00:28:42,372
it's growing on me now.

447
00:28:44,251 --> 00:28:45,172
This is basically me.

448
00:28:45,731 --> 00:28:47,011
Fooled by you repeatedly,

449
00:28:47,172 --> 00:28:48,531
yet I keep forgiving you.

450
00:28:49,132 --> 00:28:50,051
Well done, Nie Jiuluo.

451
00:28:50,652 --> 00:28:51,291
Keep it up.

452
00:28:51,291 --> 00:28:52,251
I'll consider it a yes.

453
00:28:52,412 --> 00:28:53,972
Excellent. Keep it up.

454
00:28:56,372 --> 00:28:57,531
Ms. Lu, any leftovers?

455
00:29:02,892 --> 00:29:03,612
Jiang.

456
00:29:08,051 --> 00:29:09,011
When did it happen?

457
00:29:11,811 --> 00:29:12,612
Lu,

458
00:29:15,011 --> 00:29:15,892
contact that rich kid

459
00:29:15,892 --> 00:29:16,811
again for me.

460
00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:18,771
Who?

461
00:29:19,692 --> 00:29:21,132
The art-talking guy in the cemetery.

462
00:29:21,132 --> 00:29:22,291
I want to meet him again.

463
00:29:24,091 --> 00:29:25,571
Always acting on whims.

464
00:29:25,892 --> 00:29:26,771
Hurry up.

465
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,280

(Breeding Report, Gou Yan)

469
00:29:44,452 --> 00:29:45,811
If we're right,

470
00:29:46,731 --> 00:29:48,491
they're all Earth Fiends
disguised as humans.

471
00:29:49,372 --> 00:29:51,852
Besides Gou Ya and Xiong Hei,

472
00:29:52,172 --> 00:29:53,168
do you know anyone else?

473
00:30:02,051 --> 00:30:02,652
Tuo.

474
00:30:04,372 --> 00:30:06,011
Do you remember

475
00:30:06,932 --> 00:30:08,972
that place we went to when we were kids?

476
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:13,771
The farm?

477
00:30:13,892 --> 00:30:16,212
Lin Ling? Lin Ling?

478
00:30:17,452 --> 00:30:18,412
Where are you?

479
00:30:18,412 --> 00:30:20,291
Come out. This is not fun.

480
00:30:20,452 --> 00:30:22,051
Ms. Lin will scold us if she finds out.

481
00:30:26,652 --> 00:30:27,412
Lin Ling?

482
00:30:29,612 --> 00:30:30,291
Lin Ling?

483
00:30:33,011 --> 00:30:34,972
Lin Ling? Lin Ling?

484
00:30:57,051 --> 00:30:57,811
Lin Ling?

485
00:30:59,892 --> 00:31:00,731
Lin Ling?

486
00:31:04,011 --> 00:31:06,372
Tuo, it hurts.

487
00:31:07,212 --> 00:31:09,051
Hang in there. I'll get you out.

488
00:31:10,372 --> 00:31:11,172
Come on.

489
00:31:33,571 --> 00:31:34,652
How's the preparation?

490
00:31:35,051 --> 00:31:37,531
After pre-treatment,
we can remove the roots.

491
00:31:38,452 --> 00:31:39,372
And Xu Anni?

492
00:31:39,932 --> 00:31:41,011
Someone has taken over.

493
00:32:21,811 --> 00:32:24,972
You think that farm

494
00:32:25,731 --> 00:32:27,372
is the secret base where Ms. Lin

495
00:32:27,372 --> 00:32:29,291
transforms Earth Fiends into humans??

496
00:32:30,412 --> 00:32:31,212
Very likely.

497
00:32:32,771 --> 00:32:35,452
Tuo, maybe

498
00:32:36,692 --> 00:32:37,571
you should stop.

499
00:32:38,571 --> 00:32:40,612
If kindness retreats out of fear,

500
00:32:40,652 --> 00:32:42,251
it only lets malice grow stronger.

501
00:32:42,932 --> 00:32:44,011
Only by finding the truth

502
00:32:44,091 --> 00:32:45,452
can you be truly safe.

503
00:32:47,491 --> 00:32:48,212
Don't worry.

504
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:50,412
I've met someone recently

505
00:32:51,372 --> 00:32:52,932
who could be a huge help.

506
00:32:58,771 --> 00:32:59,811
Pardon me, Mr. Yan.

507
00:32:59,892 --> 00:33:02,132
Miss Nie wants me to ask you

508
00:33:02,452 --> 00:33:03,612
(Mr. Lu, Nie's agent)
if she can meet you

509
00:33:03,612 --> 00:33:06,972
at Baogeland Hotel for a talk

510
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,011
at 8 PM tomorrow.

511
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:11,452
Speak of the devil.

512
00:33:42,863 --> 00:33:48,374
(Braised meat)

513
00:33:49,372 --> 00:33:49,932
I...

514
00:34:02,911 --> 00:34:04,412
(Braised meat)

515
00:34:04,412 --> 00:34:05,011
You're here.

516
00:34:05,172 --> 00:34:06,291
Come in and have a seat.

517
00:34:21,812 --> 00:34:22,972
Haven't we settled up?

518
00:34:23,531 --> 00:34:24,732
What's this honor

519
00:34:25,252 --> 00:34:26,892
of dining with you, Miss Nie?

520
00:34:28,051 --> 00:34:29,011
I have a companion

521
00:34:29,372 --> 00:34:30,812
probably in your people's custody.

522
00:34:31,292 --> 00:34:32,691
I want to know his whereabouts.

523
00:34:32,932 --> 00:34:34,571
And before we rescue him,

524
00:34:34,691 --> 00:34:35,812
you need to keep him safe.

525
00:34:37,252 --> 00:34:38,372
What would you like to eat?

526
00:34:39,131 --> 00:34:39,812
Let me see.

527
00:34:41,332 --> 00:34:42,491
A triple-braised platter.

528
00:34:42,932 --> 00:34:43,651
Okay.

529
00:34:43,732 --> 00:34:46,491
Tripe, chicken feet, and...

530
00:34:47,332 --> 00:34:48,171
Any recommendations?

531
00:34:50,732 --> 00:34:51,852
The beef intestines.

532
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:52,651
Okay.

533
00:34:52,651 --> 00:34:53,611
That's all for now.

534
00:34:53,611 --> 00:34:54,292
Coming right up.

535
00:34:54,332 --> 00:34:54,972
Thanks.

536
00:34:58,332 --> 00:35:00,852
The braised dish seems ready-made.

537
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:03,252
Just scoop, slice, and serve.

538
00:35:03,611 --> 00:35:04,812
But to prepare it,

539
00:35:04,972 --> 00:35:06,292
how many spices are used,

540
00:35:06,292 --> 00:35:07,491
how much time is spent,

541
00:35:07,651 --> 00:35:09,091
and how many steps are involved

542
00:35:09,252 --> 00:35:11,051
to transform rankness into delicacy?

543
00:35:12,292 --> 00:35:15,051
Yet its good taste
only lingers for a few seconds.

544
00:35:16,051 --> 00:35:17,091
Once swallowed,

545
00:35:17,571 --> 00:35:18,852
it's flushed away the next day.

546
00:35:21,292 --> 00:35:22,892
Say what you want directly.

547
00:35:23,292 --> 00:35:24,412
If you help me this time,

548
00:35:24,452 --> 00:35:25,772
I won't let you work for nothing.

549
00:35:27,372 --> 00:35:28,051
Here you are.

550
00:35:28,972 --> 00:35:29,812
Enjoy your meal.

551
00:35:29,892 --> 00:35:30,651
Thanks.

552
00:35:32,571 --> 00:35:34,372
Then I need to think carefully.

553
00:35:35,332 --> 00:35:36,332
For how long?

554
00:35:37,292 --> 00:35:38,292
Hard to say.

555
00:35:39,452 --> 00:35:41,292
Maybe as long
as this braised dish lasts,

556
00:35:41,852 --> 00:35:43,292
depending on if it suits my taste.

557
00:35:44,292 --> 00:35:45,372
Or maybe overnight,

558
00:35:46,292 --> 00:35:47,972
depending on how well I sleep.

559
00:35:48,651 --> 00:35:49,852
It also could take a month,

560
00:35:50,211 --> 00:35:50,932
depending on

561
00:35:50,932 --> 00:35:52,812
whether this month's
financial report is good.

562
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:57,171
Well then, Mr. Yan,

563
00:35:57,812 --> 00:35:59,372
keep considering while enjoying

564
00:35:59,372 --> 00:36:00,292
the beef intestines.

565
00:36:02,491 --> 00:36:04,292
Or it might be decided in an instant

566
00:36:05,932 --> 00:36:07,812
depending on your sincerity.

567
00:36:16,171 --> 00:36:18,491
From now on, we'll settle accounts
after each meeting.

568
00:36:19,171 --> 00:36:20,452
You grant me a request,

569
00:36:20,732 --> 00:36:22,252
and I'll grant you one in return.

570
00:36:22,732 --> 00:36:23,651
I pay each time.

571
00:36:23,972 --> 00:36:24,972
Why so calculative?

572
00:36:25,091 --> 00:36:26,011
Because I don't want

573
00:36:26,011 --> 00:36:27,211
to get entangled with you.

574
00:36:27,691 --> 00:36:29,131
Fine, as you say.

575
00:36:29,372 --> 00:36:30,332
Have you decided?

576
00:36:31,571 --> 00:36:32,932
What's your request this time?

577
00:36:35,611 --> 00:36:36,372
I've decided.

578
00:36:36,772 --> 00:36:38,571
Add me on WeChat. Scan my code.

579
00:36:44,571 --> 00:36:46,051
What brings you here today?

580
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:49,772
I tried a braised dish spot
last night and found it good.

581
00:36:50,091 --> 00:36:51,452
The owner said they do breakfast,

582
00:36:51,452 --> 00:36:53,651
so I woke early to get you some.

583
00:36:54,252 --> 00:36:54,972
Try it first.

584
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,091
I haven't tried it.

585
00:36:56,372 --> 00:36:58,091
Don't expect too much.
It might disappoint.

586
00:37:01,292 --> 00:37:02,131
Not bad.

587
00:37:02,372 --> 00:37:03,131
It's good?

588
00:37:03,491 --> 00:37:04,452
I'll buy more next time.

589
00:37:09,531 --> 00:37:12,051
I saw the report.
Our business are thriving.

590
00:37:12,611 --> 00:37:13,892
Don't just see the surface.

591
00:37:14,051 --> 00:37:15,252
Such a large group

592
00:37:15,412 --> 00:37:18,292
has countless trivial matters
beneath your notice.

593
00:37:18,732 --> 00:37:20,011
Don't focus only on now either.

594
00:37:20,292 --> 00:37:22,211
The future remains uncertain.

595
00:37:23,051 --> 00:37:24,491
If Roadsound's competitors

596
00:37:24,611 --> 00:37:26,651
had half your crisis awareness,

597
00:37:26,772 --> 00:37:28,611
they wouldn't have stayed
underfoot forever.

598
00:37:30,091 --> 00:37:32,651
You think these internal
and external troubles are imaginary?

599
00:37:34,892 --> 00:37:36,091
That's why I brought breakfast

600
00:37:36,292 --> 00:37:37,332
to ease your mind.

601
00:37:40,412 --> 00:37:41,491
I heard the other day

602
00:37:42,171 --> 00:37:43,252
Xiong caught someone.

603
00:37:43,252 --> 00:37:44,011
What happened?

604
00:37:50,531 --> 00:37:52,892
I know you want to help me,

605
00:37:53,211 --> 00:37:54,892
but some grassroots matters

606
00:37:55,171 --> 00:37:56,772
are better left untouched.

607
00:37:56,852 --> 00:37:57,611
Understood.

608
00:38:01,491 --> 00:38:02,812
The schedule is tight today.

609
00:38:03,211 --> 00:38:05,452
I need to visit the farm
before heading to the office.

610
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:08,332
You even personally
oversee the planting?

611
00:38:08,611 --> 00:38:10,452
I need to check. I can't rest easy.

612
00:38:39,091 --> 00:38:40,732
Anyone here?

613
00:39:01,611 --> 00:39:04,972
Speak up now if you want less suffering.

614
00:39:08,531 --> 00:39:09,812
I'm old.

615
00:39:10,412 --> 00:39:11,452
I can't handle turmoil.

616
00:39:11,772 --> 00:39:12,772
Let's talk civilly.

617
00:39:16,051 --> 00:39:17,852
Where's the base
of South Mountain Hunters?

618
00:39:18,131 --> 00:39:19,171
How many members in total?

619
00:39:19,892 --> 00:39:21,972
What's your next action plan?

620
00:39:23,292 --> 00:39:24,011
The base...

621
00:39:25,292 --> 00:39:27,292
The base is at the South Heavenly Gate.

622
00:39:28,211 --> 00:39:31,691
Their numbers are hundreds of thousands,
and they are from a celestial army.

623
00:39:32,372 --> 00:39:36,292
And they plan to descend
to eradicate demons and monsters.

624
00:39:41,211 --> 00:39:42,372
Bad with essay questions?

625
00:39:42,852 --> 00:39:44,332
Then we'll make it multiple choice.

626
00:39:45,651 --> 00:39:46,732
How do you want to die?

627
00:39:47,412 --> 00:39:49,332
Bleed out? Heart extraction?

628
00:39:49,651 --> 00:39:51,011
Or live burial?

629
00:39:51,372 --> 00:39:53,812
If you'd brought Mrs. Hua with you,

630
00:39:54,412 --> 00:39:56,051
I'd choose live burial.

631
00:39:57,211 --> 00:39:59,131
We couldn't be together in life.

632
00:39:59,531 --> 00:40:00,932
Sharing a grave in death

633
00:40:01,051 --> 00:40:03,091
would fulfill my wish.

634
00:40:03,332 --> 00:40:04,972
That woman in the hospital

635
00:40:05,651 --> 00:40:06,611
is in such bad shape.

636
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:09,892
She'll never speak again.

637
00:40:23,211 --> 00:40:24,531
He's quite spirited.

638
00:40:26,171 --> 00:40:27,252
Calm him down.

639
00:40:38,852 --> 00:40:39,812
Long time no see.

640
00:40:39,892 --> 00:40:41,211
Who are you?

641
00:40:42,372 --> 00:40:43,491
Twenty years ago,

642
00:40:43,932 --> 00:40:44,772
I offended you.

643
00:40:45,932 --> 00:40:46,732
Who?

644
00:40:49,611 --> 00:40:51,372
Don't tell me you're holding a grudge,

645
00:40:52,732 --> 00:40:54,732
wanting me to repay you with a leg?

646
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:14,343
(Greenhouse)

647
00:41:25,372 --> 00:41:27,292
Don't be fooled
by his usual carefree demeanor.

648
00:41:27,812 --> 00:41:29,772
He definitely has his own thoughts.

649
00:41:30,171 --> 00:41:31,491
He just buries them well.

650
00:41:32,491 --> 00:41:34,051
It's fine if it's not a deal-breaker.

651
00:41:34,651 --> 00:41:36,011
It's been many years.

652
00:41:36,772 --> 00:41:38,531
This whole mother-and-son-bond act

653
00:41:39,011 --> 00:41:41,091
has to continue, doesn't it?

654
00:41:41,412 --> 00:41:42,531
No matter what,

655
00:41:42,972 --> 00:41:44,892
Yan Tuo is my own son.

656
00:41:46,412 --> 00:41:48,892
Wake the old man below
and resume interrogation.

657
00:41:49,452 --> 00:41:51,452
We must extract information
about the Mad Blade.

658
00:41:51,611 --> 00:41:52,772
Understood. We'll handle it.

659
00:42:13,812 --> 00:42:14,651
(Lin Ling?)

660
00:42:17,011 --> 00:42:17,732
(Lin Ling?)

661
00:42:19,732 --> 00:42:21,171
(Where are you? Come out.)

662
00:42:22,531 --> 00:42:23,332
(Lin Ling.)

663
00:42:25,091 --> 00:42:25,892
(Lin Ling?)

664
00:42:27,972 --> 00:42:29,171
(Come out now.)

665
00:42:29,892 --> 00:42:30,852
(This is not fun.)

666
00:42:30,932 --> 00:42:32,611
(Ms. Lin will scold us
if she finds out.)

667
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:36,011
(Lin Ling?)

668
00:42:36,691 --> 00:42:37,452
(Lin Ling?)

669
00:42:40,292 --> 00:42:40,972
(Lin Ling?)

670
00:43:08,976 --> 00:43:11,664
(Toxic and Hazardous)

671
00:43:39,312 --> 00:43:40,200
Lin Xirou.

672
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,880
This humanoid Earth Fiend
and the Roadsound Group

673
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,280
must be closely connected.

674
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,080
This intel is crucial.

675
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,600
We'll investigate immediately.

676
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:51,800
Thank you.

677
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:53,640
How's Sun Zhou?

678
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,880
Overcast skies may make us

679
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,720
miss the window.

680
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,120
Do what you can.

681
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,560
If even heaven won't save him,

682
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:03,880
we can't help with that.

683
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,200
Then

684
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,840
we'll have to banish him to Golden Gate

685
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,160
by Hunters' rules.

686
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,680
Those wounded by Earth Fiends before

687
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,800
and became infected
without timely fire purification

688
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,120
were all Hunters

689
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,040
who vowed to accept this fate.

690
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,240
They were all prepared.

691
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,080
But Sun Zhou is a civilian.

692
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,840
For him,

693
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:25,800
it's too cruel.

694
00:44:25,808 --> 00:44:26,465
Of course.

695
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,880
I'll explore alternatives.

701
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,840
about Lin Xirou and the Roadsound Group,

702
00:44:48,048 --> 00:44:49,090
who is he?

You think he's unreliable?

704

I'm worried for your safety.

705
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,120
How did you connect with him?

706
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,720
Maybe my unique constitution

707
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,000
attracts oddities.

708
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,520
We've got plenty of oddities here too.

709
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:07,320
They're all here at the hospital
keeping watch over Mrs. Hua.
