15
00:01:41,216 --> 00:01:44,000
(This story is a work of fiction)

16
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,960
=Episode 28=

17
00:02:35,985 --> 00:02:37,425
This is the Golden Gate.

18
00:02:50,448 --> 00:02:52,976
The same as what you saw
at the Temple of the Righteous Lord.

19
00:02:53,584 --> 00:02:55,225
This is the Blade Clan's emblem.

20
00:02:55,744 --> 00:02:56,825
That's the Whip Clan's.

21
00:03:01,304 --> 00:03:02,425
And that's Hound Clan's.

22
00:03:07,385 --> 00:03:08,505
Tighten this.

23
00:03:10,665 --> 00:03:12,425
Shen, the gear is all ready.

24
00:03:13,864 --> 00:03:14,545
Go ahead.

25
00:03:14,825 --> 00:03:15,385
Pretty much.

26
00:03:17,265 --> 00:03:18,304
You try it first.

27
00:03:19,464 --> 00:03:20,505
Tighten it.

28
00:03:23,105 --> 00:03:24,144
Too tight.

29
00:03:26,744 --> 00:03:27,705
Have a word in private.

30
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:41,489
We've never been to the Golden Gate.

31
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,210
No one knows what'll happen next.

32
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,730
It's normal that they feel excited,

33
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,929
anxious, or even scared.

34
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:52,290
But no matter what,

35
00:03:53,009 --> 00:03:54,650
we can't let them harbor doubts.

36
00:03:56,049 --> 00:03:57,449
Is this a reminder

37
00:03:58,449 --> 00:03:59,290
or a warning?

38
00:04:00,337 --> 00:04:01,577
Just a final confirmation.

39
00:04:02,897 --> 00:04:04,337
Confirm that we share the same goal

40
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:05,697
and work together.

41
00:04:06,738 --> 00:04:07,978
Don't you trust me?

42
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:09,250
If I don't trust you,

43
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,330
I wouldn't let you lead.

44
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,089
None of us knows what challenges

45
00:04:14,089 --> 00:04:15,089
lie ahead for us.

46
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,250
I just want to avoid any mishaps.

47
00:04:24,785 --> 00:04:26,426
Are we opening the Blade Clan's gate?

48
00:04:29,785 --> 00:04:30,465
Open it then.

49
00:04:35,785 --> 00:04:38,025
Assemble. Get ready to open the gate.

50
00:05:08,273 --> 00:05:09,552
Blade, Hound, and Whip Clans

51
00:05:10,072 --> 00:05:11,913
correspond to
the Golden Gate's three mouths.

52
00:05:12,592 --> 00:05:14,722
All three mechanisms
must be activated simultaneously.

53
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,480
Each time, a different
golden figure opens its mouth.

54
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:19,552
Only a few Hunters

55
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:21,593
know which one will open next.

56
00:05:22,793 --> 00:05:24,273
If the sequence is correct,

57
00:05:24,392 --> 00:05:26,153
it proves it's never been opened before.

58
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,376
It's open.

59
00:06:05,752 --> 00:06:06,713
The entrance's up there.

60
00:06:06,713 --> 00:06:07,673
Up there.

61
00:06:25,273 --> 00:06:26,713
Oh, my.

62
00:06:31,312 --> 00:06:32,192
Sit down.

63
00:06:40,713 --> 00:06:41,593
Prepare to set off.

64
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:42,288
Got it.

65
00:06:42,913 --> 00:06:43,432
- Go.
- Go.

66
00:06:45,473 --> 00:06:46,593
- Go.
- Go.

67
00:06:46,632 --> 00:06:47,432
Let's go.

68
00:06:48,473 --> 00:06:49,752
- Go.
- Let's go.

69
00:06:51,473 --> 00:06:53,432
My team, follow me.

70
00:06:55,872 --> 00:06:56,593
Yu Rong's team,

71
00:06:57,072 --> 00:06:58,153
depart in thirty minutes.

72
00:06:58,153 --> 00:06:58,833
No problem.

73
00:07:15,217 --> 00:07:16,017
Hurry.

74
00:07:20,938 --> 00:07:21,497
Go inside.

75
00:07:40,016 --> 00:07:42,480
(Roadsound Mining)

76
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,320
Aren't they going to Twilight Chasm?

77
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,376
Why are they coming here?

78
00:07:51,376 --> 00:07:52,889
Let's tell Xing Shen about it.

79
00:07:58,864 --> 00:07:59,753
Jiang.

80
00:08:01,233 --> 00:08:01,873
Move.

81
00:08:15,472 --> 00:08:16,993
No. The call can't get through.

82
00:08:17,272 --> 00:08:18,713
They might get into the Golden Gate.

83
00:08:18,896 --> 00:08:20,473
We can't wait here. Play it by ear.

84
00:08:20,496 --> 00:08:21,072
Okay.

85
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,593
Kid, what are you doing here?

86
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,480
What are you doing here, kid?

87
00:09:25,191 --> 00:09:25,951
Jiang.

88
00:09:33,111 --> 00:09:34,111
Why are you here?

89
00:09:34,929 --> 00:09:35,488
Run!

90
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:37,882
Run!

91
00:09:42,609 --> 00:09:44,930
Either release them all

92
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:46,890
and leave.

93
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:48,410
Or,

94
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:50,650
none of us leaves.

95
00:09:53,361 --> 00:09:55,680
Kid, are you trying to scare us?

96
00:09:57,489 --> 00:09:58,328
Want to try?

97
00:09:59,249 --> 00:10:00,649
We use this to blast mountains.

98
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:02,808
Mines are mountains too.

99
00:10:03,088 --> 00:10:04,009
And they're hollow.

100
00:10:05,088 --> 00:10:05,849
Explosion

101
00:10:06,288 --> 00:10:07,249
might be a good idea.

102
00:10:13,609 --> 00:10:14,408
Ms. Lin, go now.

103
00:11:07,921 --> 00:11:08,842
Run!

104
00:12:34,769 --> 00:12:35,608
Tighten this more.

105
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:36,448
Alright.

106
00:12:37,328 --> 00:12:38,192
The waterway's clear.

107
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:38,768
No problem.

108
00:12:38,768 --> 00:12:39,268
This.

109
00:12:39,268 --> 00:12:39,888
- Okay.
- Tighten it.

110
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:43,169
Almost.

111
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:45,688
You try it first.

112
00:12:50,609 --> 00:12:51,369
Are you okay?

113
00:12:51,489 --> 00:12:52,249
What happened?

114
00:12:52,249 --> 00:12:52,930
Are you ready?

115
00:12:53,249 --> 00:12:54,129
The gear and oxygen

116
00:12:54,369 --> 00:12:55,129
are ready.

117
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,690
The gate was open when we arrived.

118
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:58,489
The lock is broken.

119
00:12:58,729 --> 00:12:59,930
But the gear is untouched.

120
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:00,810
Did anyone go down?

121
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:01,609
We've checked. No.

122
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,009
Good then. Let's gear up and move out.

123
00:13:04,148 --> 00:13:04,688
Got it.

124
00:13:20,849 --> 00:13:21,729
Before,

125
00:13:22,849 --> 00:13:23,930
I was a bit worried

126
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:27,729
that with the passage of time,

127
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:31,570
the South Mountain Hunters
had lost cohesion

128
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:33,249
and with no successors.

129
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:37,769
But now seeing this kid

130
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:40,210
so capable and brave.

131
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:45,489
You wicked birds

132
00:13:45,729 --> 00:13:46,690
won't overturn anything.

133
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:54,729
Xiong Hei.

134
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:56,720
Xiong Hei.

135
00:13:59,889 --> 00:14:01,729
Young ones shoulder heavy duties.

136
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:04,129
Veterans face death unflinchingly.

137
00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:06,609
Since you Hunters

138
00:14:06,609 --> 00:14:08,889
have resolved to die,

139
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,969
once we reach Twilight Chasm,

140
00:14:13,129 --> 00:14:16,650
I'll send you all to death peacefully.

141
00:14:18,369 --> 00:14:19,489
Can't wait any longer.

142
00:14:20,785 --> 00:14:22,104
Everyone in diving suits?

143
00:14:22,464 --> 00:14:23,425
Check the tanks.

144
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:08,848
Let's go.

145
00:16:12,882 --> 00:16:13,840
Big Head, Shan Qiang.

146
00:16:14,882 --> 00:16:16,401
Help me get Jiang down.

147
00:16:17,241 --> 00:16:18,282
Everyone else, stay sharp!

148
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:37,362
Ambush!

149
00:16:37,961 --> 00:16:38,721
Ambush!

150
00:16:39,921 --> 00:16:40,441
Who's there?

151
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:11,522
Hound Clan, follow me.

152
00:17:11,882 --> 00:17:13,282
Third, guard the Earth Fiends.

153
00:17:13,401 --> 00:17:14,602
Shan Qiang, pin them down.

154
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:52,608
Hound Clan, report.

155
00:17:55,288 --> 00:17:56,368
Fiend stench is thickening.

156
00:18:35,857 --> 00:18:37,176
Dacheng!

157
00:18:42,216 --> 00:18:43,656
Xiaoyu!

158
00:18:47,089 --> 00:18:48,089
They're Xiong Hei's men.

159
00:18:48,289 --> 00:18:49,329
Treated by Lv Xian before.

160
00:18:59,984 --> 00:19:00,720
Where's Mao Liang?

161
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:02,089
Mao Liang!

162
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:03,849
- Mao Liang!
- Mao Liang!

163
00:19:05,928 --> 00:19:07,248
He was right behind me.

164
00:19:09,408 --> 00:19:09,968
Mao Liang.

165
00:19:12,529 --> 00:19:13,089
Mao Liang!

166
00:19:17,688 --> 00:19:18,488
What is that?

167
00:19:20,488 --> 00:19:21,289
Keep the formation!

168
00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:39,649
Over there.

169
00:19:44,728 --> 00:19:45,329
Scatter!

170
00:20:28,569 --> 00:20:30,889
This is the Whip Clan's move.

171
00:21:14,728 --> 00:21:15,289
Watch out!

172
00:21:23,008 --> 00:21:23,609
Grab this!

173
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:49,728
Luo!

174
00:21:55,049 --> 00:21:56,049
Hold tight!

175
00:21:57,488 --> 00:21:58,569
Hold tight!

176
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:01,529
Hold tight!

177
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,289
Take care.

178
00:22:05,129 --> 00:22:05,928
Sun Li!

179
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:16,289
Yan Tuo.

180
00:22:22,529 --> 00:22:23,448
Miss Nie.

181
00:22:25,129 --> 00:22:27,408
No, Mad Blade.

182
00:22:28,488 --> 00:22:29,569
I think between us,

183
00:22:29,728 --> 00:22:31,408
no need for formalities.

184
00:23:08,817 --> 00:23:10,657
I wish you were Mad Blade,

185
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:13,018
so you could give me a clean death.

186
00:23:24,337 --> 00:23:26,577
What are those white-haired creatures?

187
00:23:27,313 --> 00:23:28,273
We wounded

188
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:31,474
those South Mountain Hunters

189
00:23:31,714 --> 00:23:32,914
who opposed us.

190
00:23:34,154 --> 00:23:36,113
They had no time to kindle natural fire

191
00:23:37,154 --> 00:23:38,313
to heal their wounds,

192
00:23:39,194 --> 00:23:41,234
so they locked themselves in here

193
00:23:42,313 --> 00:23:43,914
turning into Earth Demons.

194
00:23:45,434 --> 00:23:47,073
Then continue fighting us.

195
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,154
They keep haunting us.

196
00:23:50,769 --> 00:23:51,688
Earth Demons?

197
00:23:52,369 --> 00:23:53,330
Normally,

198
00:23:54,209 --> 00:23:56,610
they don't pop up for no reason

199
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:57,889
to massacre.

200
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:00,570
It's you guys.

201
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:02,409
You guys did it.

202
00:24:42,513 --> 00:24:43,592
Someone has been here.

203
00:25:10,257 --> 00:25:10,898
Who's there?

204
00:25:17,969 --> 00:25:19,008
I saw you.

205
00:25:19,008 --> 00:25:19,689
Show yourself.

206
00:25:30,417 --> 00:25:31,256
Jiang.

207
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:32,538
Jiang.

208
00:25:32,785 --> 00:25:33,466
Stay back!

209
00:25:36,265 --> 00:25:36,946
Stay back.

210
00:25:38,345 --> 00:25:39,105
Jiang.

211
00:26:17,105 --> 00:26:18,384
You're a South Mountain Hunter?

212
00:26:20,184 --> 00:26:21,664
We're South Mountain Hunters as well.

213
00:26:23,944 --> 00:26:25,184
Don't waste your time.

214
00:26:25,585 --> 00:26:27,305
They've lost consciousness long ago.

215
00:26:28,424 --> 00:26:30,424
Even Earth Fiends can't handle it.

216
00:26:30,984 --> 00:26:32,944
Let alone a rookie like you.

217
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:38,865
When you were confined at home,

218
00:26:40,144 --> 00:26:41,585
I brought you a razor.

219
00:26:42,384 --> 00:26:43,785
When you were trapped in the mine,

220
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,464
I brought you tangerines.

221
00:26:45,984 --> 00:26:48,025
You owe me all these.

222
00:26:49,384 --> 00:26:50,825
I suggest you leave now

223
00:26:53,025 --> 00:26:55,305
before I kill you.

224
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:20,984
Stop chasing.

225
00:27:25,521 --> 00:27:26,601
Summon them out now.

226
00:27:33,001 --> 00:27:34,162
What is this?

227
00:27:37,402 --> 00:27:38,281
Don't you think?

228
00:27:39,056 --> 00:27:40,688
The deeper we go into
the Twilight Chasm,

229
00:27:41,442 --> 00:27:43,801
this place feels more like
a giant living creature.

230
00:27:47,801 --> 00:27:49,001
I feel this path

231
00:27:49,321 --> 00:27:50,642
pulsates occasionally.

232
00:27:52,801 --> 00:27:55,722
Great then.
Living creatures fear this the most.

233
00:28:03,521 --> 00:28:04,202
Jiang.

234
00:28:04,761 --> 00:28:06,642
Forget the red thread piercing pupils.

235
00:28:07,162 --> 00:28:08,162
Let's go back first.

236
00:28:08,162 --> 00:28:09,241
There must be a way.

237
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:12,321
Yu Rong, am I right?

238
00:28:12,977 --> 00:28:14,576
There must be a way, right?

239
00:28:15,537 --> 00:28:17,136
Ahead. There's an exit ahead.

240
00:28:18,457 --> 00:28:20,496
It's like a maze in here.

241
00:28:20,496 --> 00:28:21,176
Easy to get lost.

242
00:28:21,176 --> 00:28:21,648
Yu Rong.

243
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,120
Quecha.

244
00:28:36,945 --> 00:28:37,865
Jiang.

245
00:28:39,425 --> 00:28:40,264
Stay back.

246
00:28:52,017 --> 00:28:52,658
Jiang.

247
00:28:54,768 --> 00:28:55,280
Jiang...

248
00:29:11,618 --> 00:29:12,618
I presume

249
00:29:13,937 --> 00:29:15,138
you've all come here

250
00:29:15,697 --> 00:29:18,058
to rescue me and the four others.

251
00:29:19,017 --> 00:29:19,977
But now,

252
00:29:21,138 --> 00:29:22,537
they're probably gone.

253
00:29:23,777 --> 00:29:26,618
And my pupils are pierced
by the red thread, so I can't leave.

254
00:29:27,777 --> 00:29:28,537
Therefore,

255
00:29:29,217 --> 00:29:30,058
your mission

256
00:29:30,898 --> 00:29:32,338
has been completed.

257
00:29:35,497 --> 00:29:36,777
The white-haired ones

258
00:29:37,497 --> 00:29:38,697
must be former

259
00:29:39,818 --> 00:29:42,257
South Mountain Hunters
whose pupils pierced by red thread.

260
00:29:42,578 --> 00:29:44,898
They exiled themselves
in the Golden Gate.

261
00:29:46,578 --> 00:29:47,457
Never expected

262
00:29:49,017 --> 00:29:50,418
they'd become like that.

263
00:29:51,898 --> 00:29:55,497
Fate brings me here today.

264
00:29:56,658 --> 00:29:58,297
I upheld South Mountain's rules

265
00:29:59,178 --> 00:30:02,098
and joined my predecessors.

266
00:30:02,898 --> 00:30:06,377
Though I can't return with you,

267
00:30:07,658 --> 00:30:08,817
this still counts as

268
00:30:10,448 --> 00:30:12,144
returning to the South Mountain Hunters.

269
00:30:16,217 --> 00:30:17,658
What a fine end!

270
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:21,538
Besides,

271
00:30:24,538 --> 00:30:26,377
I can see you all here.

272
00:30:29,458 --> 00:30:30,417
I'm already content.

273
00:30:43,897 --> 00:30:44,618
Mad Dog,

274
00:30:49,978 --> 00:30:50,777
Ghost Whip,

275
00:30:58,257 --> 00:30:59,377
Mad Blade.

276
00:31:12,618 --> 00:31:13,777
Take a headcount

277
00:31:14,697 --> 00:31:16,417
and evacuate everyone.

278
00:31:18,297 --> 00:31:19,737
No negotiations this time.

279
00:31:21,817 --> 00:31:23,297
You must follow my orders.

280
00:32:34,217 --> 00:32:35,098
What's that sound?

281
00:32:37,817 --> 00:32:38,538
I smell fiends.

282
00:32:46,978 --> 00:32:47,697
Yan Tuo.

283
00:32:50,938 --> 00:32:51,538
Luo.

284
00:32:52,458 --> 00:32:53,098
Luo.

285
00:32:53,098 --> 00:32:54,938
Yan Tuo, are you okay?

286
00:32:54,938 --> 00:32:55,777
I'm fine.

287
00:33:36,658 --> 00:33:37,737
Push the statues over.

288
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:40,058
Hurry!

289
00:33:40,938 --> 00:33:41,488
Hurry!

290
00:34:25,777 --> 00:34:26,697
Faster!

291
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:28,058
More Earth Fiends are coming.

292
00:34:44,857 --> 00:34:46,658
Third, cut through the membrane.

293
00:34:46,658 --> 00:34:47,458
Got it!

294
00:35:51,138 --> 00:35:51,658
Luo.

295
00:35:58,817 --> 00:35:59,618
Guo!

296
00:36:01,337 --> 00:36:03,817
- Guo!
- Guo!

297
00:36:06,138 --> 00:36:06,777
