(In ancient times,)

17
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:27,439
(a meteor fell upon South Mountain.)

18
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:31,760
(Flames devoured forests,
and scorched earth bred anomalies,)

19
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,560
(forming Turquoise Land.)

20
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,840
(From this area emerged fiendish beasts)

00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:44,280
(that fed on human flesh
and terrorized people.)

22
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:47,599

00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,920
(Warriors marched to South Mountain
to exterminate them)

24
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:58,359
(and sealed the remaining fiends
beneath dark iron gates.)

25
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:01,560
(The guardians who remained)

26
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,439
(evolved into)

27
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:07,599
(a secret organization

(But while fangs are easily spotted,)

36
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,800
(human disguises hide sinister hearts.)

37
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,319
(Beneath the Turquoise Land,)

38
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,319
(Earth Fiends
may have infiltrated mankind,)

39
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,479
(lurking in wait,)

40
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:54,919

=Episode 1=

44
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,879
(As the saying goes,
it takes a range to make a mountain,)

45
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,680
(and it takes trees to make a forest.)

46
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,400
(This area was once called Nanba Weald,)

47
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:24,080
(a desolate place
that even birds and dogs avoided.)

48
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,240
(It's seen bandits and mountain fiends.)

49
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:28,439
You're such a renowned artist.

50
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,800
Why choose our backwater

51
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:32,000

52
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,159
By the way,

53
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,240
have you heard the child-eating
mountain fiend tales?

54
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:44,840
It's a long way ahead.
Let me tell you the full story.

55
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,000
Long ago,

56
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,120
there lived a deranged old woman
in Nanba Weald.

57
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,879
Childless her whole life,

58
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,159
yet she took in every orphan,

59
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,599
abandoned child,

60
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,560
or disabled infant

61
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,879
from nearby villages and towns

62
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:04,439
and raised them all alone
in the mountains.

63
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,840
A living saint, people said.

64
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,560
But here's the twist.

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,919
Guess what?

66
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:15,840
(Roadsound Welfare Home)

67
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:17,560

Mr. Gou Yan,

77
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,959
and invite him to say a few words.

78
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,399
- Great.
- Great.

79
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:38,759
- Great.
- Great.

81
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:55,680
Hello.

82
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:58,319
My name is Gou Yan.

83
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:04,680
Good.

84
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,519
Well said.

85
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,279
Concise and clear, right?

86
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,000
- Right.
- Right.

87
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:11,000
Kids,

88
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:12,399
from now on,

89
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,959
Mr. Gou Yan is family.

90
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:17,279
So you should support

91
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,319
and help each other,

92
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:19,040
right?

93
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,720
- Right.
- Right.

94
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,279
- Right.
- Right.

95
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:23,839
We've long heard

96
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,920
of Roadsound Group's
General Manager, Mr. Yan Tuo,

97
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:28,079
a promising young leader

98
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:28,959
of remarkable talent.

99
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,240
- You flatter me.
- We're finally meeting you in person.

100
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,240
Mr. Zheng, you're too kind.

101
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:35,720
My main purpose

102
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:36,959
is to introduce

103
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:38,759
Mr. Gou Yan to everyone

104
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,319
and to thank you

105
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,120
for giving our Roadsound Group

106
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,519
an opportunity to give back to society.

107
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,439
The one in green.

108
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,800
Your blood bag.

109
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:51,319
Keep close watch.

110
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,000
Mr. Yan, you're too kind.

111
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:58,000
Let me tell you straight up.

112
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,920
That old woman wasn't human at all.

113
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,959
She was a man-eating mountain fiend.

114
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:06,920
Hadn't the magistrate
whose daughter was missing

115
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,879
mobilized hunters
to search the mountains,

116
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:10,120
(Qiao Ya)
who knows...

117
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:14,920
Sorry.

118
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,720
This is my wife.

119
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,839
Mr. Yan, I know you're busy,

120
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,839
but today,

121
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,480
you must stay for dinner.

122
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,480
Mr. Zheng, thank you,

123
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,879
but we have other plans.

124
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:44,279
We shouldn't trouble you further.

125
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,680
Don't be so formal.

126
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,040
It's no trouble at all.

127
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:51,560
Just share a simple meal with the kids.

128
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,800
It's by your group's stan...

129
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,759
We have other matters to attend to.

130
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,639
I see.

131
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,560
Ms. Wang,

132
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:05,480
take Mr. Gou to acquaint him

133
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,759
with the facilities.

134
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,240
I'll escort the guests out.

135
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,160
Yes, Director.

136
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,480
It's okay, Tutu.

137
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,800
I will come find you later.

138
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:12,800
Go with Ms. Huang first.

139
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:13,759
Let's go.

140
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:15,759
Let's go.

141
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,800
Hello, Mr. Gou.

142
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,079
Ms. Wang,

143
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,839
be careful with your bandaged hand.

144
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:25,959
Just a minor cut.

145
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:26,879
It'll heal soon.

146
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:28,560
Alright then. After you, sir.

147
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,120
Mr. Zheng, you first.

148
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,800
After you.

149
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,439
Take a look.

150
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:33,920
Please.

151
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,160
We have an art studio,

152
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,360
a dance studio, and so on.

153
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:41,600
After you.

154
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:42,519
After you.

155
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,439
It was over.

156
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:50,959
A complete disaster.

157
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:52,639
Twenty strong hunters

158
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,839
were all bitten to death
by an old woman.

159
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,759
The magistrate was so terrified.

160
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:58,959
He stood frozen in the yard,

161
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,160
trembling like a leaf.

162
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,319
His head was spinning.

163
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,160
And he couldn't move an inch.

164
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:08,759
Finally,

165
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,879
he managed

166
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,879
to croak out a sound.

167
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:15,279
Then the old woman,

168
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,720
silent as death,

169
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:20,959
appeared right...

170
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,040
Darn it!

171
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:27,319
Rushing to your grave?

172
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:30,920
Nearly ran us into the ditch.

173
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,679
In this backwater place,

174
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,679
if anything happens,

175
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:35,879
there's no help for miles.

176
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:37,720
Oh my.

177
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,919
Miss Nie,

178
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,759
my apologies.

179
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,120
Where were we earlier?

180
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,879
Let's continue.

181
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,879
Mr. Sun,

182
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,480
please focus on the road.

183
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,879
Got it.

184
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,320
We're almost there.

185
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,840
Just past this bend.

186
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,720
Molten iron was poured

187
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:04,519
cauldron after cauldron

188
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:06,240
into these marshes.

189
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:08,679
Then one day,

190
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:10,799
torrential rains came,

191
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:12,440
making the area

192
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,480
steam for three days straight.

193
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,679
Ever since,

194
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:20,799
nothing grows for miles around.

195
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,399
Know what villagers call this area?

196
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,399
The Iron Coffin.

197
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:27,840
And where's this coffin?

198
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:30,600
Right behind this very mountain.

199
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:32,200
So

200
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,360
the old woman's tales

201
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:37,159
originated from here.

202
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:39,200
Villagers feared her

203
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:41,240
and worried she'd return to feast.

204
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,080
Guess what?

205
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,919
They pooled funds
to build a Temple of the Righteous Lord.

206
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,240
You know?

207
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,600
It's a Temple of Zhong Kui.

208
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,919
The temple enshrines
Lord Zhong Kui himself.

209
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,399
Mind the steps.

210
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,480
Zhong Kui catches ghosts, right?

211
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,399
With this lord

212
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,080
standing guard here,

213
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,519
no ghost,

214
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:04,960
fiend, or wraith

215
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,080
would dare come near.

216
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:09,279
But before building this temple,

217
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,440
something even stranger happened.

218
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,399
One day, the magistrate's mansion
caught fire...

219
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,480
What did you call this temple?

220
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,559
Temple of Lord Zhong Kui.

221
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,759
Does he have three heads and six arms?

222
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,559
Yes or no?

223
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,759
Aren't you the tour guide?

224
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,720
Well,

225
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:36,559
our Yanguan Province
has countless heritage-listed

226
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:37,679
grotto Buddha statues.

227
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:38,919
Four 5A-rated scenic spots

228
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:39,720
in Xicang alone.

229
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,080
Let me take you there.

230
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,320
It'll be worth your trip.

231
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,480
No need.

232
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,039
I came to see something unique.

233
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:49,440
Fair enough.

234
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:51,720
Artists always
take unconventional paths.

235
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:52,919
Such kinds of

236
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,039
folk religious carvings

237
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:58,000
don't follow standard conventions,

238
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,720
but they have their own charm.

239
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,799
Do you hate tourists like me

240
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,320
who ask about attractions

241
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,600
not in your scripted tour?

242
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,679
Nonsense.

243
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,440
It's a learning opportunity for me.

244
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:19,136
(Roadsound Welfare Home)

245
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:26,759
- Hurry.
- Come play.

246
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:27,960
Alright, kids,

247
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:30,159
let's wash up and eat. Come on.

248
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,399
- Okay.
- Okay.

249
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,480
Be careful.

250
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,080
Sculptor? Pfft.

251
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,279
I checked.

252
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:04,799
She sells toys.

253
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:07,000
And they're toy ducks.

254
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:09,720
No matter

255
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,440
how famous she is,
she shouldn't be so rude.

256
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:12,960
Look how she puts on airs,

257
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,720
acting like she carved

258
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:17,600
the Venus de Milo, David,

259
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,960
The Thinker,

260
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:20,759
or something.

261
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:21,759
So pretentious.

262
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,279
I told you not to take this job.

263
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,399
You wouldn't listen.

264
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:27,480
It's not that.

265
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:29,919
When the money's good,

266
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:31,759
cabbage becomes jade.

267
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:34,039
Who says no to that?

268
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:36,679
The big artist is paying well.

269
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,519
I need to save up
for the betrothal gifts.

270
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,360
Cut the act.

271
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:43,039
I think you're just

272
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,799
smitten with her pretty looks.

273
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,039
Don't be ridiculous.

274
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:48,879
You call her pretty?

275
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,440
She's nowhere near you. Right?

276
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,720
What's wrong?

277
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:58,080
I'll talk to you later.

278
00:12:59,039 --> 00:12:59,879
Gotta go.

279
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:00,720
Sales of the old models

280
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:03,200
have dropped 40% already.

281
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,200
By month's end,

282
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,679
Ninja Duck needs three new skins.

283
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,320
(Mr. Lu)
Though you created it,

284
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:11,519
it doesn't belong to you anymore.

285
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:14,440
It belongs to customers and fans.

286
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:16,679
Harry Potter isn't J.K. Rowling's.

287
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:18,679
Sun Wukong isn't Wu Cheng'en's.

288
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:21,879
And Ninja Duck isn't yours, Nie Jiuluo.

289
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:25,759
Hermit Duck.

290
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,159
What?

291
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:31,960
It's Hermit Duck, not Ninja Duck.

292
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,720
That's what customers call it.

293
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,639
Don't correct your gods' pronunciation.

294
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,480
I can't cater to these 'gods' anymore.

295
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:40,720
I need real artwork.

296
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,360
Proper sculptures.

297
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,600
Not mass-produced toys.

298
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,799
Luo.

299
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,320
Miss Jiuluo.

300
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:48,759
Master Nie.

301
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,720
Your current wealth,

302
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:52,080
resources, and followers

303
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,679
all come from those mass-produced toys.

304
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,600
You're financially set now.

305
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,120
And you want to pursue art?

306
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,159
Don't take this the wrong way.

307
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:01,840
You're burning the bridge you crossed.

308
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,080
Burning the bridge?

309
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:13,879
There's landscape, architecture,

310
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,960
expression, and rage.

311
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:18,360
Great material. Let me jot this down.

312
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,080
New skins. New skins. New skins.

313
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,080
I want new skins
by the end of this month.

314
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,440
Ninja Duck.

315
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:48,399
The sun's setting.

316
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,720
Everyone back to your rooms.

317
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,600
The sun's setting.

318
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:58,480
Everyone back to your rooms.

319
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:01,919
Sun.

320
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,440
Director, Tian has food poisoning.

321
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:05,759
Come take a look.

322
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:08,519
She started saying she hurts

323
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,240
and won't stop asking for Ms. Wang.

324
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,080
Where's Ms. Wang?

325
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:12,840
She's not back yet. Check on Tian first.

326
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,320
Okay.

327
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:13,919
Hurry up.

328
00:16:54,624 --> 00:16:56,026

329
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:02,528

Xiong.

344
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:28,720
It's done.

345
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:29,680
What?

346
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:31,920
Didn't you want to keep

347
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:33,559
(Diploma)
this outing with me from Ms. Lin?

348
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:36,559
I just deleted
the entrance surveillance footage.

349
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,039
Okay.

350
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,200
Thank you.

351
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,279
I'll treat you to dinner.

00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:43,880
I can't cover for you for long.

354
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,799
Didn't I tell you I'm meeting a client?

355
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:47,559
I'll buy you some late-night snacks.

356
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,079
Mr. Gou Ya.

358
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,000
What's wrong? Where are you?

359
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:31,920
Yan Tuo?

Xiong.

366
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:44,920
I don't need a refund

367
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,559
or compensation.

368
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,519
I just need a proper explanation.

369
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:50,160
How could your guide

370
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,079
abandon a client
in the middle of the tour?

371
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:53,799
And even now,

372
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:55,319
I still can't reach him.

373
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,519
Didn't you say
to send another car for me?

374
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,079
Where's the car now?

375
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,200
How long must I wait?

376
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:09,200
Hello?

00:24:41,312 --> 00:24:49,280
(Roadsound Welfare Home)

380
00:24:57,559 --> 00:24:58,480
Hello?

381
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,240
Xiong, what's this?

382
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,519
You're just injecting him?

383
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,519
Weren't you meeting a client?

384
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,839
I was supposed to,

385
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,519
but then I couldn't find my phone.

386
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,079
I searched the car.

387
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:15,480
I thought maybe I left it

388
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,880
in the welfare home restroom.

389
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,279
So I came back,

390
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:19,599
and there it was on the sink.

391
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,880
Since I was already here,

392
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:23,440
and Gou Yan is your relative

393
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,400
in this new place,

394
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,160
I went to his dorm to leave some money.

395
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:27,839
Then what?

396
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:30,920
As soon as I entered
the dorm, you called.

397
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:31,839
Then

398
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,240
he lunged at me covered in blood.

399
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,240
You know the rest.

400
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:52,960
Wait.

401
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:57,240
Are you sure
he didn't bite or scratch you?

402
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,359
Absolutely not.

403
00:27:58,359 --> 00:27:59,160
Didn't I tell you?

404
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,640
I checked my whole body.

405
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:03,279
You said

406
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,119
he lunged at you covered in blood?

407
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,039
Yeah.

408
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:09,119
He was covered in blood
when you saw him?

409
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:10,200
Right.

410
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,079
If you're not hurt,
where'd the blood come from?

411
00:28:51,232 --> 00:28:55,279
(Ms. Lin)

412
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,079
Xiong?

413
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,319
Don't come closer.

414
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,240
Wait there for me.

415
00:29:34,432 --> 00:29:39,296
(Room 302, Binhai Grand Hotel)

416
00:29:46,784 --> 00:29:49,152
(Lu)

417
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:52,799
(Miss Nie, look.)

418
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:55,319
(I learned how to braise beef shank
from online videos.)

419
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,839
(It looks decent.)

420
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,079
(Miss Nie, the osmanthus
in our yard has bloomed.)

421
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:07,759
(Miss Nie,)

422
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,079
(I've already
changed the bedsheets twice)

423
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,640
(and cleaned all the windows.)

424
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:13,480
(If you don't come back soon,)

425
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:15,960
(I'll have to dig up
all the courtyard tiles)

426
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,480
(and relay them from scratch.)

427
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,480
(Otherwise, I'll feel guilty)

428
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:21,599
(about getting paid to loaf around.)

429
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:04,960
Mr. Sun?

430
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,640
What's wrong?

431
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:18,440
I...

432
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,319
I've already quit.

433
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,759
You'll get a refund.

434
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,759
If you need compensation,

435
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:25,960
contact the agency.

436
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,599
How did you get hurt?

437
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:29,920
Let me check.

438
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:31,279
No need. I have to leave.

439
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,920
You should leave too.

440
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:41,359
What happened?

441
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:43,920
Mountain fiend.

442
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,200
It was a mountain fiend.

443
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,720
It's alright. Stay calm.

444
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:49,440
Tell me what happened.

445
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,119
I can help you.

446
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,200
Mountain fiend.

447
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,599
Mountain fiend.

448
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,440
Let me see your wound.

449
00:31:59,240 --> 00:31:59,960
Mountain fiend.

450
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:02,640
Mountain fiend.

451
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,000
Mountain fiend. Mountain fiend.

452
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:06,599
It's here.

453
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:07,559
Stay quiet.

454
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,559
The power's out.

455
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,240
What's going on?

456
00:32:58,519 --> 00:32:59,240
The power's out?

457
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:00,640
Exactly. Why the blackout?

458
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:19,759
Mountain fiend.

459
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,088
Mountain fiend.

460
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:22,160
Mountain fiend.

461
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:23,960
Mountain fiend!

462
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,400
- What's wrong?
- Why the blackout?

463
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,920
Why isn't the power back?

464
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,079
The alarm!

465
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:23,840
Where?

466
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:25,280
Is there a fire?

467
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,119
- Go.
- Go downstairs.

468
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:29,840
- Fire!
- There's a fire!

469
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:31,360
Let's go.

470
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:33,719
Make way.

471
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:34,360
I'll leave.

472
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,639
Use the stairs.

473
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:36,880
This way.

474
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,000
Stop her!

475
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:39,519
Get downstairs now.

476
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,160
Hello, I'm Vivian.

477
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,120
Hi, I'm Yukou.

478
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,480
- We're the Vi-Yu Girls.
- We're the Vi-Yu Girls.

479
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,040
- Vi-Yu Girls!
- Vi-Yu Girls!

480
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:21,960
You're Mr. Gou?

481
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,960
Gou Yan. Just call him 'Gou Ya.'

482
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,040
Mr. Gou Ya.

483
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,040
Why not let Ms. Lin
get you an easier job?

484
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,680
Office work would be better.

485
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,200
Why come to this remote mountain area?

486
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,720
Look, there's nothing here.

487
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,760
If not for you,

488
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,960
I wouldn't have known

489
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,040
we support a welfare home.

490
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,200
Ms. Lin said

491
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,000
charity should stay pure.

492
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,280
It's not advertising.

493
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,520
No need for fanfare.

494
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,880
See? That's visionary thinking.

495
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,360
Mr. Gou Ya,

496
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,960
once we arrive,

497
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,160
just tell me what you need.

498
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,360
We're all family here.

499
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,280
Don't be shy.

500
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,320
I suppose it's in the family blood.

501
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,720
Your relative's quieter than you.

502
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,560
Not a relative.

503
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,560
