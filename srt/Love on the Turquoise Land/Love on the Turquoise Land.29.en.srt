(This story is a work of fiction)

16
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,960
=Episode 29=

17
00:01:50,282 --> 00:01:50,922
Quecha!

18
00:01:56,122 --> 00:01:58,282
Quecha, get up. Hurry.

19
00:01:58,842 --> 00:01:59,482
Hurry.

20
00:02:46,282 --> 00:02:46,881
Shan Qiang!

21
00:02:56,481 --> 00:02:57,481
Two adult Earth Fiends.

22
00:02:57,562 --> 00:02:59,002
We're no match for them.

23
00:02:59,242 --> 00:03:00,282
Find a way out now.

24
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:02,402
I'll hold them off.

25
00:03:08,842 --> 00:03:09,682
This way!

26
00:03:09,721 --> 00:03:10,522
Luo, Yu Rong,

27
00:03:10,721 --> 00:03:11,921
evacuate the wounded first.

28
00:03:12,481 --> 00:03:13,122
Let's go.

29
00:03:13,122 --> 00:03:13,921
Hurry!

30
00:03:17,562 --> 00:03:18,721
Quick, get inside.

31
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:21,842
Hurry.

32
00:03:22,242 --> 00:03:23,082
You go ahead.

33
00:03:23,721 --> 00:03:24,441
I'll cover you.

34
00:03:25,441 --> 00:03:25,962
Go.

35
00:03:25,962 --> 00:03:26,601
Be careful.

36
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:44,082
- Third!
- Third!

37
00:03:44,082 --> 00:03:46,362
- Third!
- Third!

38
00:04:36,281 --> 00:04:37,841
Once entering the Twilight Chasm,

39
00:04:38,722 --> 00:04:40,162
fiends become human demons,

40
00:04:40,682 --> 00:04:42,122
and humans become fiendish wraiths.

41
00:05:10,482 --> 00:05:11,441
It's a dead end.

42
00:05:11,482 --> 00:05:12,521
This is the only exit.

43
00:05:15,961 --> 00:05:17,441
To deal with us,

44
00:05:17,881 --> 00:05:20,401
you even summoned
the ancestral Earth Demons.

45
00:05:22,881 --> 00:05:23,602
Fine then.

46
00:05:24,602 --> 00:05:27,002
Let's settle all scores at once.

47
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:29,441
What's she saying?

48
00:05:31,408 --> 00:05:33,840
The underworld is where fiends dwell.

49
00:05:35,281 --> 00:05:39,602
Lurking beneath Turquoise Land,
they heed the ocarina's call.

50
00:05:40,401 --> 00:05:43,441
War Ocarina
has five tones and eight sounds.

51
00:05:44,641 --> 00:05:47,441
It governs heaven and earth
with the Dao as its score.

52
00:05:47,961 --> 00:05:52,081
Humans and fiends share paths,
merging into South Mountain.

53
00:05:52,841 --> 00:05:53,841
Were those Earth Demons

54
00:05:54,641 --> 00:05:55,521
summoned by you?

55
00:06:02,401 --> 00:06:05,201
I wanted to increase
our odds of success.

56
00:06:05,881 --> 00:06:06,922
But I never expected

57
00:06:07,081 --> 00:06:08,362
our South Mountain elders

58
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:10,562
couldn't tell friend from foe.

59
00:06:15,984 --> 00:06:17,776
None of this matters now.

60
00:06:17,776 --> 00:06:19,362
Seven hounds, two whips, and one blade.

61
00:06:19,441 --> 00:06:21,401
If ten of us fight one fiend,
we stand a chance.

62
00:06:21,401 --> 00:06:23,216
But now it's two fiends
against seven of us.

63
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:23,952
What do we do?

64
00:06:25,042 --> 00:06:25,841
Fight to the death.

65
00:06:26,562 --> 00:06:28,081
Killing even one would count as a win.

66
00:06:28,761 --> 00:06:30,321
There's only this one exit anyway.

67
00:06:31,881 --> 00:06:32,841
Let's take them on.

68
00:06:34,881 --> 00:06:35,562
Xing Shen,

69
00:06:36,922 --> 00:06:37,641
give the order.

70
00:06:39,761 --> 00:06:41,961
Wu Qing, watch Quecha.

71
00:06:42,722 --> 00:06:43,362
Yu Rong,

72
00:06:44,281 --> 00:06:46,002
hold off the big one
at the cave entrance.

73
00:06:46,722 --> 00:06:47,961
We'll break out together.

74
00:06:56,761 --> 00:06:57,401
Luo!

75
00:06:57,401 --> 00:06:58,042
Luo!

76
00:07:00,562 --> 00:07:01,362
What did you eat?

77
00:07:04,881 --> 00:07:05,761
It doesn't matter.

78
00:07:13,482 --> 00:07:14,362
Mad Blade medicine.

79
00:07:19,401 --> 00:07:20,362
Luo?

80
00:07:24,961 --> 00:07:25,641
Luo?

81
00:07:40,122 --> 00:07:41,122

I'm fine.

Xing Shen!

95
00:13:19,235 --> 00:13:19,995
Tuo,

96
00:13:20,554 --> 00:13:23,154
this is both a reunion and a farewell.

97
00:13:24,075 --> 00:13:26,394
Any last words for me?

98
00:13:35,995 --> 00:13:38,075
Yan Xin has been gone a long time.

99
00:13:38,075 --> 00:13:39,715
Now go join her.

100
00:14:03,995 --> 00:14:04,835
Have you forgotten?

101
00:14:05,715 --> 00:14:07,794
This can't kill me.

102
00:16:03,674 --> 00:16:04,355
Xinxin.

103
00:16:05,394 --> 00:16:06,835
Xinxin, where did you go?

104
00:16:07,554 --> 00:16:09,554
I never went anywhere.

105
00:16:09,674 --> 00:16:11,394
I've been right here.

106
00:16:11,394 --> 00:16:14,274
I'm perfectly fine. Don't worry.

107
00:16:14,995 --> 00:16:16,995
Good, good.

108
00:16:16,995 --> 00:16:19,955
Tuo, look how beautiful
it is over there.

109
00:16:19,955 --> 00:16:22,355
Let's go see together.

110
00:16:22,355 --> 00:16:23,555
No, Xinxin.

111
00:16:23,555 --> 00:16:24,115
Xinxin!

112
00:16:24,674 --> 00:16:26,795
Tuo, I'm very happy here.

113
00:16:26,795 --> 00:16:28,714
Everyone takes good care of me.

114
00:16:29,035 --> 00:16:30,275
Stop looking for me.

115
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:33,035
Go back now. Goodbye.

116
00:16:33,275 --> 00:16:33,994
Xinxin!

117
00:18:04,394 --> 00:18:05,234
Where's Luo?

118
00:18:21,714 --> 00:18:24,835
A long-haired Earth Demon
killed Lin Xirou

119
00:18:26,394 --> 00:18:27,755
and then dragged Luo away.

120
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,275
Everyone's badly injured.

121
00:18:34,634 --> 00:18:36,355
We feared
more Earth Fiends would appear.

122
00:18:38,115 --> 00:18:39,994
We couldn't continue
search and rescue efforts.

123
00:18:45,154 --> 00:18:47,515
Rong, we did our best.

124
00:18:48,555 --> 00:18:50,315
We only recovered the War Ocarina.

125
00:19:08,994 --> 00:19:10,115
Let's retreat

126
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:11,835
and heal properly

127
00:19:12,515 --> 00:19:14,795
before resuming the search.

128
00:19:17,154 --> 00:19:19,275
Recall the team and take headcount.

129
00:19:19,755 --> 00:19:20,914
Copy that.

130
00:19:21,674 --> 00:19:22,795
Okay.

131
00:19:46,434 --> 00:19:48,434
L-Luo?

132
00:20:21,755 --> 00:20:22,555
Luo.

133
00:20:28,674 --> 00:20:29,434
Luo.

134
00:20:31,634 --> 00:20:32,234
Luo!

135
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:38,035
Somebody dumped you
at my place, no idea who.

136
00:20:38,595 --> 00:20:40,434
You've been out cold for a week.

137
00:20:41,835 --> 00:20:44,154
My Wanbao Tower's been closed
that whole time too.

138
00:20:45,154 --> 00:20:46,595
I'll tell you everything I know.

139
00:20:46,674 --> 00:20:47,755
Just one condition.

140
00:20:47,994 --> 00:20:49,194
Stay lying down, okay?

141
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,954
At first you were in a deep coma.

142
00:20:58,115 --> 00:21:00,795
I used every med
I could get my hands on.

143
00:21:00,795 --> 00:21:02,994
You only stabilized
these past couple of days.

144
00:21:04,674 --> 00:21:06,474
So your top priority now

145
00:21:07,674 --> 00:21:08,555
is sleeping.

146
00:21:09,755 --> 00:21:11,515
If you collapse again,

147
00:21:12,555 --> 00:21:14,035
I can't handle it again.

148
00:21:20,515 --> 00:21:21,275
What about Luo?

149
00:21:23,056 --> 00:21:24,795
I searched everywhere possible

150
00:21:25,795 --> 00:21:27,355
and asked around.

151
00:21:28,547 --> 00:21:29,627
No trace of her anywhere.

152
00:21:31,266 --> 00:21:33,147
Don't think I'm some hero doing this.

153
00:21:33,507 --> 00:21:34,388
It's mainly because

154
00:21:34,388 --> 00:21:36,507
you've mumbled her name
over 600 times in your coma.

155
00:21:37,787 --> 00:21:38,468
Drove me crazy.

156
00:21:47,948 --> 00:21:51,347
I've lost count of how many times
you've helped me.

157
00:21:52,388 --> 00:21:53,428
Save the thanks.

158
00:21:54,948 --> 00:21:56,787
Focus on getting your strength back

159
00:21:56,787 --> 00:21:58,067
and moving out from here

160
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,228
to free up my bed.

161
00:22:01,188 --> 00:22:02,027
That matters most.

162
00:22:04,307 --> 00:22:06,148
You can get me
a commendation plaque later.

163
00:22:07,628 --> 00:22:09,388
No 'Healing Hands, Compassionate Heart'

164
00:22:10,628 --> 00:22:13,267
or 'Modern Hippocrates of Kos.'

165
00:22:13,267 --> 00:22:14,428
Too cliché.

166
00:22:15,748 --> 00:22:17,708
Go creative, like,

167
00:22:18,228 --> 00:22:20,388
'Xian, thank you for my second life.'

168
00:22:20,988 --> 00:22:23,787
'From the depths of my heart,
I call you Father.'

169
00:22:24,507 --> 00:22:26,628
That's the kind of heartfelt tribute
I'll take.

170
00:22:29,428 --> 00:22:30,507
Mind if I ask?

171
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,547
Why are you

172
00:22:34,307 --> 00:22:35,547
doing all this?

173
00:22:51,075 --> 00:22:52,075
I'll show you something.

174
00:22:59,595 --> 00:23:00,716
This kid is me.

175
00:23:06,499 --> 00:23:07,139
This was my dad.

176
00:23:09,259 --> 00:23:11,378
He got leukemia young.

177
00:23:13,139 --> 00:23:14,378
Got lucky though.

178
00:23:15,338 --> 00:23:18,179
Found a volunteer marrow donor.

179
00:23:19,659 --> 00:23:20,778
But then somehow,

180
00:23:21,578 --> 00:23:22,778
right before the surgery,

181
00:23:23,219 --> 00:23:25,018
that kind soul vanished mysteriously.

182
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:27,699
My dad didn't make it.

183
00:23:30,019 --> 00:23:34,019
My mom juggled work and raising me.

184
00:23:35,019 --> 00:23:36,100
She worked herself sick

185
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,019
and followed my dad within three years.

186
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,220
You know the rest.

187
00:23:43,739 --> 00:23:45,620
Roadsound Group sponsored me

188
00:23:45,779 --> 00:23:47,860
through school and graduation.

189
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,299
And I opened Wanbao Tower smoothly.

190
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:53,499
Then one day

191
00:23:54,259 --> 00:23:55,739
I discovered

192
00:23:56,499 --> 00:23:58,698
that missing volunteer

193
00:23:58,698 --> 00:23:59,779
wasn't lost by accident.

194
00:24:03,843 --> 00:24:05,603
Lin Xirou snatched him as her blood bag.

195
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:14,636
I saw Roadsound Group as my savior,

196
00:24:15,515 --> 00:24:16,876
but the very savior

197
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:21,275
indirectly killed my real parents.

198
00:24:21,876 --> 00:24:23,556
Should I hate her?

199
00:24:24,995 --> 00:24:25,755
I can't.

200
00:24:27,795 --> 00:24:28,475
But loving her?

201
00:24:30,515 --> 00:24:31,995
That's impossible too.

202
00:24:36,116 --> 00:24:37,076
That's why I envy you.

203
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:39,475
You can love and hate fiercely.

204
00:24:40,755 --> 00:24:41,995
So I helped you.

205
00:24:44,356 --> 00:24:45,755
Helping you is helping myself.

206
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:58,738
Luo said...

207
00:24:59,738 --> 00:25:00,339
Luo said

208
00:25:00,339 --> 00:25:02,619
she wanted to stop
by a cave temple on the way.

209
00:25:02,729 --> 00:25:04,019
She'll be back a few days late.

210
00:25:04,539 --> 00:25:06,178
I can't be away
from the company for long.

211
00:25:06,178 --> 00:25:07,259
So I came back first.

212
00:25:08,898 --> 00:25:09,619
It's okay.

213
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:12,779
Perfect timing. Ms. Lu
is making dumplings for us today.

214
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:14,218
You can be the judge

215
00:25:14,339 --> 00:25:16,738
and decide whose dumplings taste better.

216
00:25:17,458 --> 00:25:19,218
Dumplings for departure,
noodles for arrival.

217
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:20,859
Mr. Yan just got back.

218
00:25:20,938 --> 00:25:22,178
Don't make him eat dumplings.

219
00:25:22,738 --> 00:25:23,859
Everything's ready.

220
00:25:24,138 --> 00:25:25,019
Let's make dumplings

221
00:25:25,658 --> 00:25:27,458
and cook him a separate bowl of noodles.

222
00:25:28,138 --> 00:25:29,418
We shouldn't overstuff him.

223
00:25:29,738 --> 00:25:31,378
He's a young grown man.

224
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:33,059
When I was his age,

225
00:25:33,218 --> 00:25:34,418
I ate noodles by the pot.

226
00:25:41,099 --> 00:25:41,658
Tuo,

227
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:43,938
why not go to your room and rest?

228
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:45,697
I'll call when the food's ready.

229
00:25:47,539 --> 00:25:48,178
Okay.

230
00:25:48,698 --> 00:25:49,579
I'll head over now.

231
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:28,419
(Return Safely)

232
00:26:49,091 --> 00:26:51,747
(Practical Sculpture Techniques)

233
00:27:05,571 --> 00:27:07,651
(Photo Album)

234
00:27:41,539 --> 00:27:42,258
Lu,

235
00:27:42,978 --> 00:27:44,539
I've already washed them.

236
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:48,738
Look at me.

237
00:27:50,498 --> 00:27:51,899
I'm getting forgetful.

238
00:27:57,089 --> 00:27:58,089
Something on your mind?

239
00:28:02,899 --> 00:28:04,658
Miss Nie travels often.

240
00:28:05,779 --> 00:28:07,059
This isn't her first trip.

241
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:10,299
But this time feels different.

242
00:28:10,978 --> 00:28:14,938
I've got this nagging unease.

243
00:28:20,835 --> 00:28:21,474
Ms. Lu.

244
00:28:22,155 --> 00:28:22,795
Ms. Lu.

245
00:28:24,395 --> 00:28:26,034
Ms. Lu, who is this person?

246
00:28:27,954 --> 00:28:29,155
Miss Nie's mother.

247
00:28:29,635 --> 00:28:30,274
What's wrong?

248
00:28:30,994 --> 00:28:32,034
Luo's mother?

249
00:28:32,835 --> 00:28:33,434
Yes.

250
00:30:46,114 --> 00:30:47,114
That's enough.

251
00:30:48,474 --> 00:30:49,154
Give it a rest.

252
00:30:51,795 --> 00:30:53,994
I'll decide when to rest

253
00:30:54,795 --> 00:30:55,634
and when to train.

254
00:30:57,474 --> 00:30:58,195
No problem.

255
00:30:59,835 --> 00:31:01,875
As long as you meet my standards.

256
00:31:03,514 --> 00:31:07,315
If I pass the Ghost Whip assessment,

257
00:31:08,235 --> 00:31:09,395
you'll stop nagging me?

258
00:31:11,554 --> 00:31:12,795
It's okay if you don't pass.

259
00:31:14,395 --> 00:31:15,755
Don't push yourself too hard.

260
00:31:24,154 --> 00:31:25,514
I will pass the assessment.

261
00:31:25,715 --> 00:31:27,034
The Hunters need me.

262
00:31:27,474 --> 00:31:28,594
And I will be there.

263
00:31:30,235 --> 00:31:34,954
But training, patrolling,
and ancestor rites

264
00:31:36,994 --> 00:31:39,355
are just formalities.

265
00:31:39,994 --> 00:31:42,315
Can I skip them from now on?

266
00:31:43,675 --> 00:31:44,954
Let's talk after the assessment.

267
00:31:47,177 --> 00:31:50,825
(Jiang Baichuan)

268
00:32:23,835 --> 00:32:24,594
From now on,

269
00:32:25,875 --> 00:32:27,154
this will always be your home.

270
00:32:27,994 --> 00:32:29,434
And we'll always be your family.

271
00:32:45,321 --> 00:32:46,409

Big Head

274
00:33:21,675 --> 00:33:23,915
got guarding down.

275
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:24,915
Shut up.

276
00:33:24,915 --> 00:33:28,675
Others have guard dogs,
and I have Big Head.

277
00:33:29,154 --> 00:33:30,554
Stop that.

278
00:33:30,755 --> 00:33:31,434
Cheeky.

279
00:33:32,514 --> 00:33:33,195
Shut up.

280
00:33:35,145 --> 00:33:37,353

(Nie Jiuluo)

285
00:34:49,027 --> 00:34:53,392
Ode to the South Mountain Hunters.

286
00:34:53,392 --> 00:34:57,040
Stars set on dark peaks.

287
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,720
Fiends rise in Turquoise Land.

288
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,112
Bound heads, sealed gold.

289
00:35:04,112 --> 00:35:07,664
We're sworn to defend our home.

290
00:35:07,664 --> 00:35:11,216
Ancient bloodlines.

291
00:35:11,216 --> 00:35:14,832
Share this toil.

292
00:35:14,832 --> 00:35:18,416
Golden Gate arises.

293
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:22,224
Fate follows ancestors.

294
00:35:22,224 --> 00:35:26,384
South Mountain hunts shadows.

295
00:35:26,384 --> 00:35:30,032
Turquoise Land hides blades.

296
00:35:30,032 --> 00:35:33,456
Though hunters perish.

297
00:35:33,552 --> 00:35:37,072
The fiend hunt endures.

298
00:35:37,072 --> 00:35:40,560
Hound fangs tear night.

299

Whip cracks echo skies.

300
00:35:44,144 --> 00:35:47,824
Bloodstained woods.

301
00:35:47,824 --> 00:35:51,664
