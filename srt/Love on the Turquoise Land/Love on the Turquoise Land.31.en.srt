16
00:01:44,332 --> 00:01:47,025
=Episode 31=

17
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,032
(Roadsound Welfare Home)

18
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:13,810
You said to send another car

19
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:14,530
to pick me up.

20
00:02:14,889 --> 00:02:15,889
Where's the car?

21
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:17,490
How much longer?

22
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:21,169
Hello.

23
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,810
(Villagers feared her)

24
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:29,770
(Temple of the Righteous Lord)
and worried she'd return to feast.

25
00:02:30,009 --> 00:02:32,569
So they pooled funds to build
a Temple of the Righteous Lord.

26
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,409
The Temple of the Righteous Lord
is the Temple of Zhong Kui.

27
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,370
The temple enshrines
Lord Zhong Kui himself.

28
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,970
Watch your step. Be careful.

29
00:02:44,609 --> 00:02:45,889
I thought

30
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,729
to plant an osmanthus tree in the yard

31
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:52,889
and retire here peacefully.

32
00:02:53,689 --> 00:02:55,889
But I'm used to living where I am,

33
00:02:56,569 --> 00:02:57,569
too lazy to move

34
00:02:58,409 --> 00:02:59,729
or to tidy up.

35
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:02,770
So it's left uninhabited.

36
00:03:05,449 --> 00:03:06,609
Make do with this for now.

37
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:08,129
Thank you, Jiang.

38
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,129
I found you a housekeeper named Ms. Lu.

39
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:14,009
She's hardworking and a decent cook.

40
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,530
She'll be here soon.

41
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:17,289
Let me show you around.

42
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:44,250
You must be Mr. Lu.

43
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:45,689
Sorry for the wait.

44
00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:46,609
Fine. I came early.

45
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:47,849
Want a drink?

46
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,009
No, thanks. Let's get to the point.

47
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,810
I'm very bullish on your Ninja Duck.

48
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:54,729
Hermit Duck.

49
00:03:57,409 --> 00:03:58,650
It's called Hermit Duck.

50
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:02,250
H-Hermit...

51
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:03,370
Hermit.

52
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:05,530
H-Hermit Duck.

53
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:08,090
H-Hermit Duck, right?

54
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:10,009
Alright. Hermit Duck.

55
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:11,609
May I ask

56
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:13,490
why you favor Hermit Duck?

57
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:17,130
Because it can make money.

58
00:04:17,929 --> 00:04:18,650
I mean it.

59
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,249
It will be popular.

60
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:21,770
I mean, really popular.

61
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,450
Well, you can constantly

62
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,409
release new skins.

63
00:04:29,409 --> 00:04:30,609
You took the Huoquan Pills?

64
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:32,849
What's wrong with you?

65
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,169
Why did you take that?

66
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:35,289
Wait for me.

67
00:04:35,289 --> 00:04:36,849
Luo.

68
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,210
This is my choice.

69
00:04:44,028 --> 00:04:46,104
Mad Dog leads the charge,
Mad Blade stays in command,

70
00:04:46,104 --> 00:04:48,184
Enter the Twilight Chasm,
fiends hunt human monsters.

71
00:04:48,184 --> 00:04:49,824
Blades and hounds
walk the Turquoise Land.

72
00:04:49,824 --> 00:04:51,224
Ghost Whip cracks his glowing whip.

73
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:52,784
Seven hounds, two whips, and one blade.

74
00:04:52,784 --> 00:04:54,010
The Golden Gate holds firm.

75
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,280
Patrolled every four years.

76
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,600
No more wrongful deaths in Nanba.

77
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,770
Wraiths and fiends walk separate paths.
South Mountain Hunters risk brief lives.

78
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:00,800
Mad Dog leads the charge,

79
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,609
- Mad Blade stays in command...
- Ma.

80
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:05,249
Go kowtow to your mother.

81
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,169
We were late
because of the mountain patrol.

82
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,090
Ling

83
00:05:14,409 --> 00:05:15,890
won't blame us.

84
00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:20,210
I'm always told that patrolling
means protection

85
00:05:20,929 --> 00:05:21,929
and duty.

86
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:23,489
Yet in the end,

87
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,929
we didn't even get
to see Ling one last time.

88
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,450
I don't understand

89
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,130
what we are protecting.

90
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,289
I want to quit

91
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,809
the South Mountain Hunters.

92
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:43,489
If you're determined,

93
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,450
I won't stop you.

94
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:48,970
But at least after finishing

95
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:51,609
this patrol.

96
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,249
Rest assured.

97
00:06:02,249 --> 00:06:03,609
South Mountain Education Center

98
00:06:03,609 --> 00:06:05,330
is a state-funded boarding school

99
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:06,770
with qualifications.

100
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:08,650
I'll take good care of her.

101
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,169
Eat the dumplings on the way.

102
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:11,770
Eat up.

103
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:31,890
Who is this?

104
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:33,130
Someone jumped.

105
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,409
It's fine.

106
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:39,210
It's all in the past.

107
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,369
It's fine.

108
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,330
Dad, Mom.

109
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:44,970
Mom.

110
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:49,369
Dad!

111
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:50,929
Little girl, leave here first.

112
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:52,130
Let go!

113
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:52,630
Be good.

114
00:07:00,409 --> 00:07:01,530
Luo.

115
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,289
Brush your teeth and eat well.

116
00:07:03,409 --> 00:07:05,289
Don't make Dad angry, okay?

117
00:07:05,289 --> 00:07:05,929
Okay.

118
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,770
Be careful and stay safe.

119
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:09,650
Got it.

120
00:07:10,049 --> 00:07:11,650
Tell Mom to come back early.

121
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:13,210
Mom, come back early.

122
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:14,929
Luo, what is this?

123
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,049
Persimmons and peanuts.

124
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:20,690
Right, good things will happen
when you wear it.

125
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,130
Keep it safe for me, okay?

126
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:22,770
Okay.

127
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:24,530
Beautiful.

128
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:25,570
Let's go.

129
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:43,849
Is that beautiful?

130
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:44,650
Yes.

131
00:07:44,929 --> 00:07:45,650
Beautiful.

132
00:07:45,929 --> 00:07:47,450
How about I give you a present?

133
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:48,169
Okay.

134
00:07:48,489 --> 00:07:49,249
What is it?

135
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,770
Thanks, Dad.

136
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:56,450
You're welcome, dear.

137
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,609
A child's birthday
is the mother's suffering day.

138
00:07:59,609 --> 00:08:01,289
Should we get Mom a present?

139
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,570
I have one too?

140
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,010
What should we get for Mom?

141
00:08:05,249 --> 00:08:06,690
Good things ahead.

142
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:11,970
Beautiful?

143
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:12,729
Yes.

144
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,010
I'll put it on for Mom.

145
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:14,690
Okay.

146
00:08:29,489 --> 00:08:30,210
Thank you.

147
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:31,249
Beautiful.

148
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:32,690
Does it look beautiful?

149
00:08:32,769 --> 00:08:33,609
Yes.

150
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:34,529
Beautiful.

151
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:36,050
I will give you one too.

152
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:36,849
Okay.

153
00:08:38,009 --> 00:08:39,889
You put in the candles.
I'll get the utensils.

154
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:40,570
Okay.

155
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:42,889
What color do you like?

156
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:46,410
I like purple, pink, and green.

157
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:47,249
I'll do it.

158
00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:49,050
You like them all?

159
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:51,970
You're being greedy.

160
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,290
Then purple, pink,
green, and orange ones

161
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:55,129
are all yours.

162
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,410
Let's put them in.

163
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,369
You've been through
a lot in these years, right?

164
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,090
You're a grown-up now.

165
00:09:20,609 --> 00:09:21,970
Don't be a crybaby anymore.

166
00:09:26,849 --> 00:09:27,450
Mom.

167
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:49,729
Be good, Luo.

168
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:51,050
Mom.

169
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:52,649
I'm really happy.

170
00:09:53,649 --> 00:09:54,410
Mom.

171
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:55,450
I don't regret it.

172
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:56,849
Mom.

173
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,170
Mom.

174
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:01,369
Be good.

175
00:10:04,369 --> 00:10:05,330
Live well.

176
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,129
Live the life you want.

177
00:10:15,129 --> 00:10:16,330
Mom.

178
00:10:17,489 --> 00:10:20,330
Mom, come blow out the candles.

179
00:11:19,861 --> 00:11:20,461
Luo.

180
00:11:21,221 --> 00:11:22,020
Luo.

181
00:11:23,861 --> 00:11:25,660
Luo, you're awake.

182
00:11:32,461 --> 00:11:33,300
Who are you?

183
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:38,981
Stop!

184
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,020
What's wrong with you?

185
00:11:40,141 --> 00:11:41,381
Luo, stop.

186
00:11:42,221 --> 00:11:43,180
D-Don't throw the books.

187
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,180
Don't throw the books.

188
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:45,981
Don't.

189
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:48,221
Don't.

190
00:11:48,381 --> 00:11:49,020
Wait.

191
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,780
What happened?

192
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,540
Luo.

193
00:11:54,341 --> 00:11:56,741
Ms. Lu, Yu Rong.

194
00:11:58,981 --> 00:11:59,700
Luo.

195
00:12:02,461 --> 00:12:03,341
Doctor.

196
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,900
She had unconsciousness

197
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,141
due to drowning recently.

198
00:12:06,501 --> 00:12:07,660
After she woke up,

199
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,341
her short-term memory was gone.

200
00:12:11,825 --> 00:12:13,705
Any family history of mental illness?

201
00:12:14,225 --> 00:12:16,624
Or have you taken any medication lately?

202
00:12:19,424 --> 00:12:20,424
Probably not.

203
00:12:21,233 --> 00:12:22,713
Can you answer my questions yourself?

204
00:12:25,993 --> 00:12:26,633
Luo.

205
00:12:43,954 --> 00:12:44,993
My apologies.

206
00:12:44,993 --> 00:12:46,194
Just tell me.

207
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:48,034
Are you okay?

208
00:12:48,633 --> 00:12:49,434
Perfectly fine.

209
00:12:50,194 --> 00:12:51,314
I have a friend

210
00:12:51,314 --> 00:12:53,274
who's an expert psychiatrist
at Tongguan Hospital.

211
00:12:53,394 --> 00:12:54,194
Perhaps I...

212
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:57,473
There's nothing wrong
with me physically or mentally.

213
00:12:57,593 --> 00:12:58,993
You're the one with the problem.

214
00:12:59,554 --> 00:13:00,993
Stop wasting my time.

215
00:13:01,794 --> 00:13:02,593
Luo.

216
00:13:02,753 --> 00:13:03,674
Let go.

217
00:13:05,954 --> 00:13:06,593
Wait.

218
00:13:09,993 --> 00:13:11,314
I said let go.

219
00:13:19,394 --> 00:13:20,274
How's it?

220
00:13:21,554 --> 00:13:22,833
Hard to tell.

221
00:13:23,194 --> 00:13:24,194
What do you mean?

222
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:25,593
She's in great health.

223
00:13:25,713 --> 00:13:27,074
Previous injuries have all healed.

224
00:13:28,353 --> 00:13:29,914
But she's forgotten almost everything

225
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:31,593
happened in recent months.

226
00:13:32,513 --> 00:13:33,993
You met her

227
00:13:33,993 --> 00:13:35,353
in recent months, right?

228
00:13:36,314 --> 00:13:37,353
Exactly.

229
00:13:38,233 --> 00:13:39,674
The most clichéd plot

230
00:13:39,674 --> 00:13:40,753
happened to me.

231
00:13:42,593 --> 00:13:43,472
Mad Blade medicine.

232
00:13:43,472 --> 00:13:45,674
Rage. Channeled energy.
Strength up, veins bursting.

233
00:13:45,674 --> 00:13:47,554
Win big, lose more.
Trades life for victory.

234
00:13:48,753 --> 00:13:50,593
Can only be used as a last resort.

235
00:13:51,993 --> 00:13:53,194
She's only alive now

236
00:13:53,954 --> 00:13:55,473
thanks to that cavern filled

237
00:13:55,473 --> 00:13:57,233
with Yuwang Meat
beneath the chasm water.

238
00:13:58,873 --> 00:14:00,194
When you South Mountain Hunters

239
00:14:00,194 --> 00:14:02,194
developed such a medicine,

240
00:14:02,513 --> 00:14:04,353
why didn't you develop an antidote too?

241
00:14:04,554 --> 00:14:06,674
You are the heir
of Roadsound Pharmaceuticals.

242
00:14:07,074 --> 00:14:08,914
Get your team to develop one.

243
00:14:09,394 --> 00:14:10,513
Do you know how long

244
00:14:10,513 --> 00:14:12,233
it takes to develop a drug

245
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:13,394
from research to launch?

246
00:14:14,434 --> 00:14:16,873
Even longer than
rebuilding a relationship

247
00:14:17,154 --> 00:14:18,833
and spending a lifetime with her?

248
00:14:37,034 --> 00:14:38,194
Look at this.

249
00:14:38,394 --> 00:14:39,353
Recall anything?

250
00:14:39,954 --> 00:14:40,674
No.

251
00:14:43,274 --> 00:14:44,593
I almost died in the mine,

252
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:45,713
and you risked saving me.

253
00:14:45,713 --> 00:14:46,473
Recall anything?

254
00:14:46,473 --> 00:14:47,633
How often must I say it?

255
00:14:47,633 --> 00:14:48,554
I remember nothing.

256
00:15:02,233 --> 00:15:03,074
Wait, Luo.

257
00:15:05,674 --> 00:15:06,274
Not that one.

258
00:15:06,274 --> 00:15:07,233
It's a limited edition.

259
00:15:08,753 --> 00:15:09,674
Wait, listen...

260
00:15:15,921 --> 00:15:16,761
Looks good.

261
00:15:16,761 --> 00:15:19,561
You said you two
are old friends and comrades.

262
00:15:20,177 --> 00:15:21,096
As an artist,

263
00:15:21,657 --> 00:15:22,897
it's quite normal to be fickle.

264
00:15:23,336 --> 00:15:25,496
Diversity prevents creative stagnation.

265
00:15:25,697 --> 00:15:26,336
Right?

266
00:15:26,777 --> 00:15:28,697
I think it's positive. Really.

267
00:15:28,976 --> 00:15:30,777
Just be patient.

268
00:15:30,976 --> 00:15:31,616
She'll be fine.

269
00:15:32,897 --> 00:15:35,457
Miss Nie explores everywhere to gather

270
00:15:35,537 --> 00:15:36,417
artistic inspiration.

271
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:39,336
Like mountain caves
and wilderness temples.

272
00:15:39,537 --> 00:15:41,777
Did she invite some evil spirits?

273
00:15:42,057 --> 00:15:42,657
No.

274
00:15:43,697 --> 00:15:44,297
Impossible.

275
00:15:44,697 --> 00:15:46,216
Her energy is so strong.

276
00:15:46,537 --> 00:15:47,657
Evil spirits wouldn't dare

277
00:15:47,657 --> 00:15:48,496
mess with her.

278
00:15:48,577 --> 00:15:49,577
It'd be asking for death.

279
00:17:02,801 --> 00:17:04,962
(No.7 Sculpting Knife, Ebony)

280
00:17:04,962 --> 00:17:06,161
(50-jin Sculpting Clay)

281
00:17:07,042 --> 00:17:07,762
Thanks.

282
00:18:31,202 --> 00:18:33,561
(Trash)

283
00:18:36,232 --> 00:18:39,976
(Wanbao Tower)

284
00:18:45,832 --> 00:18:51,144
(For Rent, Price is a Steal)

285
00:18:55,312 --> 00:19:01,296
(Wanbao Tower)

286
00:19:17,242 --> 00:19:19,881
(To Lin Ling:
I'm leaving Xicang temporarily.)

287
00:19:19,881 --> 00:19:23,401
(Want to meet before I leave?)

288
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:31,112
(Message Revoked)

289
00:19:38,522 --> 00:19:40,042
(Agree)

290
00:20:05,873 --> 00:20:07,032
Mr. Yan.

291
00:20:07,393 --> 00:20:08,712
Are you available now?

292
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:10,472
Coming.

293
00:20:26,472 --> 00:20:27,472
Excuse me, this seat...

294
00:20:33,752 --> 00:20:34,512
What's wrong?

295
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:41,032
Pretty good.

296
00:20:43,313 --> 00:20:44,553
Long time no see.

297
00:20:45,073 --> 00:20:46,512
You've changed a lot.

298
00:20:48,353 --> 00:20:49,153
Have I?

299
00:20:51,073 --> 00:20:52,232
You've become shyer.

300
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,313
'Relax' Pine, a potted plant.

301
00:21:03,672 --> 00:21:04,432
For you.

302
00:21:04,913 --> 00:21:07,153
May you be relaxed

303
00:21:07,472 --> 00:21:08,393
and carefree.

304
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:15,593
A little pine.

305
00:21:17,313 --> 00:21:18,113
Grow up now.

306
00:21:18,992 --> 00:21:20,913
Green leaves and new sprouts.

307
00:21:26,353 --> 00:21:28,113
Why does this feel like a farewell?

308
00:21:29,633 --> 00:21:30,752
A farewell gift for me?

309
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:36,672
Since we've both survived hardships,

310
00:21:37,073 --> 00:21:39,153
we both want a fresh start.

311
00:21:40,512 --> 00:21:42,393
Let's pretend
that it's the first time we meet.

312
00:21:42,992 --> 00:21:44,593
And this is a welcome gift for you.

313
00:21:52,032 --> 00:21:54,073
But I came unprepared.

314
00:21:54,432 --> 00:21:56,032
Like I'm not sincere.

315
00:21:56,153 --> 00:21:57,833
Well, I'll treat you to ice cream.

316
00:22:00,272 --> 00:22:03,313
Sir, two of those ice desserts.

317
00:22:03,313 --> 00:22:05,328
Alright. Takeaway or staying?

318
00:22:09,353 --> 00:22:10,952
(You're the 66th customers)

319
00:22:10,952 --> 00:22:12,272
(in our shop today.)

320
00:22:12,393 --> 00:22:14,833
We've prepared three gifts
for you to choose from.

321
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:15,593
Pick one.

322
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:16,512
Pick one.

323
00:22:17,432 --> 00:22:19,952
I'll pick this one.

324
00:22:48,393 --> 00:22:49,153
Where's he?

325
00:22:49,633 --> 00:22:50,432
Mr. Yan?

326
00:22:51,192 --> 00:22:51,833
He left.

327
00:22:53,393 --> 00:22:54,272
Why?

328
00:22:55,272 --> 00:22:56,712
You don't want him to be here.

329
00:22:57,272 --> 00:22:59,073
I think he found it awkward
to stay here,

330
00:22:59,073 --> 00:22:59,992
so he left.

331
00:23:29,937 --> 00:23:31,416
What did Ms. Lu say?

332
00:23:32,785 --> 00:23:34,305
She told me to get some fresh air.

333
00:23:34,825 --> 00:23:36,184
Stop treating her like a child,

334
00:23:36,385 --> 00:23:37,704
coaxing and indulging her.

335
00:23:37,704 --> 00:23:38,664
That won't work.

336
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,025
Not sure if she's comforting me

337
00:23:42,025 --> 00:23:43,385
or just trying a desperate mean.

338
00:23:44,105 --> 00:23:45,625
Ms. Lu makes a good point.

339
00:23:46,385 --> 00:23:47,424
Don't go back just yet.

340
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:49,105
Why?

341
00:23:49,825 --> 00:23:51,305
The more you coax her,

342
00:23:51,744 --> 00:23:53,144
the less she cares for you.

343
00:23:53,904 --> 00:23:55,184
Keep some distance from her,

344
00:23:55,585 --> 00:23:57,625
and she might see your value.

345
00:23:57,649 --> 00:23:58,449
Exactly.

346
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:00,530
To achieve something,

347
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:02,010
try to go against the grain.

348
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:04,369
The more you seek strength,

349
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:05,969
the weaker you must appear.

350
00:24:06,369 --> 00:24:07,449
The more you desire,

351
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:08,969
the more you must let go.

352
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:10,409
The same to her.

353
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,409
The harder she recalls,

354
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:14,169
the more she'll forget.

355
00:24:16,449 --> 00:24:18,530
Learn this wisdom at the archery range?

356
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:23,250
If you focus too hard on the bullseye,

357
00:24:23,689 --> 00:24:25,050
your form will fall apart.

358
00:24:25,689 --> 00:24:26,770
Score drops.

359
00:24:27,209 --> 00:24:27,889
Then,

360
00:24:29,169 --> 00:24:30,250
what should I do?

361
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:32,129
To draw the bow,

362
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:34,129
not only arm strength alone needed,

363
00:24:34,729 --> 00:24:35,810
but also relaxation.

364
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:38,209
Engage every muscle in your body

365
00:24:38,409 --> 00:24:39,330
to draw the bow fully.

366
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,929
Focus on perfecting every single detail.

367
00:24:42,209 --> 00:24:43,369
Don't go after the outcome.

368
00:24:44,944 --> 00:24:46,449
(This applies to you and Nie Jiuluo.)

369
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:49,649
(Treasure her and you at the moment.)

370
00:24:50,409 --> 00:24:51,610
(Let the fate work.)

371
00:25:41,664 --> 00:25:43,248
(Joy Comes Upon, Moving Forward)

372
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:52,330
Wherever you go,

373
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:53,609
you need my permission first.

374
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:56,850
Okay.

375
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:58,649
But solving things with words,

376
00:26:58,649 --> 00:26:59,409
not fists.

377
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:00,129
Okay.

378
00:27:01,169 --> 00:27:02,730
But it depends on the situations.

379
00:27:02,929 --> 00:27:03,850
Extreme ones excluded.

380
00:27:05,689 --> 00:27:06,290
Okay.

381
00:27:08,409 --> 00:27:10,570
Chat with me
for at least fifteen minutes every day.

382
00:27:12,889 --> 00:27:13,730
Okay.

383
00:27:14,409 --> 00:27:15,770
But it depends on the topics.

384
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:17,169
The ones I hate excluded.

385
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:17,850
Okay.

386
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:19,369
Read five stars every day.

387
00:27:19,969 --> 00:27:20,770
Let's work together

388
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:22,129
to regain your memory.

389
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:23,449
Okay.

390
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:25,689
But I'll only open and read them.

391
00:27:25,969 --> 00:27:27,129
I won't fold them back.

392
00:27:27,209 --> 00:27:27,770
Okay.

393
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:32,929
Travel with me.

394
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:35,169
Short trips.

395
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,090
Three days maximum.

396
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:42,369
Okay.

397
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:43,689
Really?

398
00:27:44,689 --> 00:27:45,449
Fine, forget it.

399
00:27:45,689 --> 00:27:46,969
No, we're definitely going.

400
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:47,889
It's settled then.

401
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:06,929
This is tacky and ugly.

402
00:28:06,929 --> 00:28:08,129
Why are you hanging it here?

403
00:28:08,449 --> 00:28:09,369
Don't touch it.

404
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:11,409
It's my treasure.

405
00:28:16,969 --> 00:28:17,770
Well,

406
00:28:18,689 --> 00:28:19,810
how many minutes left today?

407
00:28:21,169 --> 00:28:22,369
I set an alarm.

408
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:23,649
It'll ring when time's up.

409
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:25,689
It's okay to end the conversation now.

410
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:26,689
No way.

411
00:28:26,689 --> 00:28:27,929
We agreed on fifteen minutes.

412
00:28:28,129 --> 00:28:28,850
Make them count.

413
00:28:30,929 --> 00:28:33,169
Well, you drove me
up the mountain overnight,

414
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:35,169
made a natural fire for me at the peak,

415
00:28:35,169 --> 00:28:36,010
and saved my life.

416
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:37,090
You remember that, right?

417
00:28:38,409 --> 00:28:39,570
I caught your lie.

418
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:42,250
Didn't you say I saved you in the mine?

419
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,649
Why mention the natural fire now?

420
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:45,170
You saved me twice.

421
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:46,490
First time with the natural fire.

422
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:47,730
Second time in the mine.

423
00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:48,929
As a grown man,

424
00:28:48,929 --> 00:28:50,369
you need me to save you twice?

425
00:28:51,152 --> 00:28:52,225
I've saved you too.

426
00:28:52,225 --> 00:28:53,584
When you got hurt at the shipyard,

427
00:28:53,584 --> 00:28:55,010
I showed up in time.

428
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:55,649
That was...

429
00:29:03,389 --> 00:29:03,889
Fine.

430
00:29:03,889 --> 00:29:06,169
Save it for next time.

431
00:29:23,889 --> 00:29:24,449
Here.

432
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:40,889
What? What do you need?

433
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:50,250
Have I had this noodle before?

434
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:52,369
Yes, you have.

435
00:29:53,409 --> 00:29:54,810
When you went rescue Mr. Crip,

436
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:55,889
I was hurt by Locust.

437
00:29:55,889 --> 00:29:57,290
And you made a natural fire for me.

438
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,250
Later, Jiang got captured

439
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,449
and you came to me. Remember?

440
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:06,689
Jiang?

441
00:30:06,929 --> 00:30:07,570
Yes.

442
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:12,050
Mad Blade.

443
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:22,610
Jiang.

444
00:30:28,945 --> 00:30:30,425
It's okay, Luo.

445
00:30:32,945 --> 00:30:33,625
It's okay.

446
00:30:35,465 --> 00:30:36,344
Luo.

447
00:30:37,704 --> 00:30:38,224
Luo...

448
00:31:00,144 --> 00:31:00,704
Asleep?

449
00:31:48,744 --> 00:31:51,304
(Ms. Lu is excellent.
I've decided to keep her.)

450
00:31:56,224 --> 00:32:00,105
(The osmanthus tree is blooming.
We'll get to eat osmanthus sauce.)

451
00:32:05,065 --> 00:32:06,905
(Gave Yan Tuo a haircut.)

452
00:32:07,144 --> 00:32:10,505
(He should recover soon. Keep it up!)

453
00:32:19,465 --> 00:32:22,224
(Yan Tuo, Lin Ling,
Ms. Lu, Mr. Changxi.)

454
00:32:22,385 --> 00:32:25,344
(We had hot pot together as family.)

455
00:32:25,585 --> 00:32:27,465
(And we saw a meteor shower.)

456
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,704
Family?

457
00:32:47,573 --> 00:32:48,293
No way.

458
00:32:48,573 --> 00:32:49,533
You're making a mess.

459
00:32:49,533 --> 00:32:50,172
You...

460
00:32:50,293 --> 00:32:51,652
Others can't get any then.

461
00:32:54,452 --> 00:32:55,652
You've put your whole face in.

462
00:32:56,952 --> 00:32:57,452
Hold on.

463
00:32:57,452 --> 00:32:58,452
Hold on.

464
00:33:01,452 --> 00:33:02,253
Wait.

465
00:33:08,732 --> 00:33:09,452
Hello.

466
00:33:10,492 --> 00:33:11,293
Where are you?

467
00:33:12,732 --> 00:33:14,932
I-I'm out meeting a client.

468
00:33:15,373 --> 00:33:16,293
Come back now.

469
00:33:19,813 --> 00:33:21,452
Today? But I...

470
00:33:22,373 --> 00:33:23,492
I haven't finished my work.

471
00:33:23,492 --> 00:33:24,492
How about tomorrow?

472
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:26,652
Is it urgent?

473
00:33:28,813 --> 00:33:29,932
I'll try my best

474
00:33:30,013 --> 00:33:31,412
to get back early.

475
00:33:31,732 --> 00:33:32,452
How early?

476
00:33:35,492 --> 00:33:36,773
If I can go back today,

477
00:33:36,773 --> 00:33:38,333
can we discuss something?

478
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:39,853
Talk when you're back.

479
00:33:39,853 --> 00:33:41,462
Wait, let's say...

480
00:33:42,201 --> 00:33:42,864
Hello.

481
00:33:43,536 --> 00:33:44,437
Hello?

482
00:33:47,088 --> 00:33:54,800
♪Farewell to the old times,
and scenes fade away one by one♪
