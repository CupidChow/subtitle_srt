It's fine.

20
00:02:47,671 --> 00:02:48,591
Don't misfire.

21
00:02:49,271 --> 00:02:50,032
It's for me?

Though it's a tranquilizer gun,

23
00:02:51,376 --> 00:02:52,472
it could knock you out

00:02:54,912 --> 00:02:56,032
I can only offer this help.

This is a treasure.

36
00:04:38,552 --> 00:04:39,151
Hello?

37
00:04:39,752 --> 00:04:40,952
Shen, what's your status?

38
00:04:41,552 --> 00:04:43,192
We just arrived. How about you?

39
00:04:43,831 --> 00:04:44,512
Positioned.

40
00:04:44,591 --> 00:04:45,872
Then let's proceed as planned.

41
00:04:45,872 --> 00:04:47,024
Mine closed in three days.

42
00:04:47,271 --> 00:04:47,831
Rest assured.

43
00:04:51,031 --> 00:04:52,432
Watch those Earth Fiends.

44
00:04:52,831 --> 00:04:55,552
Everything else is the same
as our regular patrols.

45
00:04:56,632 --> 00:04:57,552
The path is rough.

46
00:04:58,711 --> 00:04:59,591
Watch your step.

47
00:05:08,911 --> 00:05:09,632
Let's go.

48
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:11,512
Keep up.

49
00:05:13,192 --> 00:05:14,072
Everyone stay close.

50
00:05:14,351 --> 00:05:15,432
- Got it.
- Okay.

51
00:05:16,031 --> 00:05:16,831
- Stay close.
- Move.

52
00:05:16,872 --> 00:05:17,552
Let's go.

53
00:05:17,831 --> 00:05:18,432
Okay.

54
00:06:10,609 --> 00:06:11,568
Keep up.

55
00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:31,328
Landslide. It's completely blocked.

56
00:06:32,248 --> 00:06:33,688
Isn't there another route?

57
00:06:34,049 --> 00:06:35,289
For centuries,

58
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:36,049
the Hunters

59
00:06:36,049 --> 00:06:37,729
pioneered the patrol route.

60
00:06:38,128 --> 00:06:40,049
It hasn't been updated in ages.

61
00:06:42,328 --> 00:06:43,849
What about taking Village Four?

62
00:06:43,888 --> 00:06:46,248
Even Jiang might not
have taken that path.

63
00:06:46,248 --> 00:06:47,888
Let alone our generation.

64
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:49,008
We're not even sure

65
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:49,849
if that place exists.

66
00:06:50,649 --> 00:06:51,849
We can't just sit around.

67
00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:53,448
Maybe we should split up and search.

68
00:06:53,448 --> 00:06:55,808
No way. There are Earth Fiends
in the group.

69
00:06:55,808 --> 00:06:56,928
Splitting up is too risky.

70
00:06:57,568 --> 00:06:59,729
I think I can find the way
to Village Four.

71
00:07:02,888 --> 00:07:04,008
How would you know?

72
00:07:05,248 --> 00:07:06,049
Follow me.

73
00:07:10,849 --> 00:07:11,808
Everyone, keep up.

74
00:07:12,008 --> 00:07:13,128
- Okay.
- Okay.

75
00:07:16,489 --> 00:07:17,489
Stay close.

76
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,305
You actually found it.

77
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,625
Read ten thousand books,
walk ten thousand miles.

78
00:08:13,986 --> 00:08:15,346
The Hunters relocated eight times.

79
00:08:15,586 --> 00:08:16,666
The first was Qin Village.

80
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,106
It's right above the Golden Gate.

81
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:21,346
That's where we're camping this time.

82
00:08:22,825 --> 00:08:25,226
Village Four is another outpost.

83
00:08:25,602 --> 00:08:27,265
Founded about 400 years
after Qin Village.

84
00:08:29,265 --> 00:08:31,466
The current Nanshan Rescue base
is the best.

85
00:08:32,185 --> 00:08:34,825
It's discreet, convenient, and modern,

86
00:08:36,185 --> 00:08:38,185
with a rescue org as the cover.

87
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:39,586
Hiding in plain sight indeed.

88
00:08:41,586 --> 00:08:42,625
Someone was here lately.

89
00:08:49,385 --> 00:08:50,826
Have the team check the perimeter.

90
00:08:52,586 --> 00:08:53,425
Check ahead.

91
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,425
Could it be hikers?

92
00:08:56,425 --> 00:08:58,226
Or illegal loggers?

93
00:08:59,066 --> 00:08:59,785
Hard to say.

94
00:09:00,866 --> 00:09:01,905
This isn't a usual route.

95
00:09:02,025 --> 00:09:03,346
Patrols rarely come this way.

96
00:09:03,826 --> 00:09:04,946
We don't know this area.

97
00:09:04,946 --> 00:09:05,706
Better not linger.

98
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:07,625
So we're pushing to Qin Village tonight.

99
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:19,625
Take five here.

100
00:09:38,106 --> 00:09:39,787
Luo, have a bite first.

101
00:09:40,427 --> 00:09:41,866
Once we set up camp at Qin Village,

102
00:09:41,946 --> 00:09:42,986
we'll have a hot meal.

103
00:09:44,346 --> 00:09:45,946
Luo, look.

104
00:09:46,826 --> 00:09:49,627
Isn't this identical to the statue

105
00:09:49,787 --> 00:09:52,427
at the Temple of the Righteous Lord
you showed me?

106
00:09:54,187 --> 00:09:55,187
It is similar.

107
00:09:55,787 --> 00:09:56,787
But it's not surprising.

108
00:09:56,946 --> 00:09:57,586
This whole area

109
00:09:57,586 --> 00:09:59,066
is South Mountain Hunters' territory.

110
00:10:00,787 --> 00:10:01,507
I see.

111
00:10:07,586 --> 00:10:08,307
What's so funny?

112
00:10:09,147 --> 00:10:09,746
Nothing.

113
00:10:10,267 --> 00:10:13,267
Just remembered
how you used to be ice-cold

114
00:10:13,267 --> 00:10:14,027
and aloof.

115
00:10:14,507 --> 00:10:15,346
Keep your voice down.

116
00:10:16,106 --> 00:10:16,907
Let's go.

117
00:10:23,627 --> 00:10:24,706
Guo, keep watch on them.

118
00:10:25,226 --> 00:10:25,907
Got it.

119
00:10:58,027 --> 00:10:58,667
Guo.

120
00:11:01,907 --> 00:11:02,946
Canned beef.

121
00:11:06,387 --> 00:11:07,346
Had enough rest?

122
00:11:07,427 --> 00:11:08,226
Time to move on.

123
00:11:09,267 --> 00:11:10,187
Unfamiliar area ahead.

124
00:11:10,346 --> 00:11:12,027
I'll take a few buddies to scout ahead.

125
00:11:12,307 --> 00:11:13,907
Follow only after we confirm it's clear.

126
00:11:14,706 --> 00:11:15,346
Okay.

127
00:11:16,027 --> 00:11:17,226
I'll leave markers on the way.

128
00:11:17,267 --> 00:11:18,346
Just follow them.

129
00:11:20,986 --> 00:11:22,946
Qiang, Sun Li, pack your gear
and come with me.

130
00:11:23,106 --> 00:11:24,147
Let's go too.

131
00:11:24,147 --> 00:11:24,826
We may help.

132
00:12:32,307 --> 00:12:33,027
What's wrong?

133
00:12:34,466 --> 00:12:35,147
Nothing.

134
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:48,866
Qiang.

135
00:12:54,627 --> 00:12:57,346
Doesn't this path look familiar?

136
00:12:58,706 --> 00:13:00,706
Don't all mountain paths look alike?

137
00:13:01,267 --> 00:13:01,866
No.

138
00:13:02,466 --> 00:13:03,466
Something does feel off.

139
00:13:04,106 --> 00:13:05,106
What feels off?

140
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:07,106
Everything feels off here.

141
00:13:08,866 --> 00:13:09,547
Stay sharp.

142
00:13:12,706 --> 00:13:13,387
Stay sharp.

143
00:13:26,946 --> 00:13:28,986
What do you think their lair looks like?

144
00:13:30,547 --> 00:13:32,267
Exactly like in the drawings.

145
00:13:42,147 --> 00:13:43,187
Are you talking to it?

146
00:13:46,307 --> 00:13:51,387
What do you think the birds,
beasts, and plants here

147
00:13:51,986 --> 00:13:53,066
see us as?

148
00:13:55,907 --> 00:13:56,706
As trespassers.

149
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,307
And the Earth Fiends?

150
00:14:09,106 --> 00:14:11,187
You're not trying
to understand them, are you?

151
00:14:13,387 --> 00:14:14,787
Understanding them isn't hard.

152
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:19,147
In this world, problems
far trickier than Earth Fiends

153
00:14:20,267 --> 00:14:20,986
are way too many.

154
00:14:21,746 --> 00:14:23,106
Let's deal with them

155
00:14:24,187 --> 00:14:25,466
before facing new problems.

156
00:14:27,226 --> 00:14:29,787
Yes. Every barrier seems insurmountable
until we break through.

157
00:14:43,387 --> 00:14:44,187
Scared?

158
00:14:45,106 --> 00:14:46,466
Don't treat me like a child.

159
00:14:48,427 --> 00:14:50,706
Something's fishy. Stay alert.

160
00:14:52,507 --> 00:14:53,187
What's that?

161
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:56,986
Could you stop jumping at shadows?

162
00:14:58,346 --> 00:14:59,547
What else could it be?

163
00:15:00,027 --> 00:15:01,187
Wraith fire or something?

164
00:15:02,387 --> 00:15:03,826
Who'd make a fire out here?

165
00:15:05,187 --> 00:15:05,826
Stay alert.

166
00:15:48,066 --> 00:15:49,027
I almost forgot.

167
00:15:49,986 --> 00:15:52,267
Mad Dog's nose is extremely valuable.

168
00:16:00,986 --> 00:16:02,267
Not your first time here, right?

169
00:16:06,346 --> 00:16:07,307
Do you know

170
00:16:07,907 --> 00:16:10,586
why in every social animal group,

171
00:16:12,147 --> 00:16:13,946
there are always those
who leave the pack

172
00:16:14,706 --> 00:16:16,027
to live solitary lives?

173
00:16:17,187 --> 00:16:18,627
Where they go

174
00:16:19,986 --> 00:16:21,147
is actually determined

175
00:16:21,907 --> 00:16:23,307
by Earth's magnetic field.

176
00:16:24,946 --> 00:16:25,986
Being solitary

177
00:16:26,907 --> 00:16:28,907
isn't necessarily about being eccentric

178
00:16:29,627 --> 00:16:30,866
but because

179
00:16:31,346 --> 00:16:33,147
they resonate at a different frequency.

180
00:16:33,627 --> 00:16:34,307
But...

181
00:16:36,346 --> 00:16:37,706
going your own way

182
00:16:38,907 --> 00:16:40,586
often leads to dead ends.

183
00:16:50,547 --> 00:16:52,187
- What's that sound?
- Something happened.

184
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:56,547
Something happened.

185
00:16:56,706 --> 00:16:57,907
Wake up. Stop sleeping.

186
00:16:58,746 --> 00:16:59,507
It's us.

187
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:01,667
Why are you coming from there?

188
00:17:01,746 --> 00:17:02,547
What happened?

189
00:17:02,547 --> 00:17:03,427
What's going on?

190
00:17:03,627 --> 00:17:04,387
Why are they back?

191
00:17:04,427 --> 00:17:05,627
Yeah, why this direction?

192
00:17:11,586 --> 00:17:12,307
You...

193
00:17:14,106 --> 00:17:14,946
We walked in circles.

194
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:18,627
Walked in circles?

195
00:17:20,466 --> 00:17:21,986
So you couldn't find the way out

196
00:17:21,986 --> 00:17:23,026
and circled again.

197
00:17:23,026 --> 00:17:24,187
Could it be

198
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:25,907
a trap

199
00:17:26,387 --> 00:17:27,506
set by the ancestors

200
00:17:27,506 --> 00:17:28,786
of the South Mountain Hunters?

201
00:17:29,067 --> 00:17:29,907
Why?

202
00:17:30,147 --> 00:17:32,266
This was South Mountain Hunters'
territory.

203
00:17:32,587 --> 00:17:34,667
It's totally normal
that they'd set a trap

204
00:17:34,907 --> 00:17:36,587
against outsiders
or Earth Fiends, right?

205
00:17:37,746 --> 00:17:40,306
But why trap their own people?

206
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:42,746
Maybe they never expected so many

207
00:17:42,746 --> 00:17:44,466
of their own to spring the trap.

208
00:17:44,506 --> 00:17:45,107
Right?

209
00:17:53,266 --> 00:17:54,946
Mad Dog leads the charge,

210
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:57,266
Mad Blade sits in the central tent,

211
00:17:58,067 --> 00:17:59,786
and Ghost Whip cracks his glowing whip.

212
00:18:03,347 --> 00:18:04,746
If we map this village's layout

213
00:18:04,746 --> 00:18:06,706
to the South Mountain Hunters'
formation,

214
00:18:11,026 --> 00:18:12,667
that hillside ahead

215
00:18:13,347 --> 00:18:14,506
represents Mad Dog.

216
00:18:25,306 --> 00:18:27,026
And that moonlit tree

217
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:28,546
stands for Ghost Whip.

218
00:18:34,187 --> 00:18:37,187
Then this statue must be Mad Blade.

219
00:19:18,705 --> 00:19:19,786
Interesting.

220
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:49,345
Got it.

221
00:19:53,385 --> 00:19:54,226
It's a bronze mirror.

222
00:19:55,345 --> 00:19:56,186
Here's another one.

223
00:20:03,825 --> 00:20:04,825
They each found one.

224
00:20:05,186 --> 00:20:06,506
Seems my guess was correct.

225
00:20:21,105 --> 00:20:22,105
Is it possible

226
00:20:22,226 --> 00:20:24,746
that the mechanism
isn't on the statue at all?

227
00:21:10,097 --> 00:21:11,736
I-It's also the Mad Blade?

228
00:22:18,961 --> 00:22:20,600
That should be the right path.

229
00:22:30,353 --> 00:22:31,314
Enough rest.

230
00:22:31,673 --> 00:22:33,433
Pack up and head out.

231
00:22:45,137 --> 00:22:46,695
Full moon tonight. Gorgeous.

232
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,192
Shame we can't stay.

233
00:22:59,984 --> 00:23:00,738
Not bad at all.

234
00:23:14,225 --> 00:23:14,904
Let's go.

235
00:23:16,025 --> 00:23:16,624
Let's go.

236
00:23:18,785 --> 00:23:19,424
Keep up.

237
00:23:19,424 --> 00:23:20,184
Stay close.

238
00:23:20,184 --> 00:23:20,825
Hurry.

239
00:23:22,944 --> 00:23:23,505
Let's go.

240
00:23:24,104 --> 00:23:24,664
Hurry up.

241
00:23:28,585 --> 00:23:29,745
Hurry up.

242
00:23:31,585 --> 00:23:32,144
Hurry up.

243
00:23:35,985 --> 00:23:36,904
Be careful.

244
00:23:38,985 --> 00:23:39,864
Mind your step.

245
00:24:00,177 --> 00:24:01,137
Mind your step.

246
00:24:09,816 --> 00:24:10,377
Careful.

247
00:25:05,809 --> 00:25:06,408
Hurry.

248
00:25:27,057 --> 00:25:28,458
We're finally out.

249
00:25:31,618 --> 00:25:33,817
Now I see why the patrol route before

250
00:25:34,218 --> 00:25:35,497
avoided Village Four.

251
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:37,497
Push a little harder.

252
00:25:37,978 --> 00:25:39,738
Let's make up for lost time.

253
00:25:42,378 --> 00:25:42,938
Are you okay?

254
00:25:44,378 --> 00:25:45,218
- Let's go.
- Okay.

255
00:25:46,418 --> 00:25:47,658
- Let's go.
- Hurry.

256
00:25:49,497 --> 00:25:50,898
Qin Village is within the mountain.

257
00:25:51,057 --> 00:25:51,978
It's not too far now.

258
00:25:52,297 --> 00:25:52,938
Let's go.

259
00:26:16,337 --> 00:26:17,178
Let's camp here.

260
00:26:17,178 --> 00:26:18,057
- Okay
- Okay.

261
00:26:20,978 --> 00:26:22,017
Set up camp here.

262
00:26:23,378 --> 00:26:24,218
Gate opens tomorrow.

263
00:26:24,738 --> 00:26:25,537
- Okay.
- Okay.

264
00:26:26,097 --> 00:26:26,898
How about here?

265
00:26:27,097 --> 00:26:27,817
Is the spot okay?

266
00:26:27,817 --> 00:26:28,577
- Yes.
- Yes.

267
00:26:28,577 --> 00:26:29,337
Alright.

268
00:26:29,378 --> 00:26:30,458
Too many vegetables.

269
00:26:39,138 --> 00:26:40,537
Take all of them to the back.

270
00:26:40,817 --> 00:26:43,178
You've kept saying 'Qin Village.'

271
00:26:43,178 --> 00:26:44,857
I thought it was an actual village.

272
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:47,898
Back when the Golden Gate
was first built,

273
00:26:48,297 --> 00:26:50,418
the Blade, Hound, and Whip clans
each left one family

274
00:26:50,577 --> 00:26:51,537
to guard this place.

275
00:26:52,698 --> 00:26:54,698
They lived off the mountain
and were isolated.

276
00:26:55,938 --> 00:26:57,218
They didn't patrol.

277
00:26:57,418 --> 00:26:58,658
They guarded here for life.

278
00:26:59,497 --> 00:27:01,017
Probably to make this isolated place

279
00:27:01,017 --> 00:27:01,978
feel more like home,

280
00:27:01,978 --> 00:27:03,698
they gave it this homely name.

281
00:27:04,057 --> 00:27:04,777
No wonder.

282
00:27:09,178 --> 00:27:10,698
Are you hungry? Want to eat something?

283
00:27:11,618 --> 00:27:12,817
You know what I want?

284
00:27:12,817 --> 00:27:14,297
Of course. Give me your backpack.

285
00:27:14,658 --> 00:27:15,537
Be careful.

286
00:27:23,138 --> 00:27:25,138
You carry the Hunters' hopes

287
00:27:25,257 --> 00:27:27,097
and uphold the Blade Clan's mission.

288
00:27:27,097 --> 00:27:28,017
Meanwhile,

289
00:27:28,458 --> 00:27:29,857
you've still found time to date.

290
00:27:31,178 --> 00:27:33,418
The Mad Blade
truly is a one-in-a-million genius.

291
00:27:33,497 --> 00:27:34,378
I'm impressed.

292
00:27:35,978 --> 00:27:37,497
Who knows if we'll make it back up

293
00:27:37,577 --> 00:27:38,857
once we go down?

294
00:27:39,497 --> 00:27:41,497
So you're living in the moment.

295
00:27:43,297 --> 00:27:44,817
I assume you're nervous

296
00:27:44,817 --> 00:27:46,178
and need some cheering up.

297
00:27:47,537 --> 00:27:48,698
Then I'll get serious.

298
00:27:51,497 --> 00:27:52,857
If I'm not mistaken,

299
00:27:53,178 --> 00:27:55,337
Xing Shen must have been
to Village Four before.

300
00:27:56,378 --> 00:27:58,017
As for what he went there for,

301
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:00,938
maybe only you can get him
to talk about it.

302
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:05,986
I don't want to know now.

303
00:28:07,536 --> 00:28:08,874
Do you still trust him?

304
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:11,634
Hard to admit,

305
00:28:11,634 --> 00:28:14,218
but his faith and loyalty
to the South Mountain Hunters

306
00:28:14,218 --> 00:28:15,610
outshines us all.

307
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,153
So as the leader,
he's earned everyone's trust.

308
00:28:19,153 --> 00:28:21,254
If I doubt him,

309
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,612
I'm going against the whole group.

310
00:28:24,688 --> 00:28:26,026
Sounds like

311
00:28:26,026 --> 00:28:27,666
you're forcing yourself to say it.

312
00:28:29,392 --> 00:28:30,800
Sounds like you're here

313
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,785
for a definitive answer
and nothing less, right?

314
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,096
Not exactly.

315
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:37,019
But I do need something from you.

316
00:29:03,953 --> 00:29:05,585
Xing Shen and I will each lead teams

317
00:29:05,585 --> 00:29:07,121
through the Golden Gate in sequence.

318
00:29:07,121 --> 00:29:08,800
We can back each other up for safety.

319
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:09,760
Okay.

320
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,001
The Hound Clan charges first,
with Xing Shen leading.

321
00:29:14,001 --> 00:29:15,409
Mad Blade sits in the central tent.

322
00:29:15,409 --> 00:29:16,681
You're with me for rear guard.

323
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,840
No problem.

324
00:29:25,232 --> 00:29:27,217
You're going home soon.

325
00:29:27,217 --> 00:29:28,742
How does that feel?

326
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,231
When Lin Xirou comes,

327
00:29:38,833 --> 00:29:41,009
all of you will die.

328
00:29:44,864 --> 00:29:46,064
Told you.

329
00:29:46,416 --> 00:29:47,953
Watch them hardest

330
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:49,291
when home's in sight.

331
00:29:49,968 --> 00:29:51,441
Once we enter the Twilight Chasm,

332
00:29:51,441 --> 00:29:52,725
there's no room for your games.

333
00:29:56,262 --> 00:29:57,264
Put it on yourselves.

334
00:29:57,264 --> 00:29:58,353
It's for your own good.

335
00:30:08,923 --> 00:30:09,862
Mad Blade's blood.

336
00:30:10,416 --> 00:30:12,031
Act up and you get a shot.

337
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,343
Fewer problems for us.

338
00:31:12,497 --> 00:31:13,657
Here, try this.

339
00:31:24,177 --> 00:31:25,098
It's the right taste.

340
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:27,457
I just saw you draw blood.

341
00:31:27,457 --> 00:31:28,618
Eat more. There's plenty.

342
00:31:34,457 --> 00:31:35,818
What did Yu Rong say to you?

343
00:31:43,417 --> 00:31:45,898
The plans for entering
the Golden Gate tomorrow.

344
00:31:48,457 --> 00:31:50,538
How's it going? Everything ready?

345
00:31:52,177 --> 00:31:53,138
Strangely,

346
00:31:54,177 --> 00:31:55,898
we're at the Golden Gate's entrance,

347
00:31:56,098 --> 00:31:57,298
but I'm not nervous at all.

348
00:31:57,977 --> 00:31:59,257
What's strange about that?

349
00:31:59,737 --> 00:32:01,737
That reason's perfectly sound.

350
00:32:02,497 --> 00:32:03,177
Why?

351
00:32:04,058 --> 00:32:04,737
Look.

352
00:32:04,898 --> 00:32:05,657
First,

353
00:32:05,937 --> 00:32:07,417
you're always mentally tough,

354
00:32:07,657 --> 00:32:09,417
staying calm and composed in any crisis.

355
00:32:10,697 --> 00:32:11,538
Second,

356
00:32:11,737 --> 00:32:12,898
with so many Hunters here

357
00:32:13,177 --> 00:32:14,338
working together,

358
00:32:14,937 --> 00:32:16,538
we've made thorough preparations.

359
00:32:17,858 --> 00:32:18,737
Third,

360
00:32:19,217 --> 00:32:20,657
and most importantly,

361
00:32:21,457 --> 00:32:22,858
I've been right here with you.

362
00:32:23,977 --> 00:32:25,378
You should feel reassured.

363
00:32:34,697 --> 00:32:35,898
Hope you're right,

364
00:32:35,977 --> 00:32:37,378
and good things ahead.

365
00:32:37,417 --> 00:32:38,177
Of course.

366
00:32:39,217 --> 00:32:40,497
Come on. Cheers.

367
00:32:41,538 --> 00:32:42,778
Good things ahead.

368
00:32:43,578 --> 00:32:44,257
Cheers.

369
00:32:46,417 --> 00:32:47,177
Eat more.

370
00:33:30,058 --> 00:33:30,657
Don't go.

371
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:37,417
Yan Tuo. Yan Tuo, help me.

372
00:33:44,098 --> 00:33:44,618
Luo?

373
00:33:45,017 --> 00:33:45,657
Luo?

374
00:33:45,937 --> 00:33:47,177
Luo, wake up. Wake up.

375
00:33:47,618 --> 00:33:49,177
It's okay. I'm here.

376
00:33:49,257 --> 00:33:49,858
It's me.

377
00:33:50,217 --> 00:33:51,017
It's me.

378
00:34:13,457 --> 00:34:14,177
I'm here.

379
00:36:08,778 --> 00:36:09,937
Know what that is?

380
00:36:15,378 --> 00:36:16,697
It looks...

381
00:36:17,378 --> 00:36:19,058
It looks like a star chart.

382
00:36:20,058 --> 00:36:21,417
You know quite a bit.

383
00:36:22,578 --> 00:36:24,578
I've been quite close

384
00:36:24,578 --> 00:36:25,578
with a sculptor.

385
00:36:25,578 --> 00:36:26,497
She knows more.

386
00:36:26,538 --> 00:36:28,657
About traditional stone carving
and sculpture,

387
00:36:28,657 --> 00:36:29,818
she has taught me a lot.

388
00:36:30,578 --> 00:36:32,618
The oldest excavated star chart
recognized today

389
00:36:32,618 --> 00:36:33,898
sits in an overseas museum,

390
00:36:33,937 --> 00:36:35,618
swindled from us by foreigners.

391
00:36:35,937 --> 00:36:37,737
Drawn twelve hundred years ago,
they say.

392
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:39,858
But the South Mountain Hunters'
stone star chart,

393
00:36:40,058 --> 00:36:40,898
which is that one,

394
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:42,497
has existed for over two thousand years.

395
00:36:48,737 --> 00:36:50,298
Then how do we get down?

396
00:36:51,618 --> 00:36:52,497
Well...

397
00:36:53,657 --> 00:36:55,017
Stop looking. Over there.

398
00:36:55,417 --> 00:36:56,818
Climb down along the star chart.

399
00:36:57,618 --> 00:36:58,618
By stepping on this?

400
00:36:59,298 --> 00:37:00,858
In the past, we had to climb down.

401
00:37:00,858 --> 00:37:02,138
But it's a new era now.

402
00:37:02,138 --> 00:37:02,858
We have a lift.

403
00:37:02,858 --> 00:37:03,618
Right.

404
00:37:03,937 --> 00:37:05,017
Ask for help if needed.

405
00:37:05,058 --> 00:37:06,098
Don't trick the silly guy.

406
00:37:07,378 --> 00:37:08,657
Who are you calling silly?

407
00:37:09,618 --> 00:37:10,457
Get to work.

408
00:37:12,178 --> 00:37:12,722
I'll do it.
