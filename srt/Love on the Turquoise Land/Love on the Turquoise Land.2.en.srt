Hurry!

18
00:03:15,369 --> 00:03:16,168
Let's go.

19
00:03:16,689 --> 00:03:17,488
Stop her!

20
00:03:36,529 --> 00:03:37,328
This way!

21
00:03:37,768 --> 00:03:39,009
- Go!
- This way!

22
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:39,809
Is everyone here?

23
00:03:40,529 --> 00:03:41,328
No one missing?

24
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:42,289
Stop her!

25
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:43,648
Stop her!

26
00:03:44,048 --> 00:03:44,849
No one's missing.

27
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:45,648
Be careful.

28
00:03:45,648 --> 00:03:46,448
Go! This way.

29
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:47,249
Hurry!

30
00:03:50,369 --> 00:03:50,928
Xiong.

31
00:03:51,048 --> 00:03:51,768
Why are you here?

32
00:03:51,768 --> 00:03:52,529
Locked the car?

33
00:03:52,529 --> 00:03:53,888
The fire alarm. I came to check.

34
00:03:53,888 --> 00:03:54,809
Stay with Gou Ya.

35
00:04:08,608 --> 00:04:09,328
Move!

36
00:04:10,768 --> 00:04:11,768
Move!

37
00:04:12,809 --> 00:04:13,809
Watch your step!

38
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,208
I'm coming out now.

39
00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:18,848
Go! Let's move.

40
00:04:19,528 --> 00:04:20,249
A few more floors.

41
00:04:20,249 --> 00:04:21,009
Don't panic.

42
00:04:31,768 --> 00:04:32,489
Sun Zhou.

43
00:08:13,848 --> 00:08:14,528
Ms. Lin.

44
00:08:14,848 --> 00:08:15,528
Have a seat.

45
00:08:55,808 --> 00:08:56,969
Have no appetite?

46
00:08:59,528 --> 00:09:01,048
I ate late at noon.

47
00:09:01,449 --> 00:09:02,688
Not hungry yet.

48
00:09:04,408 --> 00:09:06,168
You need to eat properly.

49
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:10,528
Slim figures aren't trendy anymore.

50
00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:15,209
Guys prefer some curves now.

51
00:09:27,369 --> 00:09:28,168
Ms. Lin.

52
00:09:29,329 --> 00:09:29,888
I...

53
00:09:30,489 --> 00:09:31,768
I'm really not hungry.

54
00:10:37,408 --> 00:10:39,209
Ms. Lin, Gou Ya messed up.

55
00:11:09,048 --> 00:11:09,849
Are you sure?

56
00:11:11,009 --> 00:11:13,329
The woman had a fresh wound on her hand.

57
00:11:13,528 --> 00:11:14,888
Gou Ya just broke free recently,

58
00:11:14,969 --> 00:11:16,369
couldn't resist the blood scent,

59
00:11:16,648 --> 00:11:17,528
then went wild.

60
00:11:17,688 --> 00:11:18,568
What now?

61
00:11:18,729 --> 00:11:19,768
He's under control now.

62
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:21,928
How could it be?

63
00:11:28,329 --> 00:11:31,129
Trained? A South Mountain Hunter?

64
00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:32,648
Too dark to see clearly.

65
00:11:33,288 --> 00:11:34,449
Definitely a woman though.

66
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,849
I failed to watch over Gou Ya.
Sorry to trouble you.

67
00:11:40,168 --> 00:11:42,249
We barely managed to place
his blood bag's descendant

68
00:11:42,249 --> 00:11:43,768
to the welfare house.

69
00:11:45,209 --> 00:11:47,048
So you mean...

70
00:11:48,528 --> 00:11:49,688
Bring him back first.

71
00:11:50,288 --> 00:11:50,849
Understood.

72
00:11:53,768 --> 00:11:54,329
And

73
00:11:55,489 --> 00:11:57,168
Yan Tuo was there during the incident.

74
00:11:58,168 --> 00:11:59,048
Tuo?

75
00:12:00,249 --> 00:12:01,249
Not his fault.

76
00:12:01,928 --> 00:12:02,928
I was careless.

77
00:12:03,168 --> 00:12:05,249
I'll tell you details when I return.

78
00:12:05,609 --> 00:12:06,329
No.

79
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:08,209
I'll come apologize.

Tuo.

88
00:13:24,928 --> 00:13:27,688
There's something I need to remind you.

89
00:13:29,048 --> 00:13:32,209
Our Roadsound Group has grown this big

90
00:13:32,609 --> 00:13:33,768
with many competitors.

91
00:13:33,928 --> 00:13:35,729
Some compete fairly,

92
00:13:36,209 --> 00:13:38,048
while others play dirty.

93
00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:40,408
The business world is competitive.

94
00:13:41,329 --> 00:13:43,209
I don't hide things from you on purpose.

95
00:13:43,729 --> 00:13:45,489
It's to protect you better.

96
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:49,048
Can you understand, Tuo?

97
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:50,688
I understand.

98
00:13:51,249 --> 00:13:53,528
But Ms. Lin, I'm not a kid anymore.

99
00:13:53,688 --> 00:13:54,168
I...

100
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:55,849
Xiong Hei has matters to attend to.

101
00:13:56,329 --> 00:13:57,969
Bring Gou Ya back first.

102
00:14:02,048 --> 00:14:03,369
What about the client?

103
00:14:07,729 --> 00:14:09,489
Okay. I'm heading back.

104
00:14:10,768 --> 00:14:11,808
Drive safely.

105
00:14:21,888 --> 00:14:22,489
Xiong.

Mr. Crip, only four years apart.

119
00:15:59,849 --> 00:16:00,969
Got dementia already?

120
00:16:01,408 --> 00:16:03,009
Get the treatment soon.

121
00:16:04,408 --> 00:16:06,288
Can you add me into

122

After all, starting today,

124

I'm one of the hunters.

125
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:12,808
Why pull on such a trick?

126
00:16:13,209 --> 00:16:14,928
Even I couldn't figure it out.

127
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:16,849
Can't even handle such a simple task?

128
00:16:17,129 --> 00:16:18,168
What's wrong with you?

129
00:16:18,168 --> 00:16:19,609
Are you a fool?

130
00:16:19,768 --> 00:16:20,729
Send it again.

131
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:22,888
What did you say?

132
00:16:24,288 --> 00:16:25,849
Nothing.

133
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:28,729
Jiang.

134
00:16:29,528 --> 00:16:32,168
That Mad Blade you trained
is finally showing up.

135
00:16:36,768 --> 00:16:37,888
Just backup support.

136
00:16:43,288 --> 00:16:44,329
Not going on patrol.

137
00:16:45,729 --> 00:16:47,808

Where were we?

143
00:17:02,528 --> 00:17:03,249
I forgot.

144
00:17:04,288 --> 00:17:05,528
Can I start over?

145
00:17:20,328 --> 00:17:21,009
Go ahead.

146
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:27,048

149
00:17:32,409 --> 00:17:34,048
to take on the patrol mission.

150
00:17:34,088 --> 00:17:35,209
Just call me Shorty.

151
00:17:35,409 --> 00:17:37,249
Actually, I'm familiar

152
00:17:37,249 --> 00:17:38,288
with you all here.

153
00:17:38,368 --> 00:17:39,288
Enough of that.

154
00:17:39,288 --> 00:17:40,768
Just do what you're told.

155
00:17:43,889 --> 00:17:44,449
Hello.

156
00:17:44,568 --> 00:17:45,848
Hello, what's going on?

157
00:17:47,249 --> 00:17:47,929
You know it?

158
00:17:48,328 --> 00:17:49,288
Something happened.

159
00:17:49,288 --> 00:17:50,889
But I don't know what it is.

160
00:17:51,328 --> 00:17:52,729
A long story. We'll talk later.

161
00:17:54,128 --> 00:17:55,128
Have you been exposed?

162
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:56,209
Probably not.

163
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,209
Alright.

164
00:17:59,489 --> 00:18:00,528
Be careful then.

165
00:18:01,328 --> 00:18:02,249
Keep in touch.

166
00:18:02,489 --> 00:18:03,288
You too.

167
00:18:17,209 --> 00:18:18,169
The three clans.

168
00:18:18,449 --> 00:18:20,128
Blade, Hound, and Whip.

169
00:18:20,368 --> 00:18:22,608
We Hound Clan have the most members.

170
00:18:22,889 --> 00:18:24,608
We handle search and assault.

171
00:18:24,969 --> 00:18:26,808
The Whip Clan uses their whips

172
00:18:26,929 --> 00:18:28,409
to herd and tame.

173
00:18:29,128 --> 00:18:30,169
The Blade Clan is special.

174
00:18:30,649 --> 00:18:32,409
They deliver the critical strikes.

175
00:18:34,368 --> 00:18:35,768
Speaking of the Hound Clan,

176
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:36,889
we must mention

177
00:18:36,889 --> 00:18:38,808
the leader of South Mountain Hunters,

178
00:18:38,808 --> 00:18:39,489
Jiang.

179
00:18:40,368 --> 00:18:42,209
My father mentions his name

180
00:18:42,409 --> 00:18:43,568
more than my mom's.

181
00:18:44,929 --> 00:18:45,489
Wait, no.

182
00:18:45,568 --> 00:18:49,088
Mad Dog leads the charge,
Mad Blade stays in command,

183
00:18:49,768 --> 00:18:51,808
and Ghost Whip cracks a glowing whip.

184
00:18:53,088 --> 00:18:55,528
But not just Mad Blade,

185
00:18:55,729 --> 00:18:57,328
Mad Dog and Ghost Whip are also absent.

186
00:18:58,848 --> 00:19:00,608
Ghost Whip is overseas,

187
00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:02,328
not joining this patrol.

188
00:19:03,449 --> 00:19:05,848
But if needed,

189
00:19:06,889 --> 00:19:08,288
he'll come immediately.

190
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:10,368
Mad Dog lives here.

191
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,489
He's kind of eccentric.

192
00:19:13,328 --> 00:19:14,249
I'll fetch him later.

193
00:19:15,249 --> 00:19:17,489
Others will arrive shortly.

194
00:19:19,808 --> 00:19:20,568
Jiang.

195
00:19:22,489 --> 00:19:23,768
Maybe call it off.

196
00:19:24,889 --> 00:19:27,169
We don't share the same mind,
and can't gather everyone.

197
00:19:28,128 --> 00:19:29,969
I'll go ask Big Head.

198
00:19:31,808 --> 00:19:33,768
Exactly! I forgot someone.

199
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:35,368
The watchdog Big Head,

200
00:19:35,568 --> 00:19:37,568
the captain of this rescue center.

201
00:19:37,729 --> 00:19:39,009
Guests are here already,

202
00:19:39,009 --> 00:19:39,848
why is he...

203
00:19:42,528 --> 00:19:43,528
Guests?

204
00:19:45,689 --> 00:19:46,768
In here,

205
00:19:47,328 --> 00:19:48,368
we're all family.

206
00:19:54,704 --> 00:20:00,400
(Nanshan Rescue)

207
00:20:29,009 --> 00:20:29,608
Hello.

208
00:20:31,409 --> 00:20:32,288
Done yet?

209
00:20:34,969 --> 00:20:35,528
No.

210
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:38,009
Read Mad Blade's message?

211
00:20:39,128 --> 00:20:39,848
Yes.

212
00:20:41,128 --> 00:20:42,768
Yan A96331.

213
00:20:43,608 --> 00:20:44,288
What model?

214
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,048
Not sure.

215
00:20:45,768 --> 00:20:47,249
No follow-up message.

216
00:20:47,768 --> 00:20:49,409
Newbies can't be trusted.

217
00:20:49,768 --> 00:20:51,169
Old-timers are aged.

218
00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:53,889
Key members aren't all here.

219
00:20:54,808 --> 00:20:56,048
You hurry up.

220
00:20:57,808 --> 00:20:58,449
Wrap it up...

221
00:20:58,449 --> 00:20:58,969
Wait.

222
00:20:59,568 --> 00:21:00,288
What's wrong?

223
00:21:04,752 --> 00:21:05,296
(Stop)

224
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,712
(Do Not Enter)

225
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:19,856
(Yan A96331)

226
00:21:27,889 --> 00:21:28,528
Okay.

227
00:21:35,929 --> 00:21:37,729
What's going on here?

228
00:21:39,209 --> 00:21:40,009
Where are you going?

229
00:21:40,288 --> 00:21:41,088
Heading to the city.

230
00:21:44,048 --> 00:21:44,808
Can't go through.

231
00:21:45,449 --> 00:21:46,088
Why?

232
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:47,808
There's a landslide.

233
00:21:48,528 --> 00:21:49,969
See the rocks on the ground?

234
00:21:50,528 --> 00:21:52,729
Just got word.
The situation ahead is worse.

235
00:21:53,009 --> 00:21:53,848
Roads are all closed.

236
00:21:54,768 --> 00:21:56,689
S-Should I turn back or...

237
00:21:56,689 --> 00:21:58,449
No need. Just follow me.

238
00:22:01,209 --> 00:22:03,209
I'm changing shifts.
I'll lead you the way.

239
00:22:05,328 --> 00:22:06,249
Behind this mountain

240
00:22:06,249 --> 00:22:08,489
there's an internal road
for our rescue team.

241
00:22:09,128 --> 00:22:10,288
Your GPS won't show it.

242
00:22:11,048 --> 00:22:12,649
The road is rough but shorter.

243
00:22:13,088 --> 00:22:14,088
Bypass this section,

244
00:22:14,568 --> 00:22:16,048
turn west and you'll see the highway.

245
00:22:19,528 --> 00:22:21,048
Alright. Thank you then.

246
00:22:21,969 --> 00:22:22,848
Follow me.

247
00:22:22,848 --> 00:22:23,568
Got it.

248
00:23:13,969 --> 00:23:16,169
Stop wasting time here!

249
00:23:16,169 --> 00:23:17,288
Listen to me.

250
00:23:17,288 --> 00:23:18,489
We're already handling it.

251
00:23:18,489 --> 00:23:19,288
(Binhai Grand Hotel)
We...

252
00:23:19,288 --> 00:23:20,088
No more excuses.

253
00:23:20,128 --> 00:23:22,568
What's the use of all that talk?
Does it help?

254
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:23,328
Well, listen.

255
00:23:23,328 --> 00:23:24,929
Let's hear me out. Everyone...

256
00:23:25,409 --> 00:23:26,528
Alright, how about this?

257
00:23:26,528 --> 00:23:27,328
We'll compensate.

258
00:23:27,729 --> 00:23:29,449
- Who's in Room 302?
- No more excuses.

259
00:23:29,768 --> 00:23:31,409
Please wait a moment.

260
00:23:31,562 --> 00:23:33,528
- I was here first. Get in line.
- Who are you?

261
00:23:33,528 --> 00:23:34,568
I'll compensate you.

262
00:23:34,568 --> 00:23:35,689
I'll compensate you.

263
00:23:36,048 --> 00:23:36,768
Well, what's...

264
00:23:36,768 --> 00:23:37,969
Well, what's the matter?

265
00:23:39,889 --> 00:23:41,848
Tell me who's in Room 302.

266
00:23:42,368 --> 00:23:43,649
Sir, here's the thing.

267
00:23:43,969 --> 00:23:45,729
Our hotel regulations

268
00:23:46,288 --> 00:23:48,768
prohibit disclosing guest information.

269
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:51,209
It's about privacy.

270
00:23:52,249 --> 00:23:54,449
Your hand should get...

271
00:23:57,528 --> 00:24:00,169
Tell me who's in Room 302.

272
00:24:00,249 --> 00:24:01,729
And give me surveillance footage

273
00:24:01,729 --> 00:24:03,649
of the lobby
and the third-floor stairway.

274
00:24:03,729 --> 00:24:04,209
Stop it.

275
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:05,848
Give me the surveillance footage.

276
00:24:05,848 --> 00:24:06,528
Stop!

277
00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:08,929
Heard me? Give it to me.

278
00:24:09,649 --> 00:24:10,649
Don't cause trouble here.

279
00:24:11,848 --> 00:24:12,689
Stop causing trouble.

280
00:24:15,009 --> 00:24:15,889
You can't leave.

281
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,009
You can't leave.

282
00:24:18,088 --> 00:24:19,288
Think you can get away?

283
00:24:20,768 --> 00:24:21,328
You hit him.

284
00:24:23,288 --> 00:24:24,128
What's going on?

285
00:24:27,009 --> 00:24:28,568
Y-You finally came.

286
00:24:28,568 --> 00:24:29,328
You finally came.

287
00:24:29,929 --> 00:24:30,649
He hit us.

288
00:24:31,368 --> 00:24:32,608
Look at my injuries.

289
00:24:33,449 --> 00:24:34,449
Are you the manager?

290
00:24:34,768 --> 00:24:35,288
I am.

291
00:24:36,969 --> 00:24:37,608
He hit me.

292
00:25:01,424 --> 00:25:03,792
(I smell)

293
00:25:15,449 --> 00:25:16,848
(Burn After Reading: I smell the Fiend.)

294
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,063
(New Message)

295
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,521
(Burn After Reading: I smell the Fiend.)

296
00:25:25,489 --> 00:25:27,409
(Burn After Reading: I smell the Fiend.)

297
00:26:03,568 --> 00:26:05,608
Hello, Xicang Traffic
Information Center.

298
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:06,368
Hi.

299
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:07,288
May I ask

300
00:26:07,768 --> 00:26:09,209
Jingyun Road is currently closed?

301
00:26:09,209 --> 00:26:10,048
Is there an accident?

302
00:26:10,409 --> 00:26:11,048
Jingyun Road?

303
00:26:11,048 --> 00:26:12,368
Yes, it's in Fenglai District.

304
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,169
I saw road rescue crews

305
00:26:14,409 --> 00:26:15,649
mentioning a landslide.

306
00:26:16,088 --> 00:26:17,729
There was indeed a landslide earlier,

307
00:26:17,848 --> 00:26:19,848
but we haven't received
road closure updates.

308
00:26:19,848 --> 00:26:20,649
So it's not closed?

309
00:26:20,729 --> 00:26:21,249
Correct.

310
00:26:21,249 --> 00:26:23,449
Debris should've been cleared already.

311
00:26:23,449 --> 00:26:25,009
So it's passable now, right?

312
00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:26,048
Currently, yes.

313
00:26:26,889 --> 00:26:27,848
I see. Thank you.

314
00:26:27,969 --> 00:26:28,568
You're welcome.

315
00:26:28,848 --> 00:26:29,848
Is there anything else...

316
00:31:42,864 --> 00:31:43,536
(New Message)

317
00:31:47,328 --> 00:31:48,808
(I lost it.)

318
00:31:48,808 --> 00:31:51,649
(The Fiend is definitely
in the car Mad Blade mentioned)

319
00:33:33,889 --> 00:33:35,328
If you keep damaging things,

320
00:33:38,328 --> 00:33:39,929
I won't buy you toys anymore.

321
00:33:43,048 --> 00:33:43,889
You'll have

322
00:33:45,169 --> 00:33:47,088
to lay low for a while.

323
00:33:48,328 --> 00:33:50,169
South Mountain Hunters
are everywhere now.

324
00:33:52,328 --> 00:33:53,969
I can't take you out for walks anymore.

325
00:33:55,009 --> 00:33:56,528
But the Turquoise Land patrol

326
00:33:57,608 --> 00:33:58,929
only happens every four years.

327
00:34:01,048 --> 00:34:01,729
Bear with it.

328
00:34:03,328 --> 00:34:05,288
Soon we could climb trees again.

329
00:34:06,969 --> 00:34:08,088
Stay here

330
00:34:08,648 --> 00:34:10,009
and keep quiet.

331
00:34:10,329 --> 00:34:11,289
Just behave.

332
00:34:14,489 --> 00:34:15,289
You heard me?

333
00:34:17,568 --> 00:34:18,289
Locust.

334
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:30,969
Big Head says he smells the Fiend.

335
00:34:41,809 --> 00:34:42,648
He is on a mission.

336
00:34:43,369 --> 00:34:44,336
Definitely not Locust.
