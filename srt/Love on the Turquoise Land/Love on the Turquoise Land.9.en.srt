(This story is a work of fiction)

16
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,012
=Episode 9=

17
00:02:01,424 --> 00:02:02,944
I'm helping you with a huge favor.

18
00:02:02,944 --> 00:02:04,385
And you brush me off with this?

19
00:02:17,024 --> 00:02:18,265
The Hunters' magic weapon?

20
00:02:18,584 --> 00:02:19,945
Only I have this.

21
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,785
Ordinary weapons won't cause

22
00:02:21,864 --> 00:02:23,304
substantial damage on Earth Fiends.

23
00:02:23,464 --> 00:02:24,624
But this works wonders.

24
00:02:25,265 --> 00:02:28,105
Like using garlic against

25
00:02:28,505 --> 00:02:29,144
vampires?

26
00:02:31,505 --> 00:02:32,584
That's one way to put it,

27
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:34,024
but the mechanism differs.

28
00:02:34,545 --> 00:02:36,304
Its design is for easy concealment.

29
00:02:36,545 --> 00:02:37,545
But remember.

30
00:02:37,704 --> 00:02:38,584
This isn't a weapon,

31
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,152
but something helps you escape
at critical moments.

32
00:02:41,471 --> 00:02:42,992
It can't launch an attack.

33
00:02:43,511 --> 00:02:45,751
And, Jiang Baichuan recognizes it.

34
00:02:52,232 --> 00:02:52,872
Well...

35
00:02:56,311 --> 00:02:57,152
Wait a second.

36
00:02:57,672 --> 00:02:59,471
You gave me such a crucial tool.

37
00:03:00,351 --> 00:03:01,631
May I ask

38
00:03:01,952 --> 00:03:03,791
what is Jiang Baichuan to you?

39
00:03:06,471 --> 00:03:08,112
He's the leader of the Hunters.

40
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:10,511
He raised me.

41
00:03:14,872 --> 00:03:16,832
I see. Like a mentor and father to you.

42
00:03:18,872 --> 00:03:19,751
No time to waste.

43
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:21,432
Go fulfill your promise now.

44
00:03:22,631 --> 00:03:24,672
Your plan to completely quit the Hunters

45
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:25,872
has delayed, right?

46
00:03:31,832 --> 00:03:33,591
Free to join or quit
and act as you please.

47
00:03:33,591 --> 00:03:34,712
It's never easy.

48
00:03:35,392 --> 00:03:37,191
Even revered monks practicing lifelong

49
00:03:37,191 --> 00:03:38,272
may never achieve so.

50
00:03:40,872 --> 00:03:42,992
Enough philosophical talk.

51
00:03:43,471 --> 00:03:44,471
Let's get some breakfast.

52
00:03:44,832 --> 00:03:45,872
You stay. I'll get some.

53
00:03:57,296 --> 00:03:59,728
(Breakfast)

54
00:04:00,272 --> 00:04:01,432
Two, please.

55
00:04:02,272 --> 00:04:02,791
Thanks.

56
00:04:03,232 --> 00:04:03,732
Got it.

57
00:04:04,191 --> 00:04:04,832
Hey.

58
00:04:06,432 --> 00:04:07,232
What will you have?

59
00:04:07,311 --> 00:04:08,071
What's available?

60
00:04:08,351 --> 00:04:09,392
Everything. Look yourself.

61
00:04:11,031 --> 00:04:12,751
Alright, two of each then.

62
00:04:13,071 --> 00:04:13,571
Right away.

63
00:04:13,751 --> 00:04:14,672
Wait a moment.

64
00:05:18,391 --> 00:05:19,112
Breakfast.

65
00:05:24,112 --> 00:05:25,472
How long were you out there?

66
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:27,511
Not long. It's still warm.

67
00:05:31,792 --> 00:05:33,872
Thanks, but I'm not hungry.

68
00:05:37,592 --> 00:05:38,552
Been up all night?

69
00:05:44,352 --> 00:05:46,191
Impressive. No food, no rest.

70
00:05:46,271 --> 00:05:48,151
So you Hunters fight
against Earth Fiends

71
00:05:48,151 --> 00:05:49,311
through sheer willpower?

72
00:05:50,232 --> 00:05:51,271
Even without food or rest,

73
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:53,951
Jiang still got captured.

74
00:06:04,711 --> 00:06:06,831
Just tell me what you want me to do.

75
00:06:10,271 --> 00:06:13,311
Roadsound Group's influence in Xicang

76
00:06:13,311 --> 00:06:14,511
is tremendous.

77
00:06:14,872 --> 00:06:16,792
Even with all evidence in hand,

78
00:06:16,992 --> 00:06:19,472
Lin Xirou could still
use her connections

79
00:06:19,472 --> 00:06:21,232
and excuses to stall for time.

80
00:06:22,232 --> 00:06:24,271
Especially she has Jiang
as their hostage now.

81
00:06:25,032 --> 00:06:27,912
Reckless moves would alert her
and endanger Jiang.

82
00:06:30,071 --> 00:06:32,391
When I first met Lin Xirou as a child,

83
00:06:32,631 --> 00:06:34,151
she looked exactly like this.

84
00:06:34,511 --> 00:06:35,472
Many years have passed,

85
00:06:35,472 --> 00:06:36,711
she looks still the same.

86
00:06:36,951 --> 00:06:38,191
That's right.

87
00:06:39,151 --> 00:06:40,672
Earth Fiends have long lifespans.

88
00:06:40,872 --> 00:06:42,592
So time is what she lacks the least.

89
00:06:44,311 --> 00:06:45,552
She acts with meticulous care,

90
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,751
caution and endless patience.

91
00:06:50,951 --> 00:06:51,951
Roadsound has weathered

92
00:06:51,951 --> 00:06:53,311
multiple business crises.

93
00:06:53,311 --> 00:06:54,751
No matter the opponent,

94
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:57,151
she could stay composed
and counterattack.

95
00:06:59,391 --> 00:07:00,151
Of course.

96
00:07:00,912 --> 00:07:02,711
To fight us short-lived ones,

97
00:07:03,071 --> 00:07:04,472
time favors her.

98
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,151
She waits for us to panic

99
00:07:07,271 --> 00:07:08,711
and blunder.

100
00:07:09,352 --> 00:07:11,872
Hence, we can't act recklessly.

101
00:07:18,592 --> 00:07:20,112
While caution matters,

102
00:07:21,472 --> 00:07:22,751
we can't stay passive.

103
00:07:23,831 --> 00:07:24,391
For example?

104
00:07:27,112 --> 00:07:27,872
Make her hurt.

105
00:08:30,071 --> 00:08:31,391
Put cartons in cold chain.

106
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:32,712
The rest goes on next truck.

107
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:34,511
Drive faster. No delays.

108
00:08:34,592 --> 00:08:35,312
Got it, Zheng.

109
00:08:41,551 --> 00:08:42,911
By the way, Zheng,

110
00:08:43,431 --> 00:08:45,511
can I take two days off
after this delivery?

111
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:46,952
Why now?

112
00:08:48,271 --> 00:08:51,592
My mom's hospitalized, needs surgery.

113
00:08:51,952 --> 00:08:52,952
I'll go check on her.

114
00:08:56,151 --> 00:08:57,352
Then skip this delivery

115
00:08:57,751 --> 00:08:58,592
and go now.

116
00:08:59,232 --> 00:09:00,072
Family matters.

117
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:03,751
No need, Zheng.

118
00:09:04,472 --> 00:09:05,352
Not that urgent.

119
00:09:05,751 --> 00:09:07,832
My mother still needs more observation.

120
00:09:08,072 --> 00:09:09,952

Don't force it.

146

where you went this morning.

147
00:12:07,992 --> 00:12:08,992
Ms. Lin asked me?

148
00:12:09,992 --> 00:12:12,592
Ms. Lin intended to escort her herself,

149
00:12:13,072 --> 00:12:15,751
but saw you rushing out
without going to the office,

150
00:12:15,911 --> 00:12:17,112
so sent me to check.

151
00:12:19,712 --> 00:12:21,511
Alright, I'll call her later.

152
00:12:21,511 --> 00:12:24,631
Ms. Lin said you can just tell me,

153
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,112
and I'll relay it to her.

154
00:12:31,872 --> 00:12:34,031

156
00:12:36,911 --> 00:12:38,872
I scrolled through videos last night.

157

Guess what I saw?

158
00:12:41,031 --> 00:12:43,751
The fried breadstick store
Ms. Lin often bought us to. Remember?

159
00:12:44,151 --> 00:12:45,511
The one behind our school?

160
00:12:46,072 --> 00:12:47,671
Exactly! Seeing it made me so hungry.

161
00:12:47,671 --> 00:12:48,992
I even stayed up all night

162
00:12:49,112 --> 00:12:50,192
from craving.

163
00:12:50,751 --> 00:12:51,872

this morning

165
00:12:53,192 --> 00:12:54,072

But,

167
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,671

00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,031

172
00:13:07,592 --> 00:13:08,952
Who knows if the breakfast store

173
00:13:08,952 --> 00:13:10,592
uses the recycled oil, right?

00:14:32,031 --> 00:14:33,112
Send me the photos.

192
00:14:33,232 --> 00:14:34,751
Then delete them all.

193
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,112
Including our chat history.

194
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,312
Is it that serious?

195
00:14:39,911 --> 00:14:42,151
Didn't you see how solemn Sis was?

196
00:14:42,511 --> 00:14:44,031
You're under Ms. Lin's watch,

197
00:14:44,031 --> 00:14:45,031
in grave peril.

198
00:14:45,472 --> 00:14:47,151
So you must not be discovered.
Understand?

199
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,551
These people are coming over here.

200
00:14:50,631 --> 00:14:53,192
Is it for the person you mentioned

201
00:14:53,472 --> 00:14:55,072
that Ms. Lin captured?

202
00:15:06,151 --> 00:15:08,031
(Available today? Usual spot.)

203
00:15:08,232 --> 00:15:09,791
(Okay.)

204
00:15:19,232 --> 00:15:20,031
Sent.

205
00:15:21,412 --> 00:15:25,671
(Car Rental Reimbursement Itinerary)

206
00:15:25,671 --> 00:15:26,472
What is this?

207
00:15:27,151 --> 00:15:28,472
A group of humanoid Earth Fiends

208
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,992
are coming to Xicang.

209
00:15:30,271 --> 00:15:31,352
Others are flying in.

210
00:15:31,511 --> 00:15:33,551
Xiong Hei handles the pickup,
leaving us no chance.

211
00:15:34,431 --> 00:15:36,352
But two are driving from nearby

212
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,391
separately by car.

213
00:15:37,872 --> 00:15:40,072
They'll stop at the hotel in Shihe.

214
00:15:40,992 --> 00:15:42,072
Sent you the details.

215
00:15:42,391 --> 00:15:43,312
Coming.

216
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:44,592
The usual.

217
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:46,952
Thank you.

218
00:15:46,952 --> 00:15:47,671
Thank you.

219
00:15:50,031 --> 00:15:51,192
What's your plan?

220
00:15:54,671 --> 00:15:56,791
Let's start by targeting these two.

221
00:16:10,832 --> 00:16:11,631
Eat up.

222
00:16:11,911 --> 00:16:12,911
At times like this,

223
00:16:12,911 --> 00:16:14,072
you have to have enough food.

224
00:16:15,472 --> 00:16:16,872
What you sent is useful.

225
00:16:17,192 --> 00:16:18,911
I need to figure out how to use it.

226
00:16:21,352 --> 00:16:24,072
Miss, you've brought
your boyfriend here so many times.

227
00:16:24,072 --> 00:16:26,511
Why don't you try our signature dessert?

228
00:16:26,992 --> 00:16:28,072
This one's on the house.

229
00:16:28,151 --> 00:16:29,551
Wishing you a sweet relationship!

230
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:04,391
Hello.

231
00:17:06,911 --> 00:17:07,911
I have a plan.

232
00:17:08,872 --> 00:17:10,032
It might rescue Jiang.

233
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:11,752
Go on.

234
00:17:12,471 --> 00:17:14,872
A group of humanoid Earth Fiends
are coming to Xicang.

235
00:17:15,191 --> 00:17:15,991
Capture them

236
00:17:16,151 --> 00:17:17,391
and trade with Lin Xirou.

237
00:17:17,832 --> 00:17:18,951
Where did you get this news?

238
00:17:19,631 --> 00:17:20,592
Don't you trust me?

239
00:17:21,032 --> 00:17:22,471
Even if we capture them,

240
00:17:23,231 --> 00:17:24,631
are you sure she'll make the trade?

241
00:17:25,191 --> 00:17:26,592
Once they reach Roadsound,

242
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:27,792
we'll lose our chance.

243
00:17:30,431 --> 00:17:31,272
What's the plan?

244
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:33,072
I'll tail them first.

245
00:17:33,592 --> 00:17:35,032
You stake out their destination.

246
00:17:35,431 --> 00:17:36,592
I'll send you the location.

247
00:17:36,991 --> 00:17:39,112
Don't take your own car to tail them.

248
00:17:39,671 --> 00:17:41,191
I know. I rented one.

249
00:18:31,792 --> 00:18:32,711
Tell everyone

250
00:18:33,991 --> 00:18:34,911
to get moving.

251
00:19:03,952 --> 00:19:05,808
(List, License Plates)

252
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,053
(Mount Anping Tunnel, 1320m long)

253
00:20:05,272 --> 00:20:07,951
Has this happened before?

254
00:20:11,112 --> 00:20:12,112
Wait, look.

255
00:20:13,352 --> 00:20:16,191
They're rushing us to Xicang this time.

256
00:20:18,431 --> 00:20:20,431
And there are so many of us.

257
00:20:23,671 --> 00:20:24,512
No idea.

258
00:20:28,911 --> 00:20:30,752
Pull over at the service area.

259
00:20:31,032 --> 00:20:31,792
I'll take a leak.

260
00:20:33,752 --> 00:20:34,951
We can't be late.

261
00:20:45,872 --> 00:20:46,951
No music.

262
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:48,911
No chatting.

263
00:20:50,431 --> 00:20:51,312
Not even leaks?

264
00:21:12,951 --> 00:21:14,671
The Hound Clan of the Hunters

265
00:21:14,671 --> 00:21:16,112
can track us by scent.

266
00:21:17,911 --> 00:21:19,391
Thanks to Ms. Lin,

267
00:21:20,231 --> 00:21:21,951
we've taken human form

268
00:21:22,792 --> 00:21:23,671
without any scent.

269
00:21:35,352 --> 00:21:37,631
But if I can't hold it and wet my pants,

270
00:21:37,872 --> 00:21:39,391
the Hounds...

271
00:21:39,911 --> 00:21:42,032
m-must smell me from afar.

272
00:21:46,631 --> 00:21:47,391
Look at you.

273
00:21:47,832 --> 00:21:50,471
You never talk to me,

274
00:21:50,592 --> 00:21:51,752
instead, you take my joke

275
00:21:52,832 --> 00:21:54,072
pretty seriously.

276
00:22:52,711 --> 00:22:53,391
Let's go.

277
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:56,512
Move now. You said we can't be late.

278
00:23:00,431 --> 00:23:03,072
That blue car's been tailing us.

279
00:23:15,151 --> 00:23:17,231
At the service area now.
Still some distance away.

280
00:23:17,832 --> 00:23:19,312
But they've spotted me.

281
00:23:20,951 --> 00:23:21,991
I'll reinforce you.

282
00:23:23,032 --> 00:23:25,072
No. Ambush them at the hotel.

283
00:23:26,431 --> 00:23:27,951
What if they attack you?

284
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,792
Even better.

285
00:23:30,792 --> 00:23:31,872
If we fight at the hotel,

286
00:23:31,872 --> 00:23:32,951
it'll be more complicated.

287
00:23:33,231 --> 00:23:34,792
If they act rashly,

288
00:23:34,832 --> 00:23:36,431
I'll take them down here.

289
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,631
Luo, don't be reckless.

290
00:23:40,231 --> 00:23:41,872
Alright, don't worry.

291
00:23:42,112 --> 00:23:43,272
I drive slowly.

292
00:23:43,352 --> 00:23:45,471
You'll have time to cook
after I exit the highway.

293
00:23:46,711 --> 00:23:47,512
See you tonight.

294
00:23:50,752 --> 00:23:51,512
Let's go.

295
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,552
Is it necessary?

296
00:23:54,352 --> 00:23:55,191
Cut the crap.

297
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:01,151
(Small Potato
Where are you now?)

298
00:24:10,858 --> 00:24:11,898
(Need me to come over?)

299
00:24:37,057 --> 00:24:38,297
She's really following us.

300
00:24:41,337 --> 00:24:42,257
Stay alert.

301
00:24:44,138 --> 00:24:45,577
Just a woman.

302
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:47,297
Stop her and interrogate her.

303
00:24:48,297 --> 00:24:50,257
She might have backup.

304
00:24:51,898 --> 00:24:53,537
Let's go to a quiet spot first.

305
00:25:29,418 --> 00:25:30,698
- Let's go.
- Okay.

306
00:25:31,057 --> 00:25:32,337
Take your stuff.

307
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:27,866
(Nie Jiuluo
Need me to come over?)

308
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:33,306
(Yan Tuo)

309
00:26:53,218 --> 00:26:55,297
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed...

310
00:27:44,057 --> 00:27:44,817
Where are they?

311
00:27:48,698 --> 00:27:49,458
What time is it?

312
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:51,878
7 PM.

313
00:28:00,938 --> 00:28:02,178
Sorry,

314
00:28:02,178 --> 00:28:04,658
the subscriber you dialed
is unavailable.

315
00:28:04,777 --> 00:28:06,138
Please try again later.

316
00:28:06,138 --> 00:28:06,938
Sorry,

317
00:28:06,938 --> 00:28:09,537
the subscriber you dialed
is unavailable.

318
00:28:09,537 --> 00:28:12,218
Let's backtrack along the highway.

319
00:28:57,914 --> 00:29:00,337
(No Service)

320
00:29:00,337 --> 00:29:01,138
Sorry,

321
00:29:01,497 --> 00:29:03,978
the subscriber you dialed
is unavailable.

322
00:35:08,258 --> 00:35:10,858
What? You won't let me
pick trash during the day,

323
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:13,057
and now won't even
let me sleep peacefully at night?

324
00:35:17,898 --> 00:35:19,097
What are you...

325
00:37:53,458 --> 00:37:54,177
Han Guan.

326
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:57,217
Han Guan!

327
00:38:06,657 --> 00:38:07,537
Who are you?

328
00:38:09,097 --> 00:38:10,338
Who sent you here?

329
00:38:12,097 --> 00:38:13,298
Han Guan!

330
00:38:13,338 --> 00:38:14,458
Stop shouting.

331
00:38:18,577 --> 00:38:20,097
He can't hear you anymore.

332
00:38:41,378 --> 00:38:43,177
You know how to kill us.

333
00:38:44,338 --> 00:38:45,137
You're

334
00:38:46,338 --> 00:38:47,217
Mad Blade.

335
00:39:01,617 --> 00:39:02,418
Nie Jiuluo!

336
00:39:04,738 --> 00:39:05,537
Nie Jiuluo!

337
00:39:06,458 --> 00:39:08,177
Nie Jiuluo. You okay?

338
00:39:12,258 --> 00:39:14,017
Nie Jiuluo, are you okay?

339
00:39:15,738 --> 00:39:16,537
Nie Jiuluo.

340
00:39:17,258 --> 00:39:17,758
Wake up.

341
00:39:18,418 --> 00:39:18,918
Wake up.

342
00:39:20,537 --> 00:39:21,037
Nie Jiuluo.

343
00:39:21,778 --> 00:39:22,278
Nie Jiuluo.

344
00:39:37,146 --> 00:39:43,450
(Xicang, Shiqing)

345
00:39:57,938 --> 00:39:59,978
Nie Jiuluo, wake up!

346
00:40:00,177 --> 00:40:01,258
Don't pass out.

347
00:40:07,657 --> 00:40:08,258
Luo.

348
00:40:10,978 --> 00:40:11,657
Luo.

349
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:15,097
Luo.

350
00:40:18,298 --> 00:40:21,017
Wake up. We're almost there.

351
00:40:22,338 --> 00:40:22,978
Mom.

352
00:40:24,978 --> 00:40:26,378
Where are we going?

353
00:40:28,177 --> 00:40:29,537
I promised you

354
00:40:30,097 --> 00:40:31,378
a boat ride.

355
00:40:32,938 --> 00:40:33,938
Forgot about it already?

356
00:40:48,858 --> 00:40:49,818
I won't go.

357
00:41:01,097 --> 00:41:01,978
I won't go.

358
00:41:10,138 --> 00:41:10,996
Next time,

359
00:41:12,126 --> 00:41:14,145
how about I take you
to my usual canteen?

360
00:41:14,778 --> 00:41:16,321
A canteen worthy of your taste must

361
00:41:16,634 --> 00:41:17,862
serve upscale French cuisine.

362
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:19,736
Not at all.

363
00:41:20,666 --> 00:41:22,291
I don't find French cuisine upscale.

364
00:41:23,354 --> 00:41:25,126
Escargot can't beat
the braised duck feet.

365
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:27,436
The cheese can't beat osmanthus cakes.

366
00:41:29,594 --> 00:41:30,898
You'll definitely love the place

367
00:41:30,898 --> 00:41:31,805
I'll take you.

368
00:41:34,576 --> 00:41:35,637
How do you know

369
00:41:36,314 --> 00:41:37,147
what I like?

370
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:42,055
Let's give it a try.

371
00:41:44,218 --> 00:41:45,018
Alright.

372
00:41:45,654 --> 00:41:46,599
Looking forward to it.

373
00:41:48,986 --> 00:41:49,562
Here.

374
00:41:50,135 --> 00:41:51,014
Give me five.
