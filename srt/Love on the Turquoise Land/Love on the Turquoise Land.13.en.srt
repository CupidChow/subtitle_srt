I'll freeze them in the freezer.

Look at you.

26

You could've done this earlier.

I asked Mr. Changxi
to buy you some new outfits.

35
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,976
Hope you like them.

36
00:03:09,816 --> 00:03:12,055
Actually, they fit me perfectly.

37

61

steal meat these days.

00:17:33,176 --> 00:17:34,176
He's just confined.

193
00:17:34,176 --> 00:17:35,335
Still safe for now.

194
00:17:35,736 --> 00:17:37,456
Are you sure he's trustworthy?

195
00:17:37,855 --> 00:17:39,416
Who could even intrude into that place?

196
00:17:42,696 --> 00:17:44,896
The same guy I caught and brought to you

197
00:17:44,936 --> 00:17:46,575
with Sun Zhou and Gou Ya.

198
00:17:47,256 --> 00:17:48,055
Yan Tuo.

199
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:49,216
Yan Tuo?

200
00:17:50,896 --> 00:17:52,496
The one rescued by Earth Fiends?

201
00:17:52,936 --> 00:17:54,335
We had misunderstandings.

202
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,535
But he's actually on our side.

203
00:17:56,896 --> 00:17:59,095
He's been secretly helping me all along.

204
00:18:01,176 --> 00:18:02,696
To rescue him, those Earth Fiends

205
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:04,696
exposed themselves,

206
00:18:04,815 --> 00:18:05,855
stormed the ice factory,

207
00:18:06,295 --> 00:18:07,416
and injured Mrs. Hua.

208
00:18:07,855 --> 00:18:08,976
Be alert.

209
00:18:09,176 --> 00:18:10,855
Don't trust a single word from him.

210
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,656
Yan Tuo's biological parents

211
00:18:17,535 --> 00:18:19,135
were killed by Earth Fiends.

212
00:18:20,095 --> 00:18:22,135
He's been trying to take them down too.

213
00:18:22,575 --> 00:18:24,575
So we can trust him.

214
00:18:25,176 --> 00:18:27,615
Moreover, he already helped me

215
00:18:27,775 --> 00:18:29,896
capture two Earth Fiends,
Chen Fu and Han Guan.

216
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:31,575
You caught them?

217
00:18:32,775 --> 00:18:34,256
Don't rush to rescue Jiang.

218
00:18:34,456 --> 00:18:35,736
We need a perfect plan.

219
00:18:37,855 --> 00:18:39,216
Let me interrogate Chen Fu first.

220
00:18:39,496 --> 00:18:41,055
When I have any updates,

221
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:42,496
I'll tell you immediately.

222
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:43,095
Alright.

223
00:18:43,736 --> 00:18:44,456
Then be care...

224
00:19:17,896 --> 00:19:18,976
What is the blood bag?

225
00:19:22,456 --> 00:19:24,095
How did you take human form?

226
00:19:27,936 --> 00:19:30,976
I know Lin Xirou's son is a traitor.

227
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:33,976
I also know

228
00:19:34,216 --> 00:19:35,575
what the Mad Blade

229
00:19:35,936 --> 00:19:37,095
looks like.

230
00:19:37,815 --> 00:19:39,375
And I know

231
00:19:39,855 --> 00:19:42,216
your cozy nest is called

232
00:19:42,575 --> 00:19:43,896
Changxi Dumplings.

233
00:19:48,335 --> 00:19:52,615
So no matter what I say or do now,

234
00:19:53,016 --> 00:19:54,855
you won't let me go.

235
00:19:57,016 --> 00:19:58,535
Stop wasting time.

236
00:19:59,815 --> 00:20:00,815
Kill me.

237
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:06,295
Killing you

238
00:20:06,615 --> 00:20:08,176
means letting you off.

239
00:20:09,055 --> 00:20:10,055
Besides,

240
00:20:10,815 --> 00:20:13,216
it's rare to examine
a humanoid Earth Fiend.

241
00:20:13,936 --> 00:20:14,855
Just the fact

242
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:17,095
that I could thoroughly study

243
00:20:17,095 --> 00:20:18,496
your physical structure

244
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:20,496
is valuable.

245
00:20:22,656 --> 00:20:23,456
Tell me,

246
00:20:24,496 --> 00:20:26,176
if people eat dumplings

247
00:20:27,024 --> 00:20:28,048

(Flour for Dumpling Wrappers)

249
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:31,535
would they become stupid?

250
00:20:41,055 --> 00:20:41,855

251
00:20:50,736 --> 00:20:51,535
Ms. Lin.

252
00:21:25,055 --> 00:21:26,656
You really hid well.

253
00:21:27,535 --> 00:21:28,976
Made me search everywhere.

254
00:21:30,736 --> 00:21:31,815
That's nothing.

255
00:21:33,055 --> 00:21:35,456
I'm the one who's been
searching everywhere.

256
00:21:36,976 --> 00:21:38,095
What's going on?

257
00:21:38,815 --> 00:21:40,416
Two people went missing.

258
00:21:41,135 --> 00:21:43,135
Ms. Lin insisted
I check the surveillance.

259
00:21:44,496 --> 00:21:46,855
This could take forever.

260
00:21:47,535 --> 00:21:49,416
My eyes are going blind from watching.

261
00:21:53,456 --> 00:21:54,335
Why are you here?

262
00:21:58,936 --> 00:22:00,496
Brought you some food.

263
00:22:01,456 --> 00:22:02,696
I'll help you search.

264
00:22:06,055 --> 00:22:07,216
Perfect, I'm hungry.

265
00:22:30,896 --> 00:22:31,896
All you know is eating.

266
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:33,055
I'm doing all the work.

267
00:22:41,775 --> 00:22:42,496
What does it mean?

268
00:22:44,256 --> 00:22:45,055
Swipe it.

Nice. You're efficient.

273
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:21,456
You're just too inefficient.

274
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,736
I want one.

275
00:23:27,216 --> 00:23:28,696
Okay, I'll open it.

276
00:23:33,775 --> 00:23:34,656
Try another one.

277
00:23:46,575 --> 00:23:48,375
Should I repeat the question?

278
00:23:53,775 --> 00:23:55,095
What is the blood bag?

279
00:23:55,335 --> 00:23:57,055
How did you take human form?

280
00:23:57,456 --> 00:23:58,855
Take human form?

281
00:24:03,976 --> 00:24:05,016
Ms. Lin said

282
00:24:05,896 --> 00:24:07,815
since we choose to live as humans,

283
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:12,216
we must experience
and embrace human emotions.

284
00:24:12,615 --> 00:24:13,736
Compassion,

285

nurture,

287
00:24:16,936 --> 00:24:18,295
and fulfillment.

288
00:24:19,896 --> 00:24:20,936

gain these experiences

290
00:24:24,176 --> 00:24:26,335

291

293
00:24:34,416 --> 00:24:35,575
you're using him?

294
00:24:39,496 --> 00:24:40,176
What?

295
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,176
Yan Tuo.

296
00:24:43,055 --> 00:24:44,416
What method did you use?

297
00:24:45,855 --> 00:24:47,095
Threats and bribery?

298
00:24:47,615 --> 00:24:48,416
No.

299
00:24:49,575 --> 00:24:51,176
Emotional manipulation?

300
00:24:52,775 --> 00:24:54,256
Doesn't seem like it.

301
00:25:09,656 --> 00:25:10,496
Right.

and coquettish acts...

Once entering the Twilight Chasm,

311
00:25:45,775 --> 00:25:47,696
humans become fiendish wraiths,

312
00:25:48,016 --> 00:25:49,976

before she does.

00:30:45,456 --> 00:30:46,775
What about you?

382
00:30:47,135 --> 00:30:48,416
She's already here.

383
00:30:49,335 --> 00:30:50,216
That fast?

384
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:51,896
You ask me?

385
00:30:51,896 --> 00:30:53,375
I don't care. I just want to see.

386
00:30:54,375 --> 00:30:55,416
Let me see.

387
00:30:55,416 --> 00:30:56,095
How about this?

388
00:30:56,095 --> 00:30:57,135
Please wait inside.

389
00:30:57,216 --> 00:30:58,295
I'll get you some water.

390
00:30:58,496 --> 00:30:59,456
Then we'll talk.

391
00:31:13,896 --> 00:31:14,896
Have some water.

392
00:31:18,055 --> 00:31:19,496
The lobby surveillance footage

393
00:31:19,976 --> 00:31:21,176
on September 13th.

394
00:31:21,855 --> 00:31:23,095
I'll just take a look.

395
00:31:23,696 --> 00:31:24,736
This violates the policy.

396
00:31:24,936 --> 00:31:26,696
Ma'am, I'm sorry.

397
00:31:26,855 --> 00:31:27,976
Don't call me ma'am.

398
00:31:28,736 --> 00:31:29,736
My name is Wang Mimi.

399
00:31:30,176 --> 00:31:31,176
I'm a woman.

400
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:32,295
Hurry up!

401
00:31:32,896 --> 00:31:34,976
Let me see it. It'll be quick.

402
00:31:35,575 --> 00:31:36,575
Let me give up hope.

403
00:31:37,615 --> 00:31:38,216
Okay?

404
00:31:50,736 --> 00:31:52,135
All September 13th footage is here.

405
00:31:52,135 --> 00:31:53,416
That's so many.

406
00:31:54,736 --> 00:31:55,696
That many?

407
00:31:56,055 --> 00:31:57,016
We can fast-forward.

408
00:31:58,696 --> 00:31:59,416
Faster.

409
00:32:02,896 --> 00:32:03,575
Faster.

410
00:32:05,295 --> 00:32:06,375
They're reviewing it.

411
00:32:09,696 --> 00:32:10,375
Even faster.

412
00:32:10,936 --> 00:32:12,135
It's too fast to see anything.

413
00:32:12,135 --> 00:32:13,016
Do it.

414
00:32:20,976 --> 00:32:21,656
Faster.

415
00:32:25,936 --> 00:32:26,575
Stop.

416
00:32:27,135 --> 00:32:27,815
Rewind.

417
00:32:29,775 --> 00:32:30,456
Further back.

418
00:32:55,535 --> 00:32:57,656
I-I think the circuit breaker tripped.

419
00:32:57,656 --> 00:32:58,656
Put the knife down.

420
00:32:58,696 --> 00:32:59,736
I-I'll go check.

421
00:33:00,256 --> 00:33:00,936
Where is it?

422
00:33:00,936 --> 00:33:01,896
Back there.

423
00:33:14,135 --> 00:33:15,375
Miss, please calm down.

424
00:33:18,976 --> 00:33:20,016
She has a knife.

425
00:33:20,496 --> 00:33:21,496
Don't stop her.

426
00:33:21,736 --> 00:33:23,575
All of you stay back.

427
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,936
M-Ma'am, please stay calm.

428
00:33:42,936 --> 00:33:44,335
P-Please put down...

429
00:33:44,535 --> 00:33:45,855
Put down the knife.

430
00:33:47,135 --> 00:33:48,936
This is the circuit breaker.

431
00:33:59,696 --> 00:34:01,256
Once entering the Twilight Chasm,

432
00:34:01,535 --> 00:34:04,095
humans become fiendish wraiths,
and fiends become human demons.

433
00:34:05,535 --> 00:34:06,335
What does that mean?

434
00:34:08,456 --> 00:34:09,296
I don't know either.

435
00:34:09,816 --> 00:34:10,735
Chen Fu said it.

436
00:34:11,376 --> 00:34:13,296
Sounds like an old saying
of the Hunters.

437
00:34:13,615 --> 00:34:14,936
But I've never heard it before.

438
00:34:17,456 --> 00:34:18,336
Nothing else?

439
00:34:19,735 --> 00:34:21,175
He bit off his own tongue.

440
00:34:24,575 --> 00:34:25,976
What a tough guy.

441
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:34,296
There's a note on his phone.

442
00:34:34,296 --> 00:34:36,112
The day after tomorrow
is marked as important.

443
00:34:36,456 --> 00:34:37,896
Seems like they have some big plan.

444
00:34:38,255 --> 00:34:40,376
Xu Anni has been
constantly calling him too.

445
00:34:41,135 --> 00:34:42,296
Something feels off.

446
00:34:46,456 --> 00:34:47,255
Perhaps

447
00:34:48,055 --> 00:34:49,496
we go meet Xu Anni.

448
00:34:50,856 --> 00:34:52,296
We might get something.

449
00:34:56,296 --> 00:34:57,175
Good idea.

450
00:35:06,735 --> 00:35:07,255
Here.

451
00:35:08,055 --> 00:35:10,215
Check the Xu Anni's address.

452
00:35:17,713 --> 00:35:20,163
(Chen Fu's Profile)

453
00:35:21,575 --> 00:35:22,535
In Heyang.

454
00:35:23,016 --> 00:35:23,695
Heyang?

455
00:35:26,896 --> 00:35:27,896
Heyang.

456
00:35:33,776 --> 00:35:36,752
(Ms. Lin)

457
00:35:40,655 --> 00:35:41,456
Tuo.

458
00:35:43,376 --> 00:35:44,095
Ms. Lin.

459
00:35:44,856 --> 00:35:46,456
I'm going to Heyang tomorrow

460
00:35:46,496 --> 00:35:47,695
to meet a business partner.

461
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:48,976
Just giving you a heads-up.

462
00:35:50,496 --> 00:35:52,456
We have partners in Heyang?

463
00:35:52,936 --> 00:35:53,856
Yes.

464
00:35:54,095 --> 00:35:55,976
Meng Zheyuan, Mr. Meng.

465
00:35:57,055 --> 00:35:58,456
They've developed a new technology.

466
00:35:58,456 --> 00:36:00,575
The purification rate
exceeds our internal standards

467
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:01,976
by five percent.

468
00:36:02,655 --> 00:36:04,575
So I'm going to meet him tomorrow.

469
00:36:05,776 --> 00:36:06,615
Driving there?

470
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,400
Yes.

471
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,936
Taking the Xincang route. Quite fast.

472
00:36:10,936 --> 00:36:11,776
Be careful.

473
00:36:12,496 --> 00:36:13,135
Don't worry.

474
00:36:24,055 --> 00:36:24,856
Ms. Lin.

475
00:36:25,615 --> 00:36:27,416
Feng Mi went to check
the rental car footage,

476
00:36:27,416 --> 00:36:28,655
but someone intercepted her.

477
00:36:31,456 --> 00:36:33,416
Which means we're on the right track.

478
00:36:33,936 --> 00:36:36,135
That car and its driver

479
00:36:36,135 --> 00:36:38,776
must be connected to Han Guan
and Chen Fu's disappearance.

480
00:36:40,496 --> 00:36:42,655
Since they've made their move,

481
00:36:42,896 --> 00:36:44,896
they'll inevitably slip up.

482
00:36:46,896 --> 00:36:47,735
Keep investigating.

483
00:36:47,976 --> 00:36:48,575
Yes.

484
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,336
If Mr. Changxi sees this,

485
00:37:42,336 --> 00:37:43,496
he might get a great scare.

486
00:38:01,615 --> 00:38:02,296
Better?

487
00:38:20,896 --> 00:38:21,735
Mr. Changxi.

488
00:38:24,016 --> 00:38:24,856
Washing vegetables?

489
00:38:25,416 --> 00:38:26,336
Yes.

490
00:38:26,575 --> 00:38:27,535
You're up early.

491
00:38:28,655 --> 00:38:30,856
The storage room is so dark. You two...

492
00:38:32,055 --> 00:38:33,296
W-We were...

493
00:38:33,296 --> 00:38:35,016
W-We were...

494
00:38:35,016 --> 00:38:35,896
I-I...

495
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:37,055
I asked Yan Tuo

496
00:38:37,055 --> 00:38:38,856
to buy me some sculpting clay,

497
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:40,535
yet he entered the wrong address.

498
00:38:40,615 --> 00:38:41,896
So it got delivered here.

499
00:38:42,095 --> 00:38:43,776
We temporarily stored it in the attic.

500
00:38:43,856 --> 00:38:45,336
Is that okay, Mr. Changxi?

501
00:38:45,695 --> 00:38:46,376
No problem.

502
00:38:47,175 --> 00:38:48,135
If you need storage,

503
00:38:48,135 --> 00:38:49,296
just store them here.

504
00:38:50,135 --> 00:38:51,456
It's my fault.

505
00:38:51,456 --> 00:38:52,215
A mistake.

506
00:38:54,095 --> 00:38:54,856
Mr. Changxi.

507
00:38:55,135 --> 00:38:56,456
The clay

508
00:38:56,456 --> 00:38:57,695
has been specially treated

509
00:38:57,695 --> 00:38:58,776
with chemical dyes.

510
00:38:58,856 --> 00:39:00,055
Better not go up there.

511
00:39:00,095 --> 00:39:01,456
It might harm your health.

512
00:39:01,655 --> 00:39:02,416
Understood.

513
00:39:02,416 --> 00:39:04,535
I haven't been up there in years.

514
00:39:10,936 --> 00:39:11,735
What?

515
00:39:12,055 --> 00:39:12,976
Want to help me?

516
00:39:15,055 --> 00:39:16,016
Go have fun.

517
00:39:16,575 --> 00:39:18,016
Okay. We'll get going now.

518
00:39:36,638 --> 00:39:42,032
(Heyang City)

519
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,520
Don't they have backups?

520
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,200
You dismantled the thing.

521
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,040
Any backups would've been in it.

522
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,160
The fact this place

523
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,800
even has surveillance is a miracle.

524
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:56,680
Take it easy.

525
00:40:01,008 --> 00:40:02,200
How's your injury?

526
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,600
I broke in there.

527
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,960
You only care about me now?

528
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,040
I'll let Mr. Changxi

529
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,600
stew radishes to replenish your energy.

530
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,680
No need. I'm almost healed.

531
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,280
Take me home.

532
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,680
Are you sure?

533
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,520
Thank Mr. Changxi for me.

534
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,520
What about me?

535
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,840
It's what you should do.

536
00:40:28,528 --> 00:40:29,040
