(This story is a work of fiction)

16
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,992
=Episode 15=

17
00:01:53,994 --> 00:01:55,994
When Lin Xirou first showed up,

18
00:01:56,753 --> 00:01:58,074
Lin Ling wasn't born, right?

19
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,313
She was adopted later.

20
00:02:01,514 --> 00:02:02,673
So that means

21
00:02:03,753 --> 00:02:04,954
before Lin Ling came,

22
00:02:05,154 --> 00:02:06,714
a close kin of hers

23
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:08,754
was already Lin Xirou's blood bag.

24
00:02:18,922 --> 00:02:22,568
(Roadsound Mining)

25
00:02:23,034 --> 00:02:23,794
Madam.

26
00:02:24,673 --> 00:02:25,354
Come in.

27
00:02:26,314 --> 00:02:27,713
Yan Tuo, do you know me?

28
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:28,333
Yan Tuo.

29
00:02:28,493 --> 00:02:28,993
Good boy.

30
00:02:28,993 --> 00:02:29,754
You're so tall.

31
00:02:30,034 --> 00:02:30,914
Hello, Madam.

32
00:02:31,713 --> 00:02:32,553
Hello, Madam.

33
00:02:32,713 --> 00:02:33,393
Hello, Madam.

34
00:02:33,993 --> 00:02:34,673
Hello, Madam.

35
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:35,794
Hello, Madam.

36
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:42,873
Mom, are you tired?

37
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,234
Let me support you.

38
00:02:44,553 --> 00:02:45,433
I'm not tired.

39
00:02:45,553 --> 00:02:46,673
Thank you, Tuo.

40
00:02:52,393 --> 00:02:53,194
Hello, Madam.

41
00:02:53,393 --> 00:02:54,713
Let me feel your face.

42
00:02:54,873 --> 00:02:56,113
Get lost, you.

43
00:03:21,194 --> 00:03:21,776
Hello, Madam.

44
00:03:24,144 --> 00:03:24,814
Hello, Madam.

45
00:03:25,034 --> 00:03:25,993
Tuo, your homework?

46
00:03:25,993 --> 00:03:27,074
No homework today.

47
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:28,634
Tuo! You came to see me?

48
00:03:29,194 --> 00:03:31,433
Quick. Let me hold you.

49
00:03:32,794 --> 00:03:33,593
Quite heavy.

50
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:35,273
I missed you so much.

51
00:03:38,553 --> 00:03:39,433
Tell me,

52
00:03:39,474 --> 00:03:40,273
did you miss me?

53
00:03:41,194 --> 00:03:43,273
You two never act proper when meeting.

54
00:03:43,914 --> 00:03:45,234
How's this improper?

55
00:03:45,314 --> 00:03:45,993
If you ask me,

56
00:03:46,034 --> 00:03:47,314
you're the improper one.

57
00:03:47,553 --> 00:03:48,833
Waddling around

58
00:03:48,993 --> 00:03:49,914
with this huge belly.

59
00:03:50,273 --> 00:03:51,194
The doctor said

60
00:03:51,194 --> 00:03:52,514
I need to stay active.

61
00:03:53,153 --> 00:03:53,754
Alright.

62
00:03:54,153 --> 00:03:54,993
Haven't eaten yet?

63
00:03:54,993 --> 00:03:55,553
Not yet.

64
00:03:56,034 --> 00:03:56,673
Here.

65
00:03:56,673 --> 00:03:57,393
What's the treat?

66
00:03:58,593 --> 00:03:59,234
Dumplings.

67
00:03:59,713 --> 00:04:01,354
How'd you know I was craving these?

68
00:04:01,914 --> 00:04:02,954
Eat while they're hot.

69
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:03,794
Okay.

70
00:04:07,234 --> 00:04:08,673
Here, Tuo, try this.

71
00:04:08,713 --> 00:04:09,634
See if it's good.

72
00:04:10,273 --> 00:04:11,433
Mom should eat too.

73
00:04:11,433 --> 00:04:12,754
Okay, give Mom some.

74
00:04:12,914 --> 00:04:14,234
I've eaten. You eat.

75
00:04:14,234 --> 00:04:15,034
You have?

76
00:04:15,433 --> 00:04:15,954
Let me taste.

77
00:04:19,674 --> 00:04:20,314
Good?

78
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:21,233
Delicious.

79
00:04:21,233 --> 00:04:23,393
Something's happened! Get help!

80
00:04:23,713 --> 00:04:24,874
Yan, something's wrong.

81
00:04:24,874 --> 00:04:25,554
Madam.

82
00:04:25,554 --> 00:04:26,314
What happened?

83
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,593
Hard to explain. Yan, maybe you...

84
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:31,074
Alright. I'll check it out.

85
00:04:31,713 --> 00:04:32,393
- Let's go.
- Go.

86
00:04:37,114 --> 00:04:38,514
What's wrong? What happened?

87
00:04:38,913 --> 00:04:40,593
You'd better see for yourself.

88
00:04:43,153 --> 00:04:44,033
(That time,)

89
00:04:44,273 --> 00:04:45,393
(a worker at my dad's mine)

90
00:04:45,393 --> 00:04:46,634
(caused trouble)

91
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:47,833
and hid in the mine.

92
00:04:49,033 --> 00:04:51,353
Later my dad
took many men down to search

93
00:04:51,353 --> 00:04:52,194
but never found him.

94
00:04:52,353 --> 00:04:53,913
I still remember his name.

95
00:04:54,114 --> 00:04:54,954
Li Ergou.

96
00:04:56,434 --> 00:04:57,353
Not long after,

97
00:04:57,353 --> 00:04:58,754
Lin Xirou came to our family.

98
00:04:59,393 --> 00:05:00,314
My dad said

99
00:05:00,994 --> 00:05:02,393
she was Li Ergou's cousin.

100
00:05:06,713 --> 00:05:08,593
So you think Li Ergou

101
00:05:08,634 --> 00:05:10,434
was Lin Xirou's original blood bag?

102
00:05:11,033 --> 00:05:11,833
Yes.

103
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,033
If so,

104
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:16,314
he was also Lin Ling's close kin.

105
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:19,874
However,

106
00:05:20,473 --> 00:05:23,114
Li Ergou was very young
when he disappeared,

107
00:05:23,713 --> 00:05:25,473
so he definitely wasn't her dad.

108
00:05:29,273 --> 00:05:30,393
Regardless of the relation,

109
00:05:31,153 --> 00:05:32,353
Lin Ling is like you.

110
00:05:32,954 --> 00:05:35,153
Both of your families
were destroyed by Lin Xirou.

111
00:05:36,473 --> 00:05:37,194
Moreover,

112
00:05:38,393 --> 00:05:40,393
you've kept treating her as family.

113
00:05:46,314 --> 00:05:50,233
But... even if unhappy,

114
00:05:50,954 --> 00:05:52,393
at least she's alive and well.

115
00:05:53,994 --> 00:05:55,233
As for my sister Yan Xin,

116
00:05:57,233 --> 00:05:58,634
there's been no news at all.

117
00:06:34,674 --> 00:06:36,074
Still worried about Xu Anni?

118
00:06:38,634 --> 00:06:40,273
That man
should've stopped following her.

119
00:06:41,353 --> 00:06:42,194
I'm thinking

120
00:06:43,314 --> 00:06:45,194
about how I should pretend to be Chen Fu

121
00:06:45,233 --> 00:06:46,233
and break up with her.

122
00:06:50,713 --> 00:06:52,954
I read the messages
Xu Anni sent Chen Fu.

123
00:06:53,554 --> 00:06:54,754
She's deeply reliant on him.

124
00:06:55,713 --> 00:06:56,954
I'm afraid his disappearance

125
00:06:57,074 --> 00:06:58,194
will break her.

126
00:06:58,874 --> 00:07:00,233
I need to at least make up a lie

127
00:07:00,393 --> 00:07:01,833
so she can move on with her life.

128
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:12,833
Well,

129
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:16,114
humanoid Earth Fiends
and their roommates

130
00:07:16,114 --> 00:07:17,473
have such close relationships.

131
00:07:17,913 --> 00:07:20,233
If humans get injured by Earth Fiends,

132
00:07:21,114 --> 00:07:22,314
wouldn't they get infected?

133
00:07:27,634 --> 00:07:29,634
I've fought with Xiong Hei,
Han Guan, and Chen Fu

134
00:07:29,634 --> 00:07:31,033
and sustained injuries.

135
00:07:31,353 --> 00:07:32,473
I didn't use natural fire,

136
00:07:32,713 --> 00:07:33,634
yet I wasn't infected.

137
00:07:34,114 --> 00:07:35,233
Humanoid Earth Fiends

138
00:07:35,353 --> 00:07:37,314
can already mask their scent.

139
00:07:37,713 --> 00:07:39,634
Their ability to infect humans

140
00:07:40,114 --> 00:07:41,153
must have weakened too.

141
00:07:42,153 --> 00:07:43,153
That makes sense.

142
00:07:53,153 --> 00:07:53,874
You handle it.

143
00:07:54,353 --> 00:07:54,994
What?

144
00:07:55,314 --> 00:07:56,554
Send the message to Xu Anni.

145
00:07:56,713 --> 00:07:58,273
Aren't you good at this sort of thing?

146
00:07:58,954 --> 00:07:59,713
Why?

147
00:08:00,393 --> 00:08:01,233
Play around casually

148
00:08:01,233 --> 00:08:03,074
and dump girls with flimsy excuses.

149
00:08:03,273 --> 00:08:04,833
Shouldn't this be your specialty?

150
00:08:04,994 --> 00:08:05,674
H-Hold on.

151
00:08:06,273 --> 00:08:08,713
As a modern independent female artist,

152
00:08:08,713 --> 00:08:10,434
why are you so prejudiced against men?

153
00:08:10,913 --> 00:08:12,074
Hurry up and help me.

154
00:08:19,554 --> 00:08:20,194
Alright.

155
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:21,153
Write like this.

156
00:08:23,874 --> 00:08:25,153
During this business trip,

157
00:08:27,634 --> 00:08:29,473
I've calmly reassessed my life

158
00:08:29,514 --> 00:08:31,833
and made new plans.

159
00:08:32,794 --> 00:08:33,794
But I realized

160
00:08:34,074 --> 00:08:35,233
you're not part of them.

161
00:08:36,954 --> 00:08:38,713
This is unfair to you.

162
00:08:39,794 --> 00:08:41,394
I don't want to hold you back.

163
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:44,154
You deserve better opportunities

164
00:08:44,154 --> 00:08:45,633
and broader horizons.

165
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:47,154
That's it.

166
00:08:51,034 --> 00:08:52,113
Just as I thought.

167
00:08:52,513 --> 00:08:53,274
What?

168
00:08:53,513 --> 00:08:54,593
You told me to say it.

169
00:08:54,914 --> 00:08:55,593
Fine.

170
00:08:55,713 --> 00:08:57,154
Say it again, slower this time.

171
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:00,513
What was it?

172
00:09:00,593 --> 00:09:02,233
During this business trip...

173
00:09:02,753 --> 00:09:03,394
Business trip.

174
00:09:03,993 --> 00:09:05,154
During this business trip,

175
00:09:05,353 --> 00:09:07,074
I've calmly reassessed my...

176
00:09:16,713 --> 00:09:18,034
The courtyard is well-maintained.

177
00:09:18,794 --> 00:09:20,113
It's not your first time here.

178
00:09:20,674 --> 00:09:21,513
Just noticed now?

179
00:09:22,873 --> 00:09:24,034
Last time...

180
00:09:24,194 --> 00:09:25,633
You came sneaking around last time

181
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:26,873
and left in a hurry.

182
00:09:26,954 --> 00:09:28,113
You didn't have time for it.

183
00:09:28,794 --> 00:09:30,194
No need to be so sarcastic.

184
00:09:31,674 --> 00:09:32,394
Ms. Lu.

185
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:33,674
Miss Nie.

186
00:09:34,434 --> 00:09:35,713
You've finally returned.

187
00:09:37,554 --> 00:09:38,394
What happened to you?

188
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:42,034
I went to Tuofeng Mountain earlier

189
00:09:42,034 --> 00:09:43,473
to photograph cliff carvings.

190
00:09:43,473 --> 00:09:44,914
I lost my footing and fell.

191
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:46,833
Luckily, Mr. Yan here got me

192
00:09:46,873 --> 00:09:48,074
to the hospital in time.

193
00:09:48,314 --> 00:09:50,194
I didn't tell you to avoid worrying you.

194
00:09:50,713 --> 00:09:51,873
Was it serious?

195
00:09:52,873 --> 00:09:53,914
Almost recovered now.

196
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:55,993
Thank you.

197
00:09:56,074 --> 00:09:57,194
No need for thanks.

198
00:09:57,473 --> 00:09:58,233
You must be hungry.

199
00:09:58,233 --> 00:09:59,314
I'll make something.

200
00:09:59,434 --> 00:10:00,513
We were waiting for that.

201
00:10:00,914 --> 00:10:01,873
Come inside quickly.

202
00:10:01,993 --> 00:10:02,833
Sorry to trouble you.

203
00:10:03,554 --> 00:10:04,554
So you're Mr. Yan?

204
00:10:04,954 --> 00:10:05,993
You're both kind-hearted

205
00:10:05,993 --> 00:10:07,513
and quite handsome.

206
00:10:07,554 --> 00:10:08,473
How old are you?

207
00:10:08,753 --> 00:10:10,873
Ms. Lu, just some noodles will do.

208
00:10:11,113 --> 00:10:12,593
Alright, this way, please.

209
00:11:41,394 --> 00:11:42,034
Careful.

210
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,034
He knows you.

211
00:12:23,954 --> 00:12:25,034
Not me.

212
00:12:27,353 --> 00:12:28,034
But this.

213
00:13:56,353 --> 00:13:57,633
Miss Nie, the noodles are ready.

214
00:13:58,233 --> 00:13:59,074
You're indisposed.

215
00:13:59,074 --> 00:14:00,154
I brought it up for you.

216
00:14:00,154 --> 00:14:00,993
Thank you, Ms. Lu.

217
00:14:05,034 --> 00:14:05,753
Come in.

218
00:14:07,473 --> 00:14:08,034
Is it okay?

219
00:14:09,034 --> 00:14:09,914
Feigned courtesy.

220
00:14:13,194 --> 00:14:14,194
Enjoy.

221
00:14:16,473 --> 00:14:17,274
Thank you.

222
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:17,833
No problem.

223
00:14:20,794 --> 00:14:21,473
Let me.

224
00:14:24,554 --> 00:14:25,873
I got beaten up last time here.

225
00:14:26,113 --> 00:14:27,513
Now I'm here eating noodles.

226
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:28,993
It really feels surreal.

227
00:14:30,713 --> 00:14:32,674
Your last visit destroyed my artwork.

228
00:14:32,753 --> 00:14:35,113
Now I'm treating you to noodles
at the crime scene.

229
00:14:35,194 --> 00:14:36,314
I'm so magnanimous.

230
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:41,513
Name your price.

231
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:42,314
I'll compensate you.

232
00:14:42,753 --> 00:14:44,633
My experimental phase works
aren't valuable.

233
00:14:45,274 --> 00:14:45,954
But the noodles

234
00:14:45,954 --> 00:14:48,074
condense decades
of Ms. Lu's culinary mastery.

235
00:14:48,194 --> 00:14:49,314
I need to calculate

236
00:14:49,554 --> 00:14:50,633
the compensation.

237
00:14:52,074 --> 00:14:53,633
Keeping such clear accounts with me?

238
00:14:54,993 --> 00:14:55,593
Fine.

239
00:14:57,154 --> 00:14:59,154
Then for my kidnapping and trafficking,

240
00:14:59,353 --> 00:15:00,434
how much are you paying me?

241
00:15:02,473 --> 00:15:04,593
How much will you pay for you driving us

242
00:15:04,753 --> 00:15:05,554
into the river?

243
00:15:05,954 --> 00:15:06,593
And you...

244
00:15:09,154 --> 00:15:09,794
Let's eat.

245
00:15:16,794 --> 00:15:18,473
Where did you
find this great housekeeper?

246
00:15:18,633 --> 00:15:19,633
Her cooking's phenomenal.

247
00:15:20,113 --> 00:15:22,034
She's more like family than staff.

248
00:15:22,633 --> 00:15:23,554
I got lucky

249
00:15:23,554 --> 00:15:25,034
finding Ms. Lu on my first try.

250
00:15:25,074 --> 00:15:26,314
She's been working for me.

251
00:15:31,353 --> 00:15:32,473
If you're that close,

252
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:33,993
why does she call you 'Miss Nie'?

253
00:15:34,074 --> 00:15:35,113
It sounds so formal.

254
00:15:37,633 --> 00:15:39,074
I've actually told her many times

255
00:15:39,713 --> 00:15:40,873
to just call me Luo.

256
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,034
But Ms. Lu insists boundaries are needed

257
00:15:43,034 --> 00:15:44,554
for employer-employee relationships.

258
00:15:44,954 --> 00:15:46,233
Hence the Miss Nie title.

259
00:15:46,633 --> 00:15:47,753
I respect her choice.

260
00:16:01,113 --> 00:16:01,833
What did you say?

261
00:16:06,954 --> 00:16:07,554
Can...

262
00:16:10,034 --> 00:16:11,034
Can I call you Luo?

263
00:16:19,074 --> 00:16:19,674
Okay.

264
00:16:38,513 --> 00:16:41,034
These are all your diaries?

265
00:16:43,194 --> 00:16:45,034
You have my permission
to pick one to read.

266
00:16:45,674 --> 00:16:46,233
Really?

267
00:16:51,713 --> 00:16:52,394
I pick this one.

268
00:17:01,513 --> 00:17:03,034
"Won an award for the clay figurine.

269
00:17:03,154 --> 00:17:03,794
Happy.

270
00:17:03,914 --> 00:17:06,033
Also keyed that dirty old man's car.

271
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:06,993
Even happier."

272
00:17:07,634 --> 00:17:08,993
Who's this 'dirty old man'?

273
00:17:10,473 --> 00:17:12,394
An art teacher
from an after-school cram school.

274
00:17:12,753 --> 00:17:14,513
He kept groping the female students.

275
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:16,634
I used my house keys

276
00:17:17,154 --> 00:17:18,354
to scratch his crappy car

277
00:17:18,473 --> 00:17:19,634
with a huge line.

278
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:21,753
He said to call the police.

279
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,914
I said, "Great, let's tell them

280
00:17:23,993 --> 00:17:25,954
how you've been harassing girls."

281
00:17:29,553 --> 00:17:30,954
Such righteousness since childhood.

282
00:17:35,394 --> 00:17:36,834
When you have no one to protect you,

283
00:17:37,914 --> 00:17:39,273
you naturally put on

284
00:17:39,273 --> 00:17:40,473
an intimidating front.

285
00:17:41,753 --> 00:17:43,073
If you're pampered,

286
00:17:44,473 --> 00:17:45,914
you can afford to be gracious.

287
00:17:47,154 --> 00:17:49,114
But when you only have yourself,

288
00:17:49,874 --> 00:17:51,473
you fight tooth and nail.

289
00:17:54,834 --> 00:17:55,634
What about now?

290
00:17:58,194 --> 00:17:59,473
Have you found someone

291
00:18:00,354 --> 00:18:01,434
to take care of you?

292
00:18:02,553 --> 00:18:04,354
Someone to pamper you

293
00:18:04,473 --> 00:18:05,674
and make you more tolerant?

294
00:18:10,874 --> 00:18:11,674
Not sure.

295
00:18:23,114 --> 00:18:24,394
Haven't written today's entry?

296
00:18:24,674 --> 00:18:25,233
Here.

297
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:47,088
(Finally home.)

298
00:18:51,434 --> 00:18:55,664
(Ate Ms. Lu's noodles)

299
00:19:04,586 --> 00:19:06,096
(together with Yan Tuo.)

300
00:19:10,874 --> 00:19:12,073
Can you fold paper stars?

301
00:19:13,313 --> 00:19:14,073
No, I can't.

302
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:16,073
I'll teach you.

303
00:19:20,313 --> 00:19:21,194
First,

304
00:19:21,674 --> 00:19:23,394
tie it like a bow.

That completes the star.

311
00:20:04,874 --> 00:20:05,394
Like this?

312
00:20:10,513 --> 00:20:11,233
What's that?

313
00:20:12,273 --> 00:20:13,793
It represents another day gone by.

314
00:20:27,354 --> 00:20:28,114
Mr. Yan,

00:20:28,634 --> 00:20:30,114
your room is ready.

Qin Chi, right?

That's what the file says.

337
00:23:11,313 --> 00:23:12,033
My fault.

338
00:23:12,674 --> 00:23:13,954
It was a poorly chosen name.

339
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:16,513
He truly arrived too late.

340
00:23:18,793 --> 00:23:19,834
Very few people

341
00:23:20,914 --> 00:23:21,954
can access this place.

342
00:23:23,634 --> 00:23:25,553
We couldn't reach Li Yueying?

343
00:23:27,273 --> 00:23:28,354
The mine sent word.

344
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:30,354
Li Yueying went there.

345
00:23:37,033 --> 00:23:38,793
I do owe her.

346
00:23:41,394 --> 00:23:42,594
Let's go to the mine.

347
00:23:43,233 --> 00:23:44,594
You two clean this up.

348
00:23:46,033 --> 00:23:47,154
Should I accompany you?

349
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,600
Xiong Hei and Feng Mi can stay...

350
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:41,954
Why?

351
00:24:46,674 --> 00:24:47,674
Does it matter?

352
00:25:08,354 --> 00:25:09,553
I was the first

353
00:25:10,194 --> 00:25:11,634
to emerge from below.

354
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:13,753
I survived

355
00:25:14,394 --> 00:25:15,874
only by heaven's mercy.

356
00:25:17,114 --> 00:25:19,434
When I first saw the world

357
00:25:19,674 --> 00:25:21,354
in human form under sunlight,

358
00:25:22,553 --> 00:25:23,954
I felt no relief,

359
00:25:24,394 --> 00:25:25,394
only fear.

360
00:25:26,713 --> 00:25:28,594
Even after consuming that miner,

361
00:25:28,834 --> 00:25:30,154
my first blood bag,

362
00:25:30,594 --> 00:25:32,793
and my body stabilized,

363
00:25:33,753 --> 00:25:36,874
and I even learned to blend
into human society,

364
00:25:37,594 --> 00:25:39,553
the fear remained.

365
00:25:42,513 --> 00:25:44,473
Do you know when

366
00:25:45,033 --> 00:25:46,273
my fear finally faded?

367
00:25:49,914 --> 00:25:51,394
It was when I saw you

368
00:25:51,874 --> 00:25:53,553
successfully transformed too.

369
00:25:54,914 --> 00:25:56,793
My heart found peace at last.

370
00:25:58,194 --> 00:25:59,434
In this world,

371
00:26:00,473 --> 00:26:02,834
I was no longer a lonely aberration.

372
00:26:07,634 --> 00:26:09,434
You call this success?

373
00:26:12,954 --> 00:26:14,713
We had no experience back then.

374
00:26:16,394 --> 00:26:19,194
In haste, I made you eat that blood bag.

375
00:26:20,713 --> 00:26:23,033
You became alarmingly weak,

376
00:26:23,194 --> 00:26:24,914
even losing consciousness.

377
00:26:25,914 --> 00:26:27,993
Only then did we realize
the blood bag was tainted

378
00:26:29,634 --> 00:26:31,033
and couldn't produce offspring.

379
00:26:33,434 --> 00:26:35,713
All companions from your batch

380
00:26:36,473 --> 00:26:37,993
failed to survive.

381
00:26:40,114 --> 00:26:42,753
During those bleak, hopeless days,

382
00:26:43,354 --> 00:26:44,194
only you

383
00:26:44,753 --> 00:26:46,394
had seen the outside world.

384
00:26:51,553 --> 00:26:52,394
Filthy.

385
00:26:53,114 --> 00:26:53,793
Dark.

386
00:26:54,634 --> 00:26:55,394
Foul-smelling.

387
00:26:56,993 --> 00:26:59,594
Those are human prejudices about sewers.

388
00:27:01,313 --> 00:27:03,033
But for rats,

389
00:27:05,194 --> 00:27:06,354
it's paradise.

390
00:27:08,273 --> 00:27:09,634
To you,

391
00:27:10,033 --> 00:27:12,154
wearing this human shell

392
00:27:13,033 --> 00:27:15,753
and feeling sunlight and greenery

393
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:18,194
is a divine blessing.

394
00:27:19,273 --> 00:27:22,874
But I only feel dread, loss,

395
00:27:23,674 --> 00:27:24,954
and disorientation.

396
00:27:26,513 --> 00:27:28,553
How could you make me

397
00:27:28,553 --> 00:27:30,594
live in this half-dead body

398
00:27:31,713 --> 00:27:33,434
and pretend obedience

399
00:27:33,914 --> 00:27:35,713
before you,

400
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:38,874
feigning gratitude?

401
00:27:39,194 --> 00:27:41,634
So you'd kill your own
whose roots aren't removed?

402
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:45,753
The method for safe root removal

403
00:27:46,354 --> 00:27:49,154
was discovered
through our joint efforts.

404
00:27:50,753 --> 00:27:53,233
They became robust,

405
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:54,954
ageless, and strong,

406
00:27:56,073 --> 00:27:58,154
taking it for granted.

407
00:28:00,434 --> 00:28:03,114
They look at me with pity,

408
00:28:04,114 --> 00:28:06,033
as if I'm defective

409
00:28:07,073 --> 00:28:08,513
and I'm a monster.

410
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:12,033
Fine.

411
00:28:12,914 --> 00:28:13,914
It doesn't matter.

412
00:28:14,354 --> 00:28:15,793
None of that matters.

413
00:28:18,354 --> 00:28:19,793
But when I saw you

414
00:28:19,793 --> 00:28:22,233
execute Gou Ya without blinking

415
00:28:23,594 --> 00:28:26,834
and justify it as 'following rules,'

416
00:28:29,313 --> 00:28:31,354
I finally understood

417
00:28:33,313 --> 00:28:35,194
that my days are numbered.

418
00:28:37,073 --> 00:28:38,154
I just hoped

419
00:28:38,753 --> 00:28:40,194
my future companions

420
00:28:41,954 --> 00:28:44,233
would never come to this human world.

421
00:28:47,273 --> 00:28:47,954
No.

422
00:28:49,273 --> 00:28:51,114
This isn't the human world.

423
00:28:52,954 --> 00:28:54,834
It's purgatory.

424
00:29:05,713 --> 00:29:06,874
The sun is about to rise.

425
00:29:09,033 --> 00:29:10,473
You should head back now.

426
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:38,473
Ms. Lu,

427
00:30:39,753 --> 00:30:40,513
where's Yan Tuo?

428
00:30:42,033 --> 00:30:42,993
You're awake.

429
00:30:43,553 --> 00:30:44,914
He left early this morning.

430
00:30:56,330 --> 00:31:00,938
(Work is piling up. I need to handle it.
Rest well, and contact me anytime.)

431
00:31:07,154 --> 00:31:08,394
Alright, Miss Nie.

432
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:09,954
Time for some exercise.

433
00:31:10,674 --> 00:31:11,513
What exercise?

434
00:31:12,473 --> 00:31:13,194
To rehabilitate.

435
00:31:13,594 --> 00:31:15,073
Mr. Yan ordered the equipment.

436
00:31:15,594 --> 00:31:16,634
I've been busy with it

437
00:31:16,793 --> 00:31:17,713
all this morning.

438
00:31:54,513 --> 00:31:55,154
Shift change.

439
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:58,313
I just fell asleep.

440
00:31:58,753 --> 00:32:00,434
Stop whining. Get up.

441
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:01,753
Bro.

442
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:02,273
Up!

443
00:32:02,273 --> 00:32:03,154
Bro.

444
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:03,753
It hurts.

445
00:32:04,154 --> 00:32:04,713
It hurts.

446
00:32:04,993 --> 00:32:06,154
I've been searching forever.

447
00:32:06,354 --> 00:32:07,713
Fine, I'll go.

448
00:32:09,793 --> 00:32:10,753
Sleep carefully.

449
00:32:10,753 --> 00:32:11,553
It's full of bugs.

450
00:32:21,753 --> 00:32:23,273
Before Mr. Yan left,

451
00:32:23,753 --> 00:32:25,793
he kept telling me

452
00:32:25,874 --> 00:32:27,434
to take good care of you.

453
00:32:29,313 --> 00:32:30,313
When he left,

454
00:32:31,473 --> 00:32:33,273
he wanted to pick an osmanthus branch.

455
00:32:34,033 --> 00:32:34,713
I stopped him.

456
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:36,553
Why?

457
00:32:40,354 --> 00:32:41,513
I mean,

458
00:32:41,954 --> 00:32:43,114
he saved my life.

459
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:44,753
Picking one flower branch

460
00:32:45,073 --> 00:32:46,233
shouldn't be a big deal.

461
00:32:46,914 --> 00:32:47,914
I told him

462
00:32:48,354 --> 00:32:49,473
plucked flowers

463
00:32:49,553 --> 00:32:50,874
lose their fragrance quickly.

464
00:32:51,233 --> 00:32:52,394
I suggested he should

465
00:32:52,513 --> 00:32:53,993
visit more often to enjoy the blooms.

466
00:33:03,313 --> 00:33:04,033
Mr. Changxi.

467
00:33:04,753 --> 00:33:06,793
Miss Nie, how's your recovery going?

468
00:33:07,954 --> 00:33:09,954
Much better now. Thank you.

469
00:33:10,674 --> 00:33:11,553
Well,

470
00:33:11,993 --> 00:33:13,073
my attic

471
00:33:13,073 --> 00:33:14,793
might have aging floorboards.

472
00:33:14,954 --> 00:33:17,233
I keep hearing creaking noises lately.

473
00:33:17,834 --> 00:33:19,194
With the recent rains,

474
00:33:19,473 --> 00:33:20,954
I fear your items might get damp.

475
00:33:21,434 --> 00:33:23,114
Should I move them elsewhere for you?

476
00:33:23,114 --> 00:33:23,834
Mr. Changxi,

477
00:33:24,914 --> 00:33:26,553
I actually need

478
00:33:26,594 --> 00:33:27,753
to use those soon.

479
00:33:28,073 --> 00:33:29,273
No need to trouble you.

480
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:30,713
I'll come get them myself later.

481
00:33:31,553 --> 00:33:33,713
Alright. Come anytime. I'll be here.

482
00:33:34,313 --> 00:33:35,834
Great. Thanks, Mr. Changxi.

483
00:34:04,434 --> 00:34:07,313
Yuwang Meat often mixes
within Turquoise Land.

484
00:34:08,113 --> 00:34:09,874
The purest one resembles a jellyfish

485
00:34:10,153 --> 00:34:10,993
with a jade sheen.

486
00:34:11,314 --> 00:34:13,914
It feels like rich butter
and glows by night.

487
00:34:14,513 --> 00:34:17,354
Ancient South Mountain hunter Tu
one found it.

488
00:34:17,473 --> 00:34:19,754
His hounds ate it
and then preyed on rabbits.

489
00:34:19,754 --> 00:34:21,394
They died suddenly that day.

490
00:34:22,113 --> 00:34:23,714
Their corpses buried in Turquoise Land

491
00:34:23,834 --> 00:34:25,633
rotted and spawned strange beasts.

492
00:34:25,993 --> 00:34:28,593
They had long ears, sharp teeth,
red eyes, and mad howls,

493
00:34:28,754 --> 00:34:31,354
resembling hounds and rabbits,
yet they were no hound or rabbit.

494
00:34:35,113 --> 00:34:36,874
Resembling hounds and rabbits,

495
00:34:38,274 --> 00:34:39,633
yet neither hound nor rabbit.

496
00:34:40,434 --> 00:34:41,633
So Yuwang Meat

497
00:34:42,834 --> 00:34:45,234
could merge two species.

498
00:34:49,113 --> 00:34:49,633
Well...

499
00:34:54,754 --> 00:34:56,153
South Mountain County Chronicles.

500
00:34:57,033 --> 00:34:59,274
Yuwang Meat regenerates endlessly

501
00:34:59,513 --> 00:35:01,714
and regrows to its original form.

502
00:35:01,954 --> 00:35:04,073
Eating it strengthens vitality,

503
00:35:04,673 --> 00:35:06,754
granting the longevity
of the turtle and the crane.

504
00:35:06,954 --> 00:35:09,673
Its eaters must retreat
from the mortal world

505
00:35:09,794 --> 00:35:12,553
and cultivate immortality in mountains.

506
00:35:13,314 --> 00:35:15,874
The emperor sought immortality methods

507
00:35:16,193 --> 00:35:18,314
and sent officials
to sail east for elixirs.

508
00:35:18,874 --> 00:35:21,354
Qin troops entered South Mountain

509
00:35:21,513 --> 00:35:22,754
for this very reason.

510
00:35:23,993 --> 00:35:25,434
Immortality?

511
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:46,576
(Ancient Texts)

512
00:35:55,354 --> 00:35:56,834
There was another named Han Guan.

513
00:35:56,834 --> 00:35:58,033
I've already dealt with him.

514
00:35:58,593 --> 00:35:59,633
This one's Chen Fu.

515
00:35:59,914 --> 00:36:01,234
No space to hide at my place.

516
00:36:06,714 --> 00:36:08,274
Leave him here. It's safe.

517
00:36:14,394 --> 00:36:15,314
Recently,

518
00:36:15,593 --> 00:36:17,954
I sorted out Earth Fiends'
human-transformation logic

519
00:36:18,073 --> 00:36:19,193
and got the basic pattern.

520
00:36:20,593 --> 00:36:21,314
Go ahead.

521
00:36:23,354 --> 00:36:24,673
When Earth Fiends become human,

522
00:36:25,153 --> 00:36:26,394
they need human nutrients

523
00:36:26,394 --> 00:36:27,794
to maintain their forms.

524
00:36:29,193 --> 00:36:29,954
Such humans

525
00:36:31,354 --> 00:36:32,234
are called blood bags.

526
00:36:34,434 --> 00:36:37,314
So they must constantly capture humans.

527
00:36:37,794 --> 00:36:38,714
It's more complicated.

528
00:36:39,513 --> 00:36:41,513
Blood bags require strict selection.

529
00:36:42,314 --> 00:36:44,673
Each generation
must be a direct bloodline.

530
00:36:46,234 --> 00:36:47,394
Otherwise,

531
00:36:48,073 --> 00:36:49,434
Earth Fiends commit omnivory,

532
00:36:50,153 --> 00:36:51,954
letting Hound Clan smell them

533
00:36:52,234 --> 00:36:53,113
and expose themselves.

534
00:36:54,113 --> 00:36:56,673
When Big Head smelled a fiendish scent
in Yan Tuo's car

535
00:36:57,354 --> 00:36:58,794
because Gou Ya in the trunk

536
00:36:58,794 --> 00:37:00,193
omnivorized in the welfare home.

537
00:37:00,834 --> 00:37:02,434
If the requirements are this strict,

538
00:37:04,874 --> 00:37:06,153
how can they ensure

539
00:37:06,434 --> 00:37:08,234
the continuous supply of the blood bags?

540
00:37:09,434 --> 00:37:10,593
To control the blood bags,

541
00:37:11,234 --> 00:37:12,553
the Earth Fiends live with them

542
00:37:12,553 --> 00:37:13,874
as family members.

543
00:37:15,473 --> 00:37:17,434
Just like Chen Fu's girlfriend, Xu Anni,

544
00:37:18,473 --> 00:37:19,633
who never knew

545
00:37:19,633 --> 00:37:20,993
that she was in danger.

546
00:37:21,954 --> 00:37:23,234
If the blood bags

547
00:37:23,234 --> 00:37:24,993
are merely
their life-extending medicine,

548
00:37:25,593 --> 00:37:26,754
what exactly is the key

549
00:37:26,914 --> 00:37:29,153
that first transformed the Earth Fiends

550
00:37:30,553 --> 00:37:31,553
from beasts to humans?

551
00:37:39,274 --> 00:37:40,513
I'll wake him and question him.

552
00:37:41,874 --> 00:37:42,914
I've already done that.

553
00:37:43,234 --> 00:37:44,874
He didn't reveal any useful information.

554
00:37:46,033 --> 00:37:47,354
He even bit his own tongue.

555
00:37:48,394 --> 00:37:49,314
The Earth Fiends now

556
00:37:49,993 --> 00:37:51,553
not only possess human intelligence,

557
00:37:51,553 --> 00:37:52,683
consciousness, and emotions,

558
00:37:52,944 --> 00:37:54,354
but also have developed integrity.

559
00:37:56,914 --> 00:37:57,794
They have long

560
00:37:57,993 --> 00:37:59,794
been different from the beasts

561
00:37:59,794 --> 00:38:00,524
our ancestors saw.

562
00:38:02,874 --> 00:38:03,633
How do you know

563
00:38:04,673 --> 00:38:06,033
all these things?

564
00:38:06,754 --> 00:38:08,153
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

565
00:38:11,754 --> 00:38:13,274
Something came up and delayed me.

566
00:38:14,434 --> 00:38:15,914
Thankfully, Yan Tuo helped out.

567
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:17,234
It was a close call.

568
00:38:22,553 --> 00:38:23,193
Luo,

569
00:38:25,234 --> 00:38:26,193
you're Mad Blade.

570
