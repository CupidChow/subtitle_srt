=Episode 21=

17
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,841
No more pickles.

18
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:49,360
Don't fill up on pickles now.

19
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,561
- Here.
- Coming.

20
00:01:50,561 --> 00:01:53,201
One bowl of soul-reviving noodles
to cure fatigue.

21
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,681
Come on.

22
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,921
Careful, it's hot.

23
00:01:55,921 --> 00:01:57,800
Slow down.

24
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,121
Let me handle that.

25
00:01:59,121 --> 00:02:01,401
I love the noodles
Quecha makes. So tasty.

26
00:02:01,401 --> 00:02:02,160
Right.

27
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,360
Slow down.

28
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,240
Some toppings.

29
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,761
Eat with us.

30
00:02:05,761 --> 00:02:06,561
Fantastic.

31
00:02:06,641 --> 00:02:07,520
Come on.

32
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,121
Smells amazing.

33
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,081
Can we finish it all?

34
00:02:10,081 --> 00:02:10,961
My turn now?

35
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,361
Hold on.

36
00:02:13,121 --> 00:02:14,841
Your snoring kept everyone awake.

37
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,561
When do I snore?

38
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,480
Not just snoring,
you grind your teeth too.

39
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,600
Why not mention his farting?

40
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,401
Who? You're the farter.

41
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,521
It's from Jiang's phone.

42
00:02:24,521 --> 00:02:25,200
Give me some too.

43
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:25,880
Here.

44
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,281
(Jiang Baichuan)
Who wants more toppings?

45
00:02:27,561 --> 00:02:28,561
No more for me.

46
00:02:29,241 --> 00:02:30,241
Just got more.

47
00:02:31,521 --> 00:02:32,281
Delicious.

48
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,521
How are my people?

49
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,001
Earth Fiends are tough.

50
00:02:48,121 --> 00:02:49,600
They won't die easily.

51
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,841
But under my watch,

52
00:02:53,561 --> 00:02:55,160
we've got many hot-headed hunters.

53
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,640
They might lose control
if this drags on.

54
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,600
True, Earth Fiends are resilient.

55
00:03:06,801 --> 00:03:09,600
But Jiang Baichuan isn't an Earth Fiend.

56
00:03:11,241 --> 00:03:12,640
Those four Earth Fiends

57
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,040
must be important to you.

58
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,640
Why else did you hide them so securely?

59
00:03:17,841 --> 00:03:19,521
Since we both have bargaining chips,

60
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,081
let's negotiate directly.

61
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:25,720
All terms are on the table.

62
00:03:26,001 --> 00:03:27,281
Nothing left to negotiate.

63
00:03:27,801 --> 00:03:30,801
Fine. Five for five then.

64
00:03:32,521 --> 00:03:35,760
Jiang Baichuan and four hunters

65
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:38,160
for my four companions

66
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,521
and Lin Ling.

67
00:03:41,401 --> 00:03:44,001
I don't know any Lin Ling.

68
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,640
She's not here.

69
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,841
But I have not just four fresh ones

70
00:03:50,001 --> 00:03:52,121
but also an old friend of yours.

71
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,241
Who?

72
00:03:53,841 --> 00:03:54,521
Chen Fu.

73
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:06,081
(Quecha)
How about adding one more each?

74
00:04:09,361 --> 00:04:10,401
Meaning?

75
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,081
Besides Jiang Baichuan
and four other hunters,

76
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,720
I want one more person.

77
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,241
Who is it?

78
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,561
Yan Tuo.

79
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,131
You won't eat thrown-down food.

80
00:05:22,371 --> 00:05:25,050
You'll take it
if I deliver it personally, right?

81
00:05:36,234 --> 00:05:37,073
Got a mirror?

82
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:42,513
Why?

83
00:05:45,794 --> 00:05:46,874
Just want to see

84
00:05:47,994 --> 00:05:49,474
if I still look human.

85
00:05:55,466 --> 00:05:56,106
Thanks.

86
00:05:56,714 --> 00:05:58,515
You're throwing away a good life.

87
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:01,274
Is it worth it?

88
00:06:03,594 --> 00:06:06,435
I thought of all people...

89
00:06:07,395 --> 00:06:08,994
you'd be the one to believe me.

90
00:06:12,474 --> 00:06:13,794
How can I believe you?

91
00:06:35,635 --> 00:06:37,594
Xiong, Feng insisted...

92
00:06:45,195 --> 00:06:45,794
Xiong Hei.

93
00:07:00,234 --> 00:07:02,354
Four of my closest companions

94
00:07:02,474 --> 00:07:03,994
disappeared together.

95
00:07:05,075 --> 00:07:06,794
Do you know what happened?

96
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:10,075
I've been locked up here.

97
00:07:10,435 --> 00:07:12,354
How would I know about outside affairs?

98
00:07:13,594 --> 00:07:14,474
Where's Lin Ling?

99
00:07:15,195 --> 00:07:16,394
Where is she now?

100
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:20,810
Lin Ling is also missing?

101
00:07:22,971 --> 00:07:26,251
Xiong, what's going on with you?

102
00:07:26,731 --> 00:07:29,211
How could you be so careless
as to lose five people at once?

103
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:31,890
The South Mountain Hunters
proposed a hostage exchange.

104
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,650
They want to trade
four of our missing members

105
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:35,890
for Jiang Baichuan

106
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,410
and

107
00:07:38,251 --> 00:07:39,971
another person.

108
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,170
Guess who?

109
00:07:45,834 --> 00:07:47,393
If you don't trust me,

110
00:07:49,514 --> 00:07:51,954
everything that happens
would somehow be my fault.

111
00:07:52,474 --> 00:07:52,954
What else...

112
00:07:52,954 --> 00:07:53,594
It's you.

113
00:08:04,153 --> 00:08:06,033
The extra exchange target is you.

114
00:08:08,594 --> 00:08:09,594
Me?

115
00:08:12,106 --> 00:08:13,506
You've always been like this.

116
00:08:14,346 --> 00:08:18,067
Obedient and compliant on the surface,

117
00:08:19,187 --> 00:08:23,027
but when you make mistakes,
you'll never admit them.

118
00:08:24,506 --> 00:08:26,147
Unless I catch you red-handed,

119
00:08:26,947 --> 00:08:28,787
you'll take the denial to your grave.

120
00:08:30,538 --> 00:08:31,379
In fifth grade,

121
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:35,178
I remember it was summer,

122
00:08:35,578 --> 00:08:36,739
and I lied to you,

123
00:08:38,578 --> 00:08:40,899
telling you school
required 50 yuan for materials.

124
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:45,979
But secretly, I used that money

125
00:08:47,139 --> 00:08:48,339
to buy CDs.

126
00:08:49,098 --> 00:08:50,458
Later, when you did laundry,

127
00:08:50,539 --> 00:08:52,018
you found 10 yuan left in my pocket.

128
00:08:53,978 --> 00:08:56,378
You claimed the teacher
praised your grades

129
00:08:57,338 --> 00:08:58,419
and gave us a discount.

130
00:08:59,179 --> 00:09:01,019
Then you gave me another 100 yuan,

131
00:09:03,858 --> 00:09:06,179
telling me to buy whatever I wanted.

132
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:09,730
You said,

133
00:09:11,129 --> 00:09:12,210
"My child"

134
00:09:13,809 --> 00:09:16,490
"should never skulk around timidly."

135
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,570
"If you want something,"

136
00:09:20,289 --> 00:09:22,730
"claim it openly and boldly."

137
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:27,809
"Even if you must seize it,"

138
00:09:29,049 --> 00:09:30,289
"satisfy your desires."

139
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:39,490
I won't give you 100 yuan this time.

140
00:09:41,409 --> 00:09:43,370
I've given you too many chances,

141
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:46,330
all squandered by you.

142
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:06,850
I'm sorry.

143
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,210
I truly

144
00:10:13,129 --> 00:10:14,730
considered you family all along.

145
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:16,690
I genuinely wanted

146
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,370
to live harmoniously with you.

147
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:32,649
What a pity

148
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,769
that I happened to read that diary.

149
00:10:42,049 --> 00:10:42,850
It was you

150
00:10:43,929 --> 00:10:45,409
who killed my parents.

151
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,570
Did you think stealing Lin Xirou's name

152
00:10:50,289 --> 00:10:52,009
and inheriting Roadsound Mining

153
00:10:52,009 --> 00:10:53,330
would make you my mother?

154
00:10:54,009 --> 00:10:56,250
That you could become a proper human?

155
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,850
You're no Lin Xirou.

156
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:03,450
No.

157
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,289
You all

158
00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:10,169
aren't even worthy
of having human names.

159
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,850
Lin Xirou called using Jiang's phone.

160
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,370
She proposed a hostage exchange.

161
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,169
Perfect.

162
00:12:17,409 --> 00:12:18,929
She's starting to get anxious.

163
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:21,690
How did your talk go?

164
00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:24,850
We just showed each other our cards.

165
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,370
We haven't gotten to the details yet.

166
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,289
That's why I

167
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,490
called you first to discuss it

168
00:12:35,049 --> 00:12:36,450
to see how we should proceed.

169
00:12:39,274 --> 00:12:40,115
I've moved Lin Ling

170
00:12:40,115 --> 00:12:41,514
to a secure location.

171
00:12:43,274 --> 00:12:44,995
If Lin Xirou bargains,

172
00:12:45,235 --> 00:12:46,315
use it to string her along.

173
00:12:46,674 --> 00:12:49,554
No wonder Lin Xirou
also mentioned Lin Ling.

174
00:12:49,794 --> 00:12:51,955
But I didn't know
you had already rescued her.

175
00:12:52,195 --> 00:12:53,434
So I didn't respond.

176
00:12:53,715 --> 00:12:55,955
It's fine. It was an emergency.

177
00:12:58,674 --> 00:13:00,355
But I mentioned another person.

178
00:13:02,995 --> 00:13:03,595
Who?

179
00:13:05,514 --> 00:13:06,195
Yan Tuo.

180
00:13:11,914 --> 00:13:14,115
W-What are you saying?

181
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:17,434
You said Lin Xirou confined him,

182
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,034
and you wanted to save him.

183
00:13:19,794 --> 00:13:20,835
So I thought

184
00:13:21,355 --> 00:13:22,554
we could use him

185
00:13:22,554 --> 00:13:23,835
as an exchange bargaining chip.

186
00:13:23,914 --> 00:13:25,554
You told Lin Xirou

187
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,075
we want Yan Tuo in exchange?

188
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,715
Lin Xirou was already
suspecting Yan Tuo.

189
00:13:33,955 --> 00:13:36,075
You confirmed her suspicions
about him as a traitor.

190
00:13:36,595 --> 00:13:38,634
Creating more chaos for them

191
00:13:38,858 --> 00:13:40,537
gives us better odds.

192
00:13:41,817 --> 00:13:42,618
Xing Shen,

193
00:13:43,754 --> 00:13:45,034
from beginning to end,

194
00:13:46,713 --> 00:13:48,433
you've only cared about yourself.

195
00:16:19,434 --> 00:16:21,833
Why are humans afraid of the dark?

196
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:28,954
Humans aren't afraid of the dark.

197
00:16:29,714 --> 00:16:31,313
They're afraid of the unknown.

198
00:16:32,874 --> 00:16:34,833
When everything is clear and obvious,

199
00:16:35,634 --> 00:16:37,073
and there's no unknown,

200
00:16:37,954 --> 00:16:39,313
then we're afraid of nothing.

201
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,793
If the unknown doesn't even exist,

202
00:16:42,674 --> 00:16:45,434
then reverence vanishes.

203
00:16:46,394 --> 00:16:48,474
Humans always make similar mistakes.

204
00:16:49,313 --> 00:16:52,234
They tend to cross boundaries
that should be respected.

205
00:16:57,553 --> 00:16:59,073
Since you look down on humans so much,

206
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:02,593
why insist on being human then?

207
00:17:03,914 --> 00:17:05,394
We're also afraid of the dark.

208
00:17:08,073 --> 00:17:11,954
As long as our kind can live in peace,

209
00:17:12,634 --> 00:17:15,273
without fear and panic,

210
00:17:15,914 --> 00:17:17,234
we'll do whatever it takes.

211
00:17:18,674 --> 00:17:21,234
But this privilege is only granted

212
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:22,513
to humans.

213
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,593
Humans earned these rights
through effort,

214
00:17:29,234 --> 00:17:32,793
not by consuming human flesh and blood.

215
00:17:34,474 --> 00:17:35,194
Right.

216
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,154
Efforts to create wars,

217
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,194
efforts to spread diseases,

218
00:17:40,994 --> 00:17:44,154
massacring countless lives
yet being glorified for eternity.

219
00:17:46,714 --> 00:17:48,033
All I wanted

220
00:17:48,313 --> 00:17:51,194
was to build a home under the sun.

221
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,833
Yet I'm labeled as utterly evil.

222
00:17:54,986 --> 00:17:56,066
I brought you here

223
00:17:56,667 --> 00:17:59,026
because this is where I originated.

224
00:17:59,986 --> 00:18:02,107
Humans and fiends,
and fiends and humans.

225
00:18:02,867 --> 00:18:05,347
No need to distinguish them here.

226
00:18:09,387 --> 00:18:11,147
This will be your home from now on.

227
00:18:13,306 --> 00:18:15,546
Since everything's laid bare,

228
00:18:16,546 --> 00:18:18,147
you have nothing to fear.

229
00:18:20,706 --> 00:18:21,387
Home?

230
00:18:22,706 --> 00:18:23,786
I can't remember

231
00:18:24,466 --> 00:18:27,746
how many years it's been
since I had my own home.

232
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:30,667
Do you think I still have a home?

233
00:18:33,147 --> 00:18:34,667
The only one in this world

234
00:18:34,667 --> 00:18:36,667
that let me pretend to be human

235
00:18:37,347 --> 00:18:38,107
was you.

236
00:18:39,706 --> 00:18:40,627
But Tuo,

237
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:42,347
without you,

238
00:18:42,947 --> 00:18:44,266
I lose my home too.

239
00:18:45,347 --> 00:18:47,107
You've deceived me many times,

240
00:18:48,066 --> 00:18:49,387
but none of it was your fault.

241
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,706
The one helping you deceive me
wasn't Lin Ling,

242
00:18:52,786 --> 00:18:53,907
Lv Xian,

243
00:18:54,147 --> 00:18:56,427
or your artist girlfriend.

244
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:00,449
Your greatest accomplice all along

245
00:19:03,489 --> 00:19:04,370
was me.

246
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:07,930
I helped you

247
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:10,249
deceive myself repeatedly,

248
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,170
convincing myself.

249
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:20,890
But such things

250
00:19:21,729 --> 00:19:22,890
won't happen again.

251
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:26,170
Because 'home'

252
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:28,769
is just a fabricated concept of yours.

253
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:31,090
Better off without it.

254
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:36,610
I have my own kind, my clan.

255
00:19:37,249 --> 00:19:39,449
They're what truly matter to me.

256
00:19:49,049 --> 00:19:50,410
From today onward,

257
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:53,769
humans stay human,
and fiends stay fiends.

258
00:19:54,489 --> 00:19:56,810
We'll keep clear boundaries.

259
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,610
Only this much after purification?

260
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:42,451
It resembles a jellyfish
with a jade sheen.

261
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,090
This must be it.

262
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:48,330
Jellyfish.

263
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,850
Edible jellyfish, delicious.

264
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:55,090
We can't eat this.

265
00:20:57,771 --> 00:20:59,370
Though we could let it try.

266
00:21:25,251 --> 00:21:25,931
Never mind.

267
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:28,451
Yan Tuo?

268
00:21:28,691 --> 00:21:29,370
Don't save me.

269
00:21:31,171 --> 00:21:31,931
Let go.

270
00:23:15,786 --> 00:23:22,097
(Peaceful)

271
00:23:22,097 --> 00:23:28,232
(Homecoming)

272
00:23:39,406 --> 00:23:43,244
(Lu,)

273
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,889
(you've got some
unconventional connections.)

274
00:23:48,889 --> 00:23:51,850
(Investigate
Roadsound Group's assets for me.)

275
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:54,689
(The more detailed, the better.)

276
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,850
Ms. Lin, what's this about?

277
00:24:17,969 --> 00:24:19,250
To remind me

278
00:24:20,449 --> 00:24:24,209
to never develop feelings
for humans again.

279
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:28,050
I've deployed all available personnel

280
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,169
to search for Lin Ling.

281
00:24:30,449 --> 00:24:31,489
Don't worry, Ms. Lin.

282
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:33,889
I'll definitely bring Lin Ling back.

283
00:24:36,209 --> 00:24:37,570
I hope it's not too late.

284
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:55,050
(Nie Jiuluo)

285
00:24:58,506 --> 00:24:59,385
Shen,

286
00:25:00,425 --> 00:25:03,705
could Earth Fiends actually be humans?

287
00:25:05,506 --> 00:25:06,145
What?

288
00:25:08,266 --> 00:25:15,826
Humans combined
with other species' genes became fiends.

289
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:19,105
Lin Xirou has a method

290
00:25:19,105 --> 00:25:22,865
to reverse Yuwang Meat's effects

291
00:25:22,865 --> 00:25:24,986
and strip away the other genes.

292
00:25:25,266 --> 00:25:26,625
Are you saying

293
00:25:27,546 --> 00:25:29,385
they don't become human

294
00:25:30,945 --> 00:25:32,506
but revert to being human?

295
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:37,066
I... I don't know.

296
00:25:38,945 --> 00:25:40,026
Wild guesses.

297
00:25:41,145 --> 00:25:41,945
Exactly.

298
00:25:42,546 --> 00:25:43,665
This explains

299
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:47,586
how they came into being

300
00:25:48,826 --> 00:25:50,865
and how they became human.

301
00:25:51,506 --> 00:25:52,905
All of it makes sense now.

302
00:25:55,826 --> 00:25:57,145
If Yuwang Meat

303
00:25:57,945 --> 00:26:00,145
can enable both genetic fusion

304
00:26:01,546 --> 00:26:03,345
and reverse separation,

305
00:26:05,786 --> 00:26:07,306
then its applications

306
00:26:09,905 --> 00:26:11,226
would be endless.

307
00:26:13,425 --> 00:26:15,226
It can do good deeds

308
00:26:18,105 --> 00:26:20,826
and evil ones.

309
00:26:26,986 --> 00:26:28,145
Keep it safe first.

310
00:26:29,105 --> 00:26:29,945
Let's go check.

311
00:26:31,425 --> 00:26:32,226
Be good.

312
00:26:32,385 --> 00:26:34,665
Spend the New Year
with Grandma and Grandpa first.

313
00:26:34,865 --> 00:26:36,586
After the holidays when school starts,

314
00:26:36,786 --> 00:26:38,226
I will take you to school, okay?

315
00:26:38,226 --> 00:26:39,226
(Okay.)

316
00:26:39,786 --> 00:26:41,145
Isn't this my grown-up girl?

317
00:26:41,226 --> 00:26:42,466
Say hi to Uncle Qiang.

318
00:26:42,586 --> 00:26:43,586
Call me Dad.

319
00:26:44,385 --> 00:26:45,865
Got the stuff.

320
00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:47,226
Hurry up.

321
00:26:47,705 --> 00:26:48,625
Red packets?

322
00:26:48,625 --> 00:26:49,345
Happy New Year!

323
00:26:50,226 --> 00:26:51,226
- Happy New Year!
- I need to go.

324
00:26:51,826 --> 00:26:53,026
- Happy New Year!
- Talk later.

325
00:26:53,306 --> 00:26:54,586
- Move!
- Move!

326
00:26:54,705 --> 00:26:55,466
Ma, you pick first.

327
00:26:56,345 --> 00:26:56,986
Take more.

328
00:26:58,746 --> 00:26:59,506
Take more.

329
00:26:59,705 --> 00:27:00,625
I want that one.

330
00:27:00,625 --> 00:27:01,546
Grab a handful.

331
00:27:02,185 --> 00:27:03,066
Thanks.

332
00:27:04,226 --> 00:27:04,945
Listen...

333
00:27:06,465 --> 00:27:08,506
- When did you buy this?
- When did you buy this?

334
00:27:09,026 --> 00:27:10,066
You told me to buy it.

335
00:27:12,826 --> 00:27:14,665
It's New Year. Let's celebrate.

336
00:27:14,786 --> 00:27:15,986
Didn't we agree before?

337
00:27:15,986 --> 00:27:17,826
No alcohol at base during missions.

338
00:27:18,945 --> 00:27:19,466
Fine.

339
00:27:20,026 --> 00:27:22,026
I'll drink outside the base then, okay?

340
00:27:26,986 --> 00:27:27,625
Who are you?

341
00:27:27,945 --> 00:27:28,826
How did you get in?

342
00:27:29,826 --> 00:27:31,145
Who's she? No idea.

343
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:32,905
Luo.

344
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:41,425
After all this time,
you still remember me.

345
00:27:42,705 --> 00:27:44,905
Nie, what brings you here?

346
00:27:45,266 --> 00:27:46,266
Luo.

347
00:27:48,826 --> 00:27:50,385
Nine Oxen.

348
00:27:51,026 --> 00:27:52,001
They know each other?

349
00:27:52,001 --> 00:27:52,385
No idea.

350
00:27:52,385 --> 00:27:53,026
Talk later.

351
00:27:53,026 --> 00:27:53,746
Who is she really?

352
00:27:54,826 --> 00:27:56,905
Shan Qiang, South Mountain's best.

353
00:27:57,066 --> 00:27:59,625
Big Head got guarding down.

354
00:27:59,945 --> 00:28:01,546
You still remember the lame rhyme?

355
00:28:02,266 --> 00:28:03,506
It really is you.

356
00:28:03,705 --> 00:28:04,945
Coming home for New Year?

357
00:28:11,865 --> 00:28:13,066
Those who know me here

358
00:28:13,345 --> 00:28:15,185
are mostly old friends
I haven't seen in years.

359
00:28:15,786 --> 00:28:17,105
But for most people here,

360
00:28:17,105 --> 00:28:18,266
I'm a new face.

361
00:28:18,586 --> 00:28:19,945
Let me introduce myself.

362
00:28:20,345 --> 00:28:21,385
My name is Nie Jiuluo,

363
00:28:22,226 --> 00:28:23,226
the current Mad Blade.

364
00:28:26,306 --> 00:28:27,066
Mad Blade?

365
00:28:32,746 --> 00:28:33,746
Meeting the real deal.

366
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,505
First my mother,

367
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:44,386
then my father,

368
00:28:45,585 --> 00:28:46,865
and later Ling left too.

369
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:50,906
That's when I decided

370
00:28:52,785 --> 00:28:54,426
to leave this place no matter what.

371
00:28:55,505 --> 00:28:56,466
Wherever to go,

372
00:28:58,146 --> 00:28:59,626
I just had to get away.

373
00:29:02,626 --> 00:29:04,265
But among all Blade Clan members,

374
00:29:05,265 --> 00:29:06,906
only my blood showed dominance,

375
00:29:07,626 --> 00:29:08,626
which means

376
00:29:09,545 --> 00:29:11,946
only I could inherit the Mad Blade.

377
00:29:13,986 --> 00:29:15,065
Jiang told me

378
00:29:16,545 --> 00:29:17,946
not to be so stubborn

379
00:29:19,345 --> 00:29:20,986
or sever South Mountain Hunters' legacy.

380
00:29:23,305 --> 00:29:23,986
So

381
00:29:24,746 --> 00:29:26,865
Baichuan secretly trained you.

382
00:29:27,186 --> 00:29:29,746
You passed the trials
to inherit Mad Blade

383
00:29:30,025 --> 00:29:31,545
and kept your identity hidden.

384
00:29:35,018 --> 00:29:36,458
Except Jiang and Xing Shen,

385
00:29:37,458 --> 00:29:38,218
no one else knew.

386
00:29:39,418 --> 00:29:41,139
Then why were you

387
00:29:41,339 --> 00:29:42,778
insisting on leaving?

388
00:29:44,906 --> 00:29:47,545
Because I thought until now,

389
00:29:48,265 --> 00:29:50,745
Earth Fiends only existed

390
00:29:50,745 --> 00:29:52,346
in older generations' memories

391
00:29:52,586 --> 00:29:53,745
and wouldn't reappear.

392
00:29:55,985 --> 00:29:56,906
I was naive.

393
00:29:58,825 --> 00:30:00,346
Excuse me, I have a question.

394
00:30:00,946 --> 00:30:02,106
Isn't it a tradition

395
00:30:02,106 --> 00:30:03,745
for the Mad Blade to remain unseen?

396
00:30:04,426 --> 00:30:05,225
Why did you...

397
00:30:08,186 --> 00:30:09,386
For now,

398
00:30:10,065 --> 00:30:11,305
our current understanding

399
00:30:11,305 --> 00:30:12,745
of humanoid Earth Fiends,

400
00:30:13,586 --> 00:30:16,346
every piece of intelligence
from our operations,

401
00:30:16,545 --> 00:30:19,866
and the progress against Earth Fiends

402
00:30:21,225 --> 00:30:22,305
all came from one man,

403
00:30:24,426 --> 00:30:25,186
Yan Tuo.

404
00:30:28,305 --> 00:30:29,346
Though his motives

405
00:30:29,346 --> 00:30:30,386
were self-serving

406
00:30:30,545 --> 00:30:31,946
to avenge his parents,

407
00:30:33,866 --> 00:30:35,146
he risked his life every time

408
00:30:35,146 --> 00:30:37,866
to cooperate with me

409
00:30:38,666 --> 00:30:39,465
and help me.

410
00:30:40,386 --> 00:30:41,666
Now he's missing

411
00:30:43,106 --> 00:30:44,785
with no way to reach him.

412
00:30:45,186 --> 00:30:47,866
Our past collaborations with Yan Tuo,

413
00:30:47,866 --> 00:30:49,946
including my personal information
and identity,

414
00:30:50,866 --> 00:30:52,825
may have been exposed to Lin Xirou.

415
00:30:54,106 --> 00:30:55,106
Given the circumstances,

416
00:30:56,346 --> 00:30:57,906
there's no point in secrecy anymore.

417
00:30:58,745 --> 00:31:01,225
So I've chosen to return
to South Mountain, reveal my identity,

418
00:31:02,505 --> 00:31:05,346
and stand with you all
against the enemy.

419
00:31:07,785 --> 00:31:10,626
Perfect. With four Earth Fiends
in our custody,

420
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,265
we hold the strategic advantage.

421
00:31:13,305 --> 00:31:13,945
Xing Shen,

422
00:31:14,385 --> 00:31:16,425
after your negotiation with Lin Xirou,

423
00:31:16,626 --> 00:31:17,706
hasn't she contacted you?

424
00:31:24,026 --> 00:31:24,706
Luo,

425
00:31:27,945 --> 00:31:29,026
a word in private.

426
00:31:33,962 --> 00:31:37,203
I begged and pleaded with you before.

427
00:31:38,314 --> 00:31:39,994
Yet you insisted on leaving.

428
00:31:40,834 --> 00:31:43,115
And now you're exposing
your Mad Blade identity

429
00:31:43,994 --> 00:31:44,914
to return here,

430
00:31:46,155 --> 00:31:49,434
claiming to stand with us
against the enemy,

431
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:51,715
but you're here to save him, right?

432
00:31:53,738 --> 00:31:55,858
The Hunters chose you to replace Jiang

433
00:31:56,658 --> 00:31:57,858
because they trusted you,

434
00:31:58,497 --> 00:31:59,937
deeming you worthy of leadership.

435
00:32:00,898 --> 00:32:02,417
But they never imagined

436
00:32:03,626 --> 00:32:05,107
you'd treat the innocent civilians

437
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:06,746
who helped us

438
00:32:08,306 --> 00:32:10,587
as disposable pawns.

439
00:32:11,706 --> 00:32:13,226
He was raised in a fiend den.

440
00:32:13,826 --> 00:32:15,947
Do you truly believe he's innocent?

441
00:32:16,826 --> 00:32:18,467
If his sole purpose is revenge,

442
00:32:18,987 --> 00:32:20,226
our fight against Earth Fiends

443
00:32:20,226 --> 00:32:21,626
plays right into his hands.

444
00:32:22,467 --> 00:32:24,107
As for casualties along the way,

445
00:32:24,226 --> 00:32:26,907
whether Jiang or other hunters
live or die,

446
00:32:27,226 --> 00:32:28,746
he couldn't care less.

447
00:32:28,867 --> 00:32:30,306
So you deliberately betrayed him?

448
00:32:30,507 --> 00:32:31,266
And the outcome?

449
00:32:31,746 --> 00:32:33,666
Did Lin Xirou agree
to your exchange terms?

450
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:35,266
Was Jiang rescued?

451
00:32:36,067 --> 00:32:37,626
Can we all celebrate the New Year?

452
00:32:38,986 --> 00:32:40,106
If you're shouting,

453
00:32:41,387 --> 00:32:42,666
why speak privately?

454
00:32:43,387 --> 00:32:45,227
Just say everything in the room.

455
00:32:53,227 --> 00:32:56,106
Many bird species form mixed flocks.

456
00:32:56,867 --> 00:32:58,227
Though living together,

457
00:32:59,146 --> 00:33:01,747
they prioritize their own kind.

458
00:33:03,706 --> 00:33:05,146
Yet despite differing goals,

459
00:33:05,586 --> 00:33:07,146
they cooperate in hunting

460
00:33:07,706 --> 00:33:08,907
and fending off predators.

461
00:33:12,186 --> 00:33:13,227
For years,

462
00:33:14,546 --> 00:33:17,827
Mad Dog, Mad Blade, and Ghost Whip

463
00:33:18,427 --> 00:33:19,867
have gathered for the first time.

464
00:33:22,227 --> 00:33:24,427
If we only squabble and quarrel,

465
00:33:24,427 --> 00:33:26,626
then the South Mountain Hunters

466
00:33:27,747 --> 00:33:29,387
stand no chance of victory.

467
00:33:32,347 --> 00:33:33,106
True.

468
00:33:34,106 --> 00:33:37,026
Goals may differ,
but it can be the same path.

469
00:33:38,506 --> 00:33:40,787
Someone must chart that path first.

470
00:33:42,146 --> 00:33:44,706
South Mountain Hunters
only follow one path.

471
00:33:47,146 --> 00:33:50,026
To rescue Jiang or Yan Tuo,

472
00:33:50,307 --> 00:33:52,146
it requires confronting Lin Xirou.

473
00:34:03,146 --> 00:34:04,347
My father said for millennia

474
00:34:04,347 --> 00:34:06,026
Mad Blades never revealed themselves.

475
00:34:06,146 --> 00:34:07,586
Did he mention

476
00:34:07,747 --> 00:34:08,706
that for millennia,

477
00:34:08,747 --> 00:34:10,427
Earth Fiends never took human form?

478
00:34:19,666 --> 00:34:21,427
Though Lin Xirou hasn't responded

479
00:34:21,427 --> 00:34:22,947
to our hostage exchange terms,

480
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:24,867
we can't wait any longer.

481
00:34:25,026 --> 00:34:26,227
We must keep attacking.

482
00:34:26,747 --> 00:34:29,267
Mad Blade took away
Lin Xirou's blood bag,

483
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:30,026
Lin Ling.

484
00:34:30,387 --> 00:34:32,467
She's crucial to Lin Xirou,

485
00:34:32,867 --> 00:34:34,467
who'll search desperately for her.

486
00:34:35,066 --> 00:34:36,907
Luo will try persuading Lin Ling

487
00:34:36,907 --> 00:34:37,907
to relocate to our base.

488
00:34:38,227 --> 00:34:38,747
This way,

489
00:34:38,747 --> 00:34:40,307
we can better protect her.

490
00:34:41,106 --> 00:34:41,827
Yu Rong,

491
00:34:41,986 --> 00:34:43,867
interrogate
those five Earth Fiends again.

492
00:34:44,066 --> 00:34:46,186
See if they'll reveal more intel.

493
00:34:47,227 --> 00:34:48,146
Big Head, Shan Qiang,

494
00:34:48,307 --> 00:34:50,827
use the rescue team's
resources and network

495
00:34:51,106 --> 00:34:52,347
for a comprehensive search.

496
00:34:52,986 --> 00:34:54,747
All information
related to Roadsound Group

497
00:34:54,747 --> 00:34:55,666
must be looked at.

498
00:34:56,186 --> 00:34:57,106
Especially

499
00:34:57,986 --> 00:35:00,427
potential locations
where Yan Tuo might be hidden.

500
00:35:00,626 --> 00:35:01,666
Once located,

501
00:35:02,546 --> 00:35:03,827
immediately launch a rescue.

502
00:35:04,787 --> 00:35:05,787
My apologies, everyone.

503
00:35:06,227 --> 00:35:07,026
We probably

504
00:35:08,546 --> 00:35:10,186
won't have a peaceful New Year.

505
00:35:46,626 --> 00:35:47,427
Luo.

506
00:35:49,787 --> 00:35:50,986
Happy New Year.

507
00:35:51,666 --> 00:35:52,227
Candy.

508
00:36:00,947 --> 00:36:03,066
When I left, I promised you

509
00:36:03,666 --> 00:36:05,267
I'd visit you regularly.

510
00:36:07,947 --> 00:36:08,787
Sorry about that.

511
00:36:11,658 --> 00:36:12,818
You're back now.

512
00:36:17,098 --> 00:36:20,138
Blades and hounds
walk the Turquoise Land,

513
00:36:21,017 --> 00:36:23,698
and Ghost Whip cracks his glowing whip.

514
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,818
Seven hounds, two whips, and one blade.

515
00:36:28,017 --> 00:36:29,785
The Golden Gate
is fortified beyond defeat.

516
00:36:31,258 --> 00:36:33,377
A patrol checks
the Golden Gate every fourth year.

517
00:36:33,977 --> 00:36:35,977
No more wrongful deaths in Nanba.

518
00:36:37,258 --> 00:36:39,298
Wraiths and fiends walk separate paths.

519
00:36:40,658 --> 00:36:42,577
South Mountain Hunters risk brief lives.

520
00:36:44,897 --> 00:36:46,818
Blades and hounds
walk the Turquoise Land,

521
00:36:48,298 --> 00:36:50,577
and Ghost Whip cracks his glowing whip.

522
00:36:50,577 --> 00:36:52,738
Seven hounds, two whips, and one blade.

523
00:36:53,577 --> 00:36:55,818
No more wrongful deaths in Nanba.

524
00:36:57,778 --> 00:36:58,738
Be careful.

525
00:37:05,913 --> 00:37:08,017
Mad Dog leads the charge,
Mad Blade stays in command,

526
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,897
Once entering the Twilight Chasm,
fiends hunt human monsters.

527
00:37:09,897 --> 00:37:11,217
Blades and hounds
walk the Turquoise Land,

528
00:37:11,217 --> 00:37:12,617
and Ghost Whip cracks his glowing whip.

529
00:37:12,617 --> 00:37:14,017
Seven hounds, two whips, and one blade.

530
00:37:14,017 --> 00:37:15,417
The Golden Gate
is fortified beyond defeat.

531
00:37:15,417 --> 00:37:17,217
A patrol checks
the Golden Gate every fourth year.

532
00:37:17,217 --> 00:37:18,737
No more wrongful deaths in Nanba.

533
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:20,337
Wraiths and fiends walk separate paths.

534
00:37:20,337 --> 00:37:21,697
South Mountain Hunters risk brief lives.

535
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:23,609
Mad Dog leads the charge,
Mad Blade stays in command,

536
00:37:24,297 --> 00:37:26,217
Once entering the Twilight Chasm,
fiends hunt human monsters.

539
00:37:28,297 --> 00:37:29,057
Ma,

540
00:37:32,017 --> 00:37:33,737
