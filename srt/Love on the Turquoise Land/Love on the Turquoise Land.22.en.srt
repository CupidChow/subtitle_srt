(Cang Water)

19
00:04:09,738 --> 00:04:11,417
I lost track of days and nights.

20
00:04:11,858 --> 00:04:14,058
I completely forgot the date.

21
00:04:14,858 --> 00:04:17,258
Chinese New Year
is in about ten more days.

22
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:21,730
Good.

23
00:04:24,371 --> 00:04:28,011
Have a tangerine. Wish for good fortune.

24
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:31,530
Auspicious sign.

25
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,571
Here, have one.

26
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:39,970
Stop hanging in.

27
00:04:40,331 --> 00:04:42,090
I can beg Ms. Lin for mercy.

28
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,011
Just tell her

29
00:04:44,011 --> 00:04:46,050
about your cooperation
with South Mountain Hunters

30
00:04:46,131 --> 00:04:47,891
and where Lin Ling went.

31
00:04:49,451 --> 00:04:50,891
Ms. Lin will soften up.

32
00:04:53,066 --> 00:04:55,905
Did she send you to persuade me?

33
00:04:57,066 --> 00:04:58,866
Why bother?

34
00:07:22,026 --> 00:07:23,346
He's so obedient.

35
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:27,666
It seems promising.

36
00:07:31,065 --> 00:07:32,906
Hope we won't need to use him.

37
00:07:35,346 --> 00:07:36,505
Anyway,

38
00:07:37,185 --> 00:07:39,026
we'll find him a proper place.

39
00:07:42,505 --> 00:07:43,945
What kind of proper place?

40
00:07:45,786 --> 00:07:47,146
If Yuwang Meat

41
00:07:47,545 --> 00:07:49,706
enables positive gene fusion,

42
00:07:51,146 --> 00:07:52,985
it could also reverse the process.

43
00:07:53,745 --> 00:07:55,305
Then it is

44
00:07:57,865 --> 00:07:59,146
very useful.

45
00:08:19,618 --> 00:08:21,346
(Qiao)

46
00:08:21,346 --> 00:08:22,865
His girlfriend's name is Qiao Ya.

47

He still retains his humanity.

48
00:09:06,226 --> 00:09:09,466
Just keep it till Chinese New Year.

49
00:09:10,346 --> 00:09:11,466
Till Chinese New Year.

52
00:09:37,025 --> 00:09:37,985
Your broth.

53
00:09:38,346 --> 00:09:39,426
Thank you.

54
00:09:40,385 --> 00:09:41,385
Seems you got used to it.

55
00:09:42,385 --> 00:09:43,946
I can't freeload forever.

56
00:09:43,946 --> 00:09:45,106
I should help somehow.

57
00:09:45,346 --> 00:09:47,106
Have you eaten?
Let me cook you dumplings.

58
00:09:47,106 --> 00:09:47,706
No need.

59
00:09:47,706 --> 00:09:49,106
I've eaten plenty here already.

60
00:09:49,985 --> 00:09:51,265
I made these myself today.

61
00:09:51,385 --> 00:09:52,025
It's different.

62
00:09:54,426 --> 00:09:55,385
Come and chat.

63
00:09:56,306 --> 00:09:57,025
Go ahead.

64
00:10:01,186 --> 00:10:03,186
Lin Xirou has been searching for you.

65
00:10:03,905 --> 00:10:06,025
This place is well-hidden,

66
00:10:06,186 --> 00:10:07,745
but I can't guarantee absolute safety.

67
00:10:08,265 --> 00:10:08,946
So,

68
00:10:09,466 --> 00:10:11,265
I want you to be somewhere more secure.

69
00:10:17,385 --> 00:10:18,665
Can't I stay here?

70
00:10:30,826 --> 00:10:31,665
I'm sorry.

71
00:10:32,066 --> 00:10:33,346
You just got settled.

72
00:10:34,145 --> 00:10:34,865
It's fine.

73
00:10:35,466 --> 00:10:37,546
I cause you trouble

74
00:10:37,546 --> 00:10:38,665
and make you worry.

75
00:10:40,505 --> 00:10:41,265
Besides,

76
00:10:41,745 --> 00:10:43,546
I'm used to hiding.

77
00:10:47,466 --> 00:10:48,226
Check please.

78
00:10:48,586 --> 00:10:49,226
Coming.

79
00:10:52,265 --> 00:10:53,145
20 yuan in total.

80
00:10:55,106 --> 00:10:56,306
Thanks. Take care.

81
00:10:56,985 --> 00:10:59,466
Ling, chop the scallions finer.

82
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:00,385
Okay.

83
00:11:00,586 --> 00:11:01,226
Mr. Changxi.

84
00:11:01,226 --> 00:11:02,306
Miss Nie, you're here.

85
00:11:02,905 --> 00:11:04,226
How are you lately? Feeling well?

86
00:11:04,226 --> 00:11:05,025
All good.

87
00:11:05,946 --> 00:11:08,306
I came to discuss something with you.

88
00:11:08,586 --> 00:11:09,186
What is it?

89
00:11:10,426 --> 00:11:11,145
Lin Ling

90
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,745
might need to stay here longer.

91
00:11:15,985 --> 00:11:17,186
I'd like to keep her company.

92
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,426
Do you mind?

93
00:11:18,946 --> 00:11:20,186
Why do I mind?

94
00:11:20,385 --> 00:11:21,466
No problem.

95
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:22,226
Welcome.

96
00:11:22,745 --> 00:11:23,865
Good you'd keep her company.

97
00:11:24,665 --> 00:11:25,985
Sorry for bothering you.

98
00:11:26,106 --> 00:11:26,665
Not at all.

99
00:11:26,665 --> 00:11:27,426
Mr. Liu.

100
00:11:27,426 --> 00:11:28,905
- Any leek dumplings?
- Degui.

101
00:11:29,145 --> 00:11:30,466
- Long time no see.
- Back from a business trip.

102
00:11:30,466 --> 00:11:31,066
Have a seat.

103
00:11:31,586 --> 00:11:32,385
Really?

104
00:11:34,385 --> 00:11:35,025
Don't worry.

105
00:11:35,466 --> 00:11:36,625
You're safe with me here.

106
00:11:39,745 --> 00:11:40,946
I'll go chop scallions then.

107
00:11:43,226 --> 00:11:44,025
Watch your fingers.

Chinese New Year's Eve is coming.

116
00:16:14,786 --> 00:16:15,627
Good.

117
00:16:17,627 --> 00:16:18,907
Good day.

118
00:16:20,866 --> 00:16:22,627
I love the Chinese New Year most.

119
00:16:23,907 --> 00:16:25,907
What an eventful year.

120
00:16:26,266 --> 00:16:27,506
Gou Ya was omnivorous.

121
00:16:28,586 --> 00:16:30,467
Han Guan and Chen Fu disappeared.

122
00:16:31,627 --> 00:16:33,306
South Mountain Hunters resurfaced.

123
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:35,266
Four of our people got captured.

124
00:16:35,987 --> 00:16:38,066
Even the most obedient
Lin Ling ran away.

125
00:16:39,947 --> 00:16:42,866
Now you're the only one left
to spend Chinese New Year with me.

126
00:16:45,427 --> 00:16:48,066
Legend has it that long ago

127
00:16:49,707 --> 00:16:51,866
there was a monster called Nian.

128
00:16:52,987 --> 00:16:55,627
It loved devouring people
on Chinese New Year's Eve.

129
00:16:57,627 --> 00:17:01,667
But it feared fire, the color red,

130
00:17:03,627 --> 00:17:04,786
and firecrackers.

131
00:17:05,907 --> 00:17:08,187
So people set off firecrackers,

132
00:17:09,707 --> 00:17:12,707
posted red couplets,
and wore red clothes

133
00:17:13,707 --> 00:17:15,066
to drive it away.

134
00:17:16,147 --> 00:17:19,266
That's how we
celebrate Chinese New Year.

135
00:17:26,474 --> 00:17:27,315
Though

136
00:17:29,355 --> 00:17:31,674
I don't wear in red,

137
00:17:37,034 --> 00:17:38,794
I think your eyes

138
00:17:40,354 --> 00:17:42,314
are already red, right?

139
00:17:45,435 --> 00:17:47,755
I wish I could set off firecrackers

140
00:17:53,675 --> 00:17:55,274
to drive away

141
00:17:58,395 --> 00:17:59,715
all you monsters.

142
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:08,314
This might be your
last dinner for Chinese New Year's Eve.

143
00:18:09,754 --> 00:18:11,635
Have some farewell dumplings.

144
00:18:26,634 --> 00:18:28,114
For my final journey,

145
00:18:29,753 --> 00:18:31,033
I don't need you to farewell me.

146
00:18:32,594 --> 00:18:33,394
Rest assured.

147
00:18:34,674 --> 00:18:37,914
I won't let you leave alone.

148
00:18:39,194 --> 00:18:41,473
I'll have all the South Mountain Hunters

149
00:18:41,914 --> 00:18:44,273
and that Mad Blade
who gave you the needle

150
00:18:44,713 --> 00:18:45,914
keep you company

151
00:18:46,513 --> 00:18:47,713
on your final journey.

152
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:08,298
The hunting hounds of that Hunter Tu

153
00:19:08,858 --> 00:19:10,777
accidentally ate Yuwang Meat

154
00:19:11,138 --> 00:19:12,537
and preyed on hares.

155
00:19:13,378 --> 00:19:14,537
After they died suddenly,

156
00:19:14,658 --> 00:19:18,618
they transformed beneath Turquoise Land
into creatures resembling

157
00:19:19,098 --> 00:19:21,257
both dogs and rabbits.

158
00:19:22,818 --> 00:19:25,418
This suggests the mysterious Yuwang Meat

159
00:19:26,658 --> 00:19:27,457
contains

160
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:30,497
microorganisms that enable
stable genetic fusion.

161
00:19:34,618 --> 00:19:36,017
Yes, that's right.

162
00:19:36,658 --> 00:19:40,418
The structure of cell membranes
has changed.

163
00:19:40,858 --> 00:19:43,937
The cells merged

164
00:19:44,537 --> 00:19:48,818
the gene of both the spider
and the insects it ate

165
00:19:49,177 --> 00:19:50,618
and showed stability.

166
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:52,378
This indicates

167
00:19:53,537 --> 00:19:55,497
Earth Fiends must be hybrid creations

168
00:19:55,497 --> 00:19:57,017
from cross-species genetic fusion

169
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,977
for their shady experiments.

170
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:02,257
So, Roadsound Pharmaceuticals
acts as a front.

171
00:20:03,257 --> 00:20:05,697
With their resources and technology,

172
00:20:06,017 --> 00:20:08,937
they could fully exploit Yuwang Meat

173
00:20:09,257 --> 00:20:11,497
and transform Earth Fiends

174
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:12,858
into humans.

175
00:20:23,818 --> 00:20:26,217
I can always get good tea in your place.

176
00:20:27,858 --> 00:20:29,058
I'm flattered.

177
00:20:29,737 --> 00:20:30,298
You came

178
00:20:30,298 --> 00:20:32,017
when Wanbao Tower opened.

179
00:20:32,138 --> 00:20:33,338
And you brought your own tea.

180
00:20:36,697 --> 00:20:38,977
Sometimes, it's hard to distinguish

181
00:20:40,017 --> 00:20:42,217
what's mine and what's yours.

182
00:20:43,777 --> 00:20:46,578
Today I'm not sure

183
00:20:47,737 --> 00:20:48,898
if I should drink

184
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:50,697
the tea you offer here.

185
00:20:55,217 --> 00:20:55,898
Wait.

186
00:20:56,537 --> 00:20:57,898
What do you mean? I don't get it.

187
00:21:07,497 --> 00:21:10,058
You came, and then Lin Ling got injured.

188
00:21:10,818 --> 00:21:12,937
And you insisted on taking her here

189
00:21:13,537 --> 00:21:15,378
to handle her wound.

190
00:21:16,537 --> 00:21:19,618
Once you came, she was taken away.

191
00:21:21,177 --> 00:21:23,338
What a coincidence.

192
00:21:25,098 --> 00:21:26,338
By heaven's truth,

193
00:21:26,697 --> 00:21:28,058
you told me to get along well

194
00:21:28,058 --> 00:21:29,217
with Lin Ling.

195
00:21:29,578 --> 00:21:30,497
When she got hurt,

196
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:31,818
I wasn't even there.

197
00:21:31,898 --> 00:21:33,457
It's Sis who was with her.

198
00:21:33,977 --> 00:21:36,497
That day she bled so much
and came for treatment.

199
00:21:36,497 --> 00:21:38,818
I focused on her wound

200
00:21:38,818 --> 00:21:39,658
all the time.

201
00:21:39,818 --> 00:21:41,818
And someone knocked me out,

202
00:21:42,138 --> 00:21:43,737
and twisted off

203
00:21:43,737 --> 00:21:44,658
my arm.

204
00:21:44,658 --> 00:21:45,858
I'm still in pain right now.

205
00:21:46,658 --> 00:21:47,338
Sorry.

206
00:21:59,497 --> 00:22:00,618
Last night at City Hospital,

207
00:22:00,618 --> 00:22:02,017
I vomited several times.

208
00:22:03,058 --> 00:22:05,138
The doctor said it might
be post-concussion syndrome.

209
00:22:05,737 --> 00:22:06,977
I am asked to stay longer.

210
00:22:08,058 --> 00:22:08,977
I said no.

211
00:22:09,618 --> 00:22:11,098
The Group might need me.

212
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:12,658
The buddies need...

213
00:22:14,058 --> 00:22:16,298
Hei, why didn't you tell Ms. Lin

214
00:22:16,298 --> 00:22:18,017
how I have treated you buddies normally?

215
00:22:18,257 --> 00:22:18,898
Tell her.

216
00:22:24,418 --> 00:22:25,898
I thought you'd

217
00:22:25,898 --> 00:22:27,098
at least say something like,

218
00:22:27,098 --> 00:22:28,418
"My child, you've suffered."

219
00:22:29,058 --> 00:22:30,298
Instead, you interrogated me.

220
00:22:45,058 --> 00:22:45,858
I see.

221
00:22:47,217 --> 00:22:49,217
I have to tell you the truth today.

222
00:22:55,098 --> 00:22:55,898
I have vile desires.

223
00:23:01,457 --> 00:23:03,298
My love for Lin Ling wasn't pure.

224
00:23:06,098 --> 00:23:07,378
I thought if we were married,

225
00:23:08,017 --> 00:23:09,177
I would strengthen our bonds,

226
00:23:09,977 --> 00:23:12,177
so I could secure
my position in the Group

227
00:23:12,777 --> 00:23:13,578
and earn more money.

228
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:15,858
B-But if you think

229
00:23:15,858 --> 00:23:17,017
I don't like Lin Ling at all,

230
00:23:17,017 --> 00:23:18,017
that's not true.

231
00:23:18,737 --> 00:23:20,578
But she's not the one
I care about the most.

232
00:23:21,177 --> 00:23:21,937
It's you.

233
00:23:24,298 --> 00:23:26,737
Love can change in an instant,

234
00:23:27,818 --> 00:23:30,058
but Roadsound Group can stand forever.

235
00:23:48,017 --> 00:23:48,898
Don't worry, Ms. Lin.

236
00:23:49,697 --> 00:23:52,457
We'll keep close contact

237
00:23:52,737 --> 00:23:53,578
with Dr. Lv.

238
00:23:55,177 --> 00:23:57,818
I'll also station men at Wanbao Tower.

239
00:23:58,658 --> 00:24:00,697
If Lin Ling contacts Dr. Lv,

240
00:24:01,058 --> 00:24:04,177
we'll be the first he sees.

241
00:24:05,497 --> 00:24:06,578
My arm!

242
00:24:07,257 --> 00:24:08,098
No problem.

243
00:24:08,777 --> 00:24:10,378
My injury won't heal soon anyway.

244
00:24:10,497 --> 00:24:11,602
I won't open Wanbao Tower.

245
00:24:12,257 --> 00:24:13,737
Just focus on this.

246
00:24:50,642 --> 00:24:52,978
(Leisure Time Teahouse)

247
00:24:53,697 --> 00:24:55,177
Ling!

248
00:24:55,378 --> 00:24:56,737
Smash some cucumbers for me now.

249
00:24:56,737 --> 00:24:57,937
I'm too busy to do that.

250
00:24:58,298 --> 00:24:59,737
I've already served them.

251
00:25:03,818 --> 00:25:05,457
When I worked alone,

252
00:25:05,497 --> 00:25:06,578
I always needed more help.

253
00:25:06,578 --> 00:25:07,977
Now with two helpers,

254
00:25:08,098 --> 00:25:09,217
I'm still overwhelmed.

255
00:25:09,418 --> 00:25:11,418
Don't get used to it, Mr. Changxi.

256
00:25:11,497 --> 00:25:12,578
Once we all leave,

257
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:13,658
you'll miss this.

258
00:25:13,737 --> 00:25:14,497
Exactly.

259
00:25:15,257 --> 00:25:16,697
Stay permanently then.

260
00:25:18,298 --> 00:25:19,937
Welcome. For how many people?

261
00:25:20,898 --> 00:25:21,457
One.

262
00:25:27,898 --> 00:25:28,697
Have a seat.

263
00:25:28,937 --> 00:25:29,658
Order anything?

264
00:25:29,937 --> 00:25:31,578
I'll handle this. You check the kitchen.

265
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:33,658
Alright, you take over.

266
00:25:42,618 --> 00:25:44,338
I thought you're quite busy.

267
00:25:47,697 --> 00:25:49,858
Shan Qiang found some

268
00:25:50,138 --> 00:25:51,058
suspicious mines.

269
00:25:51,777 --> 00:25:53,537
We're investigating them now.

270
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:55,058
We should get something.

271
00:26:03,497 --> 00:26:04,537
How suspicious?

272
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:10,177
Roadsound Group evolved
from Roadsound Mining.

273
00:26:10,898 --> 00:26:13,618
Those private mines
should've been abandoned.

274
00:26:14,177 --> 00:26:16,217
But there are still
traces of people now.

275
00:26:16,697 --> 00:26:17,457
Therefore,

276
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:19,537
something is wrong.

277
00:26:22,154 --> 00:26:23,034
Would it be

278
00:26:25,233 --> 00:26:26,953
where they're hiding Jiang and Yan Tuo?

279
00:26:28,634 --> 00:26:30,713
Not sure. We are still investigating.

280
00:26:38,154 --> 00:26:39,594
Xing Shen worries about you two,

281
00:26:39,794 --> 00:26:40,874
so he sent me to check.

282
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:44,554
You came all this way

283
00:26:44,993 --> 00:26:46,154
just to tell me this?

284
00:26:48,114 --> 00:26:48,913
Of course not.

285
00:26:49,594 --> 00:26:51,074
Have a hearty meal as well.

286
00:26:52,273 --> 00:26:54,394
Beef scallion dumplings, please.

287
00:26:58,794 --> 00:27:00,433
Right away. Just a moment.

288
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:07,394
(Changxi Dumplings)

289
00:27:07,394 --> 00:27:08,433
Lin Ling, let me.

290
00:27:08,473 --> 00:27:09,074
It's fine.

291
00:27:09,154 --> 00:27:09,834
This is dirty.

292
00:27:10,354 --> 00:27:11,993
Okay, I'll clean the table then.

293
00:27:18,114 --> 00:27:18,874
Go get some rest.

294
00:27:19,074 --> 00:27:19,834
Got it.

295
00:27:21,074 --> 00:27:21,834
It's a long day.

296
00:27:23,114 --> 00:27:24,354
You go rest as well.

297
00:27:30,322 --> 00:27:33,459
(Changxi Dumplings)

298
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,049
Had a nightmare?

299
00:30:38,474 --> 00:30:39,714
I'll get you some water.

300
00:30:40,313 --> 00:30:41,553
No need, Luo.

301
00:30:45,002 --> 00:30:45,681
Could you

302
00:30:48,042 --> 00:30:49,681
sleep here with me?

303
00:30:58,986 --> 00:31:05,770
(Changxi Dumplings)

304
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:07,170
Happy Chinese New Year.

305
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:08,489
Happy Chinese New Year.

306
00:31:08,609 --> 00:31:09,730
You've brought the lanterns?

307
00:31:10,538 --> 00:31:11,410
(Open)

308
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:13,252
(Closed)

309
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:17,210
Morning, Mr. Changxi.

310
00:31:17,569 --> 00:31:18,410
You're up.

311
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:20,850
Wait here.

312
00:31:30,489 --> 00:31:32,170
Like Tuo, you're all kids

313
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:33,890
to me.

314
00:31:36,049 --> 00:31:36,730
Take this.

315
00:31:39,049 --> 00:31:39,730
(Blessing)
Lucky money.

316
00:31:42,449 --> 00:31:43,210
For good fortune.

317
00:31:45,009 --> 00:31:46,129
Thank you, Mr. Changxi.

318
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:48,770
Tuo isn't here.

319
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:50,810
You take it for him.

320
00:31:51,529 --> 00:31:53,170
Give it to him when you see him.

321
00:31:56,129 --> 00:31:57,370
Thanks, Mr. Changxi.

322
00:31:58,370 --> 00:31:59,290
It's Chinese New Year,

323
00:31:59,449 --> 00:32:00,569
so let's be cheerful.

324
00:32:02,609 --> 00:32:05,449
This is my first time
receiving lucky money.

325
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:11,250
Since I opened this shop,

326
00:32:11,569 --> 00:32:14,449
this is the first time someone has
celebrated Chinese New Year with me.

327
00:32:15,649 --> 00:32:16,770
Don't just stand there.

328
00:32:17,089 --> 00:32:19,290
I bought lots of nuts
and candies yesterday.

329
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:21,210
Check the bedroom for the snack tray.

330
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:23,290
I think it's on top of that big cabinet.

331
00:32:23,649 --> 00:32:25,129
Got it, we'll handle it, Mr. Changxi.

332
00:32:25,529 --> 00:32:26,009
Let's go.

333
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:39,529
Here.

334
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:48,609
Be careful.

335
00:32:53,489 --> 00:32:55,770
Look, this is Mr. Changxi
when he was young.

336
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:57,170
He looked so energetic.

337
00:32:58,170 --> 00:32:59,609
He is still energetic now.

338
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:01,690
He used to have delicate features.

339
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:03,730
Now he looks benevolent.

340
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:05,410
Let's put it back.

341
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:10,410
Where should we put it?

342
00:33:10,969 --> 00:33:12,250
(Roadsound Mining)
Many photos!

343
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:16,410
Here, I guess.

344
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:25,290
Did you find it?

345
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:26,649
Mr. Changxi,

346
00:33:26,649 --> 00:33:27,330
we accidentally

347
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:29,330
saw your old photos from younger days.

348
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:31,129
Mr. Changxi,

349
00:33:31,569 --> 00:33:32,730
who's this person?

350
00:33:33,449 --> 00:33:34,210
Let me see.

351
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:36,850
These were my mining coworkers
back then.

352
00:33:37,089 --> 00:33:39,129
We were all wearing uniforms.

353
00:33:40,489 --> 00:33:42,129
Let me check
how many years ago this was.

354
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:47,330
Quanshun, Zhang Guangdong,
Li Yunxiang, Dalieba,

355
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:49,049
and this is Li Ergou.

356
00:33:50,009 --> 00:33:50,649
He

357
00:33:50,649 --> 00:33:51,770
got along well with us,

358
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:53,170
but he had sticky fingers.

359
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:55,449
He stole mining company's
money and ran off.

360
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:58,089
Tuo's father was kind-hearted.

361
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,290
He didn't punish him,

362
00:33:59,529 --> 00:34:01,290
and took pity on his poor family

363
00:34:01,529 --> 00:34:04,330
and hired his sister as a housekeeper.

364
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:07,330
A woman

365
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:09,649
ruined my family.

366
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:12,410
She even stole my mother's name.

367
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:14,129
(Lin Xirou)
Lin Xirou

368
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:17,210
is in charge
of the entire Roadsound Group,

369
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:18,569
and living carefree.

370
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:24,609
So Li Ergou's sister

371
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:27,129
was the housekeeper
in Yan Tuo's family later?

372
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:27,969
Yes, that's her.

373
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:28,929
Li Shuangxiu.

374
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:32,290
She was quite pretty,

375
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:33,410
but lacked integrity.

376
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:35,529
Later, because of her,

377
00:34:36,609 --> 00:34:38,250
Tuo's family's fate has changed.

378
00:34:46,058 --> 00:34:47,994
After making all these efforts,

379
00:34:48,074 --> 00:34:49,674
we found nothing.

380
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:51,034
I'm starving.

381
00:34:52,434 --> 00:34:53,154
And you?

382
00:34:55,034 --> 00:34:56,154
Only two sites are left.

383
00:34:56,954 --> 00:34:57,794
Work harder,

384
00:34:58,554 --> 00:34:59,714
and we'll finish tomorrow.

385
00:35:05,434 --> 00:35:07,274
Bid farewell to the old year with vigor,

386
00:35:07,474 --> 00:35:09,394
and welcome the new year joyfully!

387
00:35:11,834 --> 00:35:14,234
On this Chinese New Year,

388
00:35:14,754 --> 00:35:16,714
I hereby represent...

389
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:18,474
Stop that.

390
00:35:19,354 --> 00:35:20,994
You really scared me!

391
00:35:21,074 --> 00:35:22,314
I almost smashed you.

392
00:35:22,474 --> 00:35:23,434
We have already eaten.

393
00:35:24,514 --> 00:35:25,194
But...

394
00:35:26,826 --> 00:35:31,210
♪Heaven-sent tides can't
quench this reckless fire♪

395
00:35:33,554 --> 00:35:34,234
Dumplings.

396
00:35:38,674 --> 00:35:39,874
Shen told us

397
00:35:39,874 --> 00:35:41,274
to save these for you two.

398
00:35:41,274 --> 00:35:42,114
Come on, eat up!

399
00:35:42,234 --> 00:35:42,954
Eat up.

400
00:35:45,648 --> 00:35:46,320
Are they tasty?

401
00:35:48,826 --> 00:35:56,546
♪Farewell to the old times,
and scenes fade away one by one♪
