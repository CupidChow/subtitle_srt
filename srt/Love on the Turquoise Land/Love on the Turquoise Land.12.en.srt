Can you guys adjust
the dough consistency for me?

18
00:01:58,008 --> 00:01:59,648
Make the dough a bit softer.

19
00:01:59,767 --> 00:02:01,648
Who makes steamed buns
with unleavened dough?

20
00:02:01,968 --> 00:02:02,767
Jiang Baichuan.

21
00:02:09,328 --> 00:02:10,648
Did Luo send you?

22
00:02:11,648 --> 00:02:13,048
She told you to hang on.

23
00:02:13,232 --> 00:02:14,832
South Mountain Hunters are working hard

24
00:02:14,832 --> 00:02:15,847
to come to rescue you.

25
00:02:15,847 --> 00:02:16,687
Don't come.

26
00:02:16,847 --> 00:02:17,528
Why?

27
00:02:18,287 --> 00:02:19,048
Tell them

28
00:02:19,088 --> 00:02:20,687
not to come to rescue me.

29
00:02:21,048 --> 00:02:22,088
Jiang, let me tell you.

30
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,208
Those people

31
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:24,447
would resort to any means.

32
00:02:24,968 --> 00:02:25,928
Then it means

33
00:02:25,928 --> 00:02:28,007
I have value to them

34
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:29,928
and I can try
to extract some information.

35
00:02:30,368 --> 00:02:31,248
As long as I'm here,

36
00:02:31,407 --> 00:02:33,088
they'd think they have the upper hand

37
00:02:33,167 --> 00:02:34,287
and won't act recklessly.

38
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,287
Luo and the others
will stay relatively safe.

39
00:02:37,007 --> 00:02:37,808
Are you sure?

40
00:02:37,887 --> 00:02:39,447
Of course.

41
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:42,088
Ask Luo to tell other Hunters

42
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:43,488
to keep a close watch on Locust.

43
00:02:43,567 --> 00:02:45,007
It's not just a combat tool,

44
00:02:45,368 --> 00:02:46,167
but also a hostage.

45
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:47,847
Locust?

46
00:02:48,447 --> 00:02:50,048
I'm unfilial.

47
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,007
Tell Luo

48
00:02:51,127 --> 00:02:52,368
not to worry about me.

49
00:02:52,368 --> 00:02:53,287
Take care of herself.

50
00:02:53,287 --> 00:02:55,407
That's what matters most to the Hunters.

51
00:02:55,507 --> 00:02:56,007
Leave.

52
00:02:56,007 --> 00:02:57,248
Okay.

53
00:03:22,847 --> 00:03:23,447
Hello.

54
00:03:28,328 --> 00:03:29,007
Hello.

55
00:03:29,928 --> 00:03:32,567
We've called him Jiang since childhood.

56
00:03:33,287 --> 00:03:34,127
So,

57
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:35,687
I should call you...

58
00:03:35,687 --> 00:03:36,567
Just Quecha is fine.

59
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:47,808
Yu Rong.

60
00:03:50,928 --> 00:03:52,287
I often heard Jiang mention you.

61
00:03:53,727 --> 00:03:55,048
Nothing good, I bet.

62
00:03:57,447 --> 00:03:58,248
Not at all.

63
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:00,127
He said

64
00:04:01,328 --> 00:04:03,287
you've been taming beasts overseas.

65
00:04:04,127 --> 00:04:04,928
Taming beasts?

66
00:04:05,648 --> 00:04:06,607
He said that?

67
00:04:07,528 --> 00:04:08,248
Haven't you?

68
00:04:10,687 --> 00:04:11,368
He said

69
00:04:11,847 --> 00:04:14,567
you can't stand being constrained.

70
00:04:15,727 --> 00:04:17,568
But if the Hunters face real danger,

71
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,487
he believes you'll definitely return.

72
00:04:22,088 --> 00:04:24,688
Indeed, he's right.

73
00:04:31,448 --> 00:04:32,607
I'm still too late.

74
00:04:37,088 --> 00:04:37,847
Sorry.

75
00:04:46,008 --> 00:04:48,208
An entire wild elephant herd,

76
00:04:48,648 --> 00:04:49,927
about ninety of them,

77
00:04:51,328 --> 00:04:53,047
escaped from the national park,

78
00:04:53,888 --> 00:04:55,727
and devoured farmers'

79
00:04:56,287 --> 00:04:57,047
rice crops

80
00:04:57,688 --> 00:04:58,727
and sugarcane.

81
00:04:59,487 --> 00:05:00,568
They even trampled roads

82
00:05:01,487 --> 00:05:02,727
and injured three people.

83
00:05:04,487 --> 00:05:06,047
I made tremendous effort

84
00:05:06,727 --> 00:05:08,407
to convince local authorities

85
00:05:08,927 --> 00:05:10,208
not to deploy the military,

86
00:05:11,287 --> 00:05:12,328
while herding them

87
00:05:12,807 --> 00:05:14,528
back into the national park.

88
00:05:15,927 --> 00:05:16,688
Impressive.

89
00:05:17,968 --> 00:05:19,247
No wonder Jiang said

90
00:05:19,607 --> 00:05:20,968
you're unruly,

91
00:05:22,008 --> 00:05:24,407
but you're the only one
worthy of Ghost Whip.

92
00:05:25,768 --> 00:05:26,927
Unruly?

93
00:05:27,367 --> 00:05:29,167
I got strictly trained.

94
00:05:30,968 --> 00:05:32,047
When I was young, Jiang

95
00:05:32,047 --> 00:05:34,247
always made me demonstrate for the boys.

96
00:05:48,688 --> 00:05:49,847
Can you teach me how?

97
00:05:52,448 --> 00:05:53,167
Teach what?

98
00:05:53,528 --> 00:05:54,407
Anything.

99
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:56,208
As long as I can stay

100
00:05:58,008 --> 00:05:59,367
and help you.

101
00:06:46,568 --> 00:06:47,648
How did it feel when you

102
00:06:49,047 --> 00:06:50,208
first summoned the cauldron?

103
00:06:55,568 --> 00:06:56,847
Heavier than I expected.

104
00:07:04,807 --> 00:07:07,287
You shoulder heavy burdens as well.

105
00:07:10,088 --> 00:07:11,568
When Jiang summoned the cauldron,

106
00:07:12,927 --> 00:07:14,367
he made it look easy.

107
00:07:16,128 --> 00:07:17,088
Now I'm doing it myself,

108
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:20,528
I realize it's not easy at all.

109
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:25,927
You admit you were pretending it?

110
00:07:28,927 --> 00:07:29,528
Thank you

111
00:07:30,704 --> 00:07:32,088
for supporting me to keep Locust.

112
00:07:33,888 --> 00:07:35,807
You even gave it a name?

113
00:07:35,847 --> 00:07:37,688
You don't give the animals

114
00:07:38,247 --> 00:07:39,287
you care names?

115
00:07:43,927 --> 00:07:45,167
Supporting you

116
00:07:45,688 --> 00:07:47,247
doesn't mean I approve your approach.

117
00:07:47,727 --> 00:07:50,208
But there's no better option right now.

118
00:07:52,008 --> 00:07:53,888
Hope you won't change
your mind too quickly.

119
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:58,528
I need to see it with my own eyes.

120
00:07:59,167 --> 00:08:00,847
I might regret it.

121
00:08:05,487 --> 00:08:06,088
Okay.

122
00:08:44,808 --> 00:08:45,887
Everything went smoothly?

123
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,968
A few close calls.

124
00:08:50,048 --> 00:08:51,088
How are you feeling?

125
00:08:53,887 --> 00:08:54,487
I...

126
00:08:57,048 --> 00:08:57,968
I'm fine.

127
00:08:59,928 --> 00:09:00,647
Good then.

128
00:09:05,767 --> 00:09:06,688
Want to eat anything?

129
00:09:12,968 --> 00:09:14,048
I want to take a shower.

130
00:09:16,887 --> 00:09:18,048
Your wound can't get wet.

131
00:09:18,168 --> 00:09:19,487
Can I at least wash my hair?

132
00:10:08,367 --> 00:10:09,168
Don't...

133
00:10:09,767 --> 00:10:11,007
Don't worry too much.

134
00:10:12,007 --> 00:10:14,288
Jiang looks fine.

135
00:10:15,127 --> 00:10:16,808
And judging from where he's being held,

136
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,367
Lin Xirou doesn't want
to harm him for now.

137
00:10:19,968 --> 00:10:22,168
Jiang also believes he's safe for now.

138
00:10:22,607 --> 00:10:24,767
So he told me to warn you
not to rescue him.

139
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,408
Anyway,

140
00:10:31,568 --> 00:10:32,887
focus on recovering first.

141
00:10:42,328 --> 00:10:42,887
Right.

142
00:10:43,247 --> 00:10:44,408
Jiang also told you

143
00:10:45,328 --> 00:10:46,767
to keep a close eye on that...

144
00:10:48,887 --> 00:10:49,847
What's that again?

145
00:10:51,127 --> 00:10:51,808
Keep a close eye

146
00:10:52,968 --> 00:10:54,568
on Locust. Right, Locust.

147
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:58,208
He said it's both a tool and a hostage.

148
00:11:01,647 --> 00:11:02,887
Who is Locust?

149
00:11:03,647 --> 00:11:05,088
What else did he tell you?

150
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:07,727
Nothing else.

151
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,088
We didn't have time to talk more.

152
00:11:14,568 --> 00:11:16,247
Alright, sit up.

153
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,727
You can return Mr. Changxi's phone

154
00:11:42,727 --> 00:11:43,408
to him.

155
00:11:43,408 --> 00:11:44,048
It's fixed.

156
00:12:00,688 --> 00:12:01,288
Thanks.

157
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:04,968
In case you get bored,

158
00:12:05,127 --> 00:12:07,088
I prepared some clay

159
00:12:07,328 --> 00:12:09,007
and sculpting tools for you.

160
00:12:09,007 --> 00:12:10,247
Not sure if you'll need them.

161
00:12:12,048 --> 00:12:13,088
Guess I'll have

162
00:12:13,088 --> 00:12:13,968
to sculpt

163
00:12:13,968 --> 00:12:15,048
after my arm heals.

164
00:12:17,607 --> 00:12:18,288
Right.

165
00:12:19,568 --> 00:12:20,247
Makes sense.

166
00:12:23,288 --> 00:12:23,968
It's okay.

167
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,727
I also brought you some books.

168
00:12:27,607 --> 00:12:29,448
If you can't sculpt,
you can at least read.

169
00:12:30,487 --> 00:12:31,168
Here they are.

170
00:12:52,568 --> 00:12:53,367
This...

171
00:12:55,527 --> 00:12:57,208
Are you trying to entertain me

172
00:12:57,607 --> 00:12:59,208
or force me into seclusion for creation?

173
00:12:59,568 --> 00:13:01,168
You're like my agent.

174
00:13:16,487 --> 00:13:17,168
And this.

175
00:13:17,887 --> 00:13:18,767
I cleaned it for you.

176
00:13:36,767 --> 00:13:38,647
I feel the most secure
when it's in my hand.

177
00:13:43,688 --> 00:13:45,847
Is this the Mad Blade?

178
00:14:19,688 --> 00:14:20,887
It seems scared.

179
00:14:22,247 --> 00:14:23,808
I thought it's already tamed?

180
00:14:25,328 --> 00:14:26,448
Why still scared of people?

181
00:14:26,808 --> 00:14:29,887
Maybe because Ghost Whip is here.

182
00:14:33,887 --> 00:14:35,448
Such a large living Earth Fiend.

183
00:14:36,448 --> 00:14:37,607
If it doesn't run,

184
00:14:38,288 --> 00:14:40,607
how long will you keep hiding it?

185
00:14:45,568 --> 00:14:46,247
Jiang said it was

186
00:14:46,247 --> 00:14:48,328
captured during a mountain patrol
twenty years ago.

187
00:14:49,247 --> 00:14:50,607
That year the Mad Blade died.

188
00:14:51,568 --> 00:14:52,928
Golden Gate's being repaired.

189
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:56,847
We couldn't kill it or release it,

190
00:14:57,928 --> 00:14:58,887
so had to keep it here.

191
00:15:00,448 --> 00:15:01,288
What happened next?

192
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,007
One year, I and two Hound kids
were told to go

193
00:15:04,408 --> 00:15:05,367
for mountain training,

194
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:08,367
but we loafed around
and wanted to roast locusts.

195
00:15:09,487 --> 00:15:10,607
Just as we lit the fire,

196
00:15:11,647 --> 00:15:13,208
Mr. Crip caught us red-handed.

197
00:15:15,127 --> 00:15:17,847
He locked us in the septic tank
behind the mountain.

198
00:15:18,247 --> 00:15:19,527
We Hounds couldn't

199
00:15:19,968 --> 00:15:21,408
tolerate that stench overnight.

200
00:15:22,527 --> 00:15:23,288
At midnight,

201
00:15:24,448 --> 00:15:26,247
we picked the lock and escaped.

202
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:28,808
But I got lost

203
00:15:30,487 --> 00:15:31,408
and discovered it

204
00:15:32,847 --> 00:15:34,088
in this place.

205
00:15:38,527 --> 00:15:39,727
Now that you mention it,

206
00:15:39,847 --> 00:15:40,847
I remember

207
00:15:41,928 --> 00:15:44,968
you guys were punished
to clean the toilet for three more days,

208
00:15:45,727 --> 00:15:46,408
right?

209
00:15:50,808 --> 00:15:52,527
So since then,

210
00:15:53,127 --> 00:15:54,367
you've been taming it?

211
00:15:57,048 --> 00:15:57,767
No.

212
00:15:59,568 --> 00:16:01,288
After you guys left one by one,

213
00:16:02,568 --> 00:16:04,688
only Ma Hanzi and I stayed behind.

214
00:16:06,448 --> 00:16:08,647
So Jiang entrusted it to me.

215
00:16:11,328 --> 00:16:12,727
Maybe to you,

216
00:16:13,168 --> 00:16:14,088
it's an old friend.

217
00:16:15,048 --> 00:16:17,127
But to other South Mountain Hunters,

218
00:16:18,448 --> 00:16:19,487
it's an enemy.

219
00:16:22,088 --> 00:16:24,448
I wanted to turn enemy into friend,

220
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:26,607
and then defeat it.

221
00:16:28,847 --> 00:16:30,527
Before, you were just on your own.

222
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:32,607
Now you are the leader.

223
00:16:35,688 --> 00:16:37,527
I hope you can tell

224
00:16:39,048 --> 00:16:40,288
friend from enemy.

225
00:16:42,887 --> 00:16:43,808
Since you're here,

226
00:16:45,968 --> 00:16:47,727
let's visit another person

227
00:16:48,928 --> 00:16:50,328
who can't tell friend from enemy.

228
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:04,007
So Ms. Lin doesn't
give birth to any kids?

229
00:17:04,968 --> 00:17:05,608
No.

230
00:17:07,688 --> 00:17:09,327
When were you adopted then?

231
00:17:11,727 --> 00:17:13,007
Must we talk about this?

232
00:17:17,608 --> 00:17:19,487
You agreed to come out today

233
00:17:19,968 --> 00:17:21,487
just as a formality.

234
00:17:21,527 --> 00:17:22,368
I know it.

235
00:17:23,368 --> 00:17:24,527
But think carefully.

236
00:17:24,888 --> 00:17:25,888
If she asks me

237
00:17:25,888 --> 00:17:27,448
what we talked about,

238
00:17:27,928 --> 00:17:29,368
I can't just tell her nothing.

239
00:17:31,688 --> 00:17:34,007
Then change the subject.

240
00:17:39,007 --> 00:17:39,608
Got it.

241
00:17:40,287 --> 00:17:42,287
I'll start with myself

242
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:43,888
to break the ice.

243
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:47,888
I'm also an orphan,

244
00:17:48,128 --> 00:17:49,408
but no one adopted me.

245
00:17:49,767 --> 00:17:51,247
I grew up in a welfare home.

246
00:17:53,767 --> 00:17:56,767
I only knew Ms. Lin sponsored you.

247
00:17:58,567 --> 00:18:01,247
When I was young,
the welfare home reformed.

248
00:18:01,608 --> 00:18:03,327
They stopped annual visits

249
00:18:03,327 --> 00:18:04,608
and superficial formalities,

250
00:18:04,968 --> 00:18:06,327
but host a sponsorship program.

251
00:18:06,848 --> 00:18:09,168
Any business or individual

252
00:18:09,448 --> 00:18:11,368
could choose a child to sponsor,

253
00:18:11,727 --> 00:18:13,848
covering their education

254
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:14,848
and living costs.

255
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:18,087
I was lucky to be chosen by Roadsound.

256
00:18:18,688 --> 00:18:20,608
Ms. Lin never even met us,

257
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,767
but fully sponsored three kids at once.

258
00:18:26,727 --> 00:18:27,688
To tell the truth,

259
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:29,567
among the three of us,

260
00:18:31,287 --> 00:18:33,487
one now works
in telecommunications abroad,

261
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,007
another does research at Roadsound,

262
00:18:37,487 --> 00:18:40,168
and I'm the unpromising one,
just self-employed.

263
00:18:43,767 --> 00:18:47,287
Actually, Ms. Lin often praises you.

264
00:18:49,007 --> 00:18:49,767
Is that so?

265
00:18:51,168 --> 00:18:53,287
That's why I call Ms. Lin my benefactor.

266
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:56,928
Now she's even introduced you to me.

267
00:18:57,327 --> 00:18:59,327
Not sure why I'm that lucky.

268
00:19:00,608 --> 00:19:01,208
Let's go.

269
00:19:04,688 --> 00:19:05,287
Go.

270
00:19:08,287 --> 00:19:09,047
Be careful.

271
00:19:09,767 --> 00:19:10,368
Be careful.

272
00:19:22,368 --> 00:19:22,968
What's wrong?

273
00:19:27,087 --> 00:19:27,888
N-Nothing.

274
00:19:28,807 --> 00:19:29,448
Let's go.

275
00:19:31,567 --> 00:19:33,287
A stall selling
qingtuan rice balls ahead.

276
00:19:33,527 --> 00:19:34,327
Ever tried it?

277
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:35,408
No.

278
00:19:35,487 --> 00:19:36,087
Let's go.

279
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,224
(Luo)

280
00:19:43,727 --> 00:19:44,327
Sorry.

281
00:19:44,327 --> 00:19:46,608
I failed to notify you
that mission's canceled.

282
00:19:46,608 --> 00:19:47,408
No need to worry.

283
00:19:49,287 --> 00:19:49,888
Sorry.

284
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:52,168
I failed to notify you
that mission's canceled.

285
00:19:52,168 --> 00:19:52,968
No need to worry.

286
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:58,287
Is he completely dead?

287
00:19:58,848 --> 00:20:00,408
The skull apex and the seventh vertebra

288
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:01,648
are Earth Fiends' weak points.

289
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:02,848
Once damaged,

290
00:20:02,848 --> 00:20:04,968
they'll hibernate like Gou Ya

291
00:20:05,688 --> 00:20:07,047
for three months to half a year.

292
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:09,007
Then wake up again?

293
00:20:11,368 --> 00:20:14,087
Only Mad Blade
can completely kill Earth Fiends.

294
00:20:25,487 --> 00:20:26,128
No.

295
00:20:28,047 --> 00:20:28,688
What?

296
00:20:29,767 --> 00:20:31,807
Lin Xirou executed Gou Ya.

297
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,208
It means Earth Fiends
can kill their own kind.

298
00:20:36,128 --> 00:20:37,968
Yet she also summoned

299
00:20:37,968 --> 00:20:39,448
Earth Fiends across the nation.

300
00:20:39,448 --> 00:20:40,487
This means, for them,

301
00:20:40,487 --> 00:20:41,888
it's no easy task.

302
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,608
For us,

303
00:20:47,448 --> 00:20:48,648
this might be good news.

304
00:20:49,567 --> 00:20:50,688
After all, we've discovered

305
00:20:50,688 --> 00:20:52,247
another way to defeat Earth Fiends.

306
00:20:53,807 --> 00:20:55,527
Do you know why Gou Ya was executed?

307
00:20:57,168 --> 00:21:00,007
They said he broke rules
and omnivorized.

308
00:21:00,487 --> 00:21:02,007
His scent risked exposure.

309
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:03,128
It's forbidden,

310
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:04,208
so he must be executed.

311
00:21:05,767 --> 00:21:06,888
Omnivory?

312
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:07,848
Yes.

313
00:21:13,767 --> 00:21:15,448
Forget it. When Chen Fu wakes up,

314
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:17,408
we might get useful info from him.

315
00:21:18,968 --> 00:21:20,527
When Chen Fu wakes up?

316
00:21:20,807 --> 00:21:22,327
Right. He's still in my trunk.

317
00:21:23,247 --> 00:21:23,928
Now?

318
00:21:24,128 --> 00:21:24,688
Yes.

319
00:21:25,168 --> 00:21:26,368
Why didn't you say so earlier?

320
00:21:26,567 --> 00:21:28,208
Don't worry. He won't wake up.

321
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:29,688
Why are you so sure?

322
00:21:35,487 --> 00:21:36,527
I'll go check.

323
00:21:45,928 --> 00:21:48,567
We have such a place?

324
00:21:49,247 --> 00:21:50,968
The rescue team won't come here.

325
00:21:51,848 --> 00:21:53,448
It's usually sealed off.

326
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:58,448
I assume the place where
that small Earth Fiend was kept

327
00:21:58,848 --> 00:22:00,408
is also your secret base?

328
00:22:00,888 --> 00:22:02,087
Only Jiang and I

329
00:22:03,007 --> 00:22:03,928
know about it.

330
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,247
Red threads pierce pupils.

331
00:22:16,527 --> 00:22:18,287
We rescued him from the Earth Fiends.

332
00:22:19,527 --> 00:22:20,688
But he wasn't lucky enough

333
00:22:21,608 --> 00:22:22,928
to undergo the natural fire.

334
00:22:23,128 --> 00:22:24,608
You just keep him locked up forever?

335
00:22:26,087 --> 00:22:27,567
The Whip Clan excels at taming.

336
00:22:28,567 --> 00:22:29,567
Perfect timing.

337
00:22:30,727 --> 00:22:32,168
Let's see if you have any idea.

338
00:22:36,007 --> 00:22:36,968
I have plenty way

339
00:22:37,087 --> 00:22:37,928
to tame beasts

340
00:22:38,247 --> 00:22:39,327
and fiends.

341
00:22:40,448 --> 00:22:41,408
But to tame human?

342
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:43,567
There's no precedent
in our family history.

343
00:22:46,247 --> 00:22:47,007
Do you think

344
00:22:48,327 --> 00:22:49,567
he still counts as human?

345
00:23:00,487 --> 00:23:01,567
It is easy to tame beasts

346
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:03,087
because

347
00:23:03,408 --> 00:23:04,888
we can understand their minds.

348
00:23:05,807 --> 00:23:07,848
But no one

349
00:23:09,007 --> 00:23:10,247
can understand human minds.

350
00:23:10,727 --> 00:23:11,968
Human minds are unpredictable.

351
00:23:13,648 --> 00:23:16,087
It's a challenge we could never resolve.

352
00:23:17,767 --> 00:23:19,527
But now we're dealing

353
00:23:20,087 --> 00:23:23,448
with something that's
between human and fiend.

354
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:30,087
What do others think?

355
00:23:34,608 --> 00:23:35,848
They don't need to know.

356
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:41,648
How many more secrets are you keeping?

357
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:10,648
(Kaixun Pastry Shop)

358
00:24:10,648 --> 00:24:11,247
Ling.

359
00:24:12,487 --> 00:24:14,448
Why do I feel like we're being followed?

360
00:24:17,368 --> 00:24:19,807
If you can't find conversation topics,

361
00:24:20,087 --> 00:24:21,567
you could be silent.

362
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:23,648
No need to force a conversation.

363
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:25,408
You're trying too hard.

364
00:24:27,767 --> 00:24:29,168
I may lack everything else,

365
00:24:29,408 --> 00:24:31,007
but never conversation topics.

366
00:24:31,487 --> 00:24:33,368
Your assorted qingtuan rice balls. Here.

367
00:24:33,368 --> 00:24:34,047
Thank you.

368
00:24:34,168 --> 00:24:34,688
Thank you.

369
00:24:34,727 --> 00:24:35,968
Let's talk about the qingtuan.

370
00:24:36,327 --> 00:24:38,848
Before the Tomb-Sweeping Festival,

371
00:24:39,327 --> 00:24:41,087
we extract juice from mugwort, you know,

372
00:24:41,712 --> 00:24:43,408
and then mix it
with glutinous rice flour.

373
00:24:43,408 --> 00:24:45,007
You're the 66th customers

374
00:24:45,007 --> 00:24:46,247
in our shop today.

375
00:24:46,448 --> 00:24:48,888
We've prepared three gifts
for you to choose from.

376
00:24:48,928 --> 00:24:49,608
Pick one.

377
00:24:51,648 --> 00:24:52,368
Go pick one.

378
00:24:59,968 --> 00:25:00,888
That's more like it.

379
00:25:09,727 --> 00:25:11,888
I'll pick this one.

380
00:25:11,888 --> 00:25:13,047
Good choice.

381
00:25:13,188 --> 00:25:13,688
Let's go.

382
00:25:13,688 --> 00:25:15,208
Wait, what's wrong?

383
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:16,408
Take care.

384
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:18,047
Don't look back.

385
00:25:18,368 --> 00:25:19,168
Watch your step.

386
00:25:20,527 --> 00:25:21,327
Wait, we...

387
00:25:21,327 --> 00:25:22,688
No questions. Follow me.

388
00:25:47,487 --> 00:25:48,688
That's Sis.

389
00:25:49,608 --> 00:25:50,408
Why is she here?

390
00:26:09,448 --> 00:26:10,688
This area is full of residents.

391
00:26:11,168 --> 00:26:12,168
Haven't you thought

392
00:26:12,208 --> 00:26:13,848
he might cause trouble if he escapes?

393
00:26:15,767 --> 00:26:16,487
I'm sorry.

394
00:26:16,888 --> 00:26:17,408
I was

395
00:26:17,408 --> 00:26:19,087
too focused on checking on you

396
00:26:19,128 --> 00:26:20,087
and forgot about him.

397
00:26:28,968 --> 00:26:30,648
Once these membranes heal and shed,

398
00:26:31,368 --> 00:26:33,087
he'll be as good as new.

399
00:26:33,688 --> 00:26:35,527
That's how primal Earth Fiends work,
at least.

400
00:26:37,168 --> 00:26:38,767
But I'm not sure if these in human forms

401
00:26:39,888 --> 00:26:40,928
work the same way.

402
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,128
Such strong regenerative ability.

403
00:26:45,047 --> 00:26:46,727
It makes them difficult to defeat.

404
00:26:49,368 --> 00:26:50,848
Tuo, the meal is ready.

405
00:26:50,848 --> 00:26:52,487
Bring it up for Miss Nie.

406
00:26:53,247 --> 00:26:54,247
Okay, coming.

407
00:26:54,928 --> 00:26:56,368
Wait for me. Let's eat up here.

408
00:26:58,327 --> 00:26:59,727
I feel much better now.

409
00:27:00,208 --> 00:27:01,007
I'll eat downstairs.

410
00:27:01,327 --> 00:27:01,968
Wait,

411
00:27:02,608 --> 00:27:03,448
are you sure?

412
00:27:16,007 --> 00:27:17,368
Well, I'll tie him up.

413
00:27:28,976 --> 00:27:32,240
(Changxi Dumplings)

414
00:27:41,087 --> 00:27:42,368
Fresh out of the pot.

415
00:27:47,087 --> 00:27:48,128
Haven't seen this before.

416
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:51,608
This is Miss Nie's.

417
00:27:52,168 --> 00:27:53,287
This one is yours.

418
00:27:54,287 --> 00:27:56,368
Wait, why the special treatment here?

419
00:27:56,487 --> 00:27:57,128
Here.

420
00:27:58,087 --> 00:27:59,448
Herbal beef filling.

421
00:27:59,608 --> 00:28:00,567
New filling.

422
00:28:01,327 --> 00:28:02,807
Fill your stomach

423
00:28:03,007 --> 00:28:04,327
(Table for Two)
while nourishing your body.

424
00:28:04,567 --> 00:28:05,247
Try it.

425
00:28:06,888 --> 00:28:07,608
Mr. Changxi.

426
00:28:08,168 --> 00:28:10,408
Usually for new drug clinical trials,

427
00:28:10,408 --> 00:28:11,688
we need multiple control groups.

428
00:28:11,767 --> 00:28:13,087
Her opinion alone isn't enough.

429
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:14,807
If I could try the nourishment meal...

430
00:28:14,807 --> 00:28:15,408
Stop.

431
00:28:17,007 --> 00:28:18,287
You don't need nourishment.

432
00:28:18,688 --> 00:28:19,368
Too much for you.

433
00:28:23,247 --> 00:28:24,087
It's delicious.

434
00:28:26,888 --> 00:28:28,047
I've never seen someone cook

435
00:28:28,047 --> 00:28:29,567
better than Ms. Lu before.

436
00:28:29,968 --> 00:28:30,688
Ms. Lu?

437
00:28:31,487 --> 00:28:32,368
She is my housekeeper.

438
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:35,608
I only know how to make dumplings.

439
00:28:35,696 --> 00:28:36,928
Can't make other dishes well.

440
00:28:37,087 --> 00:28:38,608
If you don't mind,

441
00:28:38,767 --> 00:28:40,567
I'll teach Ms. Lu how to make filling.

442
00:28:40,767 --> 00:28:42,408
You can eat them whenever you want.

443
00:28:43,968 --> 00:28:44,567
Mr. Changxi.

444
00:28:44,648 --> 00:28:47,007
You should have Ms. Lu
teach you to cook other dishes.

445
00:28:47,007 --> 00:28:48,527
Sharing knowledge.

446
00:28:49,047 --> 00:28:50,448
Got tired of my dumplings?

447
00:28:53,247 --> 00:28:54,247
By the way, Mr. Changxi.

448
00:28:54,408 --> 00:28:56,648
I want to order 20 portions
for Ms. Lu tomorrow.

449
00:28:56,648 --> 00:28:57,448
Is that okay?

450
00:28:57,608 --> 00:28:58,727
Got it. I'll make it done.

451
00:29:00,128 --> 00:29:01,727
Thank you, Mr. Yan.

452
00:29:02,567 --> 00:29:03,208
Eat up.

453
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:04,727
Wait.

454
00:29:04,928 --> 00:29:06,527
Here, Mr. Yan. Have one.

455
00:29:09,527 --> 00:29:11,128
I don't take handouts.

456
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:11,968
Then throw it away.

457
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:18,168
It's from you.

458
00:29:24,807 --> 00:29:25,408
One more.

459
00:29:25,408 --> 00:29:26,247
Enough.

460
00:29:32,128 --> 00:29:33,247
Exchange.

461
00:29:47,688 --> 00:29:48,608
Nice.

462
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,888
You're a quick learner.

463
00:29:51,648 --> 00:29:53,448
She usually creates artworks.

464
00:29:53,448 --> 00:29:55,327
Dumplings are child's play for her.

465
00:29:56,208 --> 00:29:57,527
These dumplings could sell high.

466
00:29:57,527 --> 00:29:59,128
I should update the price tag later.

467
00:30:00,208 --> 00:30:02,208
Good dumplings depend on the filling.

468
00:30:02,327 --> 00:30:03,727
Your filling is perfect.

469
00:30:04,208 --> 00:30:05,487
Even if wrapped like his,

470
00:30:05,487 --> 00:30:06,608
they wouldn't taste bad.

471
00:30:07,727 --> 00:30:09,128
What's wrong with mine?

472
00:30:09,487 --> 00:30:10,128
It's...

473
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:11,408
It is unique.

474
00:30:12,087 --> 00:30:12,608
Right?

475
00:30:12,928 --> 00:30:14,087
Keep them for yourself.

476
00:30:14,128 --> 00:30:15,247
They won't sell anyway.

477
00:30:24,208 --> 00:30:26,848
Mr. Changxi spent half his life
mastering his craft.

478
00:30:26,928 --> 00:30:28,487
He teaches Ms. Lu the filling,

479
00:30:29,087 --> 00:30:30,527
and teaches you the wrapping.

480
00:30:30,807 --> 00:30:33,168
You can inherit the Changxi Dumplings.

481
00:30:34,408 --> 00:30:36,928
If your sculpting career fails,

482
00:30:36,928 --> 00:30:38,287
come back and run the shop.

483
00:30:38,727 --> 00:30:40,047
Don't be sarcastic.

484
00:30:40,168 --> 00:30:41,408
You're a true businessman.

485
00:30:41,448 --> 00:30:43,047
All business strategies in that head.

486
00:30:43,567 --> 00:30:45,007
Not as genuine as Mr. Changxi.

487
00:31:14,608 --> 00:31:16,648
No matter how meticulous Ms. Lu is,

488
00:31:18,208 --> 00:31:19,767
and how well Mr. Changxi teaches,

489
00:31:20,928 --> 00:31:23,007
dumplings cooked at home

490
00:31:23,287 --> 00:31:25,168
would still taste different, right?

491
00:31:26,368 --> 00:31:27,408
Not that different.

492
00:31:28,408 --> 00:31:30,688
Then those humanoid Earth Fiends
are similar too,

493
00:31:32,408 --> 00:31:34,047
but never 100 percent identical.

494
00:31:37,767 --> 00:31:40,047
Yes. Like omnivorous habits.

495
00:31:41,208 --> 00:31:43,608
Omnivorous Earth Fiends carry scent,

496
00:31:43,798 --> 00:31:44,608
easily get exposed.

497
00:31:47,408 --> 00:31:48,928
The Hound Clan can naturally detect

498
00:31:48,928 --> 00:31:49,888
Earth Fiends' scent.

499
00:31:50,688 --> 00:31:52,247
But after taking human form,

500
00:31:52,247 --> 00:31:53,767
Earth Fiends mask their scent.

501
00:31:54,848 --> 00:31:56,168
To stay hidden,

502
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:58,168
omnivorous habits become forbidden.

503
00:31:59,128 --> 00:32:00,007
Mr. Gou Ya.

504
00:32:01,688 --> 00:32:03,767
Omnivorous? A nice way to put it.

505
00:32:03,968 --> 00:32:04,727
Actually, it's...

506
00:32:04,727 --> 00:32:05,327
Eating humans.

507
00:32:08,408 --> 00:32:09,567
So this means

508
00:32:12,128 --> 00:32:14,767
eating humans
won't make them more human-like,

509
00:32:15,208 --> 00:32:16,807
but actually reveals their true nature.

510
00:32:18,888 --> 00:32:19,807
Exactly.

511
00:32:27,888 --> 00:32:29,047
This is a primal Earth Fiend.

512
00:32:30,087 --> 00:32:31,128
To become human,

513
00:32:31,487 --> 00:32:32,448
it needs a wrapper.

514
00:32:37,727 --> 00:32:41,767
Wrap it tight, cook thoroughly,

515
00:32:42,448 --> 00:32:43,448
and then serve up

516
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:45,128
as a human form.

517
00:32:49,047 --> 00:32:51,128
Can any wrapper contain this 'filling'?

518
00:32:52,767 --> 00:32:53,767
Besides the wrapper

519
00:32:53,767 --> 00:32:55,888
and the time-consuming process,

520
00:32:56,047 --> 00:32:57,807
are there other steps involved?

521
00:32:58,648 --> 00:32:59,807
Or additives?

522
00:33:00,848 --> 00:33:02,128
I think something's missing.

523
00:33:09,968 --> 00:33:11,327
I almost forgot.

524
00:33:12,848 --> 00:33:13,968
I have a list here.

525
00:33:14,128 --> 00:33:15,327
Lin Ling gave it to me.

526
00:33:17,487 --> 00:33:18,968
I didn't have time to study it.

527
00:33:22,527 --> 00:33:23,128
This...

528
00:33:24,807 --> 00:33:27,047
(Record Sheet)
Lin Xirou has a hidden compartment with a password.

529
00:33:27,287 --> 00:33:28,807
All these documents are locked inside.

530
00:33:30,007 --> 00:33:31,968
(Roommate, Xu Anni)
Must be an important list.

531
00:33:36,448 --> 00:33:37,287
Roommate?

532
00:33:39,968 --> 00:33:40,727
For safety,

533
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,727
they should live alone.

534
00:33:43,408 --> 00:33:44,928
They live with someone,

535
00:33:44,928 --> 00:33:46,208
what if they can't resist?

536
00:33:46,247 --> 00:33:47,208
That would expose them.

537
00:33:51,608 --> 00:33:52,608
Why aren't

538
00:33:52,888 --> 00:33:54,287
these Earth Fiends living alone?

539
00:33:56,807 --> 00:33:59,408
Is it to better study

540
00:33:59,448 --> 00:34:00,247
and mimic humans?

541
00:34:03,287 --> 00:34:05,047
Who does Lin Xirou live with?

542
00:34:06,007 --> 00:34:06,688
Me

543
00:34:07,527 --> 00:34:08,328
and Lin Ling.

544
00:34:12,448 --> 00:34:13,207
Tell me.

545
00:34:14,288 --> 00:34:15,607
Did you run away from home

546
00:34:15,607 --> 00:34:17,007
or attempt to kill yourself?

547
00:34:18,728 --> 00:34:19,607
What?

548
00:34:19,928 --> 00:34:21,848
They say quiet people
harbor wild streaks.

549
00:34:22,167 --> 00:34:24,368
You must've done something shocking

550
00:34:25,127 --> 00:34:26,248
that even Ms. Lin

551
00:34:26,527 --> 00:34:27,808
has to monitor you tightly.

552
00:34:27,888 --> 00:34:29,248
Otherwise, why monitor you

553
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,487
just for going out for a date?

554
00:34:33,127 --> 00:34:34,127
You should

555
00:34:34,647 --> 00:34:36,408
ask Ms. Lin about it.

556
00:34:44,167 --> 00:34:46,368
Then there's only one possibility left.

557
00:34:47,448 --> 00:34:48,848
Ms. Lin isn't monitoring you,

558
00:34:48,848 --> 00:34:50,288
but me.

559
00:34:51,288 --> 00:34:53,647
Worried that I'm a villain
with ulterior motives,

560
00:34:54,007 --> 00:34:55,167
and might harm you.

561
00:35:02,928 --> 00:35:04,928
Lin Ling was adopted by Lin Xirou.

562
00:35:05,448 --> 00:35:06,968
We basically grew up together.

563
00:35:07,848 --> 00:35:10,647
But I think Lin Xirou
clearly favors me more.

564
00:35:10,768 --> 00:35:12,448
Do Earth Fiends prefer boys to girls?

565
00:35:14,127 --> 00:35:14,968
Not exactly.

566
00:35:15,888 --> 00:35:18,928
She's just extremely strict
with Lin Ling,

567
00:35:19,288 --> 00:35:20,328
and restraining Lin Ling.

568
00:35:21,072 --> 00:35:22,647
She keeps pushing Lin Ling to marry,

569
00:35:22,768 --> 00:35:25,808
claiming that she wants many descendants

570
00:35:25,928 --> 00:35:27,448
and to enjoy the family gatherings.

571
00:35:29,007 --> 00:35:31,687
Has she urged you?

572
00:35:34,527 --> 00:35:35,888
I'm older than Lin Ling,

573
00:35:35,888 --> 00:35:37,207
so I should be first in line.

574
00:35:37,968 --> 00:35:39,047
But she never urged me,

575
00:35:39,047 --> 00:35:39,848
only Lin Ling.

576
00:35:43,288 --> 00:35:44,928
Descendants?

577
00:35:45,288 --> 00:35:47,007
You're only mentioning this now?

578
00:35:47,448 --> 00:35:48,448
I don't care.

579
00:35:48,567 --> 00:35:49,647
Slaughter a cow right now,

580
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,408
and get me my 40 jin of meat.

581
00:35:51,696 --> 00:35:53,866
If I have no meat,
I couldn't open the shop tomorrow.

582
00:35:54,087 --> 00:35:55,448
Keep your words.

583
00:35:55,687 --> 00:35:56,968
Or you'll ruin the bond I had

584
00:35:56,968 --> 00:35:57,687
with your dad.

585
00:35:58,207 --> 00:36:00,127
Huzi, let me tell you the truth.

586
00:36:00,527 --> 00:36:02,328
Your dad ruined things with drinking.

587
00:36:02,328 --> 00:36:03,448
If you don't shape up now,

588
00:36:03,567 --> 00:36:05,127
your business will collapse.

589
00:36:09,368 --> 00:36:10,408
Sorry, Miss Nie.

590
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:11,567
If you...

591
00:36:11,567 --> 00:36:13,527
If you need those 20 portions urgently,

592
00:36:13,728 --> 00:36:15,687
I'll have to use frozen meat
from the freezer.

593
00:36:15,968 --> 00:36:17,607
It's fine. Take it easy, Mr. Changxi.

594
00:36:18,848 --> 00:36:20,487
The one supplying me

595
00:36:20,808 --> 00:36:23,248
is relying on his family's
pastures and cattle

596
00:36:23,248 --> 00:36:24,687
with quality meat,

597
00:36:24,848 --> 00:36:27,047
never fulfills his work properly,

598
00:36:27,808 --> 00:36:29,487
just like his dad,

599
00:36:29,728 --> 00:36:31,328
being a good-for-nothing drunkard.

600
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:34,808
Genetics are interesting.

601
00:36:35,368 --> 00:36:36,167
Look at Tuo,

602
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:37,968
a fine young man.

603
00:36:38,408 --> 00:36:40,007
Back when his dad worked at our mine,

604
00:36:40,047 --> 00:36:40,687
he was...

605
00:36:40,687 --> 00:36:41,368
Mr. Changxi.

606
00:36:43,087 --> 00:36:44,888
Why don't you go rest?

607
00:36:44,888 --> 00:36:46,328
We'll finish wrapping these.

608
00:36:48,288 --> 00:36:49,007
Right.

609
00:36:49,368 --> 00:36:50,527
Miss Nie needs to recuperate.

610
00:36:50,848 --> 00:36:51,448
Well,

611
00:36:51,448 --> 00:36:52,768
don't stay up too late.

612
00:36:52,968 --> 00:36:53,848
Got it.

613
00:36:54,127 --> 00:36:54,968
Rest up, Mr. Changxi.

614
00:37:00,768 --> 00:37:01,808
Blood bag?

615
00:37:07,368 --> 00:37:09,087
The blood bags Lin Xirou mentioned

616
00:37:10,207 --> 00:37:12,207
are humans with blood ties.

617
00:37:13,928 --> 00:37:14,968
Roommates

618
00:37:16,607 --> 00:37:18,647
are essentially reared as blood bags.

619
00:37:19,567 --> 00:37:20,928
Though they can't eat humans,

620
00:37:21,368 --> 00:37:23,087
blood bags are crucial to them.

621
00:37:23,248 --> 00:37:24,928
So, she has to ensure
their reproduction.

622
00:37:27,207 --> 00:37:28,487
(Xu Anni)
Humans with blood ties.

623
00:37:31,768 --> 00:37:32,848
How's the preparation?

624
00:37:33,487 --> 00:37:35,328
After pre-treatment,
we can remove the roots.

625
00:37:38,928 --> 00:37:39,768
Where's Xu Anni?

626
00:37:40,768 --> 00:37:41,808
Someone has taken over.

627
00:37:46,207 --> 00:37:48,167
Chen Fu's roommate is Xu Anni.

628
00:37:49,888 --> 00:37:52,047
Lin Ling and I met her dad as children.

629
00:37:54,328 --> 00:37:55,448
She has blood ties,

630
00:37:56,928 --> 00:37:58,408
and gets reared by Earth Fiends.

631
00:37:58,768 --> 00:37:59,928
Just like you said.

632
00:38:08,207 --> 00:38:09,448
Even if we know about it,

633
00:38:11,167 --> 00:38:12,687
where do we even start?

634
00:38:27,007 --> 00:38:27,808
Tell me,

635
00:38:28,368 --> 00:38:30,487
did we make progress today,

636
00:38:30,728 --> 00:38:32,047
or fall into another confusion?

637
00:38:35,888 --> 00:38:36,728
Regardless,

638
00:38:37,087 --> 00:38:39,487
Mr. Changxi made
great progress in his dumplings.

639
00:38:42,448 --> 00:38:43,207
Agreed.

640
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:46,567
Mr. Changxi's dumplings

641
00:38:46,567 --> 00:38:47,888
not only nourish the body,

642
00:38:47,888 --> 00:38:49,127
but also sharpen the mind.

643
00:38:51,007 --> 00:38:53,087
Not inferior over Roadsound's medicine.

644
00:38:57,087 --> 00:38:57,728
Perfect timing.

645
00:38:57,888 --> 00:38:59,007
You should take antibiotics.

646
00:39:00,328 --> 00:39:01,487
Focus on recovering.

647
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:02,687
We still have time.

648
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:19,487
Rough day today.

649
00:39:21,248 --> 00:39:22,527
Is it rough?

650
00:39:22,968 --> 00:39:24,248
I'm just getting warmed up.

651
00:39:25,087 --> 00:39:26,728
If you want to go anywhere to have fun,

652
00:39:26,728 --> 00:39:27,687
just call me.

653
00:39:28,047 --> 00:39:29,448
I'd accept

654
00:39:29,448 --> 00:39:30,567
without hesitation.

655
00:39:36,047 --> 00:39:36,848
Lin Ling.

656
00:39:39,248 --> 00:39:40,408
This date with you

657
00:39:41,368 --> 00:39:42,527
was arranged by Ms. Lin.

658
00:39:43,328 --> 00:39:45,248
But befriending you

659
00:39:45,928 --> 00:39:46,687
is what I want.

660
00:39:52,487 --> 00:39:53,047
Here.

661
00:39:53,607 --> 00:39:54,487
Qingtuan rice balls.

662
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,240
Today's weather is quite poetic.

663
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,340
Right?

664
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,600
The rain saturates the street
with tender grace.

665
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,920
Green shades afar
are seen-yet-unseen in place.

666
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,160
Am I annoying?

667
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,240
Two yogurts, please.

668
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,360
Perfect.

669
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,240
Frozen-solid yogurts are the best.

670
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,960
Just buy popsicles then.

671
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,160
You take a non-frozen one.

672
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,160
Cold foods are harmful.

673
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,600
Especially for you girls,

674
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,000
eat less cold foods.

675
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,760
And,

676
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,000
chill rises from the ground.

677
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,480
Bare arms are fine,

678
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,000
but keep legs covered.

679
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,120
Put it on.

680
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:21,760
Thanks.

681
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,800
Health matters at any age.

682
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,520
You don't care about it,

683
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,000
but joint pains await later.

684
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,280
Right?

685
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,800
My jacket is nice.

686
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:33,920
It's in lucky purple.
