Some things

19
00:02:19,735 --> 00:02:21,376
are better discussed between girls.

20
00:02:35,096 --> 00:02:36,976
Everyone, welcome

21
00:02:36,976 --> 00:02:39,015
to the Mengjiu Grand Stage of Heyang.

00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,976
wish all friends present today

30
00:03:22,216 --> 00:03:23,216
Hello, Mr. Meng.

31
00:03:23,615 --> 00:03:24,496
I've arrived.

32
00:03:24,615 --> 00:03:25,816
I'm already in Heyang.

33
00:03:27,216 --> 00:03:28,336
No need.

34
00:03:28,496 --> 00:03:29,575
I've already eaten.

35
00:03:29,575 --> 00:03:31,216
Besides, I'm meeting a friend tonight.

36
00:03:31,936 --> 00:03:32,695
Right.

37
00:03:33,536 --> 00:03:34,376
How about this?

38
00:03:34,496 --> 00:03:36,575
Could we have lunch together tomorrow?

39
00:03:37,496 --> 00:03:38,695
Great. That works.

40
00:03:38,976 --> 00:03:42,295
Then please send me the time and place.

41
00:03:43,216 --> 00:03:43,816
Okay.

42
00:03:44,096 --> 00:03:45,336
See you tomorrow, Mr. Meng.

43
00:03:46,256 --> 00:03:46,855
Goodbye.

44
00:03:59,496 --> 00:03:59,976
Bravo!

45
00:03:59,976 --> 00:04:01,295
Bravo!

46
00:04:02,415 --> 00:04:03,256
Another one!

47
00:04:03,256 --> 00:04:03,895
Another one!

48
00:04:03,895 --> 00:04:04,855
Another dance!

49
00:04:05,735 --> 00:04:06,816
Another one!

50
00:04:13,895 --> 00:04:14,656
Xu Anni.

51
00:04:16,216 --> 00:04:16,815
Hello.

52
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,295
Tell your boss
that no one can change my mind.

53
00:04:21,855 --> 00:04:22,855
I said I'm not going.

54
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,576
I told him I have a boyfriend.

55
00:04:26,175 --> 00:04:27,415
You might've misunderstood.

56
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,976
There's an opening event
at Fengyun Plaza tomorrow.

57
00:04:30,175 --> 00:04:32,175
Could you help us liven up the venue?

58
00:04:34,615 --> 00:04:35,415
Are you...

59
00:04:36,096 --> 00:04:37,255
I'm the event organizer.

60
00:04:37,495 --> 00:04:38,495
We can discuss the price.

61
00:04:40,016 --> 00:04:41,456
Sorry, I thought...

62
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:45,055
We've had shady people
approach us before.

63
00:04:45,216 --> 00:04:46,935
I thought you were one of them.

64
00:04:47,055 --> 00:04:47,815
My apologies.

65
00:04:47,896 --> 00:04:48,336
It's okay.

66
00:04:48,336 --> 00:04:49,096
Please sit.

67
00:04:49,136 --> 00:04:49,615
Okay.

68
00:04:52,615 --> 00:04:53,696
You said tomorrow?

69
00:04:53,696 --> 00:04:54,216
Yes.

70
00:04:54,415 --> 00:04:55,016
Can you do it?

71
00:04:55,656 --> 00:04:56,735
I can't make it tomorrow.

72
00:04:56,735 --> 00:04:58,136
I'm booked here through next week.

73
00:04:59,896 --> 00:05:00,615
Then...

74
00:05:01,855 --> 00:05:02,976
Could you make an exception?

75
00:05:04,415 --> 00:05:05,415
I'm afraid not.

76
00:05:06,216 --> 00:05:07,456
The owner here is very kind.

77
00:05:07,615 --> 00:05:09,576
He booked me for ten shows
without haggling.

78
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:10,935
I've only done two so far.

79
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:11,855
I can't leave now.

80
00:05:13,096 --> 00:05:14,055
Maybe next time?

81
00:05:15,096 --> 00:05:15,776
Okay.

82
00:05:16,136 --> 00:05:16,976
It's a shame.

83
00:05:17,935 --> 00:05:19,175
Let me get your contact info.

84
00:05:19,175 --> 00:05:20,175
I'll contact you again.

85
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:24,776
I'll pay the deposit first.

86
00:05:24,976 --> 00:05:26,776
No need. Pay after the show.
It's the rule.

87
00:05:29,656 --> 00:05:31,016
That pendant's unique.

88
00:05:31,175 --> 00:05:32,016
Did you make it?

89
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:33,096
This?

90
00:05:34,295 --> 00:05:35,055
I made it.

91
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:37,696
I've loved crafts since childhood.

92
00:05:37,776 --> 00:05:38,815
So in my free time,

93
00:05:38,815 --> 00:05:40,096
I tinker with these things.

94
00:05:45,976 --> 00:05:46,976
What happened to you?

95
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:50,336
My...

96
00:05:51,216 --> 00:05:52,295
My boyfriend

97
00:05:52,776 --> 00:05:53,696
had a few drinks

98
00:05:54,175 --> 00:05:55,216
and got rough.

99
00:06:00,216 --> 00:06:01,735
You can't let that slide.

100
00:06:02,656 --> 00:06:03,536
Once men do it once,

101
00:06:04,136 --> 00:06:05,656
they'll do it again and again.

102
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,576
Your boyfriend

103
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:10,216
does this to you too?

104
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:12,136
No.

105
00:06:12,576 --> 00:06:13,495
He treats me very well.

106
00:06:14,776 --> 00:06:15,735
Let me tell you.

107
00:06:16,415 --> 00:06:19,495
You've got to meet a few
to find the one.

108
00:06:20,096 --> 00:06:21,935
If you're lucky someday,

109
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:23,615
you'll find the one meant for you.

110
00:06:25,136 --> 00:06:26,495
My ex was no good either.

111
00:06:27,016 --> 00:06:28,375
He's the same, always violent.

112
00:06:29,216 --> 00:06:30,576
But I didn't take it lying down.

113
00:06:31,295 --> 00:06:32,375
I fought back every time.

114
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:34,216
The neighbors called the police.

115
00:06:36,216 --> 00:06:38,295
At least you've met someone
who treats you well now.

116
00:06:44,456 --> 00:06:46,615
I grew up without parents,
naive about everything.

117
00:06:47,175 --> 00:06:48,815
I met a guy and impulsively ran off.

118
00:06:50,055 --> 00:06:50,855
It's my fault

119
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:52,696
for trusting others too much.

120
00:06:54,175 --> 00:06:55,336
But now

121
00:06:56,136 --> 00:06:57,656
things are truly different.

122
00:06:58,055 --> 00:06:59,136
I feel much more grounded.

123
00:07:00,935 --> 00:07:02,336
What does your boyfriend do?

124
00:07:03,295 --> 00:07:04,456
Driving for hire around town.

125
00:07:05,495 --> 00:07:07,216
He said yesterday he'd come home late.

126
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:09,175
A simple man.

127
00:07:10,456 --> 00:07:11,815
I don't expect him

128
00:07:11,815 --> 00:07:12,935
to strike it rich.

129
00:07:13,576 --> 00:07:14,495
But towards me,

130
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:17,255
his heart is genuine.

131
00:07:20,336 --> 00:07:21,415
I really envy you.

132
00:07:28,175 --> 00:07:29,855
You'll find someone too.

133
00:07:31,896 --> 00:07:33,016
But not the current one.

134
00:07:33,456 --> 00:07:34,255
Dump him quickly.

135
00:07:41,815 --> 00:07:42,415
Well,

136
00:07:43,216 --> 00:07:44,576
I won't disturb your work anymore.

137
00:07:44,815 --> 00:07:46,456
I'll call you next time I need help.

138
00:07:46,536 --> 00:07:47,415
Okay. Do call me.

139
00:07:49,175 --> 00:07:49,896
Bye-bye.

140
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:13,336
Not going well?

141
00:08:14,216 --> 00:08:15,096
Too well, actually.

142
00:08:15,415 --> 00:08:16,495
I didn't even need to try.

143
00:08:16,656 --> 00:08:17,656
She offered it up freely.

144
00:08:18,495 --> 00:08:19,776
Then why the long face?

145
00:08:22,776 --> 00:08:23,656
I think

146
00:08:24,536 --> 00:08:26,336
she's lived in her own world,

147
00:08:26,855 --> 00:08:27,776
unaware of everything

148
00:08:28,055 --> 00:08:29,336
and believing she's truly happy.

149
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:36,416
Being kept in the dark

150
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:38,615
makes her carefree.

151
00:08:41,895 --> 00:08:42,615
Just like me.

152
00:08:42,895 --> 00:08:44,976
Those years
before reading my mom's diary,

153
00:08:46,096 --> 00:08:47,176
I was happy too.

154
00:08:56,976 --> 00:08:58,056
And what about the date?

155
00:08:59,176 --> 00:09:00,176
I asked about that too.

156
00:09:00,775 --> 00:09:02,375
No particular reaction from her.

157
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,296
Probably doesn't know.

158
00:09:04,615 --> 00:09:06,495
I messaged her pretending to be Chen Fu.

159
00:09:06,895 --> 00:09:08,135
Let's keep her calm for now.

160
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:09,576
But I'm not sure for how long.

161
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,984
Either she suspects, or someone comes.

162
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:12,976
Neither will take long.

163
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:15,655
One more day?

164
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:18,135
Hopefully.

165
00:09:32,944 --> 00:09:37,775
(Mengjiu Seafood Stall)

166
00:09:37,775 --> 00:09:38,615
Just one room?

167
00:09:39,615 --> 00:09:40,696
It's the peak season.

168
00:09:40,976 --> 00:09:43,296
We only have this
because someone canceled.

169
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,416
Without it, we'd be full
for the next two weeks.

170
00:09:46,255 --> 00:09:47,976
Any other hotels nearby?

171
00:09:48,775 --> 00:09:49,936
There's a guesthouse behind.

172
00:09:50,096 --> 00:09:51,135
You could check there.

173
00:09:52,296 --> 00:09:53,336
A guesthouse?

174
00:09:53,615 --> 00:09:54,775
No guesthouse.

175
00:09:55,096 --> 00:09:56,176
We'll take this room first.

176
00:09:57,015 --> 00:09:57,655
You stay here.

177
00:09:57,655 --> 00:09:59,056
I'll crash in my car tonight.

178
00:09:59,176 --> 00:10:00,056
What's the room type?

179
00:10:00,456 --> 00:10:01,456
Deluxe king suite.

180
00:10:02,775 --> 00:10:04,576
Comes with a sofa and chaise lounge.

181
00:10:04,735 --> 00:10:05,855
You can sleep on them too.

182
00:10:06,855 --> 00:10:08,255
Alright, let's check it out first.

183
00:10:08,615 --> 00:10:10,096
Right this way, please.

184
00:10:29,456 --> 00:10:30,535
It's actually quite cozy.

185
00:10:30,615 --> 00:10:31,375
You take this.

186
00:10:32,816 --> 00:10:33,615
It'll be awkward.

187
00:10:35,895 --> 00:10:38,336
Then I... I'll sleep here.

188
00:10:38,336 --> 00:10:39,096
You take the bed.

189
00:10:39,176 --> 00:10:39,775
Wait.

190
00:10:39,936 --> 00:10:41,655
We can't sleep without a partition.

191
00:10:45,176 --> 00:10:45,816
Shy about it?

192
00:10:48,456 --> 00:10:49,855
Not afraid I'll take advantage?

193
00:10:50,535 --> 00:10:51,296
Why would I be?

194
00:10:51,296 --> 00:10:52,416
You can't beat me anyway.

195
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:00,735
Fine, I'll sleep here then.

196
00:11:01,816 --> 00:11:02,816
Sleeping already?

197
00:11:03,895 --> 00:11:04,495
Let's go.

198
00:11:04,495 --> 00:11:05,096
Where to?

199
00:11:05,535 --> 00:11:07,056
To eat. Been starving all day.

200
00:11:08,775 --> 00:11:09,495
Keep up.

201
00:11:11,216 --> 00:11:11,976
(Red Coral Braised Delicacies)

202
00:11:11,976 --> 00:11:12,696
Good, right?

203
00:11:13,735 --> 00:11:14,375
Yes.

204
00:11:14,456 --> 00:11:16,015
I came here last time with that guy.

205
00:11:17,096 --> 00:11:18,296
Good for you.

206
00:11:18,336 --> 00:11:19,576
Great find.

207
00:11:20,296 --> 00:11:21,096
Of course.

208
00:11:21,296 --> 00:11:22,576
I'm putting you to the test

209
00:11:22,735 --> 00:11:24,296
to see which is better, the Heyang

210
00:11:24,296 --> 00:11:25,336
or Xicang braised food?

211
00:11:25,855 --> 00:11:27,216
Alright, we'll find out later.

212
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:30,456
What would you like to order?

213
00:11:41,296 --> 00:11:42,176
He's asking you.

214
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:45,375
Let her order.

215
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,576
She's the expert.

216
00:11:51,015 --> 00:11:52,056
So many choices.

217
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:54,576
Recommend some for us.

218
00:11:54,655 --> 00:11:55,735
Which are the best?

219
00:11:56,255 --> 00:11:57,495
The Long Intestines,

220
00:11:57,936 --> 00:11:59,015
Chicken Neck Club,

221
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,056
The Wing-shank Redemption,

222
00:12:01,535 --> 00:12:02,895
Four Meats and One Offal...

223
00:12:02,895 --> 00:12:05,576
(Tuo, look. There's someone
selling ducklings over there.)

224
00:12:05,576 --> 00:12:07,855
(Let's go take a look together.)

225
00:12:08,535 --> 00:12:11,976
(Tuo, why haven't you
come to find me yet?)

226
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,816
These are all bestsellers.

227
00:12:17,255 --> 00:12:19,176
Then let's order one of each.

228
00:12:19,255 --> 00:12:19,816
Is that okay?

229
00:12:21,015 --> 00:12:22,336
Can you two finish all that?

230
00:12:22,895 --> 00:12:24,135
If we can't finish it all,

231
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:26,336
will you and your sister join us?

232
00:12:26,775 --> 00:12:28,576
Welcome.

233
00:12:29,655 --> 00:12:31,855
Don't say 'welcome.' Say 'thank you.'

234
00:12:32,615 --> 00:12:34,015
Saying 'welcome' is fine too.

235
00:12:34,976 --> 00:12:35,936
Wait a moment.

236
00:12:35,936 --> 00:12:37,015
Food's ready soon.

237
00:12:37,135 --> 00:12:38,296
Okay, here you are.

238
00:13:01,456 --> 00:13:02,936
Jiang always said,

239
00:13:03,096 --> 00:13:05,296
"If you have things on your mind,

240
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:06,655
you'll ruin the meal."

241
00:13:07,456 --> 00:13:08,135
Let's drink

242
00:13:08,895 --> 00:13:10,416
to relax and whet our appetite.

243
00:13:11,855 --> 00:13:12,655
May things go well

244
00:13:12,976 --> 00:13:13,816
as we wish.

245
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:17,296
Definitely.

246
00:13:23,176 --> 00:13:25,615
How do you entertain clients
when you can't hold your liquor?

247
00:13:27,735 --> 00:13:29,015
No. The wine wasn't right.

248
00:13:29,936 --> 00:13:32,015
D-Did you drug me?

249
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:35,495
Yes, I drugged you

250
00:13:35,895 --> 00:13:36,895
to knock you out cold,

251
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,655
making you a perfect bargaining chip

252
00:13:38,896 --> 00:13:40,056
when dealing with Lin Xirou.

253
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:42,855
No.

254
00:13:43,336 --> 00:13:44,056
It wasn't right.

255
00:13:44,528 --> 00:13:45,418
The wine wasn't right.

256
00:13:49,135 --> 00:13:50,176
Nothing was in the wine.

257
00:13:50,615 --> 00:13:52,015
It's your heart that's burdened.

258
00:13:52,775 --> 00:13:53,696
My heart...

259
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,296
My heart is clear and open.

260
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:57,336
There's nothing there.

261
00:13:57,816 --> 00:13:58,615
Nothing.

262
00:14:00,456 --> 00:14:01,816
There's a nail in your heart.

263
00:14:06,056 --> 00:14:06,696
What?

264
00:14:15,056 --> 00:14:16,456
A nail embedded in your flesh.

265
00:14:19,696 --> 00:14:21,336
Over time, you think it's harmless,

266
00:14:22,855 --> 00:14:24,255
but a sudden prick

267
00:14:24,735 --> 00:14:25,775
still brings sharp pain.

268
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:34,336
(You've got to)

269
00:15:34,535 --> 00:15:36,456
(meet a few to find the one.)

270
00:15:37,096 --> 00:15:38,855
(If you're lucky someday,)

271
00:15:39,152 --> 00:15:40,592
(you'll find the one meant for you.)

272
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:27,255
Hello?

273
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:28,895
Mr. Meng, sorry about earlier.

274
00:16:29,056 --> 00:16:31,176
The signal was bad,
and I couldn't hear clearly.

275
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,456
Could you please repeat that?

276
00:16:35,336 --> 00:16:36,855
Here's the thing, Mr. Xiong.

277
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:38,416
I was supposed to meet Mr. Yan

278
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:40,015
this morning,

279
00:16:40,255 --> 00:16:42,255
but something came up,

280
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:44,655
so I needed to reschedule.

281
00:16:45,056 --> 00:16:46,336
However, since last night,

282
00:16:46,336 --> 00:16:47,895
I haven't been able to reach Mr. Yan.

283
00:16:49,056 --> 00:16:50,135
He isn't picking up.

284
00:16:50,535 --> 00:16:52,576
Could you please contact him for me?

285
00:16:53,336 --> 00:16:54,535
Okay, got it.

286
00:16:54,976 --> 00:16:55,855
I'll check with him.

287
00:16:57,456 --> 00:16:58,735
Thank you, Mr. Xiong.

288
00:16:59,535 --> 00:17:00,936
Apologies for the trouble.

289
00:17:01,495 --> 00:17:02,696
I'm truly sorry.

290
00:17:32,976 --> 00:17:33,575
Thank you.

291
00:17:42,856 --> 00:17:43,575
Lili.

292
00:17:44,335 --> 00:17:45,495
Here are the microphones.

293
00:17:45,896 --> 00:17:46,696
Thanks, Anni.

294
00:17:46,696 --> 00:17:47,495
No problem.

295
00:17:54,295 --> 00:17:55,055
Anni, you're here.

296
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:56,535
Sir.

297
00:17:56,896 --> 00:17:58,055
How's the gig scene lately?

298
00:17:59,176 --> 00:17:59,936
It's going well.

299
00:18:00,976 --> 00:18:01,896
Sing your best.

300
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:03,976
We can get you an exclusive contract.

301
00:18:04,495 --> 00:18:06,015
This place can become your main stage.

302
00:18:07,735 --> 00:18:08,535
We'll see.

303
00:18:13,896 --> 00:18:15,735
I'll go touch up my makeup now.

304
00:18:15,976 --> 00:18:17,055
The show's about to start.

305
00:18:17,176 --> 00:18:17,976
Stay for a bit.

306
00:18:17,976 --> 00:18:18,575
I'm leaving.

307
00:18:18,656 --> 00:18:19,456
No rush.

308
00:18:33,656 --> 00:18:34,095
Hurry up.

309
00:18:34,095 --> 00:18:35,176
The show's starting soon.

310
00:18:35,335 --> 00:18:36,015
Okay.

311
00:19:21,296 --> 00:19:22,800
(Mr. Meng, Voice Message)

312
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,176
(Missed Calls of Mr. Meng, Heyang)

313
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,976
(Mr. Meng)

314
00:19:28,976 --> 00:19:29,735
Mr. Yan,

315
00:19:29,976 --> 00:19:31,095
I couldn't reach you.

316
00:19:31,176 --> 00:19:32,295
I'll leave you a message.

317
00:19:32,575 --> 00:19:34,136
My kid fell ill and was hospitalized.

318
00:19:34,136 --> 00:19:35,255
I need to go to Xicang

319
00:19:35,335 --> 00:19:36,376
to visit a doctor friend.

320
00:19:36,535 --> 00:19:37,775
Can we reschedule?

321
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:40,055
How about a few more days in Heyang?

322
00:19:40,136 --> 00:19:41,696
Or I'll stay once I'm done in Xicang.

323
00:19:41,696 --> 00:19:42,416
We can meet

324
00:19:42,495 --> 00:19:43,295
when you're back.

325
00:19:43,976 --> 00:19:45,055
I'm really sorry.

326
00:19:45,255 --> 00:19:45,896
What happened...

327
00:20:01,216 --> 00:20:01,896
Ms. Lin.

328
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:03,295
Where are you?

329
00:20:03,696 --> 00:20:04,535
In Heyang.

330
00:20:04,856 --> 00:20:05,575
Heyang?

331
00:20:05,735 --> 00:20:06,376
Right.

332
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,416
Meeting Mr. Meng
of Chinese medicine purification.

333
00:20:08,656 --> 00:20:09,896
Didn't I tell you before?

334
00:20:10,495 --> 00:20:11,376
How did it go?

335
00:20:11,735 --> 00:20:13,616
It went well. Mr. Meng is decent.

336
00:20:13,936 --> 00:20:14,616
Is that so?

337
00:20:15,055 --> 00:20:15,616
Yes.

338
00:20:16,335 --> 00:20:18,775
Moreover, I think
with one or two more follow-ups,

339
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,335
we'll probably seal the deal.

340
00:20:20,775 --> 00:20:22,936
Why did Mr. Meng say
he couldn't reach you?

341
00:20:32,216 --> 00:20:33,295
Sorry, Ms. Lin.

342
00:20:33,696 --> 00:20:34,015
Well...

343
00:20:34,015 --> 00:20:36,856
I-I drank too much
with a friend yesterday.

344
00:20:36,856 --> 00:20:38,176
I missed Mr. Meng's calls.

345
00:20:38,775 --> 00:20:39,856
What friend?

346
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:42,495
J-Just an online friend.

347
00:20:43,856 --> 00:20:44,856
I told you about this.

348
00:20:44,896 --> 00:20:46,055
You're not a child anymore.

349
00:20:46,055 --> 00:20:47,456
You're Roadsound's future.

350
00:20:50,055 --> 00:20:50,656
Understood.

351
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,176
I'll make it a priority
to meet with Mr. Meng

352
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:55,416
and lock in our cooperation.

353
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,856
Before making any decisions,

354
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:59,335
consider the group

355
00:20:59,376 --> 00:21:00,535
and our family first.

356
00:21:00,856 --> 00:21:01,775
Not just yourself.

357
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:05,696
Understood, Ms. Lin.

358
00:21:06,176 --> 00:21:06,815
My apologies.

359
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:23,760
(I'm on Xu Anni.
Catch up after you rest)

360
00:21:41,456 --> 00:21:42,815
Could you get me a cup?

361
00:21:43,495 --> 00:21:44,055
Here.

362
00:21:44,976 --> 00:21:45,575
Thanks.

363
00:21:45,575 --> 00:21:46,136
No problem.

364
00:22:06,055 --> 00:22:08,815
I... didn't do anything embarrassing

365
00:22:08,815 --> 00:22:09,896
last night, right?

366
00:22:12,295 --> 00:22:13,015
You forgot?

367
00:22:15,255 --> 00:22:16,896
What should I remember?

368
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:19,295
Don't tell me you'll back out

369
00:22:19,295 --> 00:22:20,176
of your promises

370
00:22:20,176 --> 00:22:21,456
now that you're sober.

371
00:22:21,815 --> 00:22:22,856
What did I promise?

372
00:22:27,376 --> 00:22:28,335
You promised

373
00:22:31,335 --> 00:22:32,735
to support my art career.

374
00:22:35,616 --> 00:22:36,255
Only that?

375
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:39,255
Right.

376
00:22:39,376 --> 00:22:40,896
Now I remember. I did say that.

377
00:22:41,015 --> 00:22:42,176
After all this time,

378
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,656
supporting you is natural, right?

379
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:46,216
You also promised

380
00:22:46,216 --> 00:22:48,176
to book the Yanguan Art Museum

381
00:22:48,616 --> 00:22:49,575
for an entire month

382
00:22:49,936 --> 00:22:51,015
for my solo exhibition.

383
00:22:57,176 --> 00:22:57,775
How do you

384
00:22:57,775 --> 00:22:59,216
hold your liquor at events?

385
00:22:59,335 --> 00:23:00,936
If beer does this to you,

386
00:23:01,015 --> 00:23:02,216
you'd be kidney-less

387
00:23:02,335 --> 00:23:03,856
with hard liquor.

388
00:23:03,896 --> 00:23:05,136
Thank you

389
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:06,335
for my kidneys then.

390
00:23:06,575 --> 00:23:07,335
You're welcome.

391
00:23:07,656 --> 00:23:08,735
Your kidneys remain,

392
00:23:09,176 --> 00:23:10,055
but not your dignity.

393
00:23:15,376 --> 00:23:16,255
How's Xu Anni?

394
00:23:19,216 --> 00:23:20,815
That one's been standing a while,

395
00:23:21,015 --> 00:23:22,376
pretending to be a tourist

396
00:23:22,616 --> 00:23:24,495
and snapping water, boats, and birds.

397
00:23:28,095 --> 00:23:29,896
But he's actually
watching Xu Anni, right?

398
00:23:30,295 --> 00:23:31,656
Sharp observation, Mr. Yan.

399
00:23:32,055 --> 00:23:33,255
After sleeping half the day,

400
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:34,856
now you have it all figured out?

401
00:23:40,295 --> 00:23:40,936
Alright.

402
00:23:41,136 --> 00:23:42,416
You think I'm all talk?

403
00:23:46,775 --> 00:23:47,416
Wait here.

404
00:23:47,775 --> 00:23:48,575
Where are you going?

405
00:23:55,656 --> 00:23:58,095
This angle won't capture everything.

406
00:24:00,775 --> 00:24:01,936
Hey, bro.

407
00:24:02,255 --> 00:24:03,015
Mind helping

408
00:24:03,255 --> 00:24:04,815
take a photo for me?

409
00:24:04,815 --> 00:24:05,575
It's for my wife.

410
00:24:05,575 --> 00:24:06,295
I'm in a hurry.

411
00:24:06,295 --> 00:24:07,255
It'll be quick.

412
00:24:07,255 --> 00:24:08,656
Appreciate it. Thanks.

413
00:24:08,856 --> 00:24:10,136
Here, aim like this.

414
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:12,136
Take more.

415
00:24:12,136 --> 00:24:12,656
Okay. Done.

416
00:24:12,656 --> 00:24:13,216
More shots.

417
00:24:13,216 --> 00:24:14,136
Get this boat

418
00:24:14,136 --> 00:24:15,255
in the frame.

419
00:24:15,376 --> 00:24:16,015
Right.

420
00:24:16,015 --> 00:24:16,976
Use it as a background.

421
00:24:17,696 --> 00:24:18,376
Right.

422
00:24:18,616 --> 00:24:19,216
More shots.

423
00:24:19,216 --> 00:24:20,176
Come on, like this.

424
00:24:21,936 --> 00:24:22,735
Bro, how about

425
00:24:22,735 --> 00:24:24,616
you step back over there?

426
00:24:24,616 --> 00:24:25,216
To the railing.

427
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,976
And capture everything here.

428
00:24:27,015 --> 00:24:27,775
It'll look good.

429
00:24:27,856 --> 00:24:28,696
The view is great.

430
00:24:28,976 --> 00:24:29,696
Thanks.

431
00:24:32,815 --> 00:24:33,856
Take a few more.

432
00:24:36,255 --> 00:24:37,255
More shots.

433
00:24:39,295 --> 00:24:39,896
Done.

434
00:24:40,216 --> 00:24:41,015
Thank you.

435
00:24:41,335 --> 00:24:42,896
Bro, wait a second.

436
00:24:42,896 --> 00:24:43,976
Let me check.

437
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:44,616
Let me check.

438
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:45,735
Maybe we'll have to reshoot.

439
00:24:47,936 --> 00:24:49,976
Not bad. That chick's hot.

440
00:24:50,136 --> 00:24:52,095
Check out that leopard print. Cute, huh?

441
00:24:53,616 --> 00:24:54,775
Hey, are you a local?

442
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:57,216
I'm a tourist.

443
00:24:57,656 --> 00:24:58,696
Same here.

444
00:24:59,255 --> 00:25:00,936
Most people avoid coming to Heyang.

445
00:25:00,936 --> 00:25:02,055
Too rundown for them.

446
00:25:02,495 --> 00:25:03,696
But you need an eye

447
00:25:03,696 --> 00:25:05,015
for finding beauty in things.

448
00:25:05,176 --> 00:25:06,416
Seems like you've got that eye.

449
00:25:06,575 --> 00:25:07,456
I've got things to do.

450
00:25:07,456 --> 00:25:08,456
Wait, bro.

451
00:25:08,575 --> 00:25:09,376
How about this?

452
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,896
Let's take a photo together.

453
00:25:11,575 --> 00:25:12,696
No photos with strangers.

454
00:25:12,696 --> 00:25:14,335
Well, it's for my wife.

455
00:25:14,335 --> 00:25:15,856
She thinks I came here with some girl.

456
00:25:15,856 --> 00:25:16,775
I can't do that.

457
00:25:16,775 --> 00:25:17,815
Let's take one.

458
00:25:17,815 --> 00:25:18,616
You take it for me.

459
00:25:19,735 --> 00:25:21,055
Bro, look at this.

460
00:25:21,055 --> 00:25:22,136
Are you out of your mind?

461
00:25:22,136 --> 00:25:23,295
It's broken. What's inside?

462
00:25:23,295 --> 00:25:23,775
Get lost.

463
00:25:23,775 --> 00:25:24,656
Sorry about that.

464
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,216
Hey, don't get mad.

465
00:25:42,064 --> 00:25:43,655
(Yan Tuo)

466
00:25:51,535 --> 00:25:52,735
That guy is up to no good.

467
00:25:52,856 --> 00:25:54,295
He probably had ether in his bag.

468
00:25:55,575 --> 00:25:56,376
How do you know?

469
00:25:56,535 --> 00:25:57,416
I smelled it.

470
00:25:58,255 --> 00:25:59,295
You have skills like that?

471
00:26:02,095 --> 00:26:03,335
Before taking over Roadsound,

472
00:26:03,335 --> 00:26:04,416
it was all lab work.

473
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,295
As the General Manager
of Yanguan's largest pharma group,

474
00:26:07,295 --> 00:26:08,775
I know my field.

475
00:26:12,095 --> 00:26:13,015
So not all rich heirs

476
00:26:13,015 --> 00:26:14,856
are complete slackers.

477
00:26:19,936 --> 00:26:20,656
Enough chatter.

478
00:26:21,775 --> 00:26:22,896
That guy's plan was ruined.

479
00:26:22,976 --> 00:26:23,896
He'll come back.

480
00:26:24,095 --> 00:26:24,815
Keep watching.

481
00:26:26,495 --> 00:26:27,376
Let's move.

482
00:26:27,775 --> 00:26:29,696
Xu Anni saw me sitting here too long.

483
00:26:33,656 --> 00:26:34,416
How about this?

484
00:26:34,696 --> 00:26:36,095
Let's get food to eat in the car.

485
00:26:36,616 --> 00:26:37,936
Fine, order whatever.

486
00:26:38,216 --> 00:26:39,216
Just don't drink.

487
00:26:50,216 --> 00:26:51,015
I'd like to order.

488
00:27:00,015 --> 00:27:02,176
We're searching blindly.

489
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:04,416
When will we ever find it like this?

490
00:27:05,055 --> 00:27:05,976
You never stop talking.

491
00:27:06,216 --> 00:27:07,216
Blabbered the whole way.

492
00:27:07,456 --> 00:27:08,815
Can't find it, can't go back.

493
00:27:08,936 --> 00:27:10,295
Just wasting time out here.

494
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,176
Who wants this?

495
00:27:13,456 --> 00:27:14,535
Shut up already.

496
00:27:14,976 --> 00:27:15,976
I'm stressed enough.

497
00:27:16,255 --> 00:27:17,456
I don't want your yapping.

498
00:27:17,456 --> 00:27:18,775
I'm annoyed too.

499
00:27:18,936 --> 00:27:20,775
Xiong treats us like dogs, you know.

500
00:27:20,775 --> 00:27:21,815
Dogs at least get cans.

501
00:27:22,416 --> 00:27:23,976
This team's management style

502
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:24,976
will cause problems soon.

503
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:25,976
Then quit searching.

504
00:27:27,136 --> 00:27:28,495
Xiong will hit me.

505
00:27:28,696 --> 00:27:29,856
You deserve that.

506
00:27:29,936 --> 00:27:31,095
Then I'll hit you.

507
00:28:13,015 --> 00:28:14,216
Such delicious food.

508
00:28:14,376 --> 00:28:15,775
Give it here if you won't eat.

509
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:18,696
You love cilantro this much?

510
00:28:19,456 --> 00:28:20,775
It's called 'Fragrant Green' too.

511
00:28:20,856 --> 00:28:22,335
Because it's fragrant. Tasty.

512
00:28:22,735 --> 00:28:23,696
Unreasonable.

513
00:28:25,376 --> 00:28:27,015
Tell me all your dietary restrictions.

514
00:28:27,095 --> 00:28:28,456
I'll remember for next time.

515
00:28:40,696 --> 00:28:42,255
Among us South Mountain Hunters,

516
00:28:43,335 --> 00:28:44,896
the Hound Clan has the most members.

517
00:28:47,136 --> 00:28:48,335
Any pungent smells

518
00:28:48,976 --> 00:28:50,735
interfere with their tracking senses.

519
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:53,095
So since childhood,

520
00:28:53,936 --> 00:28:56,176
we've eaten bland food
without chili, ginger, garlic,

521
00:28:56,575 --> 00:28:58,255
or cilantro as seasonings.

522
00:29:00,696 --> 00:29:02,495
But Jiang loves them,

523
00:29:03,376 --> 00:29:04,535
especially ginger.

524
00:29:07,136 --> 00:29:08,456
After every mountain patrol,

525
00:29:09,575 --> 00:29:11,416
he'd take me for sashimi.

526
00:29:13,535 --> 00:29:14,976
He'd give me all the fish meat

527
00:29:16,495 --> 00:29:18,335
and save the ginger for himself.

528
00:29:23,335 --> 00:29:24,015
Don't worry.

529
00:29:25,136 --> 00:29:26,376
We'll definitely rescue him.

530
00:29:30,815 --> 00:29:32,416
And you'll find your sister too.

531
00:29:40,335 --> 00:29:41,095
What are you doing?

532
00:29:46,456 --> 00:29:47,136
Excuse me,

533
00:29:47,896 --> 00:29:48,456
bro.

534
00:29:48,656 --> 00:29:50,656
I noticed your license plate
is from Xicang.

535
00:29:50,936 --> 00:29:52,176
When you came here,

536
00:29:52,255 --> 00:29:53,815
did you take the Xincang route?

537
00:29:54,495 --> 00:29:56,176
Yes, I did.

538
00:29:56,176 --> 00:29:56,815
Well,

539
00:29:56,815 --> 00:29:58,376
a friend of mine is coming from there.

540
00:29:58,376 --> 00:29:59,735
What are the road conditions?

541
00:29:59,735 --> 00:30:00,456
Is it passable?

542
00:30:00,896 --> 00:30:01,616
No checkpoints.

543
00:30:01,775 --> 00:30:02,535
It's pretty smooth.

544
00:30:02,656 --> 00:30:02,936
Yeah.

545
00:30:02,976 --> 00:30:03,775
Okay, great.

546
00:30:03,775 --> 00:30:05,015
Thanks. Sorry to bother you.

547
00:30:05,015 --> 00:30:06,575
Not at all. Perfect timing.

548
00:30:36,416 --> 00:30:37,335
Well,

549
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:39,495
smooth energy flow
ensures blood circulation.

550
00:30:39,775 --> 00:30:41,735
Stagnant energy causes blood stagnation.

551
00:30:42,696 --> 00:30:44,456
Once the energy flows freely,

552
00:30:45,015 --> 00:30:46,295
all else follows smoothly.

553
00:30:47,376 --> 00:30:48,456
And the opposite?

554
00:30:49,295 --> 00:30:50,775
If the heart meridian gets blocked,

555
00:30:51,376 --> 00:30:53,896
worries will accumulate like knots.

556
00:30:54,136 --> 00:30:55,696
Even without major issues,

557
00:30:55,936 --> 00:30:58,095
minor troubles will persist.

558
00:30:59,376 --> 00:31:01,696
'Free from worries' sounds easy.

559
00:31:05,896 --> 00:31:06,535
Ms. Lin,

560
00:31:07,136 --> 00:31:08,656
if you have any worries,

561
00:31:08,976 --> 00:31:10,136
vent to me.

562
00:31:11,216 --> 00:31:12,815
Maybe I can't solve them,

563
00:31:13,216 --> 00:31:14,735
but sharing helps relieve stress.

564
00:31:15,255 --> 00:31:17,976
My worries
could fill three days and nights.

565
00:31:19,015 --> 00:31:21,535
But if you ask about joys,

566
00:31:21,696 --> 00:31:23,535
I'd need time to think.

567
00:31:26,535 --> 00:31:27,216
Right.

568
00:31:28,176 --> 00:31:29,936
As Roadsound Group's leader,

569
00:31:30,575 --> 00:31:31,856
you're busy.

570
00:31:32,815 --> 00:31:33,775
We underlings

571
00:31:33,775 --> 00:31:35,456
can't possibly understand

572
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:37,456
your pressures.

573
00:31:38,095 --> 00:31:39,456
Just remember my words.

574
00:31:39,976 --> 00:31:41,616
Smooth energy brings peace of mind.

575
00:31:43,216 --> 00:31:44,656
Today's moxibustion worked well.

576
00:31:45,055 --> 00:31:46,136
Follow my prescription

577
00:31:46,136 --> 00:31:47,456
for two more doses,

578
00:31:47,896 --> 00:31:49,976
and happy memories will return.

579
00:31:51,335 --> 00:31:53,696
Could you and Lin Ling ease my worries?

580
00:31:57,575 --> 00:31:58,216
Ms. Lin,

581
00:31:58,775 --> 00:31:59,535
what do you mean?

582
00:31:59,815 --> 00:32:01,255
Have we upset you?

583
00:32:02,055 --> 00:32:03,896
You're not toying with her, are you?

584
00:32:08,255 --> 00:32:10,136
How should I put this?

585
00:32:12,616 --> 00:32:13,295
Ms. Lin,

586
00:32:14,095 --> 00:32:15,015
you think

587
00:32:15,136 --> 00:32:17,775
I act brash normally,

588
00:32:18,936 --> 00:32:20,495
but when it's serious,

589
00:32:21,176 --> 00:32:22,735
I get more nervous than anyone.

590
00:32:23,616 --> 00:32:25,735
Wanbao Tower sounds grand,

591
00:32:26,176 --> 00:32:27,735
but it's just a small workshop.

592
00:32:27,735 --> 00:32:30,015
Without your support, I'd be a tramp.

593
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:31,696
As for Roadsound,

594
00:32:32,376 --> 00:32:34,696
it's an unreachable summit.

595
00:32:35,575 --> 00:32:37,856
My humble career

596
00:32:38,335 --> 00:32:40,735
serving you diligently

597
00:32:40,735 --> 00:32:42,456
is already my family's greatest honor.

598
00:32:43,015 --> 00:32:45,495
The young mistress is beyond my reach.

599
00:32:45,976 --> 00:32:49,416
If everything followed logic,

600
00:32:49,616 --> 00:32:50,896
how boring life would be.

601
00:32:52,936 --> 00:32:54,696
Great achievements require risks

602
00:32:54,696 --> 00:32:55,936
and struggles.

603
00:32:59,295 --> 00:33:00,936
This is too great.

604
00:33:01,856 --> 00:33:02,976
A lifelong commitment.

605
00:33:07,976 --> 00:33:09,856
I'm honored by your confidence

606
00:33:10,216 --> 00:33:11,896
and won't disappoint you.

607
00:33:12,335 --> 00:33:14,495
With your blessing, I'll move forward.

608
00:33:20,936 --> 00:33:22,696
Not just walk far,

609
00:33:23,295 --> 00:33:24,896
but walk faster too.

610
00:33:37,535 --> 00:33:38,735
Enough already.

611
00:33:38,735 --> 00:33:40,015
I've honored my word.

612
00:33:42,176 --> 00:33:43,495
It's time to clock out.

613
00:33:43,775 --> 00:33:44,535
Drink less.

614
00:33:47,095 --> 00:33:48,095
Leaving together?

615
00:33:48,575 --> 00:33:49,575
You go ahead.

616
00:33:50,095 --> 00:33:51,095
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

617
00:35:33,376 --> 00:35:34,695
We meet again.

618
00:35:36,416 --> 00:35:37,615
It's you.

619
00:35:38,055 --> 00:35:39,135
What are you doing?

620
00:35:39,296 --> 00:35:40,175
Let me go.

621
00:35:40,215 --> 00:35:40,816
Don't move.

622
00:35:44,896 --> 00:35:46,135
Why were you following Xu Anni?

623
00:35:47,615 --> 00:35:48,336
Who?

624
00:35:48,736 --> 00:35:50,055
Not sure what you mean.

625
00:35:51,296 --> 00:35:52,456
Let me go.

626
00:35:52,615 --> 00:35:53,816
Did you hear me?

627
00:35:53,936 --> 00:35:54,856
I'll call the police.

628
00:35:54,856 --> 00:35:55,896
Not cooperating, huh?

629
00:35:57,376 --> 00:35:58,376
Want to call the police?

630
00:35:58,936 --> 00:35:59,695
Perfect.

631
00:35:59,736 --> 00:36:00,695
Explain this

632
00:36:00,695 --> 00:36:01,535
to the police.

633
00:36:03,736 --> 00:36:04,736
W-What is this?

634
00:36:05,535 --> 00:36:06,736
I really don't know.

635
00:36:06,736 --> 00:36:07,535
It isn't mine.

636
00:36:07,535 --> 00:36:09,175
It's in your bag. You don't know?

637
00:36:09,175 --> 00:36:10,175
It isn't yours?

638
00:36:17,095 --> 00:36:18,495
If you have no shame,

639
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:19,896
I'll help redden your face.

640
00:36:19,896 --> 00:36:20,416
Come on.

641
00:36:21,575 --> 00:36:22,896
No.

642
00:36:24,095 --> 00:36:25,736
Wait. They hired me.

643
00:36:26,296 --> 00:36:27,015
Who?

644
00:36:28,015 --> 00:36:29,215
Her boyfriend.

645
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:32,296
He hired you to stalk her?

646
00:36:33,095 --> 00:36:33,615
No.

647
00:36:34,215 --> 00:36:35,856
He hired me to drug her

648
00:36:35,976 --> 00:36:38,015
and then sleep with her.

649
00:36:41,175 --> 00:36:42,575
Explain this.

650
00:36:43,296 --> 00:36:44,095
Explain yourself.

651
00:36:45,175 --> 00:36:45,695
Well,

652
00:36:47,095 --> 00:36:49,095
I don't know what he wanted.

653
00:36:50,055 --> 00:36:51,535
He timed everything precisely.

654
00:36:51,535 --> 00:36:53,055
He made me do it during her ovulation.

655
00:36:53,976 --> 00:36:55,055
If she got pregnant,

656
00:36:55,856 --> 00:36:56,936
there'd be extra payment.

657
00:36:57,535 --> 00:36:58,655
If it failed,

658
00:37:00,256 --> 00:37:01,695
I'd try again next month.

659
00:37:09,416 --> 00:37:10,456
Listen up.

660
00:37:11,495 --> 00:37:12,896
I have your photo

661
00:37:12,936 --> 00:37:14,376
and know who hired you.

662
00:37:14,655 --> 00:37:16,495
If I see you again,

663
00:37:17,175 --> 00:37:18,776
you'll lose this arm.

664
00:37:19,296 --> 00:37:20,135
Understood?

665
00:37:21,896 --> 00:37:22,736
Yes.

666
00:37:22,896 --> 00:37:23,456
Get lost.

667
00:37:39,336 --> 00:37:40,575
Ms. Lin wants to see you.

668
00:38:04,256 --> 00:38:05,776
Sis, prepare some late-night snacks.

669
00:38:06,135 --> 00:38:07,015
Yes, Ms. Lin.

670
00:38:07,175 --> 00:38:09,296
Lin Ling, sit with Dr. Lv
and have a bite.

671
00:38:09,976 --> 00:38:11,816
He's worked hard all night.

672
00:38:12,575 --> 00:38:13,896
It's nothing.

673
00:38:13,896 --> 00:38:15,175
No trouble at all.

674
00:38:15,495 --> 00:38:16,776
Don't bother this late.

675
00:38:16,776 --> 00:38:17,816
I'm heading back.

676
00:38:28,175 --> 00:38:28,856
Right.

677
00:38:30,215 --> 00:38:32,055
Well, a quick bite won't hurt.

678
00:38:32,495 --> 00:38:34,416
As they say,
a horse needs its midnight boats.

679
00:38:35,456 --> 00:38:36,976
I mean, oats.

680
00:38:45,816 --> 00:38:46,776
Okay, Ms. Lin.

681
00:38:47,736 --> 00:38:49,575
Sis, take them over first.

682
00:38:49,776 --> 00:38:50,976
Clean up here later.

683
00:38:51,296 --> 00:38:51,896
Okay.

684
00:38:52,535 --> 00:38:53,376
Xiong Hei's here.

685
00:38:53,896 --> 00:38:54,936
He's waiting downstairs.

686
00:38:55,055 --> 00:38:55,615
Okay.

687
00:39:21,816 --> 00:39:22,896
This tea's pretty good.

688
00:39:23,495 --> 00:39:24,336
The aroma's amazing.

689
00:39:30,175 --> 00:39:31,256
Don't you think

690
00:39:31,495 --> 00:39:33,856
your moxibustion smell

691
00:39:33,856 --> 00:39:35,256
is even stronger?

692
00:39:37,256 --> 00:39:38,055
My apologies.

693
00:39:38,495 --> 00:39:40,135
Can't help it. That room's stuffy.

694
00:39:40,816 --> 00:39:42,655
True, I did the moxa treatment
longer today.

695
00:39:43,856 --> 00:39:44,655
It's okay.

696
00:39:46,135 --> 00:39:47,896
I actually like medicinal smells.

697
00:39:48,256 --> 00:39:48,856
Really?

698
00:39:50,655 --> 00:39:52,896
What about paint smell?

699
00:39:53,736 --> 00:39:55,015
That's nice too.

700
00:39:55,856 --> 00:39:58,456
Those slightly weird odors,

701
00:39:59,256 --> 00:40:03,256
like nail polish or exhaust fumes.

702
00:40:03,456 --> 00:40:04,615
Wait, let me guess.

703
00:40:07,816 --> 00:40:09,695
Damp stairwell after rain?

704
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:12,615
Sun-baked bedding?

705
00:40:14,615 --> 00:40:16,456
Snapped celery stalks?

706
00:40:17,095 --> 00:40:18,055
Mildewed rags?

707
00:40:18,336 --> 00:40:19,456
Squashed stink bugs?

708
00:40:23,575 --> 00:40:25,336
Find out who did it by tomorrow.

709
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:26,175
Working on it.

710
00:40:26,296 --> 00:40:27,615
Sis, I'm heading out.

711
00:40:30,575 --> 00:40:31,175
Okay.

712
00:40:52,615 --> 00:40:54,376
(Legend says in Xingbazi Town)

713
00:40:54,376 --> 00:40:55,776
(there's a great swamp)

714
00:40:55,776 --> 00:40:57,175
(that is so creepy.)

715
00:40:57,336 --> 00:40:59,344
Just as we suspected.

716
00:40:59,344 --> 00:41:01,215
(Big Brother
carried mountain goods to market)

717
00:41:01,215 --> 00:41:02,736
(and pass through this swamp.)

718
00:41:02,736 --> 00:41:03,615
Direct lineage.

719
00:41:04,376 --> 00:41:05,296
Close kin.

720
00:41:05,615 --> 00:41:07,135
(Following his brother's steps...)

721
00:41:07,135 --> 00:41:08,135
Now it makes sense

722
00:41:08,135 --> 00:41:09,296
why Chen Fu went

723
00:41:09,296 --> 00:41:10,695
to such lengths in his attempt

724
00:41:10,736 --> 00:41:11,896
to get Xu Anni pregnant.

725
00:41:15,015 --> 00:41:18,095
That's why Lin Xirou
has been controlling Lin Ling

726
00:41:18,655 --> 00:41:19,695
and forcing her to marry.

727
00:41:19,695 --> 00:41:20,336
Exactly.

728
00:41:20,615 --> 00:41:22,095
Lin Ling is her blood bag.

729
00:41:22,175 --> 00:41:23,416
Once Lin Ling has offspring,

730
00:41:23,416 --> 00:41:24,695
she loses her value.

731
00:41:24,695 --> 00:41:25,896
She could be in danger.

732
00:41:26,175 --> 00:41:27,416
When Lin Xirou first showed up,

733
00:41:27,416 --> 00:41:28,896
Lin Ling wasn't born, right?

734
00:41:31,776 --> 00:41:32,856
She was adopted later.

735
00:41:36,416 --> 00:41:37,456
So that means

736
00:41:38,736 --> 00:41:39,936
before Lin Ling came,

737
00:41:40,095 --> 00:41:41,655
a close kin of hers

738
00:41:42,296 --> 00:41:43,816
was already Lin Xirou's blood bag.

739
00:42:08,256 --> 00:42:09,575
It was definitely sabotaged.
