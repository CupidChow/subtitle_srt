(The Earth Fiend is definitely
in the car Mad Blade mentioned.)

20
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,659
Wake up.

21
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,539
Wake up. Don't sleep.

22
00:04:59,019 --> 00:05:01,060
Don't be afraid. I'm not a good person.

23
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:03,300
What?

24
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,339
I said I'm not a good person.

25
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:08,899
You're not a good person either.

26
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:11,060
We're the same.

27
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:12,139
So don't be afraid.

28
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,579
Who are you?

29
00:05:16,219 --> 00:05:17,860
Why don't you tell me who you are first?

30
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:19,940
Or...

31
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,579
Who's in the trunk?

32
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,379
Where is he?

33
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,339
Answer my question first.

34
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,019
I'm a sculptor.

35
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,540
I came here for inspiration.

36
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:34,940
My driver was injured.

37
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,459
I need to get him to the hospital.

38
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:37,940
Listen,

39
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,459
if he dies because of your delay,

40
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:40,339
you'll be responsible.

41
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,540
The driver was injured,

42
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,300
so you stuffed him in a duffel bag

43
00:05:45,339 --> 00:05:46,500
and threw him in the trunk?

44
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,579
Are you saving him or dumping a body?

45
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:50,379
What do you want?

46
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:51,980
Do you want money?

47
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,139
I'll give you money.

48
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:54,019
Let me go.

49
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,899
Untie me quickly.

50
00:05:55,899 --> 00:05:56,899
Let me go!

51
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,779
Back off.

52
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:01,740
Let go! Don't touch me!

53
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:07,100
Give it back.

54
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,219
Give it back!

Don't move.

58
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,219
What are you doing?

59
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,740
Give it back.

60
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:34,779
Stop looking. Give it back!

Sculpting?

62
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,819
Your hands are really rough.

63
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,899
They don't match your face.

64
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,180
But rough hands

65
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,699
don't mean you're a sculptor.

66
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:48,219
You could be a kidnapper

67
00:06:48,219 --> 00:06:50,660
or a crazy killer.

68
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,420
You're insane.

69
00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:00,980
You really are a sculptor.

70
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,139
I'm a public figure.

71
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,019
If I go missing,

72
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:05,980
my agent and fans will notice.

73
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:06,899
Let me go now,

74
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:08,339
and I won't hold you responsible.

75
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:10,699
A public figure?

76
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,579
With so few followers?

77
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,500
Don't worry.
You fear your fans will be concerned?

78
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,259
I'll help you.

79
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:26,620
In retreat for focused creation.

80
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,180
Cutting off contact to concentrate.

81
00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:32,620
I'm warning you,

82
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,620
put down my phone right now.

83
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,699
Striving for better works.

84
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:52,779
Await my return. Don't worry.

85
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:54,579
Here's the thing about me:

86
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:56,620
easy to invite, hard to send away.

87
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:58,779
No problem.

88
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,579
I'm good at sending people off.

89
00:08:02,219 --> 00:08:03,459
I can even send you to die.

90
00:08:06,579 --> 00:08:07,300
I know.

91
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,379
What's in your car's trunk

92
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,139
is something shady too, right?

93
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,579
What?

94
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,020
Stop pretending.

95
00:08:39,459 --> 00:08:40,180
Ven...

96
00:08:40,619 --> 00:08:41,499
Ventolin.

97
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:42,859
What?

98
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:45,579
Asthma.

99
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,619
Steroid spray.

100
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,699
Where is it?

101
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,060
It's not here.

102
00:08:54,859 --> 00:08:57,780
The car crash...

103
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:58,540
Dropped it.

104
00:08:58,739 --> 00:08:59,380
Water.

105
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:02,979
Such a hassle.

106
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:40,979
Where's Xinxin?

107
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,140
Where's Xinxin?

108
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:43,699
Tuo.

109
00:10:44,995 --> 00:10:50,972
(K17 Ganzhou, Departure Time: 9:45 AM)

110
00:11:58,147 --> 00:12:00,848
(Yan Tuo)

111
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,060
Three types of goods. Inspect them.

112
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,339
Jiang.

113
00:13:15,499 --> 00:13:16,579
Long time no see.

114
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:18,180
Jiang.

115
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,260
How have you been?

116
00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:22,459
Jiang.

117
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,780
I've been doing well lately.

118
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,420
Though I haven't found a boyfriend,

119
00:13:29,859 --> 00:13:30,900
living alone

120
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,780
has been quite enjoyable.

121
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,940
An opening line like this

122
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:44,660
is difficult for you?

123
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,900
Must we be this frosty?

124
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:54,339
Let's settle accounts.

125
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,979
Three unique goods. What's their worth?

126
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,380
Between us, there is

127
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,540
no need for meticulous accounting.

128
00:14:04,739 --> 00:14:05,819
Not between you and me.

129
00:14:06,739 --> 00:14:08,336
Between me and South Mountain Hunters.

130
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,260
We'd better settle this now.

131
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,979
I don't want emotional baggage.

132
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,979
I don't want to force you.

133
00:14:17,099 --> 00:14:18,660
If you're determined to leave,

134
00:14:19,739 --> 00:14:20,940
who could stop you?

135
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,300
No need to repay debts.

136
00:14:24,579 --> 00:14:25,739
Just peacefully

137
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,499
live your life as an artist.

138
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,619
That's exactly what I fear most.

139
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:33,660
Emotional debts

140
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,979
are much harder to repay.

141
00:14:37,219 --> 00:14:38,819
If only you truly believed that.

142
00:14:41,099 --> 00:14:42,540
Let's calculate it my way.

143
00:14:43,219 --> 00:14:44,420
After I deliver these goods

144
00:14:44,859 --> 00:14:45,979
and complete one more task,

145
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,339
we'll be square.

146
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:48,660
After the next patrol,

147
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,219
I'll quit completely.

148
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,140
This man works for the Earth Fiend.

149
00:14:59,260 --> 00:14:59,979
He is Yan Tuo.

150
00:15:00,619 --> 00:15:01,780
That's my driver.

151
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:03,900
Got bitten by the Earth Fiend.

152
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,420
It has already rooted and sprouted.

153
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:24,099
Earth Fiend?

154
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,699
How can a human
smell like the Earth Fiend?

155
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,540
I examined the driver's wound.

156
00:15:42,099 --> 00:15:42,979
Human teeth marks.

157
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,099
This vehicle is 96331.

158
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,739
He drove. He was in the trunk.

159
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,739
So the scent Big Head detected

160
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,180
must've been from this man.

161
00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:57,260
This Earth Fiend.

162
00:16:10,979 --> 00:16:14,060
Human-form Earth Fiend?

163
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,739
I pondered all the way here

164
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:27,339
before reaching this

165
00:16:28,099 --> 00:16:29,859
extremely unpleasant conclusion.

166
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,859
If you have a better explanation,

167
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,260
do share it with me.

168
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,300
The driver's name is Sun Zhou.

169
00:16:47,619 --> 00:16:49,180
He took this job because of me.

170
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,540
He got bitten by an Earth Fiend.

171
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:53,420
If possible,

172
00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:56,579
try to save him.

173
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,819
But it's been cloudy lately.

174
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,300
We might not get the natural fire.

175
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:06,340
Even if heaven won't help,

176
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,940
we can't just watch him die.

177
00:17:08,259 --> 00:17:09,860
He's innocent, after all.

178
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,100
Handle the other two as you wish.

179
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:29,180
Are you hurt?

180
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,059
Minor injuries. Nothing serious.

181
00:17:32,019 --> 00:17:34,180
Good. Your constitution is unique.

182
00:17:34,259 --> 00:17:35,940
Now that circumstances have changed,

183
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,180
we must stay cautious.

184
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:43,779
I bought it on the way.

185
00:17:45,019 --> 00:17:45,739
Take one.

186
00:17:46,539 --> 00:17:47,779
Better than nothing.

187
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,224
(Throat Lozenges)

188
00:17:52,219 --> 00:17:53,380
I hope it's an isolated case.

189
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,499
Life-Death Blade?

190
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:34,459
Do you like it?

191
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,420
I can't accept it.

192
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,779
Your solo reconnaissance missions

193
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:42,779
yield more than our group patrols.

194
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:44,580
You deserve to have that knife.

195
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,459
I just got lucky.

196
00:18:48,259 --> 00:18:49,900
Luck is a skill too.

197
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,420
Then I'm quite skilled indeed.

198
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:54,979
I'll see you off.

199
00:18:56,259 --> 00:18:57,100
No need.

200
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,979
Let's talk right here.

201
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,059
You're really leaving?

202
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:05,860
What else?

203
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,900
I smelled it when your car arrived.

204
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:12,420
That person's definitely a Fiend.

205
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,539
Mad Dog.

206
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,019
Your nose truly is sharp.

207
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,580
Since you brought that rich boy here,

208
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,180
you must've dealt with him before.

209
00:19:25,219 --> 00:19:26,580
Stay and interrogate him together.

210
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,860
You just said yourself.

211
00:19:30,699 --> 00:19:31,539
My solo achievements

212
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:32,900
outshine your entire team.

213
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,340
Want to exhaust me?

214
00:19:35,979 --> 00:19:36,620
Luo.

215
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:39,180
Aren't you being too willful?

216
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:41,699
Before, South Mountain was peaceful.

217
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:43,459
Everyone lived peacefully.

218
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,059
It was acceptable
for you to be detached.

219
00:19:46,779 --> 00:19:47,539
But what about now?

220
00:19:48,459 --> 00:19:49,660
A humanoid Earth Fiend appeared.

221
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:51,699
You personally captured him.

222
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,779
We're now in a situation

223
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:55,660
that even our ancestors

224
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,739
never encountered.

225
00:19:58,699 --> 00:20:00,459
Can you still believe
that this has nothing

226
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:01,739
to do with you?

227
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:05,019
I came to deliver goods.

228
00:20:07,219 --> 00:20:08,620
Not to listen to your lectures.

229
00:20:10,499 --> 00:20:12,420
We've trained so hard

230
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:13,940
since we were little

231
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,940
just to eliminate the Earth Fiend
completely.

232
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,979
The opportunity has come.

233
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,580
Why are you leaving?

234
00:20:20,459 --> 00:20:21,259
I don't understand.

235
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:30,620
The noble-sounding reason is

236
00:20:32,739 --> 00:20:34,499
that I don't want
to see people die anymore.

237
00:20:36,219 --> 00:20:37,580
The more selfish reason is

238
00:20:38,699 --> 00:20:40,299
that I want to be an ordinary girl.

239
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,620
Reasonably,

240
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,059
we've been indoctrinated
with the mission

241
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:46,299
to fight the Earth Fiend,

242
00:20:47,019 --> 00:20:48,180
but our generation

243
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,340
has never actually
seen the real Earth Fiend.

244
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:52,539
And the first one we saw

245
00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:54,180
is actually a human form.

246
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,420
The ideas instilled in me
by the organization

247
00:20:56,779 --> 00:20:58,019
and the skills I learned

248
00:20:58,019 --> 00:20:59,100
may no longer apply.

249
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,820
So I became afraid and hesitant.

250
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:02,820
I want to run away.

251
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:05,380
I think any of these three reasons

252
00:21:06,459 --> 00:21:08,140
could be convincing enough.

253
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,459
Choose one that you can accept.

254
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:21,779
I know you always want to be a hero.

255
00:21:22,259 --> 00:21:23,620
I also know you've been

256
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,620
wanting an opportunity.

257
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,940
But I'm telling you,

258
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,380
chaotic times produce heroes

259
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,340
and malevolent spirits.

260
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,820
Maybe you like the Mad Blade,

261
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,860
but I don't.

262
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,059
(Every four years again?)

263
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,340
Each time could be the final one.

264
00:22:13,019 --> 00:22:14,180
Right now, tell me.

265
00:22:15,259 --> 00:22:16,459
Is this family important?

266
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,140
Is our child important?

267
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,180
Or is your patrol more important?

268
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:21,979
If you find Luo troublesome,

269
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,860
send her to her uncle's place.

270
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:26,900
If you think we can't stay together,

271
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:28,219
use this time

272
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,539
to find a family woman.

273
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,499
I won't stop you.

274
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,140
Give me my bag.

275
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,219
Give it to me.

276
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,499
During this period,

277
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,100
listen to your dad at home.

278
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,900
I will return soon.

279
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:01,019
Mom, the dumplings are ready.

280
00:23:03,019 --> 00:23:05,219
Thank you, Luo. I won't eat them.

281
00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:08,180
You eat them.

282
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,059
Patrolling is my work

283
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:19,699
as a South Mountain Hunter.

284
00:23:20,259 --> 00:23:21,860
It's also to protect our family.

285
00:23:22,499 --> 00:23:23,499
You can blame me,

286
00:23:24,019 --> 00:23:25,420
but I have no regrets.

287
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,539
When you grow up,

288
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:28,979
you'll understand.

289
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,539
Such good dumplings.

290
00:23:56,739 --> 00:23:58,699
Must you wait
until they're cold to eat them?

291
00:23:58,940 --> 00:23:59,900
If your tummy hurts,

292
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,219
your uncle will blame me.

293
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,299
Stop burning incense every day.

294
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:05,140
The house is filled with smoke.

295
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,459
It's completely messy.

296
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:09,699
Get out.

297
00:24:09,699 --> 00:24:10,660
Don't stay here anymore.

298
00:24:11,459 --> 00:24:13,940
Anyway, you're now qualified to stay

299
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,539
- in any welfare home.
- Enough, enough.

300
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,140
Why are you so angry?

301
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,580
Can't you be quiet?

302
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,699
The ritual offerings are done.

303
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:27,620
Eat dumplings.

304
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:30,459
Stay as long as you want.

305
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:33,979
I'll never drive you away.

306
00:24:52,459 --> 00:24:53,940
Eat the dumplings

307
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,380
while they're warm.

308
00:24:56,299 --> 00:24:57,059
Don't worry.

309
00:24:57,219 --> 00:24:58,459
The South Mountain Education Center

310
00:24:58,459 --> 00:25:00,299
is a state-funded boarding school

311
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:01,459
with qualifications.

312
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,459
I'll take good care of her.

313
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,100
Whip!

314
00:25:10,459 --> 00:25:11,140
Is it good?

315
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:12,620
Look at me.

316
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,259
Any difference? Look.

317
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,800
Medium, medium, large.

318
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,699
Large, medium, small.

319
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,660
Small, medium, large.

320
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,699
Smell carefully.

321
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:26,499
There's also a muddy scent.

322
00:25:26,499 --> 00:25:28,100
And a hint of herbal medicine.

323
00:25:30,459 --> 00:25:31,259
Engage your waist.

324
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:35,499
Arms, spread your arms out.

325
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,860
Look, your bees have all scattered now.

326
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:40,940
Watch again.

327
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,340
Watch again.

328
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:44,360
Wrist.

329
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,320
Wrist.

330
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,299
The wrist. See it?

331
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,059
Like this. Arms open.

332
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,219
This will be your home from now on.

333
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,259
You look just like her.

334
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,140
I was your mom's good friend.

335
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:15,420
You can treat me like your family.

336
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,499
Everyone here calls me Ling.

337
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,739
Call me whatever you like.

338
00:26:21,219 --> 00:26:21,820
Take it off.

339
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:28,180
Training matters

340
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,420
are all handled by Jiang.

341
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,299
If you're hungry,

342
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:31,580
cold, or afraid,

343
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,459
come find me.

344
00:26:35,699 --> 00:26:36,420
Listen,

345
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,539
don't be fooled by her smile.

346
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,180
During the Golden Gate repair mission,

347
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,499
she and your mom

348
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,059
were among the first to charge forward.

349
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,420
When you reach her training module,

350
00:26:56,739 --> 00:26:57,739
you'll suffer.

351
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:01,299
Without your mom,

352
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,180
during the Golden Gate incident,

353
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,459
none of the hunters would've survived.

354
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,299
We all owe her.

355
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,580
No matter what happens,

356
00:27:18,019 --> 00:27:19,860
come find me. Okay?

357
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:23,860
Okay.

358
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,820
We'll be serving chilled bean soup soon.

359
00:27:31,059 --> 00:27:31,620
Take this.

360
00:27:31,779 --> 00:27:33,420
Clean up first,
and then come drink some.

361
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,100
Alright?

362
00:27:38,219 --> 00:27:38,979
Xing Shen.

363
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:41,380
Is the girl pretty?

364
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:42,940
You're this close,

365
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,739
yet can't smell the Fiend's bones
in the jar?

366
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:46,448
You're disgracing the Hound Clan.

367
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,580
Come smell.

368
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:48,499
Can't detect it.

369
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,100
Be quiet.

370
00:28:48,979 --> 00:28:50,459
Well, I'm new here.

371
00:28:50,459 --> 00:28:51,620
I just want extra practice,

372
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,499
so I won't fall too far behind.

373
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:55,860
Understood.

374
00:28:58,299 --> 00:28:58,900
Blade Clan?

375
00:28:59,180 --> 00:28:59,739
Yes.

376
00:29:10,059 --> 00:29:10,860
Impressive.

377
00:29:11,952 --> 00:29:12,976
I'm from the Hound Clan.

378
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,580
I know.

379
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:21,180
Though my nose isn't the sharpest

380
00:29:21,499 --> 00:29:23,940
and can't sniff out hidden Earth Fiends,

381
00:29:25,059 --> 00:29:27,100
I'll train hard in combat

382
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,539
to beat them

383
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,299
and make them toothless.

384
00:29:33,259 --> 00:29:35,340
Do they have teeth?

385
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:42,779
I've never seen any.

386
00:29:43,059 --> 00:29:43,660
I have no idea.

387
00:29:45,459 --> 00:29:46,979
Then I'll hack them

388
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,779
and make them headless.

389
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,259
I'm Xing Shen.

390
00:29:53,539 --> 00:29:54,459
Nie Jiuluo.

391
00:29:55,299 --> 00:29:56,739
What an unusual name.

392
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,459
Can I try that thing?

393
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:01,620
The bucket?

394
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:04,900
Sure, no problem.

395
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,620
Be careful, it's heavy.

396
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,259
(The day your mom died,)

397
00:30:19,979 --> 00:30:21,299
(Ling was critically injured.)

398
00:30:22,499 --> 00:30:24,499
(Though we lit the natural fire in time)

399
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,420
(to save her life,)

400
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,699
(her kidneys failed,)

401
00:30:31,699 --> 00:30:33,100
(and she never fully recovered.)

402
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,340
I'll get the certificate.

403
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,979
We were late
because of the mountain patrol.

404
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:13,100
Ling

405
00:31:15,019 --> 00:31:16,140
won't blame us.

406
00:31:20,459 --> 00:31:23,539
I'm always told
that patrolling is our duty.

407
00:31:25,739 --> 00:31:27,580
Now, we didn't even get to see Ling

408
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,620
one last time.

409
00:31:30,019 --> 00:31:30,860
I don't understand.

410
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,620
What exactly are we protecting?

411
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,180
It went out to play.

412
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,779
It'll come back for dinner.

413
00:32:59,219 --> 00:32:59,900
Lu.

414
00:33:00,699 --> 00:33:01,699
What's for dinner?

415
00:34:42,307 --> 00:34:46,032
(Now...)

416
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:55,539
(Now I'm a step closer to freedom.)

417
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,340
The next fishing boat
won't come to load ice

418
00:36:17,539 --> 00:36:18,860
until the day after tomorrow.

419
00:36:19,179 --> 00:36:19,900
What bad timing.

420
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,499
We only have one cotton coat here.

421
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:27,700
You'll just have to tough it out.

422
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,499
Qiang.

423
00:36:31,099 --> 00:36:33,420
Enough already. Don't stir up trouble.

424
00:36:37,539 --> 00:36:38,780
Mrs. Hua made some soup.

425
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:39,860
Go have a bowl.

426
00:36:40,139 --> 00:36:40,700
I'll do it.

427
00:36:58,539 --> 00:36:59,579
You're the one in charge?

428
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,260
Can you make decisions?

429
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:02,659
Can someone else do this?

430
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:06,019
I don't want to repeat the same words
too many times.

431
00:37:06,019 --> 00:37:07,860
I don't want to hear too many either.

432
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,780
We invited you here

433
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:12,380
just to ask a few questions.

434
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:15,619
You know what?

435
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,700
Right now,
I've got more questions than you do.

436
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,459
Can you answer my questions first?

437
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,099
Ask away.

438
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,860
But I suggest you
think carefully before that.

439
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,260
What is the Earth Fiend?

440
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,780
They're sworn enemies of ours.

441
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,220
What are you people?

442
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,019
My turn.

443
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:55,499
About the person, or a thing,

444
00:37:57,099 --> 00:37:58,380
in your trunk,

445
00:37:59,459 --> 00:38:00,816
what's your relationship with it?

446
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,700
His name is Gou Ya.

447
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,536
I met him for the first time yesterday.

448
00:38:12,019 --> 00:38:14,340
I already told the other guy
the same thing.

449
00:38:14,539 --> 00:38:16,139
Why was he in your car?

450
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:17,700
My turn now.

451
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:23,340
You seem very interested in him.

452
00:38:24,059 --> 00:38:25,420
What's so special about him?

453
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,900
If you want to leave,

454
00:38:28,659 --> 00:38:30,019
don't try any tricks.

455
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,220
So that means

456
00:38:34,139 --> 00:38:35,099
he's an Earth Fiend,

457
00:38:35,539 --> 00:38:36,579
and your organization

458
00:38:36,579 --> 00:38:38,059
is against the Earth Fiend, right?

459
00:38:38,059 --> 00:38:39,780
How many more like him exist?

460
00:38:40,179 --> 00:38:41,340
Where do they all come from?

461
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:41,860
Wait.

462
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:42,659
Where are they?

463
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,300
I think I'm starting to understand.

464
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,059
You think

465
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:48,579
I'm in league with Gou Ya?

466
00:38:48,579 --> 00:38:49,740
So I'm an Earth Fiend too?

467
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,499
You're definitely working with him.

468
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,539
But you're not a Fiend.

469
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,139
Then you don't
fully grasp the situation.

470
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,900
Yan Tuo, right?

471
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,420
General Manager of Roadsound Group.

472
00:39:08,619 --> 00:39:11,340
No.1 Muyuan Road,
Taihang District, Xicang City.

473
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,740
Your organization

474
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:21,860
is really despicable.

475
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,019
No wonder it lacks unity.

476
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:23,820
Shut up.

477
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,979
What is that woman's name?

478
00:39:25,979 --> 00:39:27,860
Nie...

479
00:39:28,539 --> 00:39:29,659
Nie Jiuluo.

480
00:39:31,659 --> 00:39:33,220
I used to think she was disloyal.

481
00:39:33,659 --> 00:39:35,019
But now, I understand.

482
00:39:35,619 --> 00:39:36,700
Breaking away from you

483
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,260
means escaping misery.

484
00:40:25,139 --> 00:40:27,099
Ms. Lin, go on.

485
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,300
I deserve punishment.

486
00:40:31,099 --> 00:40:33,420
Do you think I care about you?

487
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:34,860
I guarantee

488
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,780
I'll bring Yan Tuo back.

489
00:40:38,659 --> 00:40:39,340
How?

490
00:40:41,459 --> 00:40:42,499
I've already sent people

491
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,300
to locate Yan Tuo's car.

492
00:40:44,659 --> 00:40:46,340
The toll stations
after exiting the highway

493
00:40:46,659 --> 00:40:51,139
are being checked
for nearby hiding spots.

494
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:52,619
I estimate

495
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,380
we'll find him soon.

496
00:40:55,059 --> 00:40:55,559
Very soon.

497
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,760
As for Mr. Crip,

498
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,036
his left leg was injured 20 years ago

499
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:14,240
during the Golden Gate repairs.

500
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,760
He is well-known for being loyal.

501
00:41:17,104 --> 00:41:18,880
Mrs. Hua of the Whip Clan

502
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,096
optimized the team composition strategy

503
00:41:22,096 --> 00:41:23,800
with seven Hounds,
two Whips, and one Blade.

504
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,680
She's essentially the chief strategist
of the South Mountain Hunters.

505
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,080
The one on the phone right now

506
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,280
must be Shan Qiang.

507
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,600
The current version of the Whistle Whip

508
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,160
was designed by his father.

509
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,120
It's more effective at repelling Fiends

510
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,720
and has better weight distribution.

511
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,800
Seems your father told you plenty.

512
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,080
Of course.

513
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,320
The organization was founded
thousands of years ago.

514
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:57,600
Its members protect people
and eliminate Fiends,

515
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,760
asking for no fame or fortune,

516
00:41:59,888 --> 00:42:01,904
only trying to be worthy
of the ancestors' legacy.

517
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,000
My father always took pride

518
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,960
in being part
of the South Mountain Hunters.
