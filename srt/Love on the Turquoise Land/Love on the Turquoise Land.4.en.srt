(This story is a work of fiction)

16
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,813
=Episode 4=

17
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,100
Hungry?

18
00:02:25,619 --> 00:02:26,899
You should've told me earlier.

19
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:32,060
Have some.

20
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,540
Yan Tuo.

21
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:39,579
Yan Tuo!

22
00:02:39,619 --> 00:02:41,019
Xiong! Xiong!

23
00:02:41,179 --> 00:02:42,260
Is that you, Xiong?

24
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:51,019
Behave yourself.

25
00:02:57,019 --> 00:02:57,899
Quiet down.

26
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,259
You two are unreliable.

27
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,379
This place is probably found.

28
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,220
I'll go bring him out.

29
00:05:40,499 --> 00:05:41,460
You two stay here.

30
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,660
Hold the fort.

31
00:05:43,299 --> 00:05:43,980
Got it.

32
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:56,619
Let me get you some more.

33
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,419
No, thanks. I can't eat anymore.

34
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,660
Starving on the road,
then stuffing myself at home.

35
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,419
Not very healthy.

36
00:07:02,619 --> 00:07:04,780
When you find food you love,
why not eat your fill?

37
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,179
There's no point in saving it.

38
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,340
Of course I won't keep it.

39
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,819
But I'll keep you around.

40
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:10,780
With you here,

41
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,900
I can eat whatever I want.

42
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,660
After this trip,

43
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,100
you learned to sweet-talk?

44
00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:25,733
(Jiang Baichuan)

45
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:29,299
Hello?

46
00:07:30,179 --> 00:07:32,460
The one you sent isn't an isolated case.

47
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:35,020
Go on.

48
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:36,259
Except the driver,

49
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,299
the other two were taken away.

50
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,179
Several men got injured.

51
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,780
Shan Qiang's fine.

52
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,939
Mrs. Hua's in the ICU.

53
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,819
Still critical.

54
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:51,220
(We checked the video.)

55
00:07:53,859 --> 00:07:55,660
(The Whistle Whip worked,)

56
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,059
(meaning they were Earth Fiends.)

57
00:07:58,499 --> 00:07:59,619
Xiong, you okay?

58
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,419
You too?

59
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,900
(With Mrs. Hua's skills,)

60
00:08:05,859 --> 00:08:07,379
(she could handle multiple opponents,)

61
00:08:08,179 --> 00:08:10,179
(but that humanoid Earth Fiend
was too tough.)

62
00:08:11,499 --> 00:08:12,540
(Not sure why,)

63
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,859
(but Hound Clan
couldn't detect his scent,)

64
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,179
(so reinforcements were delayed.)

65
00:08:18,619 --> 00:08:19,619
(He acted)

66
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,980
(like the Whistle Whip's sound
enraged him.)

67
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:23,739
(He attacked brutally.)

68
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,100
(So...)

69
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,900
Now, tell me
what you want from all this.

70
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,739
If you want to quit
being a South Mountain Hunter

71
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:35,820
after one more mission,

72
00:08:37,379 --> 00:08:38,460
this mission

73
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:41,820
will happen soon.

74
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,379
Hope you're ready.

75
00:08:50,116 --> 00:08:51,859
(Wanbao Tower)

76
00:08:51,859 --> 00:08:53,019
The clothes arrive tomorrow?

77
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:53,700
Yeah, tomorrow.

78
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,539
Mr. Liu!

79
00:08:54,859 --> 00:08:55,779
Going grocery shopping?

80
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,180
Garlic chives
are cheap today. Better hurry.

81
00:08:58,779 --> 00:08:59,619
Even a vice principal

82
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,659
retires and buys his own groceries.

83
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,420
Dazhuang, come here.

84
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:05,980
The 108 Heroes I taught you.

85
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:06,739
You memorized them?

86
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:07,739
I did it ages ago.

87
00:09:07,739 --> 00:09:08,739
I don't believe you.

88
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,100
Study them properly.

89
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:12,220
They'll help with college exams someday.

90
00:09:13,859 --> 00:09:14,820
A new face?

91
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:15,940
Xia!

92
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,739
Come to my room to cool down.

93
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:18,600
Get lost.

94
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:19,820
What's on your mind?

95
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,180
Have some herbal tea to cool off.

96
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,139
You came, Dr. Lv.

97
00:09:22,499 --> 00:09:22,999
Bro.

98
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,460
Look. How about it?

99
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,060
Wow.

100
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,379
You really did it.

101
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,259
Of course.

102
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:28,060
Fine. Go ahead.

103
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:29,259
It could be worse.

104
00:09:29,739 --> 00:09:31,060
None of your business.

105
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:33,139
Thank you.

106
00:09:34,619 --> 00:09:37,539
(Wanbao Tower, Welcome)
Leader Star, The Loyalty, Song Jiang.

107
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,259
Strength Star, Jade Qilin, Lu Junyi.

108
00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:44,859
Leisure Star,
Dragon in the Clouds, Gongsun Sheng.

109
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,739
(Traditional Chinese Medicine Clinic)
I must be the Leisure Star.

110
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:47,940
I'm genuinely idle.

111
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,019
You don't ring until I pick the bag up.

112
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,300
Just wait.

113
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,539
If I could, you think I wouldn't answer?

114
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:05,779
(Open)

115
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:06,379
Sis.

116
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:08,659
No, I was out buying groceries.

117
00:10:08,659 --> 00:10:09,539
My hands were full.

118
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,379
Yan Tuo?

119
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,619
Okay. I'm coming right away.

120
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,499
Tell Ms. Lin not to worry, okay?

121
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,340
Bro.

122
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:27,659
Bro.

123
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,300
Watch the shop for me.

124
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,659
Got it.

125
00:10:31,499 --> 00:10:33,379
Don't be stingy with your ointment.

126
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:34,659
Hand.

127
00:10:35,499 --> 00:10:37,259
I told you I'm fine.

128
00:10:37,619 --> 00:10:38,739
Since I'm here,

129
00:10:38,859 --> 00:10:40,779
at least, let me give
you the full treatment.

130
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,899
You don't know it.

131
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:44,779
Patients coming to my clinic

132
00:10:45,259 --> 00:10:46,980
either have a weak stomach

133
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,580
or fertility issues.

134
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:51,700
Without treating external injuries,
my skills will get rusty.

135
00:10:51,739 --> 00:10:52,899
Endure it. Endure.

136
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:53,619
Don't move.

137
00:10:58,019 --> 00:10:59,460
Using me as practice?

138
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,539
Talk. How'd this happen?

139
00:11:05,659 --> 00:11:06,619
None of your business.

140
00:11:07,859 --> 00:11:09,019
When men fight,

141
00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:10,820
there are usually two reasons.

142
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,700
Parking space disputes

143
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,580
or competition for mates.

144
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,060
What is your reason?

145
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,820
Who said this was from fighting?

146
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,859
I fell hiking.

147
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:21,899
Really?

148
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:25,220
That mountain's got sharp claws.

149
00:11:25,859 --> 00:11:26,820
Enough already.

150
00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:30,300
Your disappearance for days

151
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,619
had Ms. Lin worried sick.

152
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,619
Everyone's been searching everywhere.

153
00:11:35,619 --> 00:11:36,859
And you were mountain climbing?

154
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,379
I skipped work today to give you

155
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:40,499
free medical care.

156
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,139
Not even worth honest words?

157
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,779
They were looking for me.

158
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,060
What did they say?

159
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:50,820
What do you think they should've said?

160
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,060
Tuo,

161
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:54,659
are you okay?

162
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:55,899
Where are you hurt?

163
00:11:55,899 --> 00:11:57,379
It's nothing. Just a scratch. See?

164
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,220
You scared me to death.

165
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,100
Really, I'm fine.

166
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:00,820
Does it hurt?

167
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,539
No.

168
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,019
Maybe I shall go get some scrapes too.

169
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,300
Take physical pain from fights

170
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,539
for sweet concern from others.

171
00:12:08,539 --> 00:12:10,340
Who did you fight with?

172
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:10,960
Not human.

173
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,080
Mountain.

174
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:13,779
Listen to this.

175
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,460
Tuofeng Mountain in Cangbei

176
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:17,220
has a very potent temple.

177
00:12:17,659 --> 00:12:19,739
All the infertile couples
go there, right?

178
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:20,820
Can't you shut your mouth?

179
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:23,940
Does it hurt?

180
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,580
No. Really. It's barely noticeable.

181
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,259
Ms. Lin.

182
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:28,499
Thanks for coming, Lv Xian.

183
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:30,019
Tuo, are you alright?

184
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:30,700
Yes.

185
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,379
Don't worry. He's sturdy.

186
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:35,420
Some food and sleep will fix him.

187
00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:36,779
Sorry to make you come here.

188
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:39,100
But I trust you more.

189
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,820
Ms. Lin, no need
for formalities with me.

190
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,899
If Roadsound Group hadn't funded

191
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:44,180
my TCM studies,

192
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,499
I wouldn't have this clinic.

193
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:46,779
You're a doctor?

194
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:48,340
I thought you ran a teahouse.

195
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:50,259
My examination found

196
00:12:50,259 --> 00:12:51,580
he's not completely healthy.

197
00:12:51,739 --> 00:12:53,019
He's got mouth issues

198
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,259
and cavities.

199
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,019
Lin Ling.

200
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,980
Take Dr. Lv out for a bit.

201
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,420
Serve some gratitude tea.

202
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,539
No need for formalities.

203
00:13:02,539 --> 00:13:03,499
Just doing my duty.

204
00:13:03,859 --> 00:13:04,820
Not just tea.

205
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,460
If time permits, share a meal too.

206
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,259
You young people should

207
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:10,259
interact more often.

208
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,060
Okay, Ms. Lin.

209
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:15,420
Dr. Lv, this way, please.

210
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,259
Enough with "Dr. Lv".

211
00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:19,100
Too formal.

212
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:19,820
Call me Xian.

213
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:25,460
Hear that? Ms. Lin wants us
to hang out more.

214
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,820
You don't need to ask.

215
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,060
I'll tell you.

216
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,659
That day, didn't you ask me

217
00:13:31,659 --> 00:13:33,379
to bring Gou Ya back first?

218
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:36,060
I encountered a landslide on the way.

219
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,460
Rocks were everywhere.

220
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,340
I couldn't see the road.

221
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,220
Difficult to navigate.

222
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:42,139
Out of nowhere,
a car ran fast towards me.

223
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:43,019
It hit me.

224
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,300
When I woke up,

225
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,460
I was locked up there.

226
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:46,940
What kind of car hit you?

227
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,379
It happened too fast. How could I see?

228
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,940
It might have been black.

229
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,460
How many people were there?

230
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,619
What did they say to you?

231
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,580
I saw three or four.

232
00:14:01,619 --> 00:14:02,899
They didn't say anything.

233
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,980
They just locked me in an ice cellar

234
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:05,859
and didn't feed me.

235
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,300
Luckily, Xiong arrived in time.

236
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:08,420
I almost froze to death.

237
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:10,180
They didn't tell you anything?

238
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,420
But I pretended to be unconscious

239
00:14:13,739 --> 00:14:14,899
and heard them talking.

240
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,539
They seemed particularly
interested in Gou Ya.

241
00:14:17,859 --> 00:14:19,180
Are you interested in him?

242
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:26,060
I-I-I'm just a bit curious.

243
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:35,779
A-A-Am I not supposed to be curious?

244
00:14:39,739 --> 00:14:40,619
You've suffered.

245
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:44,019
It's nothing.

246
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,460
Do you think I owe you an explanation?

247
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,779
Explanation? It doesn't matter.

248
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:06,619
By all rights, this should end here.

249
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:07,940
No more discussions.

250
00:15:08,539 --> 00:15:10,100
You're the face of Roadsound.

251
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:12,220
You should remain spotless.

252
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,899
I've been dreaming a lot lately.

253
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,859
Always about you as a child.

254
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,340
When I wake up, I remind myself

255
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:22,180
you've grown up now.

256
00:15:22,859 --> 00:15:25,060
Time to know some truths.

257
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,899
Even shoulder some responsibilities.

258
00:15:29,739 --> 00:15:30,499
Really?

259
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:34,980
Ms. Lin, I'm ready.

260
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,739
We're conducting human trials.

261
00:15:44,659 --> 00:15:46,499
For pharmaceutical companies,

262
00:15:46,499 --> 00:15:48,619
time is the biggest constraint.

263
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:51,340
Endless screening, approvals,

264
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,499
animal testing, clinical trials...

265
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,899
Any delay in these stages

266
00:15:55,899 --> 00:15:58,300
could let competitors gain advantage

267
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,820
and let us lose the entire market.

268
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:04,019
Roadsound is both the mountain

269
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:05,659
the industry looks up to

270
00:16:06,259 --> 00:16:08,300
and the one everyone wants to trample

271
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,859
to conquer.

272
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,259
So I took a risky shortcut.

273
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,259
What shortcut?

274
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,899
A drug enhancing cellular activity.

275
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,700
A groundbreaking new medicine.

276
00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:25,259
We recruited many volunteers,

277
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,859
but only Gou Yan met the criteria.

278
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:30,019
We promised him money

279
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,659
and a job placement.

280
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,659
The welfare home.

281
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,019
The trials required multiple phases.

282
00:16:36,499 --> 00:16:37,779
Held at the welfare home,

283
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:40,139
because it's remote

284
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,779
and it's our own funded project.

285
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,539
Easier to control all aspects.

286
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,420
Later, the drug caused

287
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,019
side effects in him.

288
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,980
As for what happened next,

289
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,180
you already know.

290
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,019
Choosing to take risks

291
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:03,220
means bearing the consequences.

292
00:17:09,019 --> 00:17:10,499
Those who captured me

293
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:12,380
want to crush Roadsound

294
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,420
and surpass it...

295
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:15,819
Competitors, media,

296
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,140
envious people who hate success,

297
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:21,819
troublemaking lunatics, and so on.

298
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,160
So...

299
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:28,819
Tuo,

300
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:34,259
welcome to the adult world.

301
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,620
Ms. Lin,

302
00:17:42,339 --> 00:17:43,940
I stopped being a child long ago.

303
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:45,980
You should've let me face this earlier.

304
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:48,579
No matter what challenges
Roadsound faces,

305
00:17:49,019 --> 00:17:50,579
base persons or lunatics,

306
00:17:50,739 --> 00:17:52,019
open or covert,

307
00:17:52,019 --> 00:17:53,099
you can tell me.

308
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,259
Let me handle it all. Okay?

309
00:17:56,819 --> 00:17:58,059
No matter your age,

310
00:17:59,099 --> 00:18:00,499
you're still my child.

311
00:18:02,339 --> 00:18:03,380
Rest well.

312
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,420
You should rest early too.

313
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,940
At first, we stayed hidden

314
00:18:40,499 --> 00:18:42,299
and couldn't confront them directly.

315
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,099
Later on, they began to lose their grip.

316
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,700
Nowadays, only small-time thugs
patrol the mountains.

317
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:52,460
It seems we're gradually
gaining the upper hand.

318
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,059
But this time, we got careless.

319
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,339
We almost capsized in a ditch.

320
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,380
Back and forth.

321
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:02,140
When will this ever end?

322
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,420
Then let's make it quick.

323
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:07,860
Confident?

324
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,420
That woman used a Whistle Whip.

325
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,819
She's somewhat skilled.

326
00:19:11,739 --> 00:19:12,620
Within their ranks,

327
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:14,819
she's likely a key figure.

328
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,180
I dealt her a serious blow.

329
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,099
They won't abandon her.

330
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:20,420
I've checked all hospitals in Xicang

331
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,259
for patients matching her description.

332
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,779
Follow the trail,

333
00:19:23,819 --> 00:19:25,099
and we'll find her.

334
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:26,460
No more mistakes.

335
00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:27,739
Delays add risk.

336
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,779
Don't worry, Ms. Lin.

337
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,579
I know he wants to,

338
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,700
but keep Tuo out of this.

339
00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:40,660
Of course.

340
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,739
Give it back! Give it back!

341
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,220
(Resident ID Card: Nie Jiuluo)
Nie Jiuluo.

342
00:21:01,539 --> 00:21:02,660
Awake already?

343
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,660
I wanted to admire your work quietly.

344
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,180
How many years for trespassing?

345
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:31,499
Less than intentional assault, surely.

346
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,779
Self-defense.

347
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,140
No charges apply.

348
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,660
My apologies, Miss Nie.

349
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,739
This intrusion

350
00:21:48,739 --> 00:21:49,700
is improper.

351
00:21:50,099 --> 00:21:51,059
But these past days,

352
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,579
I've encountered inexplicable things.

353
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:57,180
You might hold the answers,

354
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:57,860
so I came.

355
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,360
Up.

356
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:00,940
What?

357
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,220
That's not for sitting.

358
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:04,099
Get up.

359
00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:06,140
This chair?

360
00:22:07,019 --> 00:22:07,980
Legacy Seat.

361
00:22:08,539 --> 00:22:10,499
Created by Lausi Dandar in 1946.

362
00:22:10,499 --> 00:22:12,140
Exhibited in 16 countries.

363
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:12,779
One of a kind.

364
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,420
The only one in existence.

365
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,779
No one would tell.

366
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:27,079
Listen.

367
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,440
Listen.

368
00:23:12,019 --> 00:23:13,220
You prefer the hard way?

369
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:42,339
I...

370
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,099
Miss Nie.

371
00:23:49,579 --> 00:23:50,980
It was a slip of the hand.

372
00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:54,299
Your hand was cut? Is it bad?

373
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:57,099
No, I just fumbled it.

374
00:23:57,499 --> 00:23:58,339
My hand's fine.

375
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,180
Don't worry. Stay downstairs.

376
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:01,980
Really?

377
00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:06,220
I'm going to bed.

378
00:24:06,499 --> 00:24:07,660
Clean up tomorrow.

379
00:24:08,299 --> 00:24:10,900
Alright. Rest well.

380
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,860
You too.

381
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,579
Miss Nie?

382
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:36,819
What's wrong?

383
00:24:37,739 --> 00:24:38,460
Nothing.

384
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,259
A fly got in.

385
00:24:40,539 --> 00:24:41,299
I shooed it out.

386
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,460
Go to sleep, Lu.

387
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,499
Throwing stuff again last night?

388
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:21,779
Lu,

389
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,940
why mention this to him?

390
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:25,779
Mr. Lu came early...

391
00:25:25,779 --> 00:25:26,499
It's fine, Lu.

392
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,819
Go about your work.

393
00:25:28,099 --> 00:25:29,620
The great artist hasn't had breakfast.

394
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,420
Cook extra.

395
00:25:35,739 --> 00:25:36,779
Go, Lu.

396
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,460
Van Gogh

397
00:25:46,259 --> 00:25:48,380
painted Sunflowers first,

398
00:25:48,579 --> 00:25:49,940
and then cut off his ear.

399
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:52,620
Beethoven

400
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,380
composed his Fifth Symphony,

401
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,339
and then went deaf.

402
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,739
Hemingway finished

403
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:01,059
The Old Man and the Sea and then

404
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,579
killed himself.

405
00:26:04,779 --> 00:26:06,620
You haven't achieved anything yet.

406
00:26:07,539 --> 00:26:09,140
Cut the dramatic act.

407
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:12,499
Madness is a master's privilege.

408
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,579
You're calling me mad?

409
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,180
This is your new piece?

410
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,059
Unfinished.

411
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,819
No appeal,

412
00:26:22,059 --> 00:26:22,980
and progressing slowly.

413
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,900
Patience doesn't guarantee masterpieces,

414
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,819
but rushing never does.

415
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,539
Not rushing you.

416
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,860
Here to help you focus inward.

417
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:35,660
(Li Sheng'er, Mixiong's Trip)
The hottest sculpting artist now.

418
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,460
Drop by for a visit when you're free.

419
00:26:38,539 --> 00:26:39,900
You call this an artist?

420
00:26:40,579 --> 00:26:41,739
Why two tickets?

421
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:48,539
Don't you have any male friends

422
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,819
to visit exhibitions with?

423
00:26:51,499 --> 00:26:52,579
Or grab meals together?

424
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:55,900
Trying to set me up
with another rich guy?

425
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,259
Not this time.

426
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,019
Pure art invitation.

427
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,420
Invite whoever you want.

428
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:02,019
I'll stay out of your personal life.

429
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,180
No one. Not asking anyone.

430
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,860
I'd be embarrassed
to ask someone to this exhibition.

431
00:27:07,579 --> 00:27:08,539
Is money shameful?

432
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,700
Is being admired shameful?

433
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,620
If your exhibition sold out instantly,

434
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,420
I'd take the shame.

435
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,460
Then go hold one!

436
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,499
Instead of smashing things at home

437
00:27:16,579 --> 00:27:17,980
or disappearing to the countryside?

438
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,140
Maybe

439
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:22,140
you feel you're getting closer to art,

440
00:27:23,779 --> 00:27:25,420
but farther from real life.

441
00:27:28,299 --> 00:27:29,299
What fascinates you most

442
00:27:31,259 --> 00:27:32,380
and what suits you best

443
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,900
are rarely the same.

444
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,259
But you don't have to pick just one.

445
00:27:42,819 --> 00:27:43,700
Go see it alone

446
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,539
if there's no company.

447
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,180
Treat it as a critical analysis.

448
00:27:48,339 --> 00:27:50,339
Judge how shameful it truly is.

449
00:27:57,339 --> 00:27:59,099
Lu, is the meal ready?

450
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:04,688
(You're slightly better
than Li Sheng'er.)

451
00:28:04,688 --> 00:28:05,420
(Li Sheng'er, Mixiong's Trip)

452
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,660
What should we do later?

453
00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:08,259
Not sure.

454
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:12,220
How about finding a cafe to sit in?

455
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:25,860
Hello, Chishui Street.

456
00:28:30,739 --> 00:28:32,660
You even went to this exhibition

457
00:28:32,819 --> 00:28:35,180
with pure commercial hype
and zero artistic value?

458
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,660
I thought you had better taste.

459
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,499
I regret not hitting
you harder yesterday.

460
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,420
I've been puzzled all night.

461
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,620
Aren't you an artist, Miss Nie?

462
00:28:48,739 --> 00:28:49,940
Why are you so skilled?

463
00:28:52,099 --> 00:28:53,660
Because you're too weak.

464
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,539
So you rescued me

465
00:28:58,019 --> 00:28:59,620
out of pity yesterday?

466
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,620
I feared your corpse
would stain my courtyard.

467
00:29:05,339 --> 00:29:06,980
Then why let go?

468
00:29:07,059 --> 00:29:09,059
I didn't want your blood on my hands.

469
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,579
Why so many questions?

470
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,539
What do you want?

471
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,579
I came sincerely for advice yesterday,

472
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,739
and you threw me off the second floor.

473
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,220
I threw you?

474
00:29:21,499 --> 00:29:23,059
Answer three questions as compensation.

475
00:29:23,259 --> 00:29:23,940
Just three.

476
00:29:24,099 --> 00:29:25,059
Answer them,

477
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,299
and I'll never bother you.

478
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,739
What if I refuse?

479
00:29:32,539 --> 00:29:33,819
You can't beat me.

480
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,380
Let me out now,

481
00:29:36,819 --> 00:29:37,860
and we both save face.

482
00:29:38,499 --> 00:29:39,019
Fine.

483
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:40,019
Let's see

484
00:29:40,019 --> 00:29:41,460
who ends up losing more face.

485
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:04,059
Miss Nie,

486
00:30:04,779 --> 00:30:06,059
how long do you think

487
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:07,499
it'll take me to drive

488
00:30:07,499 --> 00:30:08,539
to that gap ahead?

489
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,499
Longer than beating you to a pulp.

490
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:22,019
Next questions.

491
00:30:22,019 --> 00:30:22,739
I ask, you answer.

492
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:23,739
Quick responses only.

493
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:25,019
Or we'll die together.

494
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,380
What are Earth Fiends?

495
00:30:30,819 --> 00:30:32,259
What's "rooting and sprouting"?

496
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,700
Who are you people?

497
00:30:35,059 --> 00:30:36,460
Why fight the Earth Fiends?

498
00:30:37,059 --> 00:30:37,819
Done.

499
00:30:37,819 --> 00:30:38,980
Do you need my repetition?

500
00:30:39,019 --> 00:30:40,660
How do you know Gou Ya?

501
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:43,620
Not your concern.

502
00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:45,299
You're not answering mine.

503
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,539
Why should I answer yours?

504
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:48,980
You have no choice.

505
00:31:06,099 --> 00:31:06,779
Scared?

506
00:31:08,819 --> 00:31:10,140
Dare to not hit the brakes?

507
00:31:10,299 --> 00:31:11,660
Dare to keep silent?

508
00:31:18,339 --> 00:31:19,220
Lunatic.

509
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,660
Smash the window.

510
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,420
Break it now!

511
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,019
Hydrophobia?

512
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:49,579
Listen.

513
00:31:49,579 --> 00:31:50,579
The water pressure

514
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:51,620
blocks the doors.

515
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:53,499
Stay calm. Small breaths. Save oxygen.

516
00:31:53,739 --> 00:31:55,259
Wait for the pressure to balance out.

517
00:31:55,259 --> 00:31:56,220
Then open the doors.

518
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,299
Inhale and swim out.

519
00:31:57,299 --> 00:31:57,900
Understood?

520
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:00,940
Can you swim?

521
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,620
Close your eyes and take a breath.

522
00:32:10,779 --> 00:32:11,539
Trust me.

523
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,900
Inhale and hold it.

524
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,140
What are Earth Fiends?

525
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:14,660
What?

526
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,339
What's "rooting and sprouting"?

527
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,019
Stay away from me.

528
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,099
Who are you?

529
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,660
Why fight the Earth Fiends?

530
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:30,739
What?

531
00:33:31,739 --> 00:33:32,380
Let me go!

532
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,420
Let me go!

533
00:33:33,739 --> 00:33:34,460
Let me go!

534
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:27,940
Miss Nie.

535
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,300
You woke up without calling me?

536
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,579
I-I-I just woke up.

537
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,740
Perfect timing. The ginger tea's ready.

538
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:36,900
While it's hot.

539
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:42,900
Lu,

540
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:46,659
how did I get back here?

541
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,699
You don't remember?

542
00:34:50,539 --> 00:34:52,219
I heard the doorbell ring.

543
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,699
I went to open it

544
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:55,019
and found you lying there,

545
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,579
soaked to the bone.

546
00:34:57,499 --> 00:34:59,380
I saw a white jeep.

547
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,099
It sped off as soon as I looked.

548
00:35:02,019 --> 00:35:03,699
Weren't you going to the exhibition?

549
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,380
How'd you end up like this?

550
00:35:06,139 --> 00:35:08,179
I-I-I drank too much.

551
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:10,059
It's fine. I had too much to drink.

552
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,340
At noon?

553
00:35:12,019 --> 00:35:13,380
Who got you this drunk?

554
00:35:16,019 --> 00:35:17,380
A contact from Mr. Lu?

555
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,340
Yes, that's right.

556
00:35:19,539 --> 00:35:23,460
First meeting, and you drank this much

557
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:24,740
and got yourself soaked?

558
00:35:27,139 --> 00:35:27,900
No!

559
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:30,099
T-T-That's not what I meant.

560
00:35:30,099 --> 00:35:30,980
I-I-I meant...

561
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:31,940
It's okay, Lu.

562
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:33,780
Just leave it there.

563
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,260
I'll drink it when I get up.

564
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:36,499
Alright.

565
00:35:37,099 --> 00:35:38,659
Then drink it all while it's warm.

566
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,019
By the way,

567
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,420
I washed your wet clothes.

568
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,780
I found this in your coat pocket.

569
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,059
