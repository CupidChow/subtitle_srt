Okay.

- Yes.

Oh crap!

10
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:00,602
- Sorry, Shige.
- What?

11
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:04,773
For the family at table one,
their child can't eat seafood.

12
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:08,526
Oh really?
We just ran out of ginger pork, right?

13
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,736
Yes.

14
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:14,491
Think of something we can make
with the ingredients we have left.

15
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:15,909
Okay.

16
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,590
We can make Japanese-style Hamburg Steak
using leftover gyoza filling.

17
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:34,219
- Sounds good. Can you do that?
- Yes.

18
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:39,140
Excuse me.

19
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:42,101

00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:33,976
You're looking for a place that allows
immediate move-in and early termination?

60
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,480
Yes. I need to move by next month.

61
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:43,236
The choices are pretty limited
at this time of year…

62
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,449
By the way, do you plan on staying
in Japan after graduation?

63
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,826
What?

64
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,453
If you don't have to terminate your lease
in less than a year,

I don't plan to.

67
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,255
I see.

68
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:24,861
You haven't captured the theme at all.

69
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:27,530
The theme for this assignment

70
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,867
was "the expression of unique textures,"
was it not?

71
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,579
I do not see any thought
put into the textures.

72
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:38,875
For example,
you could have shown how slimy it is,

73
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,668
or crisp it is.

74
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:44,255
You need to work on the expression,
and depiction of textures.

75
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,175
Okay.

76
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,556

- He's Hase, my classmate from college.
- Welcome.

90
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:52,198
He does have a toned, athletic build.
I can picture him running.

91
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:56,536
He was so good that he was assigned to run
the first leg of the High School Ekiden.

92
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,037
- Really?
- Right?

93
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:02,083
Not only that, but in college
he ran alongside athletes

94
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,085
like Kikuchi and Okubo.

95
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:06,587
- That's amazing! They're so famous.
- Yeah!

96

What is this called?

It's <i>shigure-ni</i>

<i>Shigure-ni…</i>

160
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:21,355

<i>It's not because you're</i>
<i>particularly special.</i>

182
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:34,321
<i>Didn't you used to live in Japan?</i>

183
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,240
Yeah, but I was in elementary school.

184
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,450
Plus this isn't like that.

185
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,336
I'm not going to date anyone.

186
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:52,631
If my mom finds out,
she'll drag me back home immediately.

187
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,520
The seasoning is totally different.

188
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,277
It looks similar, though…

189
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:17,114
JANG-JORIM

190
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,750
Amazing…

191
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,920
Truly a genius. A genius.

192
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:18,967
I'm so jealous.

193
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:23,013
If I had this kind of talent,
I bet I would have no worries.

194
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:32,773
I see… Your mother is pretty mad, huh?

195
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:38,987
I know. It's my fault.

196
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,531
But when you're here, don't you sometimes

197
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:45,035
feel like you've become so stupid?

198
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,747
Things like checking the mail,

199
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,958
and riding the bus…

200
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:54,836
Things that I used to do normally
have suddenly become so difficult.

201
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:59,007
‪If someone were to say,

202
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:02,219
‪"That's the life you chose,"

203
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,888
I'd have nothing to say back.

204
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:06,682
But…

205
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,810
I used to be a little more competent.

206
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:13,563
What are you saying?

207
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,108
Rin,

208
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,360
you're very competent.

209
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,445
You'll get through this soon.

210
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,990
Trust me on this one.

211
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:25,701
Okay?

212
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,246
Okay. Thank you.

213
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,126
I only have a year left,
so I'll try my best.

214
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,630
Okay. You can talk to me anytime.

215
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:45,137
You need to go back soon, right?

216
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,389
What will you do for lunch?

217
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:51,685
I'll just grab some onigiri.

218
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,358
Hey,

219
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:03,947
there's a good restaurant near the school.

220
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:08,035
Do you want to go with me next time?

221
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:10,662
- Want to go tonight?
- Really?

222
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:14,124
I'd love that. Thank you.

223
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,418
Shall we go?

224
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,176
CLOSED

225
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:32,017
‪JUN-HO - UGH, I'M TOO LAZY TO DO IT…

226
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,852
SORRY THEY'RE CLOSED.
LET'S GO ANOTHER TIME.

227
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:36,229
‪TANOMI

228
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:48,241
I'm sorry. Today is our day off.

229
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,495
Yeah, I just noticed.

230
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,666
Well, I'll come again.

231
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:03,590
Did you eat already?

232
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:10,514
If you have time,
will you please give me your input?

233
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:13,433
- Input?
- Yes.

234
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:18,146
I'm thinking of doing a Korean-style dish
for our new menu item,

235
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,397
but…

236
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,943
it's not going so well.

237
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:24,361
I'd appreciate your advice.

238
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:27,572
Of course.

239
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:33,078
Before that, may I ask you one thing?

240
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:34,663
Yes?

241
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:38,041
My name is Park Rin.

242
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,709
What is your name?

243
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,713
I'm Hase Taiga.

244
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,425
I'll call you Taiga then.

245
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:57,185
I want to use okra for its unique texture.

246
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:00,355
It's my first time seeing

247
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:01,690
- an okra.
- Huh?

248
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,067
You don't eat okra in Korea?

249
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:06,987
Do Koreans not like the slimy texture?

250
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:10,365
Slimy!

251
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:13,660
What does that mean?

252
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:15,745
Let's see…

253
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,873
Give me a second.

254
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:19,666
All right…

255
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:35,682
It's like this.

256
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:40,854
I see!

257
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:44,107
So this is what "slimy" means.

258
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,277
That's been bothering me.

259
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:51,698
Sorry, can I take a video?

260
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:53,575
Yes, of course.

261
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:56,953
It might help me with my assignment.

262
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:02,167
I'm in graduate school,
majoring in animation.

263
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,835
Animation?

264
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:05,795
That's cool.

265
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,883
I'm pursuing my dream.

266
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,720
What's your dream, Taiga?

267
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:14,804
What?

268
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:19,309
I like to hear about
other people's dreams.

269
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:25,190
I don't have a dream.

270
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:30,320
I'm only working here because I started
as a part-timer and never left.

271
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,865
So you're in training.

272
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,618
Just like me.

273
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,372
Let's do our best.

274
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,415
You can do it!

275
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:48,338
Oh, that's it.

276
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:51,466
Can you make a dish that even Koreans

277
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:53,760
who don't like slimy textures would enjoy?

278
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:57,973
That's a pretty tall order.

279
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:01,685
Oh, you will be able to do it, Taiga.

280
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:04,271
You're able to make
such delicious onigiri, after all.

281
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,358
It'll be fine.

282
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:10,527
I'm sure.

283
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:24,833
Okay. I'll give it a try.

284
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,173
Korean pancake with <i>natto.</i>

285
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:49,065
<i>Bibim-guksu</i> with <i>mekabu</i> seaweed.

286
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:17,677
Okra wrapped in <i>samgyeopsal.</i>

287
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,566
Thank you for the food.

288
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:37,947
I'm stuffed.

289
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:41,284
Thank you for today.

290
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:44,454
I have a good idea of what to do now.

291
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:47,582
No, thank you.

292
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:52,712
Make sure you let me know
when you've perfected the dish.

293
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:53,713
Yes.

294
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:06,935
In Korea, you add your own contact info
into the other person's phone.

295
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:41,678
I need to take out the trash
before I leave.

296
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:48,601
Okay. Bye then.

297
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,061
Want to go to that
<i>makgeolli</i> place we went to last time?

298
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,482
Sorry, I already ate.

299
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:37,442
Oh really?

300
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:39,736
Well, since I'm here,
I'll give you a ride home.

301
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:42,864
‪Let's go.

302
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:30,912
It's good.

303
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:35,792
- I'm impressed, Taiga.
- Thank you.

304
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:43,550
But for our customers, we might want
to bring down the spiciness a little bit.

305
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,553
Okay, I'll try that.

306
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:52,350
SECOND WOMEN'S DORM

307
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:54,894
It's already been a week,

308
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:58,606
and I still haven't received any word.

309
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:01,526
<i>I told you, "Don't think about it."</i>

310
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,362
<i>Japanese men</i>

311
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:08,366
<i>don't contact you</i>
<i>unless there is a reason to.</i>

312
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:13,997
Well then, how are you supposed to
get to know them better?

313
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:19,085
<i>You'll just have to take your time</i>
<i>with this one.</i>

314
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:23,548
<i>It may take at least half a year.</i>

315
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,508
Half a year?

316
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:30,847
<i>Who is it? Onigiri Man?</i>

317
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,893
KAEDE REAL ESTATE

318
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:56,831
HELLO, RIN
THANKS TO YOU, OUR NEW MENU ITEM IS SET

319
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:09,802
RIN - HOW ARE YOU DOING?

320
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,107
Taiga,

321
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,735
sorry for contacting you out of the blue.

322
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,613
No problem,
I was just leaving work anyway.

323
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:30,782
Also…

324
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,327
- I'm doing good.
- Huh?

325
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:37,372
Oh, I'm glad.

326
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,874
But… um…

327
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:43,795
I didn't hear from you, so I was worried.

328
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:46,673
I'm sorry.

329
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,927
It was officially added to the menu today,

330
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:53,721
- so I was going to contact you--
- That's not what I mean.

331
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:58,059
I mean keeping in touch
about normal, ordinary stuff.

332
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,814
Normal, ordinary stuff?

333
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:07,527
Sharing things about your everyday life,

334
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:10,822
like what you saw and what you ate.

335
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,909
In order to get to know each other.

336
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:19,872
But…

337
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:24,836
wouldn't that make your boyfriend upset?

338
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:26,587
Boyfriend?

339
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,257
The other day,

340
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:33,428
he came to pick you up from the restaurant
in his car.

341
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,390
Jun-ho!

342
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:40,560
He's just a friend.
I don't have a boyfriend!

343
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:55,408
Taiga, do you have a girlfriend?

344
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:01,998
No, I don't.

345
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:10,673
Rain…

346
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:18,931
- Let's run and find some shelter.
- Okay.

347
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,138
It's like <i>The Classic.</i>

348
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:02,767
<i>The Classic.</i>

349
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:07,230
This is like a scene
out of my favorite movie.

350
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:37,760
Wow!

351
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:04,787
Please, use this.

352
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,767
No, it's just… It's been a while

353
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,020
since I used a handkerchief.

354
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:31,689
Thank you.

355
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:46,829
It's strange…
I was feeling down just a minute ago,

356
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:51,459
but after running in the rain,
I feel much better.

357
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,923
Something's making you feel down?

358
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:04,847
Right now, I'm searching
for a new place to live, but…

359
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:08,434
my application was rejected.
