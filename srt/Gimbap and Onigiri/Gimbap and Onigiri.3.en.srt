Mom?

3
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:59,434
<i>Finally, you picked up!</i>

4
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:04,064
<i>I don't hear from you at all lately!</i>

5
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:07,025
How is your move going?

6
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:12,155
I'm working on it…

7
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:16,159
<i>Also, you don't need to come and help me</i>
<i>this time.</i>

8
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:20,163
You don't need me to go?

9
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:24,793
Yeah. It's so sudden, anyway.

10
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,545
I have school too, so…

11
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:30,924
How can you move all by yourself!

12
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,259
I'm really okay.

13
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,178
<i>I'll try to do what I can on my own.</i>

14
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,397
Your application was accepted.

15
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,445
Thank you.

16
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:55,281
I will get all the contracts ready
as fast as I can.

17
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:56,199
Okay.

18
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,163
I GOT THE APARTMENT

I HOPE I CAN SIGN THE CONTRACT ON MY OWN.

22
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,050
I'M NERVOUS. I SIGNED IT!

23
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,469

26
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,323
You should take a break when you can too.

27
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,366
Okay.

28
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:41,828
Shige.

29
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,622
How were this week's appetizers?

30
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,041
They were good.

31
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,713
I'll leave the appetizers
to you from now on.

32
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,008
- Okay! I'll do my best.
- Good.

I'M NERVOUS.

00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:11,274
I SIGNED IT!

39
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,719
<i>Communication issues, huh?</i>

40
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,559
<i>You'd better solve that</i>
<i>as soon as you can.</i>

41
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,023
<i>This isn't the first time, right?</i>

42
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,901
<i>Why are you ignoring the problem?</i>

43
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,155
If we take the time
to get to know each other,

44
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,783
won't these issues solve themselves?

45
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,368
<i>Park Rin.</i>

46
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:49,414
<i>Are you going to eat the onigiri</i>
<i>one grain of rice at a time?</i>

47
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:50,873
<i>At this rate,</i>

48
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:54,794
<i>you'll never find out</i>
<i>what the stuffing is.</i>

49
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:59,215
But we just started dating.

50
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,426
<i>If you're dating,</i>

51
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,304
<i>then stop stressing about it</i>
<i>all on your own,</i>

00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:07,015
<i>and sink your teeth into Onigiri Man!</i>

55
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,827
And ketchup for the pork chops.

56
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,371
- Okay.
- Here is the shopping list.

57
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,497
- Okay.
- Thanks.

58
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,583
Good evening.

59
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:38,171
Hey, Rin. Good to see you.

60
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,255
Welcome.

61
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:43,342
All right, then. Maybe I'll go home.

62
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:46,179
- I'll leave the rest to you.
- Okay. Good bye.

63
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:47,305
Bye.

00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,641

00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,358
Sorry for showing up so suddenly.

66
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,320
Just give me a second.

67
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,405
I'll be done soon. Come in.

68
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,418
I got my apartment.

69
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:22,548
What? That's great! Which one?

70
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:27,261
The last place we toured.

71
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:36,187
This place, huh?
That's great. Congratulations.

72
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,023
Thanks.

73
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:41,776
Wow…

74
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,196
What?

75
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,240
It's almost your birthday.

76
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,160
Yeah, it is.

77
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:58,292
I'll ask Shige if I can take that day off.

78
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,169
What? Really?

79
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,505
Let me celebrate it.

80
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,133
I'd love that.

81
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:08,803
But first, we have to celebrate
your new place.

82
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:10,596
Here it is.

83
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,182
How cute.

84
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,893
RAMEN - OPEN

85
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,437
What a cool place.

86
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,230
You've never been to a ramen stand?

87
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,400
But I've seen them in anime.

88
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:24,694
Welcome.

89
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:25,736
Let's sit down.

90
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,906
- For two, please.
- Two? Okay, have a seat.

91
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,952
- Two ramen and…
- Two ramen.

92
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,620
What do you want to drink?

93
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,039
I'll have a highball.

94
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,374
Two highballs please.

95
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,793
- Two highballs. Okay.
- Thank you.

96
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,470
Thanks for waiting. Here's your highball.

97
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,847
Thank you.

98
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,727
Well then, cheers.

99
00:07:58,227 --> 00:07:59,896
Cheers.

100
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:10,031
My photo of this stand is getting likes.

101
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:14,243
Social media?
Do you upload a lot of photos?

102
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,663
Things like food and doodles.

103
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,751
Did you draw that?

104
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,379
These are by an artist that I love.

105
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,341
Every piece is so unique.

106
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:29,759
I've been a long-time fan.

107
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,637
I see.

108
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,645
Anything else?

109
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:42,939
Do you want to ask me anything?

110
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,733
What?

111
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:51,113
I want you to get to know me better.

112
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:55,660
And I want to get to know you better too.

113
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,956
Did something happen?

114
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:07,046
Taiga, are you not that good
at keeping in touch?

115
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:16,097
When you don't read my messages,

116
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,099
or a day goes by without a word from you,

117
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:21,102
I start to wonder
if you have no interest in me.

118
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,021
I get worried.

119
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,865
Thanks for waiting. Here is your ramen.

120
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,534
NOODLE HOUSE MIYABI

121
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,619
Enjoy. Thanks for waiting.

122
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,538
- Here is your ramen.
- Thank you.

123
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,168
I'm sorry.

124
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:51,841
From now on,
I promise I'll contact you once a day.

125
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,722
Just once a day?

126
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,809
I didn't mean that literally.

127
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,104
What I mean is, I'll work on it.

128
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,236
Thank you.

129
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,865
Let's eat.

130
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,706
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

131
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:30,463
It's delicious.

132
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:37,928
Yeah, that's it.

133
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:42,850
Did you find it?

134
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:45,853
Thank goodness.

135
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,648
Can you hold onto it until the night?

136
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:50,775
Okay.

137
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:53,110
<i>Bye. Oh, wait.</i>

138
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:58,032
<i>Sorry, this might be really random, but…</i>

139
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:00,159
What? What is it?

140
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,161
<i>What kind of gift</i>

141
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:04,872
<i>would make you happy?</i>

142
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:06,290
Huh?

143
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:09,794
Well, it's almost Rin's birthday.

144
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,713
I was thinking about what to get,

145
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:16,092
but nothing really stood out.

146
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,013
Birthday, huh?

147
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:26,352
There's no point
if someone tells you what to get.

148
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:31,440
Wouldn't she be happy to get something
that comes from your heart?

149
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,234
<i>- You think so?</i>
- Yeah.

150
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:35,903
Well…

151
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:38,406
The beginning stages of dating
are always fun.

152
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:39,990
So take your time and think.

153
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:44,286
<i>I'll do that. Thanks. Bye.</i>

154
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,127
Mom.

155
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,963
Mom, wake up.

156
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:57,883
- Noa?
- Drink water.

00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,137

00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,066
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

162
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,860
Do you have this?

163
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:02,281
We don't carry that. I'm sorry.

164
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:03,324
I see.

165
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,409
Excuse me.

166
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,537
I'm looking for this book.

167
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:12,416
I guess it's out-of-print,
and I can't find it anywhere.

168
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,388
All right.

169
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:40,027
- It's <i>eomma…</i>
- You don't need to answer it?

170
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:44,615
It's okay. It'll be a nightmare
if she finds out you're here.

171
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,200
I'll call her back later.

172
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:52,498
Taiga.

173
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:56,085
Can I move your stuff over there?

174
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:57,962
I'll do it!

175
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,977
Helping her move, huh?

176
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:17,147
Taiga is so the type
to pamper his girlfriend.

177
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,528
Not like some boyfriends out there
who do slots on pay day.

178
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:23,445
Here.

179
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,947
- Have some <i>oshinko.</i>
- Thanks.

180
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:26,740
Welcome.

181
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:31,954
Go ahead and have a seat.

182
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,712
Please sit.

183
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,387
What is he saying?

184
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,764
He's asking if there's an English menu.

185
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,016
We don't have that.

186
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,684
Of course we don't.

187
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,854
He's saying something…

188
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:14,538
Delicious.

189
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,085
Good, good…

190
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,008
Thanks.

191
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,179
Should I make an English menu
or something?

192
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,681
That's true…

193
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:36,435
We get a lot of foreign customers lately,
so that would be great.

194
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,232
But don't expect too much.

195
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,652
- Of course I have high expectations.
- Don't.

196
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,320
In addition to English,

197
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:48,280
we need French,

198
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:51,241
- Italian, Spanish, Korean…
- No, no!

199
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,206
It's done!

200
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,043
Good work. Here.

201
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,461
Thank you.

202
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:11,387
This is my first time moving on my own.

203
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,556
So having you with me was very reassuring.

204
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,718
Hello, who's there?

205
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,272
Mom?!

206
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,649
<i>Rin, it's your birthday tomorrow, right?</i>

207
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,694
<i>So I came here to see you.</i>
<i>Hurry up and open the door!</i>

208
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,488
Give me a second.

209
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,491
My mom is here! What should I do?

210
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:17,953
- What?
- What should I do…

211
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,288
- Rin?
- Oh no…

212
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,791
This way.

213
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,213
I missed you, Rin!

214
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:31,300
Good to see you, Mom.

215
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,343
I missed you so much.

216
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:42,061
You pretty much got everything organized.

217
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:45,230
I booked a hotel,
because I thought it would be a mess.

218
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:48,233
But at this rate,
I can stay here from tonight.

219
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:52,571
Rin, where's your bedroom? That way?

220
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:57,076
Mom! Mom!

221
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:02,706
What a nice room. It's so fluffy.

222
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,459
Rin, where's your extra futon?

223
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:07,669
Over here?

224
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:12,049
- Mom!
- What?

225
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:22,518
I'm so hungry…

226
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:26,522
Oh, you were hungry? Let's eat then!

227
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:29,566
But you know,

228
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,819
I'm so glad.

229
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,529
I was worried

230
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:37,574
that you had found
a boyfriend or something.

231
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,451
I'm so relieved.

232
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,291
I'm sorry.

233
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:55,676
I put in extra sesame oil,
just how you like it.

234
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,527
It smells good.

235
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,782
She's in the bathroom, so go now.

236
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:19,783
Huh?

237
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,829
H… Hey… wait…

238
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,747
Should we be sneaking around like this?

239
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,250
Shouldn't I introduce myself properly?

240
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,169
Are you crazy?

241
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,046
Please, leave.

242
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,215
What about your birthday?

243
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:38,635
That… I want to spend with you
no matter what.

244
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,596
I'll contact you as soon as she leaves.

245
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:41,680
I promise.

246
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,349
She's coming out! Hurry!

247
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,934
Shoes, shoes, shoes!

248
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,416
You like this, right?

249
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:13,212
Here, eat the omelet too.

250
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,048
How is school?

251
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:21,595
Are you enjoying school?

252
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:27,476
Are you studying like you should be?

253
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:30,437
There's someone in my class
who's really good.

254
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:35,234
And that person is inspiring me.

255
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:42,699
Sometimes I wonder if I have any talent,
and get a little discouraged, though.

256
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,620
But I just have to do my best!

257
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:54,378
I guess the road to becoming
a creator is a tough one…

258
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:20,404
Shige? Is something wrong?

259
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:21,738
So, so, so sorry.

260
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,992
I completely forgot that we had
a reservation for a big group.

261
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:28,620
Can I ask you to come in,
just for two hours?

262
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,206
<i>What? Now?</i>

263
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,332
Excuse me.

264
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,750
<i>Yes, one moment please.</i>

265
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,089
I think I can come in.

266
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:42,092
<i>Really? You're a lifesaver. Hurry, please.</i>

267
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,137
Okay.

268
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,164
Noa.

269
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:17,627
- I haven't gotten paid yet, so no.
- Are you serious?

270
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:26,094
What is that? English?

271
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,345
Are you traveling?

272
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:31,016
Not traveling, but…

273
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:35,145
Vegas would be awesome.
The land of the free.

274
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,859
But I'd be happy to go anywhere,
as long as I'm with you.

275
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:48,366
But in order to do that,
we need to win first.

276
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:52,746
Just one, okay?

277
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:53,830
- Really?
- Yes.

278
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,129
Paw.

279
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,007
- Aren't you going to bark?
- Woof!

280
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:08,720
You're the best girlfriend!

281
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,180
All right, all right.

282
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:11,932
- Can I go?
- Sure.

283
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:14,726
- I will win, I promise.
- Yeah, yeah…

284
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:15,727
Bye!

285
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:26,780
That was delicious.

286
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,244
I'm sorry, Mom.

287
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,373
I'm really happy that you're here,

288
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:40,544
but I still haven't finished my assignment
that's due today…

289
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,838
Really?

290
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:47,592
My goodness,
you should've told me that earlier.

291
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:52,389
After I clean this all up,
I'll go back to my hotel.

292
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:54,558
You don't have to worry about me.

293
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:58,728
You work hard on your assignment! Okay?

294
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:10,907
I'm so sorry, Mom.

295
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,202
Thank you for waiting.

296
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,246
- Here's your <i>karaage.</i>
- Can you take our order?

297
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:18,498
- Yes.
- The seasonal carpaccio please.

298
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,333
- One carpaccio.
- That's all.

299
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,220
Taiga!

300
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,723
Can you make that order?

301
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,183
Okay.

302
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:38,143
Here's your omelet.

303
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:40,103
RIN

304
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:55,952
Taiga?

305
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,376
Is he mad?

306
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,008
SORRY FOR MAKING YOU WAIT
YOU CAN COME OVER NOW

307
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:12,344
WHERE ARE YOU?

308
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,806
You promised…

309
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,202
- Excuse me!
- Yes!

310
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,346
LEE YUNGYEOL: HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
MIZUKI: RIN - HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

311
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:57,472
JUNHO: HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

312
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:58,473
LEE HAEUN: HAPPY BIRTHDAY, RIN!
TODAY IS YOUR DAY!

313
00:25:58,556 --> 00:25:59,724
MAMAMON: HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MY GIRL!
I'LL LOVE YOU FOREVER!

314
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,101
YUN CHAEWON: IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY! WOW!
WHEN WILL WE HAVE THE PARTY?

315
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:02,727
TAIGA

316
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,312
SORRY FOR MAKING YOU WAIT
YOU CAN COME OVER NOW

317
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,689
WHERE ARE YOU?

318
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,108
Why?

319
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,040
Unbelievable!

320
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:26,584
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

321
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,086
Thank you.

322
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,550
Finally, they're gone.

323
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,928
Thanks so much for today.

324
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,471
- You really saved me.
- No worries.

325
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,812
RIN

326
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:48,148
Oh crap!

327
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,363
TAIGA

328
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,119
TOMORROW - I'LL GO
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING

329
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,699
Happy birthday!

330
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,837
Why didn't you say anything?

331
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:54,631
What?

332
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:57,884
I was waiting for you the whole time.

333
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:01,888
I messaged you as soon as <i>eomma</i> left.
I was looking forward to it!

334
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,765
Sorry.

335
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:07,310
I noticed around midnight

336
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,979
and called you right away…

337
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,608
Why didn't you
check your phone until then?

338
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,861
I was busy at work.

339
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,947
What? You said you had the day off.

340
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,031
Well…

341
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,826
I was asked to work that evening.

342
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:27,580
Tell me those kinds of things.
Why didn't you say anything?

343
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:28,998
That's because…

344
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:34,879
I thought you were having fun
with your mom.

345
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,927
I'm sorry about <i>eomma</i> coming…

346
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:47,642
But I wanted to be with you
when it became my birthday.

347
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,648
When you like someone,
don't you naturally want to talk to them?

348
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,568
Not just once a day,
or because you have to.

349
00:28:57,318 --> 00:29:00,155
- You can't even put in that effort for me.
- Wait.

350
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,908
I'm sorry for not telling you.

351
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:07,495
- But that has nothing to do with--
- It does!

352
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,832
I like to hear from you.

353
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,168
And when you put in the effort,
it makes me happy.

354
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:15,503
Why don't you get that?

355
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:29,225
All my friends from Korea
contacted me at midnight.

356
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:34,105
That is how important
birthdays are to them.

357
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,819
How was I supposed to know…

358
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,908
Don't push your standards on me.

359
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:57,545
Fine. Whatever.

360
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:57,438
Here's your water.

361
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,149
TANOMI

362
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:01,651
Hello.

363
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,069
Oh, what's wrong?

364
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:06,406
Plans have changed, so can I work today?

365
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:07,532
Changed?

366
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,702
I see…

367
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:13,288
Sorry, that was my fault.

368
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:15,874
No, it's not your fault, Shige.

369
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,461
Maybe it is difficult for two people

370
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,214
from different backgrounds to be together?

371
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:28,803
You two are separate human beings,
so running into problems

372
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,430
is to be expected.

373
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:33,975
It's not convincing,
coming from a single guy, huh?

374
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:40,064
What do you think was the problem?

375
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:48,031
I can't seem to keep up with her.

376
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,909
She wants to communicate regularly,

377
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,952
but I don't understand that concept.

378
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:56,915
Of course, it can't be helped
that we're from different cultures.

379
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:59,459
And I thought
that it wouldn't matter, but…

380
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:04,047
Why did Rin say that she wants
to communicate regularly?

381
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:07,592
She said…

382
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:11,679
she wants me to know more about her.

383
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:19,228
Then I don't think it's the lack
of communication that she's mad about.

384
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:28,029
It's okay to run into problems.

385
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:45,338
Shige.

386
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,549
Can I take today off, after all?

387
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,511
Sure. Good luck.

388
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:02,457
Rin.

389
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:04,375
Taiga…

390
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,883
Hey, wait!

391
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:14,469
Rin!

392
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:49,670
I'm sorry…

393
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:56,969
I couldn't celebrate
your birthday with you.

394
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:04,310
If I had communicated with you,
this wouldn't have happened.

395
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:33,589
I'm sorry too.

396
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,884
I was only thinking about myself.

397
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:40,138
I wasn't thinking about your feelings.

398
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,898
Your present…

399
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,150
I loved it.

400
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:55,319
I barely told you about it…

401
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,488
But you remembered?

402
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:04,078
When you said that you're a big fan,
your eyes were sparkling.

403
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,123
I could tell you really liked it.

404
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,878
You were trying
to get to know me, after all.

405
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:19,886
Lately,

406
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,597
when I'm cooking,

407
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,558
I think of you.

408
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:31,439
"Will she like this,
if I make this for her?"

409
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:36,736
"What would she say
if I sent a photo of this to her?"

410
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,073
I should have

411
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:44,744
told you all these things.

412
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:50,333
We can talk to each other any time.
We're dating, after all.

413
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:05,223
From now on…

414
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:09,560
I want to know more about

415
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,188
the things you value.

416
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:16,859
Thank you.

417
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:20,446
Me too.

418
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:35,521
<i>Welcome home, Taiga.</i>

419
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:37,940
Don't get the wrong idea.
Anyone can do that.

420
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:41,193
<i>I wasn't able to live up to my</i>
<i>family's expectations.</i>

421
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,945
I don't think so!

422
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:43,904
