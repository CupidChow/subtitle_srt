1
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:07,507
Come on, Taiga!

2
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,426
Don't fall behind!

3
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,555
Keep up or you'll lose!

4
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:20,353
Even if our ace runner buys us time,
there's no point

5
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,939
if everyone else wastes it.

6
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:25,650
Taiga.

7
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:29,195
You're off the team.

8
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:36,202
<i>- Man, that's brutal.</i>
<i>- Poor guy.</i>

9
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,746
<i>He didn't make it after all.</i>

10
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,790
‪TANOMI

11
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:06,126
So you're going
to tour properties together?

12
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:10,880
Yeah. We're going on our next day off.

13
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,509
You don't waste any time, huh?

14
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:16,219
It's not what you're thinking.

15
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:19,722
I'm only going for moral support.

16
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,724
Are you stupid?

17
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,894
You think she'd tour properties with a guy
who's not her parent or boyfriend?

18
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:30,859
You think so?

19
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,527
- Shige.
- Huh?

20
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,529
Taiga is about to get a girlfriend.

21
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:37,407
- Noa! It's not like that!
- I didn't expect that.

22
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,908
Like I said, it's not like that.

23
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,704
And plus, even if it was,

24
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:44,581
our relationship wouldn't go anywhere.

25
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,332
Why?

26
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,794
She's an international student from Korea,

27
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:52,463
so she shouldn't be with someone like me.

28
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,465
Someone like you?

29
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:55,925
I mean…

30
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,845
Someone with no future.

31
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,849
<i>So you're saying</i>

32
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,935
that a restaurant employee
is going to accompany you?

33
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:12,150
Yes, um…

34
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:14,819
Kind of like a Japanese advisor.

35
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,699
Taiga isn't suspicious at all.

36
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:22,410
He came with me
out of the kindness of his heart.

37
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:23,328
‪KAEDE REAL ESTATE

38
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,537
All right.

39
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:28,750
Well then, let me suggest some
properties that might fit your taste.

40
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,251
Thank you.

41
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:34,797
I picked out a few
that fit your requirements.

42
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:35,840
In your case,

43
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:40,637
the trickiest part
is that you have to move out in one year.

44
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,515
Well, why don't we take
a tour of them first?

45
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,314
Well…

46
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,776
You're leaving in a year, huh?

47
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,361
Yes.

48
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:58,821
If I can actually graduate, that is.

49
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,617
My student visa is going to expire,

50
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,746
so I can't stay in Japan
unless I start working.

51
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,414
Oh, your visa?

52
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:11,209
Wow, that's amazing.

53
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,795
Amazing?

54
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,089
What about it is amazing?

55
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,261
Well, just talking about visas and stuff

56
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,471
is amazing from my point of view.

57
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,141
It's like you're talking about
a whole different world.

58
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:29,686
There's nothing amazing about it.

59
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:33,064
International students
all stay here with student visas,

60
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:35,358
and go back to Korea once they graduate.

61
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:37,360
I see…

62
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,445
Of course…

63
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,072
Before that,

64
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:44,075
I hope I can cross things
off my bucket list.

65
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:46,869
Bucket list?

66
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:49,372
Yes.

67
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:54,627
A list of things that I want to do
before I die.

68
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,672
One item on my bucket list

69
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:00,758
is to try every kind
of Japanese convenience store snack.

70
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:02,885
I see.

71
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:04,929
Interesting.

72
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:08,141
Why don't you make one too?

73
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:09,225
What?

74
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:12,353
I don't think that's necessary.

75
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,105
You agree, right Noa?

76
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:16,524
But your daughter
is in middle school, right?

77
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,819
Then I guess she'd want a new device.

78
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:22,363
As long as I can make a call,
that's enough for me.

79
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,407
They're all the same, no?

80
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,659
They are not all the same.

81
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,578
The image quality and stuff are different.

82
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:29,996
You think so?

83
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:35,001
So your labor right now is going to turn
into your daughter's smartphone?

84
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:37,712
That's right. It's ridiculous.

85
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:41,507
I wish she'd just keep using
the one she's used to.

86
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:58,524
I don't know… It's pretty nice but…

87
00:05:58,608 --> 00:05:59,984
What do you think?

88
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,450
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

89
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:11,871
Does a lot of smoke rise up
from the restaurants below?

90
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,793
I don't think it'll be a problem,

91
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:18,961
but I can ask about it.

92
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,088
Okay, thank you.

93
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,093
The placement of the exhaust fans
might be an issue.

94
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,679
I didn't notice that at all.

95
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:37,814
Oh, Taiga.

96
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,859
- Can I ask you something?
- Yes.

97
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:45,655
This room doesn't have a refrigerator
or washing machine or anything.

98
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:49,826
Rooms in Korea usually come
with appliances.

99
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,285
Oh really?

100
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,539
Well, it's not like
anything is wrong here.

101
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:57,333
In Japan, this is normal.

102
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,127
Oh, good.

103
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,672
If you have any questions,
don't hesitate to ask me.

104
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,341
Thank you.

105
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:11,931
These windows are cute!

106
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,644
The kitchen is big too.

107
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:20,398
I like this place.

108
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,777
This is a really nice place.

109
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:29,115
I agree. The rent is not too high either.

110
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,033
I like it a lot.

111
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,744
I think my mind is set on this one.

112
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,414
Wait a second.

113
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,721
No issues with the security either.

114
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,022
Thank you for today.

115
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:03,566
I found a nice place thanks to you.

116
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,443
I didn't do anything.

117
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,904
I'm glad you found a place.

118
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:13,117
I hope they accept my application.

119
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,955
It'll be fine. I'm sure.

120
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,172
Taiga.

121
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,675
Today, I…

122
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:33,012
had a lot of fun.

123
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:39,101
Looking at houses is fun, isn't it?

124
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,233
Um…

125
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:51,614
STRAWBERRY CARAMEL

126
00:08:57,411 --> 00:09:00,456
This is a thank you gift for today.

127
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,624
Here you go.

128
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,883
Thank you.

129
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,099
Well, see you…

130
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,643
Right…

131
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:25,606
Well then… See you.

132
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,683
<i>You should give up on Onigiri Man.</i>

133
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,935
We had a good vibe,

134
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,770
so why didn't he ask me out
on another date?

135
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,648
Did I do something wrong?

136
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,567
<i>That's not it.</i>

137
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,861
<i>Didn't I tell you before?</i>

138
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,739
<i>Japanese men are extremely reserved</i>

139
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:18,367
<i>when it comes to expressing</i>
<i>their feelings.</i>

140
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,578
Isn't that just your opinion?

141
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,663
<i>Park Rin!</i>

142
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,124
<i>How many times do I have to tell you?</i>

143
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,753
<i>I am a professional content buyer, okay?</i>

144
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:33,633
<i>I've watched</i>
<i>all the movies and dramas to death.</i>

145
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,301
But dramas are just dramas.

146
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,218
<i>What are you saying!</i>

147
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:41,599
<i>Dramas reflect</i>
<i>the culture of that country.</i>

148
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:43,517
<i>According to my database,</i>

149
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:47,647
<i>main characters in Japanese dramas</i>
<i>are more sensitive.</i>

150
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:52,693
<i>In many stories, they overthink everything</i>
<i>and don't even get together in the end.</i>

151
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,029
Really?

152
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,198
<i>Yes.</i>

153
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:03,454
<i>Dating someone of a different nationality</i>
<i>isn't easy.</i>

154
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,414
<i>So don't try to rush into it</i>
<i>unnecessarily.</i>

155
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,502
Yeah?

156
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,629
<i>Park Rin.</i>

157
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,381
<i>If you keep acting like that,</i>

158
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,925
- <i>I will tell your mother.</i>
- Don't you dare!

159
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:20,012
Fine. I'll stop.

160
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,475
I'm here to study, after all.

161
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:26,018
<i>That's right.</i>

162
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,605
<i>I have to go. Bye!</i>

163
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,732
Enjoy the party.

164
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,654
- How has your mother been lately?
- Who knows?

165
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:40,241
I'm sure she's having fun with a guy,
as usual.

166
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,284
It's okay, I'll do it myself.

167
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,413
She'll show up when she feels like it.

168
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,165
You're okay with that?

169
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,795
I don't have any other choice, do I?

170
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,131
More importantly,

171
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,800
are you serious about what you said?

172
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:02,054
Well, ever since I started,
I've been preparing myself

173
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:06,308
for the possibility of closing
the restaurant when I retire.

174
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:12,440
Hey, if you're going to retire,

175
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:14,817
why not have Taiga take over?

176
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:18,195
That would be a lot to ask of him.

177
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:19,613
You think so?

178
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,540
I didn't pass the contest again.

179
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,417
What about you?

180
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,335
I didn't make it either.

181
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:40,176
I heard Amane

182
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:43,179
is going to have her solo exhibition
in New York.

183
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:44,763
She's making figurines too.

184
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:47,766
Wow.

185
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,227
When you have that much talent,

186
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,979
I bet you don't
have to worry about your future.

187
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:55,274
After graduating, she can just go
straight into the professional world.

188
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,361
I have to decide on what to do myself.

189
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:04,033
Rin, you're going back to Korea
and not finding a job over here, right?

190
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:08,537
For the most part, that's my plan…

191
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,706
I'm so jealous.

192
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:13,709
Maybe I'll follow you and go to Korea too?

193
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:14,919
Just kidding.

194
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,396
Thank you for the food.

195
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:44,698
That's delicious.

196
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,119
What is this dish called?

197
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:52,706
Today, it's Pacific Barrelfish
cooked in a bamboo steamer.

198
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,751
It's a white fish,
but it's nice and fatty, right?

199
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:59,421
When it's freshly caught,
the skin is greasy.

200
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,798
Greasy?

201
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:05,135
Is that different from "slimy"?

202
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:07,805
Well, it's basically in the same family.

203
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:10,933
You're so knowledgeable.
You're amazing, Master.

204
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:14,228
A cook should be knowledgeable
about his ingredients.

205
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:18,399
Even when I go to an aquarium,
I know almost all the fish there.

206
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:19,942
Really? Wow.

207
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:25,114
That reminds me…
I haven't been to an aquarium in ages.

208
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,365
Oh really?

209
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,201
You should have someone take you.

210
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:35,082
Hey.

211
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:37,126
If you want to, just ask her.

212
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,420
What are you talking about?

213
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:42,298
You've been staring at her the whole time.

214
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:46,218
- I was not staring.
- You were staring at her like a creep.

215
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,387
You were eavesdropping too, right?

216
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,390
Hurry up and take this chance.

217
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:57,396
But she said she's going back
to Korea in a year.

218
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,899
Even if I ask her to go with me,
it'll only trouble her.

219
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,692
Yeah, yeah… Just go!

220
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:08,991
Um…

221
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:10,868
Yes?

222
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:16,081
I overheard
that you haven't been to an aquarium.

223
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:17,791
Yes.

224
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,044
I haven't been to one since I was a child.

225
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,506
If you…

226
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:29,595
happen to have a day
where you have absolutely nothing to do,

227
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:33,265
- would you like to go to an aquarium--
- Yes.

228
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,560
Huh? Really?

229
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,812
I'd love to go.

230
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,606
Let's go together.

231
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,619
AKINORI: I'M OUT OF MONEY!
COME TO THE PACHINKO PARLOR!

232
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,207
Yes.

233
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,428
How is it going?

234
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,597
I'm definitely going to win big.

235
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:14,890
I know it.

236
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,558
- Really?
- Yeah.

237
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,061
No doubt about it.

238
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,564
Please?

239
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,112
Fine…

240
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:30,906
‪10000 YEN

241
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,243
- Here.
- Thank you, Noa.

242
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,662
Let's go eat <i>yakiniku</i> or sushi today.

243
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:40,082
- All right. I'll look forward to it.
- Okay.

244
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,625
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

245
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,633
All right!

246
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:04,481
HOW ABOUT THIS AQUARIUM?

247
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:09,445
DOES THE 24TH OR 25TH WORK FOR YOU?

248
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,448
AQUA WORLD

249
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,662
It's pretty big.

250
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,331
The sea lion show is once every two hours.

251
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,916
So start with penguins…

252
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,587
And after that…

253
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,395
BIG BRO - I WAS PROMOTED TO SECTION CHIEF

254
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,938

<i>Taiga. You're off the team.</i>

<i>He got an endorsement and he's a reserve?</i>

257
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,864
<i>Are you going to Tokyo to run away?</i>

258
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:55,074
<i>Are you really sure?</i>

259
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,700
<i>He didn't make it after all.</i>

260
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:13,550

261
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,969

PENGUIN POOL - SEA LION SHOW

264
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,909
I'm sorry. Did I make you wait?

265
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,744
Oh, no. Not at all.

266
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,080
Ready to go?

267
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:44,790
Yes.

268
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:58,804
Pretty…

269
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,765
Did you want to see any specific fish?

270
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:06,728
I want to see that thing…

271
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,397
<i>Gaoli.</i>

272
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,523
Kaoli?

273
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,484
Um…

274
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:16,280
Oh, right. A ray.

275
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,449
A ray?

276
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,451
I want to see the underside of a ray.

277
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:23,954
Is that called their underside?

278
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,747
It's not?

279
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,709
It looks like a face
and it's kind of cute.

280
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,210
They're always smiling.

281
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,964
Let's make sure we see the rays then.

282
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,799
I'll guide you through the facility,

283
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,467
so you just enjoy yourself.

284
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,136
Thank you.

285
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:42,848
But…

286
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,605
I want to enjoy it with you.

287
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,400
Yes.

288
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,402
Of course, me too.

289
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,947
Wow! Penguins?

290
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:02,451
Yes. It's a popular attraction,
and a lot of them swim in the pool.

291
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,078
I saw it on their homepage,
and they were really cute.

292
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,413
- Really?
- Yes.

293
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:08,040
I can't wait to see.

294
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,000
This is the penguin area.

295

‪HUMBOLDT PENGUIN

296
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,761
Where are the penguins?

297
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:29,895
They're not here, huh?

298
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,521
Are they on break?

299
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,364
There's a sea lion show. Want to see that?

300
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,366
Sea lions are really smart and cute.

301
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,826
Yeah. I'm excited.

302
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,246
- It's this way.
- Okay.

303
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,626
How do you say sea lion in Korean?

304
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,586
<i>Mulgae.</i>

305
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,796

- We will make an announcement soon.
- <i>Mulgae.</i>

307
00:20:58,674 --> 00:20:59,967
We're very sorry.

308
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,178
We apologize.

309
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,346
Excuse me.

310
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,974
We're sorry, but there were some
issues with the tank.

311
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,767
So we're trying to repair it now.

312
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,644
What? Oh no…

313
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:11,895
We're terribly sorry.

314
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,563
What should we do?

315
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:19,069
This aquarium is famous
for their special drink. Want to try it?

316
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:22,114
- Sounds good.
- It's this way.

00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,702
How cute!

319
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:30,789
I'm sorry. We just ran out
of the Penguin Soda.

320
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:34,376
You've got to be kidding.
We came here expecting to buy this.

321
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,961
You think it's some joke?

322
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:38,213
You didn't even do the sea lion show.

323
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,842
I can't believe we had to pay
the same entrance fee.

324
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:43,844
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

325
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,263
I'm very sorry.

Hello, can you take our order?

00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:52,269
I'm sorry,
we're out of our special Penguin Soda.

328
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:55,188
No worries. Must be tough, huh?

329
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,331
I'm sorry.

330
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:15,208
It's not going as planned at all.

331
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:16,543
No…

332
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:20,797
I appreciate how much thought
you put into it.

333
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,304
The sea lion show…

334
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:29,473
I hope it reopens soon.

Sorry, I was kind of busy.

00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:57,959
<i>Mom fell at home and hurt herself.</i>

340

What?

341
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,088
Is she all right?

342
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:04,007
<i>Yeah, they're taking</i>
<i>a look at her at the hospital.</i>

343
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,634
<i>It wasn't anything serious.</i>

344
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,470
Thank goodness.

00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:11,515
<i>You know,</i>

346
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:14,351
<i>why aren't you looking after the family?</i>

347
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:15,977
<i>Why do I have to take time off work?</i>

348
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,064
Sorry…

349
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,735
<i>Whatever… We'll take care of it.</i>

00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,448
Thank you.

<i>You're not young anymore,</i>
<i>so enough of this "self-discovery" stuff.</i>

<i>Bye.</i>

353
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:45,048
<i>An announcement to all guests.</i>

<i>We are terribly sorry,</i>

<i>but today's sea lion show</i>
<i>will be canceled.</i>

00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:11,074
I wish I could've seen
the sea lions with you.

360
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:12,909
Too bad.

361
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:17,789
I'm sorry.

362
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,835
This aquarium was supposed to be more fun.

363
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,796
It's not your fault, Taiga.

364
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:27,424
Well,

365
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:30,135
I'm used to this, anyway.

366
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:33,096
Used to what?

367
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:40,228
Things not going according to plan.

368
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:46,026
It's true that we've been
out of luck this whole day.

369
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:51,239
But halfway through, I started to wonder,
"What's going to happen next?"

370
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,658
And that was actually exciting.

371
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:58,371
It's not that I don't have a plan.

372
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:02,500
I just can't seem
to follow through with it.

373
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:11,676
Nothing in my life
has ever gone according to plan.

374
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,059
Compared to that,

375
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,645
you are amazing, Rin.

376
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:24,189
Why is that?

377
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:26,483
You came to a foreign country on your own,

378
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:30,487
and you're moving forward
toward your dream.

379
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,406
You have the ability to take action,

380
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,325
and you have courage.

381
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:41,456
Did you try making a bucket list?

382
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:43,583
What?

383
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,504
I don't have any dreams or anything.

384
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,508
It doesn't have to be
something serious like that.

385
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:56,972
Bucket lists can also help you find goals.

386
00:25:58,098 --> 00:25:59,975
The truth is,

387
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,269
I set up a goal for myself today.

388
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,690
Since you always cook for me,

389
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,401
I wanted to cook for you today.

390
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:13,530
But it was really hard.

391
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:16,366
Take a look.

392
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:24,040
Wow. They're huge.

393
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,876
I thought that might make you happier.

394
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:32,048
I'm still working on it.

395
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,763
But I did my best.

396
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,363
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

397
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:11,212
- It's good.
- Really?

398
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:14,549
Yes.

399
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:16,634
I'm glad.

400
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:21,306
It's good.

401
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:26,269
It's really good.

402
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,271
Thank you.

403
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:40,533
<i>Thank you very much for visiting today.</i>

404
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,620
<i>We will be closing soon.</i>

405
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,330
<i>We look forward to…</i>

406
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,169
Taiga! We don't have to go out of our way!

407
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:53,880
No! We should see the rays.

408
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:55,924
They're in the biggest tank.

409
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,968
We're almost there.

410
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:00,303
‪CREATURES OF OARAI

411
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,891
Excuse me. Can we go inside?

412
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:06,976
Sorry, we closed it off.

413
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,604
Please, let us in!

414
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:12,273
Rules are rules. Sorry.

415
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:15,568
Is there no way?
I really want her to see the rays.

416
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,570
We'll leave as soon as we see them.

417
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:21,366
Once we let a guest in,
the employees have to stay behind.

418
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,411
Right…

419
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,664
Sorry for troubling you.

420
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:29,040
Sorry about that.

421
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,918
Okay, good bye.

422
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,005
Wait, Sir.

423
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:42,220
I'll go patrol the other areas,
so during that time,

424
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:43,513
you can go inside.

425
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,517
Thank you!

426
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:49,936
There it is!

427
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:51,521
<i>Gaoli.</i> Ray.

428
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:54,232
How cute!

429
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,946
I'm so glad you got to see it.

430
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,245
Wow…

431
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:10,039
We have this place all to ourselves.

432
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:15,378
We do.

433
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:45,074
- Taiga.
- Hey…

434
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:51,039
There is something I want to tell you.

435
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:55,585
Yes?

436
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,012
- Taiga, I--
- Today,

437
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,476
this date didn't go as planned at all,

438
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:16,648
and I felt like more and more
of a failure.

439
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:22,779
But when I'm with you,

440
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:27,784
I feel a weight off my shoulders.

441
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:33,540
I feel like I can move forward.

442
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,304
I…

443
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:52,183
like you,

444
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,436
Rin.

445
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,948
Will you please go out with me?

446
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:12,704
Yes.

447
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,144
Oh, that reminds me.

448
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:39,063
I'll give this back to you.

449
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:42,609
Thank you.

450
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,904
But why now?

451
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:50,783
Because now I don't need an excuse
to see you anymore.

452
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:55,121
Thank you.

453
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:12,305
I can't believe we're dating!

454
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,767
Oh my god! What do I do?

455
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:29,781
JUN-HO! BIG NEWS!

456
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:33,660
‪TANOMI

457
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:35,954
You'll definitely love this place.

458
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,246
Really?

459
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,247
I can't wait.

460
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,836
I'll leave it up to you.
When you're done, I'll taste it.

461
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,005
Okay. Thank you.

462
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:50,677
- Good evening.
- Welcome.

463
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,470
You came?

464
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:55,848
Taiga, sorry for interrupting your work.
Do you have a second?

465
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,475
Yes, he does.

466
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:00,603
You do.

467
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,193
Jun-ho.

468
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:17,954
Hello. I'm Kang Jun-ho, Rin's senior.

469
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:19,455
Nice to meet you.

470
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:23,918
Jun-ho?

471
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:26,546
Nice to meet you.

472
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,756
I'm Hase Taiga.

473
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:32,427
He's been helping me since
I was going to college in Korea,

474
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,262
so we've known each other for a long time.

475
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:37,640
I confide in him a lot.
He's like a dependable older brother.

476
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:40,476
Oh, really? From college?

477
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:43,980
And this is…

478
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:48,901
my boyfriend, Taiga.

479
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:56,993
He looks nice.

480
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,244
Right?

481
00:33:58,327 --> 00:33:59,829
He's a really good cook too.

482
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:03,041
Let's have drinks together,

483
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,334
and eat Taiga's cooking today.

484
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:12,091
Rin, I'm sorry.

485
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:16,220
There's an emergency
and I have to go back to work.

486
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,014
But you said you finished work…

487
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:20,933
There was some kind of trouble
and they need me in a hurry.

488
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:22,685
I'm really sorry.

489
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,105
He said he needs to rush back to work.

490
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:27,023
What?

491
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:29,317
I wanted to formally
introduce you guys, but…

492
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,234
I'll go now.

493
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,496
Bye.

494
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,141
That's hot!

495
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,067
What's wrong?

496
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,820
Were you dumped by a girl or something?

497
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:18,116
Yes. Is it that obvious?

498
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:20,409
Wow, I was right.

499
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:23,955
What? Why were you dumped?
You're so good looking.

500
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:25,581
Did she have a man already?

501
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:33,923
You just have to steal her away.

502
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:35,591
I can't do that.

503
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:38,427
That would make me the worst type of man…

504
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,893
It's okay! It's okay!

505
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,854
That was delicious.

506
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:50,106
Your cooking is the best.

507
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:51,107
Thank you.

508
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,568
You really surprised me today, though.

509
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:57,280
I didn't think you would
bring Jun-ho out of the blue.

510
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,157
What?

511
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:03,327
I thought it was normal
to introduce my boyfriend to my friend.

512
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:05,079
Was that weird?

513
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,914
Not at all.

514
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,918
I'm happy you introduced me
to your senior.

515
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,420
Okay, good.

516
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:14,839
From now on,

517
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:19,719
let's tell each other whenever something
doesn't feel right.

518
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:23,139
Of course.

519
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:26,851
- I promise.
- Don't forget it.

520
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,204
There.

521
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,462
The bucket list thing…

522
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,506
I'm thinking of doing it too.

523
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,425
What?

524
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:01,344
You found a goal?

525
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,050
This.

526
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:55,022
That's not what a bucket list is.

527
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:57,400
Really?

528
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:05,241
A kiss isn't a life goal, is it?

529
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,118
That's true.

530
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:08,995
You're so funny.

531
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,247
That's embarrassing.

532
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:14,625
Yeah, it's embarrassing.

533
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:18,504
But it made me happy.

534
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,262
How embarrassing.

535
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,725
Are you embarrassed?

536
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:31,851
So cute.

537
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,186
Whatever.
