1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,380
Have you known a guy named Win?

2
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:13,080
Is he a friend of yours?

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,630
He comes to see me all the time,

4
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,420
But I still have no idea

5
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,710
how he truly feels about me.

6
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,080
Your favorite type

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,130
have never escaped my keen eyes.

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,830
Pete the new nurse, right?

9
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:24,960
The hospital rules:

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,540
You mustn't go out alone at night.

11
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:29,210
Someone will come.

12
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,670
You better tell me

13
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,290
who that nurse ghost was.

14
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:33,830
Are you sure

15
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:35,960
you have never seen her before?

16
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,630
Hello, Mr.Alan.

17
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:40,500
Hello, Mr.Alan.

18
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,710
Hello, Mr.Alan.

19
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,380
Hello, Mr.Alan.

20
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,789
Hello, Mr.Alan.

21
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,880
Hello, Mr.Alan.

22
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,080
Hello, Mr.Alan.

23
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,079
Hello, Mr.Alan.

24
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,750
Mr.Alan.

25
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:21,790
Mr. Alan.

26
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,040
Mr. Alan.

27
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,880
The patient is in a critical state.

28
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,500
Hurry up, follow me.

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Hurry.

30
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,380
Remember.

31
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,710
Come back to me.

32
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:02,540
Remember.

33
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:03,790
Come back.

34
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,080
Remember.

35
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,290
- Remember.
- Leave me alone.

36
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,330
Remember.

37
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,130
Remember.

38
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,830
Remember.

39
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,750
Remember.

40
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,250
Remember.

41
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,460
Come back to me.

42
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,500
Remember.

43
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,960
Remember.

44
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,420
Remember.

45
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,420
Come back to me.

46
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,540
Remember.

47
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:21,829
Come back to me.

48
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,329
Remember!

49
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:49,790
Pete?

50
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,500
Easy, Alan.

51
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,580
Drink plenty of water.

52
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,460
You were likely dehydrated

53
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,080
so you passed out.

54
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,130
Easy there.

55
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:24,710
Alan.

56
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:27,380
What were you doing on
the third-floor staircase?

57
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,040
What were you doing up there?

58
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,170
Third floor?

59
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,580
I followed the nurse
into that room too.

60
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,960
Alan, listen to me.

61
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,210
You have a problem
with memorization.

62
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,710
Maybe you'd left that room,

63
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,420
but you just couldn't remember?

64
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,750
Remember.

65
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,790
Come back to me.

66
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,500
Remember.

67
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,330
Pete.

68
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,170
Would you promise me

69
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,250
not to tell Doctor
Nil about this?

70
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,210
I don't want this
to be a big deal.

71
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,630
Please, Pete.

72
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:14,580
I'm sorry, Alan.

73
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,130
I really can't
make that promise.

74
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,500
This is an important matter,

75
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,250
especially for yourself.

76
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,500
You have a memory problem,

77
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,580
and you go lost too.

78
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,000
Not to mention the
hallucinations you had.

79
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,960
But I trusted you,

80
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:33,960
that's why I told you everything.

81
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,580
And you've promised me too.

82
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,880
Reporting this matter to Doctor Nil

83
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,630
would be more beneficial for you.

84
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,580
Now excuse me.

85
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,040
Don't forget to
drink lots of water.

86
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,790
Pete said he found me at the staircase.

87
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,960
Am I supposed to
believe that was real?

88
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,580
I'm starting to doubt what
was real and what wasn't.

89
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,790
And was everything
I've written the truth?

90
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,670
I know there's something going on,

91
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,710
but they just
didn't let me know.

92
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,750
Attention-

93
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,750
Blue code-

94
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,670
Room C02.

95
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,880
Repeat.

96
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,000
Blue code-

97
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,790
Room C02.

98
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,080
Attention-

99
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,080
Blue code-

100
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,920
Room C02.

101
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,710
Are you conscious?

102
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,920
Attention-

103
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,960
Blue code-

104
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,630
Room C02.

105
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,000
Repeat

106
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,040
Blue code

107
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:45,580
Room C02

108
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,960
Again, push harder.

109
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:49,540
Bring in the ventilator!

110
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,920
I'll take it from here.

111
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,630
Sir.

112
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:53,830
Sir!

113
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,920
Attention-

114
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,960
Blue code

115
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,580
Room C02.

116
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,500
Repeat-

117
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,630
Blue code-

118
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,290
Room C02.

119
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,920
Attention-

120
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,920
Blue code-

121
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,920
Room C02.

122
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Sir.

123
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,130
Sir!

124
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,830
Keep going.

125
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:41,289
That's enough.

126
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,830
Time of death, 11:42 PM.

127
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,380
What are you doing in here?

128
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,460
Is he really dead?

129
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,170
I think you should leave.

130
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,960
You can't just wandered
in there like that.

131
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,000
If Doctor Nil had
been in that room,

132
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,880
you would have been
in even more trouble.

133
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,500
No,

134
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,710
I wasn't wandering around.

135
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,460
I heard the announcement

136
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,130
and wanted to know what
was going on with him.

137
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:52,750
On the other day,

138
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,170
I was brought to
that room by a nurse.

139
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,080
A nurse?

140
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,500
Did you mean that night

141
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,040
I found you infront
of that room?

142
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,130
Have you still been
thinking about it?

143
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,290
It's not like that, Pete.

144
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,210
It was yesterday

145
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,710
that you told me you found
me passed out on the staircase.

146
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,960
Alan.

147
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,420
It wasn't yesterday,

148
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,460
but two days ago

149
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
that I found you.

150
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:27,130
Two days ago.

151
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,540
Huh?

152
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,170
Alan.

153
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,250
I think you got mixed up.

154
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,500
I'm not.

155
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,750
I was just here yesterday.

156
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,250
I also came here that night.

157
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,830
I think there must be something

158
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:49,170
between me

159
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,830
and room C02 for sure.

160
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,420
What's going on?

161
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,420
Pete,

162
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,960
what are you doing here?

163
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,920
Currently, your memory pattern is

164
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,540
1, 3, 5, 4 and 2.

165
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,330
even though it should have been

166
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,830
1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.

167
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,380
Doctor.

168
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:35,000
But

169
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,250
I'm sure it wasn't like that.

170
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,500
I'm sure I didn't get it wrong.

171
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,210
When we memorize things,

172
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,690
it will break down into
scenarios

173
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,750
and sub-scenarios.

174
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,960
The content in the memory

175
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,880
is the core of the memory.

176
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,670
That's why it made you

177
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,750
think you met Pete yesterday,

178
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,380
when you actually met
him two days earlier.

179
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,630
Or when you

180
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,170
falsely remembered
the meal you had

181
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,130
with the meal on the other day.

182
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,540
Remember.

183
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,420
With the meal on the other day.

184
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:13,170
Alan.

185
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,630
But, doctor.

186
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,880
That doesn't seem right.

187
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,460
What makes you

188
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:23,710
so sure?

189
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,960
You're not listening to me.

190
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,040
I've been led to the
room several times.

191
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,290
And today, someone
died in that room too.

192
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,710
Don't you think everything
has some sort of connection?

193
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,210
Currently,

194
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,710
the problem isn't
just about the memory.

195
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,630
You also suffer from a condition

196
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,830
where your brain interprets
images you're seeing

197
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,330
incorrectly.

198
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,880
Do you remember
when Doctor Nil explained

199
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,750
that you

200
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,080
had brain hallucinations issue?

201
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:02,330
Can you remember?

202
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,420
Can you remember?

203
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,330
Let me ask you straight.

204
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,880
Are you still

205
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,170
practicing looking at the cards nowadays?

206
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,380
You must do it, it's
for your own sake.

207
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,000
Remember.

208
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,460
Nobody has ever
believed what I think is true.

209
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,130
What about everyone's
efforts to help you?

210
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,580
They never meant
anything to you?

211
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,790
Are you sure

212
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,710
you have never seen that nurse before?

213
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,420
Remember.

214
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:38,250
Come back to me.

215
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,380
Yesterday

216
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,710
that you said you found me
passed out on the staircase.

217
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,080
But it was two days ago.

218
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,630
Remember.

219
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:49,920
Remember.

220
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,420
Remember!

221
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,080
No matter how much I
practice looking at the pictures,

222
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:00,380
nothing changes.

223
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,000
Nothing has gotten better!

224
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,170
You know what?

225
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,790
If you have some free time,

226
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,580
you should practice looking
at those cards as well.

227
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,380
So you'd understand how
to properly treat the patient.

228
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,170
Doc.

229
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,460
I think we should
leave him alone first.

230
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,420
They've probably
moved the corpse.

231
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,210
judging by how well
the bed was made.

232
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,750
You said he had been
here for a long time.

233
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:58,750
What was his mental disorder?

234
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,420
Well

235
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,880
I don't know either.

236
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,130
When I first saw him,

237
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,170
he was already in a
vegetative state like this.

238
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,000
Hadn't any

239
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,290
of his family

240
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,830
or anyone else
come to visit him?

241
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,290
I've never seen anyone else but
the doctors come into this room.

242
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:30,380
I told you

243
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,710
this place was a
hospital of the forgotten.

244
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,790
Even as he was dying,

245
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,170
we still didn't see how he died.

246
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,500
The only thing left to
see is an empty bed

247
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,080
that looks like no one
has ever been here before.

248
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Win.

249
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:04,829
Am I

250
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:07,420
going to end up like him?

251
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:11,540
Huh?

252
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,500
You won't.

253
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,790
But ever since I've been here,

254
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,790
no one has ever
given me attention.

255
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,920
Nobody has ever come to see me.

256
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:41,000
My father doesn't
even come visit me.

257
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,290
I'm right here.

258
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,420
It's okay.

259
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:26,580
Thank you so much.

260
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You don't have to.

261
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,920
We promised

262
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,330
we would never leave each other.

263
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:41,540
I don't wanna be here anymore.

264
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,670
Please get me out of this place.

265
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,380
I don't want to get old and die here alone.

266
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,460
Please?

267
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,500
I beg you.

268
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,210
I really beg you.

269
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,210
You've promised

270
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:03,790
you wouldn't leave me.

271
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:07,330
Right?

272
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:14,500
Right?

273
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,290
Mm-hmm.

274
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,790
But we must plan carefully.

275
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,460
Stop crying.

276
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,040
You too.

277
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,920
Hey, you.

278
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,000
You should throw that
in the washing machine.

279
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,420
It's just an ink stain,

280
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,080
hand wash should be enough.

281
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:21,500
Okay.

282
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,420
This is kinda funny.

283
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,630
You used to be the one who consoled me.

284
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:26,790
Now, it's my turn.

285
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,170
Come on, let me comfort you.

286
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:30,460
Come quickly.

287
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,210
Oh!

288
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,040
Your shirt is torn.

289
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,210
Huh?

290
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,080
On the shoulder.

291
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,210
Oh.

292
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,670
It's nothing, I can fix it.

293
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:50,920
Ain't a big deal.

294
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,540
I think that shirt's been
through a lot of hardships.

295
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,130
You should buy a new one.

296
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,170
I'd rather not, Doc.

297
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:01,830
That would be a waste of money.

298
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:08,420
Alright.

299
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,920
I gotta go now.

300
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:26,830
Okay.

301
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,790
Hey!

302
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:30,710
Look over here.

303
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,040
Your pants are ripped.

304
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,170
Oh, the hole is big too.

305
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:41,960
Have you got a spare outfit?

306
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,130
I have.

307
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,130
Let's go then.

308
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,580
I'll take you to change.

309
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:48,880
Come.

310
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,210
Everyone else's going to
notice that your pants are ripped.

311
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,670
Hurry.

312
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,500
Want me to help you pick?

313
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,130
What are you staring at?

314
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,920
I noticed you're slowing down.

315
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,540
Are you shy?

316
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,830
Or do you need me to
help you with changing?

317
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,960
No, I'm

318
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,130
I'm changing right now.

319
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,210
Or should I go wait for you outside?

320
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,710
Got it.

321
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,960
I'll go wait outside then.

322
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,920
I need to borrow
this for a while, Doc.

323
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,210
I'll pay you back when I can.

324
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,080
Here, take this.

325
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:49,790
This bag?

326
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,130
Are you sure?

327
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:58,000
Hurry up!

328
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,080
You said you wouldn't peek.

329
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,880
Who peeked?

330
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,130
I was staring at how
sluggish you were.

331
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,630
Just say you love it.

332
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:31,460
Nonsense.

333
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,040
What?

334
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,500
Come here.

335
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:55,210
You mis-buttoned your shirt.

336
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,210
Oops.

337
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:03,290
How old are you?

338
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:04,960
Look, this button.

339
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,170
Do I look handsome?

340
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,000
You do.

341
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Let's go.

342
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,960
Get up there, quick.

343
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:30,830
I'll go first.

344
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,210
Careful.

345
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,960
Come, I'll pull you up.

346
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,170
Slowly.

347
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,080
Are you ready?

348
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,290
What are you so confused about?

349
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:17,330
Quick, before someone sees us.

350
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,630
I'm not dreaming, am I?

351
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,040
What's next for us?

352
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,290
Quick, hitch a ride.

353
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,040
Over here.

354
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,080
Over here.

355
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,500
We need a ride.

356
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,290
I don't wanna be here anymore.

357
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:13,830
Please get me out of this place.

358
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,580
But we must plan carefully.

359
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,420
Thank you so much.

360
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,580
You don't have to.

361
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:25,420
We promised

362
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:27,750
we would never leave each other.

363
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,920
Over here.

364
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,750
We're going with you.

365
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,290
" Stop "

366
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,670
Hey.

367
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:46,920
So where should we go next?

368
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,290
I have no idea.

369
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,460
Why did you take me on
this bus in the first place?

370
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,250
All I could think was
that we ought to get out

371
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:58,000
of the hospital area
as fast as possible.

372
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,460
What do we do now?

373
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,080
Yeah.

374
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:10,920
Do you have plans
to go somewhere?

375
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:19,750
So...

376
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:21,630
You escaped from the hospital,

377
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:23,580
but you haven't got any plans?

378
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,210
Nothing you wanted to do?

379
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:27,630
No where you wanted to go?

380
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,960
I know that my memory
isn't working properly.

381
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:33,170
Don't go harsh on me yet.

382
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,290
Can you believe this?

383
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,710
Shouldn't have
brought this to myself.

384
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,580
Hey.

385
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,710
What day is today?

386
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:44,790
Saturday.

387
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,000
Why?

388
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:47,630
What time might it be now?

389
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,130
Around 4.00 PM, I guess.

390
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,380
Can we travel to somewhere near Rangsit Khlong 12?

391
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,250
I have a friend named Nate.

392
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,290
He should be able to help us.

393
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:05,670
Are you sure

394
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,330
your friend won't send
us back to the hospital?

395
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,210
I'm sure.

396
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,790
That's my best friend.

397
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:15,330
He once mentioned that he
liked to play music at the market.

398
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:17,330
At this time,

399
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,290
we might be able to find him there.

400
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,460
Fine.

401
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,580
We'll go meet your friend.

402
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,000
Here, for two person.

403
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,500
Where to next?

404
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,670
I don't remember.

405
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,580
I didn't write that
down in here either.

406
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,080
But something might
come up while we're walking.

407
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:54,500
So tired,

408
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,920
I need a break.

409
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,540
Where should we sit?

410
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:01,130
Hey.

411
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:04,380
See the ice cream
shop over there?

412
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,380
I remember eating
it, and it was delicious.

413
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:09,750
You wanna eat?

414
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:11,920
Let's go.

415
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,380
You want some too?

416
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,250
Fine, I'll eat it with you.

417
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,670
You wanted to eat too,
but you're just acting.

418
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:40,380
I'd like a scoop of
ice cream in a cup

419
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,750
with sticky rice and corn for toppings.

420
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,580
Sure thing.

421
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,040
I'll have the same.

422
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,500
Why did you copy me?

423
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,580
I didn't copy.

424
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,630
Couples would have shared
the same thoughts, right?

425
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,130
Hold up,

426
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,330
since when did we
become a couple?

427
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,540
Hold up,

428
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:03,130
People who love each
other must become couples.

429
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,080
Hold up,

430
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:08,500
when did I ever
tell you I loved you?

431
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:11,040
Hold up,

432
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,710
you don't love me?

433
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,130
Stop saying "Hold up."

434
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,500
Thanks.

435
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,000
Sir.

436
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:23,500
I ordered two cups.

437
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,420
It's okay,

438
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,580
I can share with you.

439
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Go.

440
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,790
What's up with him?

441
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,580
I'll give you the first bite.

442
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:44,880
How was it?

443
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,330
Yummy.

444
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:48,540
Go ahead,

445
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,710
dig in.

446
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:51,710
He doesn't see us.

447
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,080
Don't do that.

448
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,460
Hey!

449
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:57,170
Someone's secretly
taking a picture of us.

450
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:01,210
Hey there.

451
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:03,920
It's okay, I'm not mad.

452
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,040
I just would like
to request that

453
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,170
you take a picture
of the two of us.

454
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:11,380
Please?

455
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,460
Just one picture.

456
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:13,670
Of course.

457
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,960
Thank you.

458
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,040
You can stand right over there.

459
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,500
1, 2, and 3.

460
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,420
Here.

461
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:36,960
Thanks a lot.

462
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,670
The picture printed
out right away?

463
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:39,380
Yeah,

464
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,580
We have to wait for a bit,

465
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,580
and after some time passes,

466
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,880
the picture will
start getting clearer.

467
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:44,710
Then we can just keep it.

468
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,920
Pretty cool.

469
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,210
No idea what kind
of face I made.

470
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,080
A nurse!

471
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:56,130
He's coming all the way here?

472
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:56,830
Let's go.

473
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,580
Your friend is really here?

474
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,130
It's getting dark.

475
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,000
Yeah, it's this place.

476
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:38,380
Come.

477
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:48,540
Alan.

478
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:50,330
Hey!

479
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:53,420
Nate.

480
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,630
Long time no see, man.
ไม่ได้เจอกันนานเลยนะ

481
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,380
Where have you been? You're father've been looking for you.
หายไปเลยนะ ไอ้ห่า พ่อมึงตามหาอยู่

482
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,920
I'm sorry, but I was sick.
กูขอโทษ กูไม่ค่อยสบายไง

483
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:03,130
Remember?
ที่เคยบอกไป

484
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,500
Is everything alright now?
ตอนนี้หายแล้วเหรอวะ

485
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,580
Is your brain okay?
สมองมึงไม่เป็นไร ใช่ไหม

486
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,080
It's been a long story.
เรื่องมันยาวว่ะ

487
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Do you have time?
 มึงมีเวลาป่ะล่ะ

488
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:17,790
Always.
ได้เสมอ

489
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,920
So, this must be Win.
งั้นนี่ก็คือวินสินะ

490
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:27,710
Like "Winner", with the W?
เหมือนวินเนอร์เหรอ ขึ้นต้นด้วยตัวดับเบิ้ลยูเหรอ

491
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,580
Yeah, Win.
ใช่ วิน

492
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,080
Like a Winner.
เหมือนกับวินเนอร์

493
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:32,830
What are your plans?
แล้วแผนมึงคืออะไรวะ

494
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,750
That's why we came to see you.
นั่นคือเหตุผลที่กูมาหามึง

495
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,040
We don't know where to go next
พวกกูไม่รู้จะไปไหนต่อ

496
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,420
and have no plan.
และไม่มีแผนอะไรเลย

497
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:41,920
Alan.
อลัน

498
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,460
Can I be honest with you?
กูถามมึงตรง ๆ ได้ไหม

499
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:45,580
Yeah.
เออ

500
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,210
Your condition...
มึงหนีออกมาแบบนี้

501
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:52,420
will running away be bad for you?
แล้วอาการป่วยของมึงล่ะ

502
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,960
Look, man.
มึงดูกูดิ

503
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,460
I'm fine.
กูปกติดี

504
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:57,790
Do I look like a patient?
กูดูเหมือนคนป่วยเหรอ

505
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,920
Yeah?
เออ

506
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:01,210
Yeah, you look fine.
เออ มึงปกติดี

507
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,670
What about your dad?
แล้วพ่อมึงอะ

508
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:04,670
Why don't you like, go back to him.
ทำไมมึงไม่กลับไปหาพ่อมึงวะ

509
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:08,420
I'm sure he's heard from the hospital and is looking for you.
กูมั่นใจว่าโรงพยาบาลต้องบอกเขา และเขาก็จะตามหามึง

510
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,540
He must be very worried.
เขาคงจะกังวลมาก

511
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:13,330
I...
กู...

512
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:16,920
I just don't want to see him right now.
กูไม่อยกาเจอเขาตอนนี้ว่ะ

513
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,630
We just need a place to stay.
เราอยากกได้ที่พักสักที่

514
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:21,290
Somewhere to hide.
ที่ที่เอาไว้ซ่อน

515
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:23,000
And our money is limited.
แล้วเงินกูก็มีแบบจำกัดด้วย

516
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,630
Please help us.
ขอร้องล่ะ ช่วยพวกกูเถอะ

517
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,380
Uh...
เอ่อ...

518
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,210
You know I'd love to help, right?
มึงรู้ใช่ไหมว่ากูชอบที่จะช่วย

519
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:36,330
But
แต่

520
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,630
I'm in the middle of moving to UK with my dad.
ช่วงนี้กูต้องเตรียมตัวย้ายไปที่อังกฤษกับพ่อ

521
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,290
And I'm currently staying with my mom and her family.
กูต้องย้ายมาอยู่กับแม่กูและญาติของเขาที่นี่

522
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:44,710
If you were to come alone
ถ้ามึงมาคนเดียว

523
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:47,170
there might be space, but...
มันก็มีที่พอ แต่...

524
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,920
I'm so sorry, man.
กูขอโทษด้วยจริง ๆ

525
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,540
It's okay. You don't have to.
ไม่เป็นไร มึงไม่ต้องขอโทษ

526
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,330
It's fine.
กูไม่เป็นไร

527
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,080
I do know a hotel. It's very cheap.

528
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:03,460
Just across the road.
แค่ข้ามถนนไป

529
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:06,420
On the... The room is what it is.
ห้องอะไรนั่น...

530
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:07,790
So...
ก็...

531
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,330
That's not a bad option.
เป็นตัวเลือกที่ไม่แย่

532
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:14,290
It's okay.
ก็โอเค

533
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:16,250
We're gonna look for it.
เดี๋ยวพวกกูไปหาดู

534
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:19,830
Anyway, I'll be here tomorrow.
ยังไงพรุ่งนี้กูก็อยู่ที่นี่

535
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:22,880
So, if you need to look for me. Please come.
ถ้ามึงจะมาหากู ก็มานะ

536
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,420
And I got to go.
แต่ตอนนี้กูต้องไปแล้ว

537
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,710
So it was really nice seeing you.

538
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:30,960
And nice to meet you too.
และดีใจที่ได้รู้จักนายด้วยนะ

539
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,040
Come.
มา

540
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,080
Come on.
มาเลย

541
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:37,330
See you.
แล้วเจอกันมึง

542
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,960
Take care.
ดูแลตัวเองด้วยนะ

543
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:42,670
See you.
เจอกัน

544
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:43,880
Yeah.
เออ

545
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,170
We're going to have
to spend the night here.

546
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:07,250
In a few days,

547
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:09,750
Nate might be able to
find us a better place.

548
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:16,830
Can we really trust him?

549
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:19,130
Sure, we can trust him.

550
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,380
Nate's been my best
friend since my childhood.

551
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:23,210
You sure he's just a friend?

552
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,880
Jealous?

553
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:38,920
We're just friends.

554
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,790
Believe me.

555
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,790
But the way you looked at each other

556
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:46,830
didn't seem like friends.

557
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:50,670
Alright.

558
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:52,750
If you wanted to
know,

559
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:54,130
then I'll be honest.

560
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,500
Nate

561
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:58,250
is someone I really trusted.

562
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:01,290
He helped me in find out

563
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:03,000
my true interests.

564
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:06,630
And he was also my first love.

565
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,920
I knew it.

566
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,250
But I no longer feel that
way with him anymore.

567
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,000
Oh yeah?

568
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:19,130
I don't buy it.

569
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,630
Please believe me.

570
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,750
Why must I believe you?

571
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,880
You just came to see him today.

572
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,170
I came to see him because
I thought he could help us.

573
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:29,830
I wasn't feeling anything
else with him.

574
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:33,380
Whatever.

575
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:37,500
I just don't want anyone else
to matter more to you than I do.

576
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:42,330
Hey.

577
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:46,500
Nate may have been
someone special to me

578
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:48,330
when I was a child,

579
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:52,630
but he likes women.

580
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,540
And ever since then,

581
00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:59,290
I have always kept
my distance from him.

582
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,500
It wasn't the same
with you, though.

583
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:09,540
How wasn't it the same?

584
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,580
Do you know

585
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:17,500
why I wanted to get out of the hospital?

586
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:22,750
Why?

587
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,290
I didn't want to
spend my life with you

588
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:28,830
as patients in that hospital,

589
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:35,170
but I wanted come out
and live my life with you

590
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:38,750
as lovers,

591
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,710
like normal people would.

592
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:47,790
Like lovers?

593
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,500
Yes.

594
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:54,710
Are you confessing
your love for me?

595
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:56,920
No?

596
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:57,750
Who said that?

597
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:58,790
I didn't say anything.

598
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:01,830
Then

599
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,330
I have the right to do
whatever lovers do, huh?

600
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:11,130
What're you going to do?

601
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:14,380
I mean...

602
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:20,630
how are you going to do?

603
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,290
Like...

604
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:29,790
something like this.

605
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:33,420
Friends could also do that.

606
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:34,460
Pretty normal.

607
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:44,130
How about this?

608
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,830
If the friends were close enough,

609
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:53,170
it could be possible.

610
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,080
How about this?

611
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:35,670
How close would they have to be?

612
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:37,420
Very, very close.

613
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,920
Your hands are so naughty.

614
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,960
Can't they be naughty?

615
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:07,170
How naughty can they possibly be?

616
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,500
Let's find out.

617
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,130
You're only mine.

618
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:16,500
Yes.

619
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:18,330
I'm all yours.

620
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:32,080
You're awake?

621
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,040
I'm going to get something to eat.

622
00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:38,960
Good idea.

623
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:56,750
Alan.

624
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,500
Run, hurry!

625
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:11,580
Found him.

626
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:14,000
- Let go!
- You're coming back.

627
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:15,290
Come with us.

628
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:16,080
Let go!

629
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:17,000
Let go!

630
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:17,710
Let go.

631
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:18,500
Time to go back.

632
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,460
Let go!

633
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:20,420
Let me go!

634
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:20,960
Come with us!
