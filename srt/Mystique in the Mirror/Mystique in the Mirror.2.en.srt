1
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,210
Did I see a ghost, dad?

2
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,170
I've told you, Alan.

3
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,130
It's because you were sick.

4
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,670
Long, shaggy hair

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,840
on an unemotional face.

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,380
They're very familiar to me.

7
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,340
What should I do?
กูควรทำยังไงดีวะ

8
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,880
You should communicate with him.
มึงควรสื่อสารกับเขา

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,540
What did you do?

10
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,170
So I snapped and called him out,

11
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:26,500
asking what he wanted
from haunting me.

12
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,840
I told you it was a hallucination.

13
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,420
Damn it!

14
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,880
If that old man ghost bullshit

15
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,460
is keeping you from moving on,

16
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,460
then you won't
ever see it again.

17
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,380
Alan!

18
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,500
You up, sleepyhead?

19
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:36,710
Then this place...

20
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:37,670
is a hospital?

21
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,790
Yes, the hospital of
the forgotten ones.

22
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,020
Probably the same as
the other patient here.

23
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,070
Someone brought us here

24
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:44,690
and forgot that we were here.

25
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,479
I have to go now.

26
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,820
Hey, wait!

27
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:50,940
Alan!

28
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:51,690
Where are you going?

29
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,940
And what's the psychiatric
hospital you mentioned?

30
00:01:54,729 --> 00:01:55,940
It's exactly what I meant.

31
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:57,229
You're gonna get me caught, bye.

32
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:58,610
Where are you going?

33
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,650
Back to my room,
it's on the other side.

34
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:01,440
See you around.

35
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,690
Look out!

36
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,020
Alan?

37
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:18,940
Good morning, Alan.

38
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,900
You're up quite early.

39
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,480
Did you sleep well last night?

40
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:46,650
Have you followed all of
my yesterday's instructions?

41
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,360
Yes.

42
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,730
And how are you feeling?

43
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:04,900
So do you feel?

44
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,150
Do you feel any better?

45
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,900
Do you recognize me, Alan?

46
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,270
Can you say my name?

47
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,900
Doctor...

48
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,440
I'm doctor Nil.

49
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,070
Your personal doctor.

50
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,570
And this is doctor Ophat.

51
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:34,690
Okay.

52
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:36,520
Alan.

53
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,150
If you can't remember, there's
no need to force yourself.

54
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,070
But you have to tell me, because
it's necessary that I know everything.

55
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,520
Otherwise, you won't get better.

56
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:50,650
Okay.

57
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:51,650
Alright.

58
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,070
Then you should go
get ready for the day.

59
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,900
We'll begin the medical
check in the afternoon.

60
00:03:58,770 --> 00:03:59,770
Okay.

61
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,650
Get the CT scanner prepared.

62
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:15,650
Yes, doctor.

63
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,150
Even without memory

64
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,020
and self-control from time to time,

65
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,270
there's still some level
of intellect left in me.

66
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,820
I may have been brought for treatment

67
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,020
from seeing the old
man ghost in the mirror.

68
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,360
Remember.

69
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:01,690
Remember.

70
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:02,770
Remember.

71
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,190
Remberber!

72
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,520
I wonder if the psychological treatment

73
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,650
would stop me from
seeing the ghost.

74
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,610
After reading your profile,

75
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,730
I have no doubts about it.

76
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,770
But I'm a little curious
about something.

77
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,360
Curious about what, doctor?

78
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,440
Nil.

79
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,900
Here's the profile of a new nurse who's
recently applied to work at our facility.

80
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,360
The staff sent this over for you.

81
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,110
He's still young.

82
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,320
Will it be like the last time?

83
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,820
After we hire him, perhaps
he won't stay long or will resign.

84
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:42,980
I'm skeptical of
younger people like him.

85
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,440
Doesn't hurt to give him a try.

86
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:49,230
It would be a waste of time.

87
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,150
I suggest hiring a senior
or near-retired individual.

88
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,230
Don't give up just yet.

89
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,610
A man a with good profile like yours

90
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,520
could've applied for jobs
at big hospitals in the city.

91
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:09,150
Why did you choose
to apply here?

92
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:12,730
Honestly, doctor.

93
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,360
I don't like crowded environments.

94
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,570
Is it crowding that bothers you,

95
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,480
or do you just prefer easy work?

96
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,650
What's that supposed to mean?

97
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,150
Many of those who
applied for job here

98
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,610
also assumed that working in a
hospital away from the city

99
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,690
would be simple.

100
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,570
But after they actually
started working here,

101
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,440
everyone of them quit.

102
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,270
I came to this place

103
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,650
because I want to
help other people.

104
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,070
Do you know what
you'll be up against

105
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,150
while working here?

106
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:00,820
Your entirety of time

107
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:02,980
will be spent in this place.

108
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,940
That's the reason
why I chose this place.

109
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,860
And I believe

110
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:11,070
we should avoid using past
experiences as a baseline, doctor.

111
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,400
What about your family?

112
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,860
Your girlfriend?

113
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:19,190
Are they truly in
agreement with this?

114
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,770
My family said it's up to me.

115
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,730
And I also have nothing
else to worry about.

116
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,570
I think you should
keep your personal

117
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,190
and work lives separate.

118
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,230
How about this.

119
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,020
you go ahead and interview him.

120
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:37,570
I trust you since

121
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,940
you'll be working
with him the most.

122
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,270
Alright, Mr.Phiranthon

123
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,440
When can you start work?

124
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,690
Immediately,

125
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:52,860
if you were to hire me.

126
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,020
Then, follow me.

127
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,230
Come on,

128
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,730
I'll show you
around the hospital.

129
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,190
Did I really land a job?

130
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,860
Remember.

131
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,110
Remember.

132
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,440
Remember!

133
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,150
Remember.

134
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:37,730
Remember.

135
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,070
Tonight,

136
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,650
I sat in front of the mirror,

137
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,440
waiting for the old
man's ghost to appear.

138
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,270
I believe there's something
he wanted to tell me.

139
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,320
Remember,

140
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,980
find the answers.

141
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,690
Remember.

142
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,770
Remember?

143
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,980
I have a question, doc.

144
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,900
Why doesn't this place
look like a hospital?

145
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,020
How does it not
resemble a hospital?

146
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,400
Well, I dunno.

147
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:23,020
This place seems
much too luxurious to me.

148
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,570
Isn't it ok to be luxurious?

149
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,190
Or are hospitals

150
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,690
supposed to be eerie

151
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,440
and scary all the time?

152
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,440
No.

153
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,360
I mean...

154
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,190
What about you?

155
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,270
You're not who I
thought you'd be.

156
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:39,980
And how's that, doc?

157
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:45,690
Huh?

158
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,320
Wha!

159
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,150
Have you seen Doctor Nil?

160
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:57,690
Doctor Nil?

161
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,480
Doctor Nil...

162
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,860
Did I see him somewhere?

163
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,650
Chill out,

164
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,900
what's the hurry?

165
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,270
Did you see him or not?

166
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:11,980
Doctor Nil.

167
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,480
He's probably busy
with one of his cases.

168
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:15,980
Why?

169
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,400
What did he do to you?

170
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:20,730
Nothing.

171
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,320
I just need to speak with him.

172
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,230
You're gonna meet
him today anyway.

173
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:28,940
For now, let's go get some food.

174
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,270
I'm hungry.

175
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,020
Come on,

176
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,400
Your tummy's rumbling!

177
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,400
Let's go for a lunch.

178
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,480
You've never been
to the cafeteria, right?

179
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,650
Follow me.

180
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,230
I'm starving.

181
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,570
This is a recreation room.

182
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,860
Relaxation and
activities are held here.

183
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,860
Greetings, Mr.Alan.

184
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,770
Are you going for lunch?

185
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,440
Yes, I am.

186
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,940
Bon appétit.

187
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,820
Thank you.

188
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,400
How does she know my name?

189
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,400
She knows every patient's name.

190
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,270
It's kinda like being
in prison here, actually.

191
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,070
They just make us
feel like we're not in it.

192
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,770
Maybe they were
just doing their job?

193
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:52,650
Nah.

194
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,190
If they were, I wouldn't
have to climb your windows.

195
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,900
You'll find out as time goes on.

196
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,440
Your wristband is a
very important item.

197
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,770
See the barcode
scanner on their hands?

198
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,980
After scanning our wristbands,

199
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,020
they'd know everything about us.

200
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,440
whether they're
going to identify us

201
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,820
or even during our mealtimes.

202
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,730
By just scanning our wristbands,

203
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:26,190
they'd know how
to prepare our food.

204
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,610
Tofu soup again?

205
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,270
Boring.

206
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,860
May I have an extra
fried egg, please?

207
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,360
Mr. Alan Bunnalai?

208
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,440
Yes.

209
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:06,570
Thank you.

210
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,020
Remember.

211
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,320
Come back to me.

212
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,820
Remember!

213
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:28,610
Alan.

214
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,820
This way.

215
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:31,650
Quickly!

216
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,860
This place doesn't
look like a hospital at all.

217
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,980
I know, right?

218
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,610
I've had the same thought.

219
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,320
And the patients here...

220
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,440
they don't look like patients.

221
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,770
Everyone seems so normal.

222
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,610
You should eat up
before it gets cold.

223
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:13,770
Can I have a look?

224
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,480
You can't!

225
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,820
It's my personal journal.

226
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:21,770
How personal?

227
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,020
Do you have to take
notes all the time?

228
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:27,940
Mm-hmm.

229
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,020
Dr.Nil said

230
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,190
this is one of the treatment methods.

231
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,440
So, you have
dementia or something?

232
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,820
There's no such
thing as "dementia"!

233
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,520
The term for this is
"memories issues."

234
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,520
Really?

235
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,400
I wanna read even more now.

236
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,320
Can't you even grasp
what "personal" means?

237
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,070
I do,

238
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,690
but I just wanna
take a little peek.

239
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,900
What?

240
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:03,020
Can't friends share
their personal story?

241
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,190
Friends?

242
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:08,650
Alright.

243
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,480
Then let me hear
your personal story first.

244
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,480
Okay, what do you
want to know about?

245
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,650
How about...

246
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,520
the reason you've
been brought here.

247
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,320
I've seen hallucinations.

248
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,690
What kind of hallucinations?

249
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,070
I once had a normal
life like everyone else.

250
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,320
Until one day...

251
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,360
my dad inherited
a piece of land.

252
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:52,570
So he started a project
to build a market.

253
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,110
Originally, that land
was a Muslim village.

254
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,440
And there was an old cemetery

255
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,520
where the Muslims who
once lived there were buried.

256
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,110
My mother wasn't
happy about it at first.

257
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,690
She didn't want to disrespect

258
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,940
or kick them out of their homes.

259
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,270
But my father
never listened to her.

260
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,020
He was stubborn
and insistent about it.

261
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,820
Then one day, I saw something

262
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,820
I shouldn't have seen.

263
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:19,110
Something you
shouldn't have seen?

264
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,070
What did you saw?

265
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:27,020
I saw dead people who'd
been buried in that cemetery.

266
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,270
Did you...

267
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:33,730
see ghosts.

268
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,730
That also marked the
start of the entire story.

269
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:42,650
I told my best friend who lived in
that village about what had happened.

270
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,610
Because one of the
ghosts I saw was his father.

271
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,070
The story quickly
spread after that.

272
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:53,230
People had rumored that the
ancestral spirits were dissatisfied

273
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,270
about using that
land as a market.

274
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,900
Then a protest broke out.

275
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,070
For my part,

276
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:02,270
I was still seeing those ghosts.

277
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:06,190
The funny thing was,
my dad didn't believe me.

278
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,440
He thought I was crazy.

279
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:14,270
One day, He pushed me
into the car, drove me here,

280
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,650
and never returned
to see me again.

281
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,270
So...

282
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,650
Why did they bring
us to this place?

283
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,900
Because this is the
hospital of the forgotten.

284
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,730
Everyone who's been here

285
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,980
was left behind by someone.

286
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,770
Your turn to now.

287
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,650
Try reading this journal.

288
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:32,360
You saw a ghost of an old man?

289
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,860
Yes.

290
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,110
I usually see him
when I look in the mirror.

291
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,520
But I had no idea

292
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,320
what he was

293
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,110
or what he wanted from me.

294
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,690
Until one day,

295
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,190
I had a confrontation with him.

296
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,480
I asked him what he wanted from me.

297
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:04,860
Come out here!

298
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,940
But my dad was very mad...

299
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:09,320
Everything was an illusion
that you created, Alan.

300
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,570
and he went on to smash
every mirror in the house.

301
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:13,570
Then...

302
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,860
the next thing I knew,

303
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:21,940
I found myself here.

304
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,690
That's why I wanted to ask Dr.Nil

305
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:30,650
why my dad brought me here.

306
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,770
Do you get the feelings...

307
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,940
that the day before
you left home

308
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,860
and the day you arrived here

309
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,400
felt differently, like you
were in another movie

310
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,070
or another world?

311
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,110
Who do you mean?

312
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,570
Everyone here has the same idea.

313
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:53,940
The sensation...

314
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,820
of being transported
to an alternate world.

315
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,150
You know what it resembles?

316
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,400
Resembles to what?

317
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,650
An after life.

318
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,940
The place where
time doesn't pass.

319
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,730
We are the only ones...

320
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,360
who must await judgment
before crossing to the next realm.

321
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,940
You watched a
lot of movies, huh?

322
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,440
I don't buy it.

323
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,610
Do ghosts remember the
time of their own deaths?

324
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,820
You know...

325
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,820
when we die,

326
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,400
the memory of our final moment

327
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,150
will be erased.

328
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,820
That's why voids
between memories exists.

329
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,820
Definitely.

330
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,520
Just like when you were
living your normal life

331
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:04,440
Alan.

332
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:05,900
and then suddenly woke up here.

333
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,270
I don't believe it.

334
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,610
But it's written
all over your face

335
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,820
that you do.

336
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,900
Fine, don't believe me.

337
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:46,020
Return the tray when
you're done eating.

338
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,400
I'm going to the restroom.

339
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:50,610
See you there, I'll
take you to a spot.

340
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,690
Wait, where are we going?

341
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,190
Alan.

342
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:08,860
I see you've finished your meal.

343
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:11,860
Yes.

344
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:13,650
How is everything?

345
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,320
Did you enjoy your meal?

346
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:17,770
It was great.

347
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:19,770
Oh…

348
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,270
This is Phirantorn,

349
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,770
the new nurse.

350
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,020
He'll be assisting me and
Dr.Nil in taking care of this place.

351
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,320
Okay...

352
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,440
Hello.

353
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,980
Hello, Mr. Alan.

354
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,860
You can call me, Pete.

355
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,440
Nice to meet you.

356
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,860
Alan,

357
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,650
we have an appointment
this afternoon.

358
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,320
Performing the CT scan.

359
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,650
Are you ready to go now?

360
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,650
I need use the restroom first

361
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:51,650
then I'll meet you there.

362
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,610
Where can I find Dr.Nil's room?

363
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,650
You can ask the nurse
when you're done.

364
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,730
And maybe ask them to walk you there.

365
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,270
Okay.

366
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:05,270
Excuse me for a moment.

367
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,730
Alright.

368
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,480
That's Alan.

369
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:28,520
I would like you to observe

370
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,070
the CT scan procedure
this afternoon

371
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,980
and start following
up on Alan's case

372
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,570
together with me.

373
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,900
Alan?

374
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:38,190
Is his case

375
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,900
more unique compared to others?

376
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,020
Actually...

377
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,820
all of the cases here

378
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,730
are unique in their own ways.

379
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:49,570
Just...

380
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,440
Please try not to

381
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,360
talk with patients
unless neccesary.

382
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,400
And you should be very careful

383
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,940
with your actions.

384
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,480
Okay, Doc.

385
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,860
As you've already known,

386
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,230
this place is unlike
any other place.

387
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:08,440
Using what you've
experienced in the past

388
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,860
would not be possible here.

389
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:12,650
Alright, Doc.

390
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,900
Got it.

391
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:14,980
My best advice is that

392
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,520
you better not say anything.

393
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,020
Okay.

394
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,020
Come.

395
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:32,270
Hey, you done?

396
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:35,940
You're taking forever.

397
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:38,730
Win.

398
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,320
Where are you?

399
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:49,610
Win?

400
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,190
Win.

401
00:24:59,110 --> 00:24:59,940
Oh…

402
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,110
Not making a sound, huh?

403
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,020
You're taking so long to poop.

404
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,360
I'll wait outside, okay?

405
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:33,940
Hey, Win.

406
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,360
Win.

407
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,150
Is this you?

408
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,150
Answer me.

409
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:41,110
This isn't funny.

410
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,150
Win!

411
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:20,230
This will be the important
stage of treatment

412
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,440
to help us understand

413
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,020
and assess your
conditions better.

414
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:28,150
I'm going to perform
a brain CT scan

415
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:31,110
since it will help with
treatment efficiency.

416
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:33,110
But you don't need to be scared.

417
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:34,150
It won't hurt at all.

418
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,860
You just need to get inside
the device for a brief moment.

419
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,110
Are you ready?

420
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:09,770
Doctor.

421
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,940
I have something
I'd like to ask you.

422
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,110
You can ask anything.

423
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:24,110
I've read every page

424
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:27,110
of this notebook.

425
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,650
But could you please tell me

426
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,770
what am I doing here?

427
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,770
Do you remember anything
before you came here?

428
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,610
Answer my
question first, doctor.

429
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:46,610
Okay...

430
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:49,150
Please calm down, Alan.

431
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:52,110
If you still don't want to
tell me about something,

432
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,610
that's totally fine.

433
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,860
But you can trust me.

434
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:59,860
I'm your case's personal doctor.

435
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,610
That means I need to
know whatever happened.

436
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,900
That day...

437
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,150
I saw the old man
ghost in the mirror.

438
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,820
But it wasn't like
the other times.

439
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:22,980
It wasn't?

440
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,190
How?

441
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,980
It seemed like he was trying
to communicate with me.

442
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,900
so I waited in front of the mirror.

443
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:35,190
You think you're tough.

444
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,770
Come out and get me!

445
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,770
But my dad got very mad.

446
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:40,900
Very, very mad.

447
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,730
He ran all around the house,

448
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:45,230
smashing every mirror.

449
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,270
Alan.

450
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,980
Did you wait in
front of the mirror?

451
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,650
To communicate back at him?

452
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,270
Why would you do that?

453
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:00,900
I just thought that

454
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,610
I might learn something

455
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:06,230
if I had the
courage to face him.

456
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,070
Are you aware

457
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,860
that everything should go

458
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,020
according to the treatment plan?

459
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:16,270
Also, everyone
wants the best for you

460
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,610
and hopes to see you get better.

461
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:22,690
Does it matter, doctor?

462
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:25,230
In the end, I'm still not cured.

463
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,650
I still haven't gotten better.

464
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:29,480
- I don't want to see him anymore!
- It's going to need some time.

465
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,360
If you cooperate,

466
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:34,320
everything can proceed
according to the steps

467
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,520
that planned.

468
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:36,980
Steps?

469
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,110
What goals have you set?

470
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:40,570
For what?

471
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,020
For telling me that I'm crazy?

472
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,360
I didn't say anything like that.

473
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,440
Was everything I
saw just an illusion?

474
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,480
Alan, calm down.

475
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,480
Now, what I'm trying to say

476
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,860
is that you, Alan,

477
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,360
shouldn't skip the steps

478
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:57,230
or do anything rashly

479
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:58,980
like what you did.

480
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,900
Do you know that your father
was very worried about you

481
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,480
every time something happened?

482
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:10,360
And I knew that he's been trying

483
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,940
in order to get you better.

484
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,820
Wait.

485
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,400
Every time something happened?

486
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,480
Yes, every time.

487
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:26,570
What did you mean?

488
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,440
It meant that...

489
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,690
This isn't the first time that
something like this has happened.

490
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,190
And I understand as well why,

491
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:39,150
on that day, your father...

492
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:40,900
had a breakdown.

493
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:43,770
Because your father
really cared for you.

494
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:46,360
He was afraid that something
bad would happen to you,

495
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,070
so he didn't want you
to become obsessed

496
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:50,400
with the illusion,
like that one time.

497
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,900
That one time?

498
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,270
When was "that
one time," doctor?

499
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,020
Huh?

500
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,690
It was when you sleep-walked

501
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:01,110
down from your bedroom

502
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,150
to the storage room,
which had mirrors

503
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:04,570
everywhere.

504
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:06,230
And then you...

505
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:07,400
locked yourself in there.

506
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,900
That's not true.

507
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:11,150
Not true.

508
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:12,820
I've never done that.

509
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,650
You and dad

510
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:16,650
worked together and
made up a story to trick me.

511
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:18,690
Everything I said has happened.

512
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,110
- No.
- But it has.

513
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,110
It's not true.

514
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,320
It has happened.

515
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:28,650
You're lying.

516
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:29,900
You and dad

517
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,860
worked together
to trick me, right?

518
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,770
Everything has
happened before, Alan.

519
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:34,900
It hasn't.

520
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,440
Why would I lie to you?

521
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,900
Where's the evidence, Doc?

522
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,440
If it's really happened, where?

523
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:41,980
Here, where?

524
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,150
I've read every single page.

525
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,400
Where, Doc?

526
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,230
If it was really important,

527
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:49,320
then you must have
told me to write it down.

528
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,480
Like all the other times.

529
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:51,980
If it was so important,

530
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:53,690
how could I not
have written it here?

531
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:54,860
Alan.

532
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,900
- Alan.
- Where?

533
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,110
You're lying to me, huh?

534
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:59,230
- Alan, get a hold on to yourself.
- You're nothing but bullshit!

535
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:01,270
Would you please calm now?

536
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,320
It will...

537
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,730
It will pass, just like it has every time.

538
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,400
Every time?

539
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:10,940
That one time?

540
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,440
Just like it has?

541
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,650
What "every time"?

542
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,230
What did you mean?

543
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,650
Has all of this happened before?

544
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:20,190
What?

545
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:21,650
What is this?

546
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,190
You and dad worked
together and made up a story

547
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,650
to trick me, huh?

548
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,900
No.

549
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,440
I won't ever believe
anything you say.

550
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,980
I'll never trust anyone in this place.

551
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,110
This journal

552
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,270
is all a lie!

553
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,820
Look...

554
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,730
You tricked me!

555
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:40,400
If you're not ready to perform CT scan,

556
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,440
then we don't have to.

557
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:42,860
We can do this another day.

558
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:43,730
No.

559
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:44,400
I won't.

560
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,070
Fuck the CT scan.

561
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,230
And I won't ever believe...

562
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:48,570
Enough!

563
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,320
This is a waste of time.

564
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,360
I'm getting tired of listening.

565
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:55,110
If the patient refuses
treatment, then let him go.

566
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,480
I've seen many cases like this.

567
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,820
Shouldn't we be spending
our time on willing patients

568
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,400
If he doesn't want to be scanned

569
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,070
just let him be.

570
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:09,860
This is a waste of our valuable time.

571
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,400
Doctor.

572
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:12,730
You know how it is.

573
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:15,320
If the patient refuses to
receive treatment here,

574
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,150
then simply send
them to an asylum,

575
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:20,110
maybe they have more
severe methods of treatment.

576
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,520
For the patient who's
unaware of their illness,

577
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:24,190
I think this is an
excellent idea.

578
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:26,860
Just inject them with
tranquilizers to numb them.

579
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,230
Or maybe put them
in electrotherapy.

580
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,820
We don't have to waste
time arguing anymore.

581
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:36,860
Oh, Doctor.

582
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,480
It's almost 3 p.m. now.

583
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,860
There's another
patient in the queue too.

584
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:42,570
So, how're we doing this?

585
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,480
Should I send them
the name right now?

586
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,270
So we can move on.

587
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,400
So we can go our seperate ways.

588
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,320
We don't need to do
the scanning anymore.

589
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,020
It seems pointless to me.

590
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:56,690
Send?

591
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:59,440
Send the name where?

592
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,070
The asylum, Alan.

593
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,650
If this place can not treat you,

594
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:06,650
we may have to refer
you to another facility.

595
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,110
Isn't that right, Dr.Nil?

596
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,360
Please tell him.

597
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,690
Are you guys trying to trick me?

598
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,440
It won't work, I'm not scared.

599
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:35,520
Alan.

600
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:36,570
Listen to me.

601
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,440
CT scan

602
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,520
is a basic procedure.

603
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:42,150
You still gotta do it anyway.

604
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,320
No other way around.

605
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,520
Please don't waste anymore time.

606
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:48,730
Right, Doc?

607
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,320
All of us

608
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,230
are following the
treatment steps.

609
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:56,110
We only need to scan your brain.

610
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,570
There may not be
any anomalies at all.

611
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:14,730
Hold up, Doc.

612
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,440
What's this about?

613
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:19,270
Pete.

614
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,070
The way you spoke
to the patient...

615
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,610
Do you still want to work here?

616
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,940
Well, he's agreeing to
be scanned now, right?

617
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,230
Do you realize

618
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:32,980
that what you did could worsen his condition?

619
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,940
Then I apologize

620
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,520
for causing trouble.

621
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,440
Pete.

622
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:45,770
Yes, Doctor?

623
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,610
Go look after Alan

624
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,070
and walk him back to his room.

625
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:57,940
We'll read the CT
scan result tomorrow.

626
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:00,070
Yes, doctor.

627
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,190
Get up slowly, Alan.

628
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,230
Come, let me help.

629
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:33,520
Have you recently
started working here?

630
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:34,940
Yeah,

631
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,940
this is my first
day working here.

632
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,440
You know,

633
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,860
you're the kind of nurse that...

634
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,520
That what?

635
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,190
Am I allowed to
say foul-mouthed?

636
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,400
Everyone who knows me

637
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:48,900
has said the same thing.

638
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:52,940
When we met in the cafeteria,

639
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:55,150
you gave me a greeting nod.

640
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:56,940
That seemed very gentle.

641
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,400
Unlike what had just happened.

642
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,650
So who did you nod to?

643
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:02,570
Let me tell you.

644
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:05,940
I nodded to the old man
who walked past you.

645
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,820
An old man who
walked past my back?

646
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,480
Who was he?

647
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:14,270
Umm.

648
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,570
That old man.

649
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:20,110
Just forget it, Alan.

650
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:22,980
Pete didn't answer.

651
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,020
But it made me certain that

652
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:28,520
Pete saw the old man's
ghost following behind me.

653
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:31,320
That means it was
actually a ghost,

654
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,650
not just a figment
of my imagination.

655
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:36,440
But how could Pete see it?

656
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,980
Even with no mirrors.

657
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,520
Alan.

658
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,320
You sleeping?

659
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:04,940
It's me.

660
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:12,270
Win?

661
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,520
Win.

662
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,820
Yeah, it's me.

663
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,570
What's wrong?

664
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,110
You alright?

665
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:27,730
I can't do this.

666
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,360
I'm scared.

667
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,190
I'm so scared.

668
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:42,270
You saw that old
man ghost again?

669
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:51,770
It's okay.

670
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:54,070
Everything will be fine.

671
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,520
I'm right here.

672
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:16,610
It's okay.

673
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,270
I feel so much better

674
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:27,900
with you here.

675
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:31,400
What happened to you?

676
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,400
Tell me.

677
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,690
What made you so scared?

678
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:39,650
Well...

679
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:44,110
It showed up to me again.

680
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:47,770
In the mirror over there.

681
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,070
Oh.

682
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:53,980
You got a good look at it?

683
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:58,940
Yeah.

684
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:05,020
I can't take this anymore.

685
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:07,980
I'm scared.

686
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,150
I can't go on like this.

687
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:11,900
It's alright.

688
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,360
I'm here.

689
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,230
Have you ever wondered

690
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,440
if the old man that you talked about

691
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,150
would show up

692
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,610
when I'm with you?

693
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,320
What do you mean?

694
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,440
You and me,

695
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:43,270
shall we go look in
the mirror together?

696
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,860
If you see it, don't worry.

697
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,650
I'm right beside you.

698
00:40:58,940 --> 00:40:59,940
Will it be okay?

699
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,070
But if we see it,

700
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:12,190
don't leave me.

701
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:15,190
Yeah.

702
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,320
I got you.

703
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:20,570
Come.

704
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:52,770
Hey.

705
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:54,150
What?

706
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,440
What did you see?

707
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,730
I noticed you were pretty quiet.

708
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,360
Come take a look.

709
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:00,940
Asshole.

710
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:02,440
Don't ever do that again.

711
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,400
You startled me.

712
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:17,270
I don't see anything.

713
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:26,230
What was that?

714
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:28,270
I dunno.

715
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,320
Hey...

716
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,320
Come on.

717
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:42,690
What do you see?

718
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:45,770
You see anything?

719
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,020
Nothing.

720
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:50,820
Oh.

721
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:53,610
There's nothing here.

722
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:54,610
Nothing at all.

723
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:55,690
What are you doing in there?

724
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:57,900
What are you doing?

725
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:00,070
What are you doing?

726
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:00,900
Someone's coming.

727
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:01,940
Mr.Alan.

728
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:03,820
Mr.Alan!

729
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,110
Under the bed, quick!

730
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:06,110
Mr.Alan.

731
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,480
Mr.Alan.

732
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:10,230
Mr.Alan.

733
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:12,690
Mr.Alan!

734
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:19,070
Mr.Alan.

735
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,570
Get up, Mr.Alan.

736
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:22,770
Hurry up.

737
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:23,940
Follow me.

738
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,270
Wait, where are we going?

739
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,480
Please follow me.

740
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:40,020
Hurry!

741
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:41,820
Over here.

742
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:44,940
Wait.

743
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:46,070
Where are we going?

744
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,400
Right this way.
