1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,540
Then this place is a hospital?

2
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,670
Someone brought us here

3
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:14,750
and forgot that we were here.

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,129
I may have been brought for treatment

5
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:17,580
after seeing the old
man's ghost in the mirror.

6
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:18,460
Remember!

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,630
I wonder if the psychological treatment

8
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,540
would stop me from
seeing the ghost.

9
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,750
The way you spoke to the patient...

10
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,460
Do you still want to work here?

11
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,880
Can you please tell me

12
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:27,880
what I'm doing here?

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,710
Alan, calm down.

14
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,830
everything should go
according to the treatment plan?

15
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,830
If you still don't want
to tell me, then it's fine.

16
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,080
But you can trust me.

17
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:34,790
You're lying.

18
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,210
It will pass, just like it has every time.

19
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,210
What "every time"?

20
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:37,960
Tell me, Doc!

21
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,460
Mr. Alan, hurry.

22
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,710
Follow me.

23
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,500
Remember.

24
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:52,539
Come back to me.

25
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,170
Remember!

26
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,960
Remember.

27
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,170
Come back to me.

28
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,000
Remember.

29
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,380
Alan.

30
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,419
Pete?

31
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,630
What are you doing here?

32
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,580
An...

33
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:18,079
An elderly nurse

34
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,130
brought me here.

35
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,500
A nurse?

36
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,920
Yes.

37
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,380
An elderly nurse's brought me here.

38
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,130
Which of the nurses, Alan?

39
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:32,670
I'm not sure exactly.

40
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:34,920
She brought me here,

41
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,670
and then she disappeared.

42
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,670
Alan.

43
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,790
Tonight's my shift.

44
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,630
There's nobody else but me.

45
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:43,000
I said there was.

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,040
She brought me here, and then she vanished.

47
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,420
Or...

48
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,630
Maybe she went inside that room.

49
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,829
I could hear someone yelling too, Pete.

50
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:51,829
Alan.

51
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,210
There's a patient resting in that room.

52
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,750
And there aren't any elderly nurses

53
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,880
during tonight's shift.

54
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,170
I said there was!

55
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,460
She really brought me here!

56
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,130
Alan, calm down.

57
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,420
Alan...

58
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,130
Was there anything else you saw?

59
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,380
Nothing else.

60
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,170
I'll take you back to your room, okay?

61
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,500
Let's go.

62
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,710
Pete's told me about last night.

63
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,920
You shouldn't wander alone at night.

64
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:37,790
I know.

65
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,290
But someone really did lead me out of my room.

66
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,329
Do you think I made it up?

67
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,329
Are you certain that it wasn't

68
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,170
another episode of sleepwalking?

69
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:53,079
There was

70
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:55,040
an elderly nurse

71
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,630
who walked into the room, called me,

72
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,130
and brought me out there!

73
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,210
It wasn't a dream, Doctor.

74
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,460
If you insist, then I won't argue.

75
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,750
So, may I ask?

76
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,920
Do you think this incident was related

77
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,329
to the ghost in the mirror sightings?

78
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,080
I don't know.

79
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,080
Are you still afraid of the old man in the mirror?

80
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,580
Alan.

81
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,000
It's because you were afraid to see,

82
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,750
so you..

83
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,420
saw the things you were scared of.

84
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,500
Our brains are only capable
of functioning in a positive way.

85
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,580
Do you know what provokes

86
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,380
the thoughts in our brain the most?

87
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,330
I don't know.

88
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,750
Emotions.

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
That is,

90
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,460
if you keep getting scared

91
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,210
and want it out of your sight,

92
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,460
you will see it more frequently.

93
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,080
But, doctor.

94
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,790
If what you said was true,

95
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,920
then how could Pete

96
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:14,920
also see the old man?

97
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Come again?

98
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,170
Pete told me

99
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,750
he saw the old man following me.

100
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,170
which means

101
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,460
what I saw couldn't
have been an illusion.

102
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,540
When did this happen, Pete?

103
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,420
On that day, Doctor O took me to the cafeteria,

104
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,080
and we came across Alan.

105
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,290
That's it, the cafeteria.

106
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,170
It could have been

107
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,960
any other old man, right?

108
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,540
But...

109
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,460
Alan.

110
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:54,420
When you saw

111
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,580
the old man.

112
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,250
I'm not saying that what you saw

113
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,290
wasn't a real thing.

114
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,290
But the visual

115
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,880
and interpretation processes

116
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,500
might have been what
caused you to see the old man.

117
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,380
Are you...

118
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:09,790
still with me?

119
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,250
I don't understand.

120
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,630
Let me give an example.

121
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,540
If I tell you

122
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,080
"Don't think about cats."

123
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,170
Try not to think about cats.

124
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:24,130
So?

125
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,040
Are you thinking about cats right now?

126
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,290
Get it?

127
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,170
This is why is said
our brains only function

128
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:32,000
in a positive way.

129
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,630
Before we could stop thinking about cats,

130
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,710
thoughts of them
would always come first.

131
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,580
Take a look at this.

132
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,750
What do you see?

133
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:42,920
Eight lines.

134
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,420
How about now?

135
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,420
"Ant".

136
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,500
They are eight straight lines.

137
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,040
Look.

138
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,920
"A"

139
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,040
uses three lines.

140
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,290
"N"

141
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,170
three lines.

142
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:57,540
"T"

143
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,630
another two lines.

144
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The total is eight.

145
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,170
they just weren't arranged

146
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,170
in the same way as the first one I wrote.

147
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,500
What does "ANT" mean?

148
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,500
Ants.

149
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,040
What are you visualizing
in your head right now?

150
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,830
I'm seeing the ants.

151
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:19,790
They're everywhere.

152
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:22,670
Here,

153
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,830
This one, we called it

154
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,420
"Visual Recognition"

155
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:30,040
It's the interpretation process

156
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,630
of the images our eyes perceive.

157
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,960
Simply speaking,

158
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,830
The visual process that
our eyes can perceive

159
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,170
is one thing.

160
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,630
When our eyes see,

161
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,130
they send signals to the brain.

162
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,580
Our brains

163
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,790
will then project how the
images we saw look like.

164
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,330
Then we'll be able to understand

165
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,880
what the images mean.

166
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:54,710
We use a different part

167
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
of our brain.

168
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,830
You get it, right?

169
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:01,790
I guess.

170
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,130
Alan, I believe that

171
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,250
you actually saw something,

172
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,380
but you brain interpreted it as an old man.

173
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,380
And...

174
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,880
it might not be a ghost at all.

175
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,290
I would like you to practice with this.

176
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,960
Try looking at them

177
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,540
from many different angles.

178
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,960
So, can I go now?

179
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,000
Sure, make yourself comfortable.

180
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,080
Have you informed Pete
how important it is to be careful

181
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:46,170
with words when
speaking to the patient?

182
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,580
Dr.O has already told me.

183
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,170
I just didn't think it
through at the time.

184
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:51,170
Didn't think it through?

185
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,290
Explain to me how you
didn't think things through.

186
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:58,630
Well,

187
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,630
Alan asked something
out of the blue.

188
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,960
I was unprepared

189
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,000
and hastily replied without

190
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,420
So, you've never considered
this a serious matter?

191
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,710
Everything we've been doing?

192
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,290
We hired you

193
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,750
because we noticed you were
an enthusiastic young man.

194
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,920
Alright?

195
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:17,420
Do not dissapoint us.

196
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,210
Anything else you said to Alan

197
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,790
that we don't know about?

198
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,830
There's nothing else, doctor.

199
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:30,000
I apologize to both of you

200
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,290
for causing complications.

201
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,540
I'd like to remind you,

202
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,420
every case here

203
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,130
is extremely delicate.

204
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,420
From the outside,
it may seem normal.

205
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,210
But every word we say,

206
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,920
everything we do.

207
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,250
Our expression, our tones.

208
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,250
Our emotions.

209
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,580
They all have an impact

210
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,000
on our patients' trust.

211
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,710
I need you to be more
considerative about your duty.

212
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,540
Dr.Nil.

213
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,040
Maybe Pete's too new for this place.

214
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,630
As for other matters,

215
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,710
Pete has never failed to fulfill his tasks.

216
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,290
It might have been my fault too.

217
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:25,210
I consider you to be in charge of him.

218
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,290
So if something happens

219
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,130
next time,

220
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,670
I'll need you to be responsible for it.

221
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,500
Yes, sir.

222
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:38,710
Don't let this happen again.

223
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,170
I know

224
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,630
what I did was wrong,

225
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,960
but he didn't have to be so harsh with me.

226
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,880
Right?

227
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,750
Hey.

228
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,540
What's that look on your face?

229
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,040
You think I had it coming?

230
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,380
What makes you say that?

231
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,330
Dunno, I just wanna vent on someone.

232
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,630
Hey, you.

233
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:23,750
Come on.

234
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,460
We all made mistakes.

235
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,460
Hmm?

236
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,080
Mm-hmm.

237
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,750
I'm sorry

238
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,210
for getting you into trouble.

239
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,500
A terrified man.

240
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,250
Dead people's graveyard.

241
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:09,330
A clock.

242
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,420
This isn't that hard.

243
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
An old person.

244
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,380
Remember.

245
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,170
Come back to me.

246
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,040
Remember.

247
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,290
Remember!

248
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:14,290
Remember.

249
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,830
What happened, tell me.

250
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,420
It showed up again

251
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:35,290
in the mirror right there.

252
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,790
You got a good look at it?

253
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,170
Remember.

254
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,580
Remember.

255
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,830
If you won't come out,

256
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,960
then you'll be staying here with me all night!

257
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,170
Get the hell out here!

258
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,630
Remember.

259
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:58,250
Remember.

260
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:01,330
Remember.

261
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,130
I can't take this anymore.

262
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,500
I need to face him

263
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,920
and ask him what he wants from me.

264
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,920
Alan.

265
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,460
Alan.

266
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,580
What's up.

267
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,920
What are you doing?

268
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,960
Leave me alone.

269
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,790
You left me last time.

270
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,540
When was that again?

271
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,040
Are you playing dumb?

272
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:10,130
I was referring to the night
the nurse ghost took me away.

273
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,880
You know?

274
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,580
Everytime something happened,

275
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,000
you were always gone.

276
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,420
I was scared shitless.

277
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,000
Come on, dude.

278
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Don't touch me!

279
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,670
Hear me out.

280
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,830
I never wanted to leave you.

281
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,580
Was that a reason

282
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,750
or just an excuse?

283
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,000
I know you're thinking I'm making an excuse,

284
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,380
but please hear me out first.

285
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,880
If I really didn't care about you,

286
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,170
why would I bother trying to explain?

287
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,250
Let's hear it then.

288
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,500
I already went out looking for you.

289
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:46,710
But when I got there, I couldn't see you.

290
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,040
You really did?

291
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,960
You're not lying?

292
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,710
Yeah,

293
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Why would I do that?

294
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,040
I didn't see you or anyone else there.

295
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,540
Besides, that place was so dark.

296
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,710
Freaking terrifying.

297
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,000
I could get scared too, you know that?

298
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,670
I'm still feeling goosebumps right now.

299
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,500
Is that all you need
to get goosebumps?

300
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,290
Wasn't even close to what I've seen.

301
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,380
Or...

302
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,830
Is baby Alan afraid of ghosts?

303
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,000
Stop.

304
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,380
Stay where you are.

305
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,330
I'm still mad at you, okay?

306
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,540
Still scared of mirrors?

307
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,540
Yeah,

308
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,170
because you left me.

309
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:47,830
I'm sorry.

310
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,580
What's this?

311
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,580
The cards.

312
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,960
Dr.Nil told me practice

313
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,710
the Vi..Visual

314
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,920
Visual Recognition.

315
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,750
But, I don't think it work.

316
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,960
"Visual"?

317
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,540
They're just cartoon cards.

318
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,920
But there's actually
something off about this place.

319
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,710
You also were just terrorized
by the ghost of a nurse.

320
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:24,579
I've got an idea.

321
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,790
I'll help you find out

322
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,040
about that nurse.

323
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,170
Consider this an apology.

324
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,290
Find out, how?

325
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,880
Come, follow me.

326
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Hey, wait!

327
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:37,880
Win.

328
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,460
What about me?

329
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,580
Just climb down after me.

330
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:45,460
Is it that hard?

331
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,040
Hurry.

332
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,080
I'm not doing this.

333
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,130
I'll just meet you downstairs.

334
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,380
Asides from ghosts,

335
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:54,790
you also scared of height?

336
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:57,420
How old are you now?

337
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,960
Come on.

338
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,920
Quick.

339
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:08,330
Whatever.

340
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:11,830
Is this the right way?

341
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:12,960
It's this way.

342
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,290
Careful.

343
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,630
I've been climbing here every day.

344
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:30,170
I...

345
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,210
Easy.

346
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,500
I'm not gonna make it.

347
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:35,210
Not possible.

348
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,630
Got it, come quickly.

349
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:54,630
See?

350
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,330
I told you it's dangerous.

351
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,080
Jerk.

352
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:58,130
You're the one who's careless.

353
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,380
Careful.

354
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,330
So

355
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,710
how did you know about this place?

356
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,830
I've never known

357
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,920
there's a place like this.

358
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,250
Block one was the first building here,

359
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,960
so its state now is a bit old.

360
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,210
My room is around this wing.

361
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,880
Sometimes I like to
come down for a walk.

362
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,920
A walk?

363
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,710
This place is really scary.

364
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:51,830
What makes you think it's
okay to walk here alone?

365
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,630
I haven't seen anyone around here.

366
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:01,460
When the new buildings were built,

367
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,080
no one used this place anymore.

368
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,330
As a result,

369
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,130
the atmosphere is rather creepy.

370
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,580
Let alone patients,

371
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:13,710
even nurses are reluctant to
come here unless necessary.

372
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,920
I've heard

373
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,170
they're planning to demolish it soon.

374
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,790
They're just waiting for
another founder to die first.

375
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,290
Another founder?

376
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,040
Who is he?

377
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,500
There were two doctors.

378
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,250
One has died,

379
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,630
and the other is very old.

380
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:47,460
You sure knows a lot.

381
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,000
Who did you hear that from?

382
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:50,920
Everyone's been talking about it.

383
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,250
Did you hear something?

384
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,040
Hear what?

385
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,080
Someone's coming this way.

386
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:38,830
This is awkward.

387
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,960
I should move a bit.

388
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:18,330
Let's move.

389
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:10,330
Hey.

390
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,500
Check this out.

391
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,630
I don't think there are any
other nurses apart from this.

392
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,130
You find her?

393
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,580
No, nothing.

394
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:29,210
What's this board.

395
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,380
A Memorial

396
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,420
to the Hospital Founding Day?

397
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,420
Memorial board for honoring

398
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,630
all previous staff members
who have passed away.

399
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:45,750
All of the photos are in sepia.

400
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,040
That's why they were called Memorial.

401
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:08,290
What's wrong?

402
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:12,670
That's her.

403
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,080
That's the nurse ghost.

404
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:16,250
In the middle.

405
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,500
That's her.

406
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:19,670
That one.

407
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,210
Who's there?

408
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,960
What do we do?

409
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,250
Run!

410
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:32,710
You...

411
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,920
Let's go!

412
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,880
Let's go!

413
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:37,500
Are you okay?

414
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,500
Hey!

415
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:39,670
What are you doing?

416
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,540
Let go!

417
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:42,670
Let me go!

418
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,500
Win!

419
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:48,710
Win.

420
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:51,170
Win.

421
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:57,080
Could you walk me through

422
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:58,710
how you got there?

423
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,580
Before asking me,

424
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,710
you should tell me

425
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,920
who that nurse ghost was?

426
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,380
That nurse's been dead.

427
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:16,040
I saw her picture on that board.

428
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,040
You better tell me the truth.

429
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,170
I've never seen that nurse before.

430
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,580
Never had memories of her in my brain.

431
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,460
So,

432
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,250
how could she not be a ghost?

433
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,250
Don't try to hide it from me.

434
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,500
Are you sure

435
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:36,130
you've never seen this nurse before?

436
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,460
Have you never?

437
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:40,880
And

438
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,420
are you also sure that

439
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,580
you've never forgotten anything?

440
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:49,630
Sure you've never seen her?

441
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Alan.

442
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:55,460
You have an issue with memory.

443
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,080
Maybe you've seen her

444
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,040
in the past,

445
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,670
but you just couldn't to remember.

446
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:02,170
Am I right?

447
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:04,500
Try to think slowly,

448
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:06,630
perhaps you'll be able to remember

449
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:08,460
that you've met her at some point.

450
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:10,380
Let me ask you again.

451
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:12,750
How did you get yourself in that building?

452
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,710
I don't know.

453
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:34,170
If something happened,

454
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,170
you can let me know.

455
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,330
I'd like us to be more trusting.

456
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:46,500
Do you know what's the most
important thing about treatment?

457
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:49,330
I don't know.

458
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,290
Please just give me the answer.

459
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:54,420
It's the doctor and patient relationship.

460
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,040
The trust between a patient

461
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,080
and a doctor.

462
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,500
That's what's most important.

463
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,130
You see, if a patient

464
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:05,330
does not trust a doctor,

465
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:07,210
the treatment will fail regardless.

466
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,880
Do you wish to no longer be afraid?

467
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:17,000
So, if you wish to get better.

468
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,880
From this moment on,

469
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:21,790
would you please trust me?

470
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:33,000
Tell me the truth about everything.

471
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,880
If I do that,

472
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,380
will I be normal again?

473
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,040
You will.

474
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,500
Do you

475
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,580
have something to say to me?

476
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:22,790
I don't.

477
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,960
I just have the feeling

478
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,250
that you are waiting for

479
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,670
someone to sit with you.

480
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,170
May I join you?

481
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Sure,

482
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,040
please have a seat.

483
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,880
I'm Si.

484
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,580
I'm Alan.

485
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,920
Have you

486
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,000
been here a long time?

487
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Yes.

488
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,080
Have your family,

489
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,580
friends,

490
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:04,250
or other people ever come to visit you?

491
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,420
I once had a husband,

492
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,460
but he died a long time ago.

493
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:18,460
But he never goes anywhere, actually.

494
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,920
What...

495
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,420
did you mean?

496
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,960
I can still feel

497
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,580
that he's right here,

498
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:31,830
so much so

499
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:34,170
that I get confused sometimes.

500
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,250
Confused,

501
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
you say?

502
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,670
When two people

503
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,830
were the only ones in each other's lives

504
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,250
and one of them

505
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,580
had to pass away,

506
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:57,000
the other would be left

507
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,750
with an empty space

508
00:29:58,790 --> 00:29:59,790
inside the house

509
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:02,420
until they started to question

510
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,960
if they were ghosts

511
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,290
or dead people.

512
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:08,790
So it's not them,

513
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,790
but us,

514
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:13,330
who have been sent
to an afterlife world.

515
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,460
Do you believe that

516
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,540
you have been dead?

517
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,040
It's not like that.

518
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,580
I was just

519
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:28,540
using metaphors to describe loneliness.

520
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,750
You must be very lonely.

521
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,000
Being lonely is one part.

522
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,540
It's the pain of missing someone.

523
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:43,290
The pain

524
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:44,960
of missing someone?

525
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,040
One of my senior

526
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,040
once said

527
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:54,040
The sadness that was caused by missing someone

528
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,960
was the receipt that time had given.

529
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,750
The more we missed each other,

530
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:01,040
the more it meant that

531
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,380
the times we shared together

532
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:04,330
were filled with joy.

533
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:09,170
Sorry

534
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,790
you had to listen to

535
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:11,920
my meaningless rant.

536
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:15,210
Not problem at all.

537
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,540
I actually liked it.

538
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:19,420
My senior came up with it,

539
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,460
just like I said.

540
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:24,000
That senior of yours was a very wise man.

541
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,460
Amazing use of the metaphors.

542
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,080
Yes,

543
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,920
he was very wise.

544
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,460
Have you ever felt lonely?

545
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:49,330
I don't know.

546
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,290
What about you?

547
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:56,330
If we had someone special,

548
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,380
regardless of where they were,

549
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,750
we'd always miss them,

550
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,830
yearn for them.

551
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:07,380
When we weren't seeing them,

552
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,460
our hearts broke.

553
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:15,330
Have you ever

554
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:17,500
missed someone?

555
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:27,540
There's one person, actually.

556
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:32,080
But I don't know where he went.

557
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:35,580
Where did he go?

558
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:39,040
Would you mind if I ask?

559
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,750
Sure you can.

560
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,170
Honestly, I don't really know

561
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,920
he went.

562
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,420
If this were to happen to you,

563
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,330
would you be mad?

564
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,790
if someone suddenly left you?

565
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,250
Sometimes

566
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,460
it was hard

567
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,670
to embrace the goodbyes.

568
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,960
But the people who left

569
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,750
might have had their own reasons.

570
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,080
If you get the chance to ask,

571
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,580
then you better ask them,

572
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,630
so you wouldn't have to regret

573
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:32,500
not asking, like I did.

574
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,670
Mr. Alan, Ms. Si.

575
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,290
Now's the time to return to your room.

576
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:41,330
I'm about to do so.

577
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,290
What's that sound.

578
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,540
Oh.

579
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,790
And I thought you were a ghost.

580
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:18,290
You hungry?

581
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:19,830
I see you're looking for snacks.

582
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,920
I was a little hungry,

583
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,540
so I checked the refrigerator

584
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:25,830
to see what was there to eat.

585
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:28,330
Then,

586
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:30,290
should I make you a sandwich?

587
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:33,790
Would that be okay?

588
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,080
We have to try.

589
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:45,630
Come.

590
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:00,420
How hungry are you?

591
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,130
Not too much.

592
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,670
Just a little bit.

593
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,420
Here you go.

594
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,250
Thanks.

595
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,080
Are you afraid of ghosts?

596
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,920
When you switched on the light,

597
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:34,210
I noticed

598
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:35,630
your face was really pale.

599
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,920
No.

600
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,130
I'm not scared.

601
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:49,830
Oh.

602
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:51,670
Are you sleepy?

603
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:55,750
You're on shift tonight.

604
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,330
Why didn't you get enough sleep?

605
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,830
I had something on my mind,

606
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,670
so I couldn't sleep.

607
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Don't tell me

608
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,170
you've been feeling down

609
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:10,460
since the doctor scolded you.

610
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,210
Yes.

611
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,460
Pete.

612
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,790
In the workplace,

613
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:29,500
Anybody can make mistakes at any time.

614
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,250
You don't need to overthink it.

615
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,040
How am I supposed to stop overthinking?

616
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:36,880
If you were chastised for a mistake at work,

617
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:38,750
wouldn't you overthink it.

618
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,040
Given what the doctor said,

619
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,500
when I came to think of it

620
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,540
I may have really worsened
the patient's condition.

621
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,920
Listen to me carefully.

622
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:52,960
The treatment we've been carrying out

623
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:55,580
is uncertain as to

624
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,250
whether we've taken the correct path.

625
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:01,710
As for you,

626
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:04,000
You were flawed

627
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,670
in not doing as the Dr.Nil ordered

628
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,210
but you were not flawed in being a nurse.

629
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,630
You genuinely cared about the patients.

630
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,420
Understand?

631
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,920
Yes.

632
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:24,000
Since you're sleepy,

633
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:25,750
how about this?

634
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,710
Wanna recharge our energy?

635
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,380
Recharge the energy?

636
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,330
What do you mean, doc?

637
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:34,210
What do I have to do?

638
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Alright.

639
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,960
Stand up.

640
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,460
Come on, stand up.

641
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,460
We really doing this?

642
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:45,710
What..

643
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,080
what is this?

644
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,960
A free hug.

645
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:50,830
You have no idea what this is?

646
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,040
Hey,

647
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:56,330
stop being shy.

648
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,000
I've hugged Doctor Nil too.

649
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:02,790
Okay.

650
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,580
Thank you.

651
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:29,580
That definitely made me feel better.

652
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:31,460
So,

653
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,670
you feel awake now?

654
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,880
I would say

655
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,920
the best way to rest

656
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:39,960
is to take a nap.

657
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:43,670
Tell you what,

658
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,330
I'll go get my documents

659
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,210
and report papers to work here.

660
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,500
I'll be right back.

661
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:49,750
Alright.

662
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:51,500
Then I'm going to

663
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,880
take a little nap.

664
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,380
Go away.

665
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:52,750
I need to talk to you.

666
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:54,460
I'm not talking to you.

667
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,960
You should go.

668
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,250
Can you open this for me?

669
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:10,170
What do you want?

670
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,170
I know you're mad at me

671
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:17,130
but please hear my reasons out.

672
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,580
Stop.

673
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,920
Stay where you are.

674
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:24,290
Don't come inside.

675
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,960
When I left you that day,

676
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,040
I never wanted to leave you.

677
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:36,460
I had reasons

678
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:38,920
for leaving so often.

679
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Please understand.

680
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
What reasons?

681
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:46,830
explain now.

682
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:51,960
I've caused trouble,

683
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,000
so the doctors and the nurses

684
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,500
keep an extra eye on me.

685
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,210
If I get caught,

686
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,790
I have no idea how they will punish me.

687
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:09,170
Worst case, they might detain me

688
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,920
and prevent me from seeing you ever again.

689
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,880
Time's up, Win.

690
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:18,920
I gave you one minute,

691
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:22,920
but I haven't a single sorry from you.

692
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:27,130
Stop.

693
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:28,250
I've had enough.

694
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:30,380
I'm sorry!

695
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:32,790
That's enough,

696
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:33,790
go away.

697
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:34,830
Get lost.

698
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:37,460
Get out.

699
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,380
I'll say it to you as many times as you want.

700
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,330
But

701
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,500
can you please talk to me?

702
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:43,420
Get out.

703
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:45,960
Alan.

704
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,500
Get out.

705
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,500
Win!

706
00:41:59,130 --> 00:41:59,500
Win!

707
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:21,920
Alan?

708
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,540
Alan.

709
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,630
Where are you going?

710
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:33,790
No going outside at night.

711
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:35,210
Do you remember?

712
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:39,080
Well,

713
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:41,040
I lost my photo cards,

714
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:42,580
so I'm out here looking for them.

715
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:44,170
Photo cards?

716
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,290
You can look for them tomorrow.

717
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,000
I need to find them now.

718
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,580
If Dr.Nil sees them tomorrow,

719
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:53,880
I'm going to be in trouble.

720
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,670
Strange,

721
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:58,580
I've never seen you take
the photo cards out to play.

722
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:02,380
Alan.

723
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:09,500
I've never encountered
a situation like this before,

724
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:11,000
so I'm not sure what to do.

725
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,040
Yes.

726
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:16,330
I'm so sorry.

727
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:17,880
Win.

728
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:22,670
Win.

729
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:24,580
Win!

730
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,710
So you cared about me after all.

731
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:29,920
Win?

732
00:43:31,330 --> 00:43:32,380
Are you hurt?

733
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:40,960
You seem all right.

734
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:42,790
Just as I thought.

735
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,290
You made a really good run there.

736
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,290
Are you no longer mad at me?

737
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:50,630
Who says I am?

738
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:52,420
Let go.

739
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:53,790
Let go.

740
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,040
I said let me go!

741
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:55,830
Let go.

742
00:43:56,330 --> 00:43:57,330
I did.

743
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:07,540
Idiot.

744
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:08,790
That was all your effort?

745
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:10,790
Sorry.

746
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:16,960
You're not mad at me anymore?

747
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:20,130
No.

748
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,080
You're not mad anymore?

749
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,000
You were so mean to me.

750
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:41,210
You know

751
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:43,330
how worried I was

752
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:44,670
when you were gone?

753
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:46,540
I'm here now.

754
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:49,380
I never wanted to leave you.

755
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:06,880
I climbed the windows to see you,

756
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:10,130
avoiding the doctors and the nurses

757
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:14,790
all because I wanted to be with you.

758
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,500
But I had to leave that day

759
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,750
so I could see you again.

760
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:32,130
Did you mean

761
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,330
you would disappear like this again?

762
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:40,790
Mm-hmm.

763
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,580
But even if I disappear,

764
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:48,080
I will always come back to you.

765
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:49,670
Okay?

766
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:55,330
Promise me

767
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:58,040
you'll always come back for me.

768
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:00,790
Mm-hmm.

769
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:02,380
I promise.

770
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:11,000
You promised?

771
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:13,170
Mm-hmm.

772
00:46:13,330 --> 00:46:14,330
Got it.

773
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:23,500
Don't ever leave me like this again.

774
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:27,750
I won't go anywhere.
