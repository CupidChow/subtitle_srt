1
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,390
Once upon a time, a man had a
dream he was a floating butterfly.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,170
When the butterfly became weary,

3
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,460
it landed on the
branch and fell asleep.

4
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,420
When the butterfly slept,

5
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,920
the man woke up.

6
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,670
When the man fell
back asleep again,

7
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:28,170
the butterfly awakened.

8
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,130
When the butterfly
went to sleep,

9
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:31,460
the man'd awoken.

10
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,380
The man slept,

11
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,420
the butterfly awoke.

12
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,710
Over and over.

13
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:58,960
Alan...wait!

14
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,960
What now!

15
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,170
Are you never going to trust me?

16
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:03,830
Trust?

17
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:05,540
This word again, Win?

18
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,080
I once trusted you
the most, you know?

19
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:09,670
But so what?

20
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,830
You lied to me

21
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,539
even more than those fuckers!

22
00:01:17,539 --> 00:01:18,250
I'm not letting you go,

23
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,920
Don't you feel the
same way about me?

24
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,630
Do you realize how
much pain I've been in?

25
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:23,960
Hmm?

26
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,289
The lies from others
weren't that bad.

27
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:28,039
But the lies you told

28
00:01:28,539 --> 00:01:30,039
were the most agonizing!

29
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,630
And how could you be so sure

30
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,710
that the truth you've been seeking...

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
wouldn't hurt you?

32
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,580
What if it separates us?

33
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,330
You'd let that happen?

34
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:49,380
Let me tell you something, Win.

35
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:53,539
The lies

36
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,710
can never develop into love.

37
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,500
Will you let me go?

38
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,250
No.

39
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,250
Please don't go.

40
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:06,750
Help, help!

41
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,960
A patient is trying to escape!

42
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,750
Help me!

43
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:11,210
Keep your voice down!

44
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,290
Help!

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,290
I said, quiet.

46
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:14,920
Win.

47
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,920
Help, help!

48
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,540
This way!

49
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,460
Let go of me!

50
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:23,079
Help!

51
00:02:24,329 --> 00:02:25,329
Help!

52
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,920
Help.

53
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,920
Help, a patient is escaping!

54
00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:34,380
Help...

55
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,500
Does it hurt?

56
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,630
Please understand me.

57
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,380
But I must learn the truth today.

58
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:09,170
Patient's Medical Record.

59
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,290
Remember!

60
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,130
Catch him, quick!

61
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:32,210
Get him out!

62
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,380
Let go!

63
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,670
Let me go!

64
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,710
Release me.

65
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,920
Let go!

66
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,960
Let go...

67
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,170
Let go!

68
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,330
Let go!

69
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,500
Let...

70
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,080
Let me go now!

71
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,380
Let me go...

72
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,630
No!

73
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,630
Let go now!

74
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,880
Stay back!

75
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,500
Alan.

76
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:35,790
Hold him still.

77
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,500
Alan.

78
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,500
Alan.

79
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,130
Alan!

80
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,250
Let me go.

81
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,830
I'm sorry, Win.

82
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,080
Don't let them do this to me.

83
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,460
Win.

84
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,540
Win...

85
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,210
Win...

86
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,080
Ten seconds after
waking up from a dream

87
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,710
was like retaining
the water in the palms.

88
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,330
Despite your best efforts,

89
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:13,290
water would always seep through
the gap between your fingers.

90
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,920
It was the same with
the dream after I woke up.

91
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:21,630
The stories I dreamed about were
leaked out of my memory space.

92
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,960
Only lingering
feelings remained.

93
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:38,250
Similar to the
moisture on the palms.

94
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,420
Alan, you hungry?

95
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,380
Who are you?

96
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,380
Alan.

97
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,580
I'm your dad.

98
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,920
Here you go again.

99
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,210
Nightmare, was it?

100
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:17,130
I thought so.

101
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,920
You probably had a vivid dream.

102
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,580
that's why you wake
up confused this way.

103
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,130
Why...

104
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,290
Why can't I remember anything?

105
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:34,130
You have dementia, Alan.

106
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,580
But don't worry.

107
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:37,830
Just try to think slowly,

108
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,880
you'll recall eventually.

109
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,580
Let me help you with that.

110
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,420
It's alright.

111
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,540
You should have some rest.

112
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:23,380
How about a little medication
to help you feel better?

113
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:34,290
No, thank you.

114
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,250
I'm feeling better now.

115
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Well then...

116
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,130
Go get washed up,

117
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,670
then come have
breakfast downstairs.

118
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,630
Okay.

119
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,040
Well, Fortunately.

120
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,790
I still haven't forgotten
that my name's Alan

121
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:19,290
Bunnalai.

122
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,170
Are you full, Alan?

123
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:48,960
You can have more.

124
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:54,210
I've had enough.

125
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:55,960
The food was excellent.

126
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:57,170
Thank you.

127
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,330
Don't forget to
take your medicine

128
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,670
and drink plenty of water afterward.

129
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,830
Then go write in your
diary after you're finished.

130
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,460
I'll go wash the dishes.

131
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,290
Go ahead, Alan.

132
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:00,460
Before you forget again.

133
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,920
The notebook is over there.

134
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,710
Today I dozed off in the moning.

135
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,000
I got up again
late in the morning.

136
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,040
Had a little headache.

137
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,250
It took me fifteen seconds

138
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,500
to recall who I was today.

139
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,670
Actually, it was a
bit longer than that.

140
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,080
My father was there
when I woke up.

141
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I was so shocked

142
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,790
and accidentally broke his dishes.

143
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,290
I've taken the medicine today.

144
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,080
Do not take more!

145
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:20,250
It happened again today.

146
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,920
He showed up to me
in my bedroom mirror.

147
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,000
He tried to tell me...

148
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,750
"Remember"

149
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,130
Remember?

150
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:34,290
Remember!

151
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,960
Are you done?

152
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,380
Dad.

153
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:57,630
Did I see a ghost, dad?

154
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,040
I've already told you

155
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:02,790
that it wasn't a ghost.

156
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,330
You saw things
because you're unwell.

157
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,290
How could it not be a ghost?

158
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:11,750
Here in this diary I pointed
out that it was a ghost.

159
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,460
Listen to me, Alan.

160
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,290
Because you were sick,

161
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,960
you had hallucinations
whenever you looked in the mirror.

162
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:27,130
This means you never
wrote down what I said, right?

163
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,630
Alan, you've promised me.

164
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,580
Why didn't you record
something this serious?

165
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,080
In this case, write
it down right now.

166
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,500
Everything

167
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:49,290
that you saw

168
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,170
was a result of your illness.

169
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,710
The things you
saw were illusions.

170
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,330
This is an important matter.

171
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,500
You must write it down every time.

172
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,380
Okay.

173
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,750
Can you stay at home
by yourself, Alan?

174
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,040
Of course, dad.

175
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,250
You don't need to worry.

176
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:22,290
Sure you can?

177
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,710
Lunch is in the fridge.

178
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,960
When you're hungry, just heat it up.

179
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,000
The snacks are on the table.

180
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,830
And my number is
written on the table.

181
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,380
You can get to work now, Dad.

182
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,960
Promise me

183
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,960
that you won't go walk
outside by yourself.

184
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,040
Because if the symptoms return,

185
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,210
you'll forget your way home again.

186
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,540
I'm not going anywhere.

187
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,580
Then, I'll get going now.

188
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,580
Be back soon.

189
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,670
I'm furious with myself
for having dementia

190
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:06,460
that prevents me from
remembering anything.

191
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,750
It's like living a shortened life.

192
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,380
Die and be reborn
again with no memories.

193
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,880
There's only this diary

194
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,540
that guides me
through everything.

195
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,880
Other than my repetitive routines,

196
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,579
which have to be
written down everyday...

197
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:29,040
The inside is filled with stories about one
old man

198
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,330
who has always appeared to me.

199
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:35,250
And the only place
where he'd ever manifest

200
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,920
is in every mirror.

201
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,880
Hey!

202
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,250
Open the door.
เปิดประตูให้หน่อย

203
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,080
What's up.
ไงพวกเป็นไงบ้าง

204
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:31,070
Good.
ดี

205
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,100
What brings you here?
มาไงวะ

206
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,480
Where have you been?
มึงหายไปไหนมา

207
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,110
Come on in.
เข้ามาก่อน

208
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:36,580
You didn't go to school.
เรียนก็ไม่ไปเรียน

209
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,780
You did not take your exams.
สอบก็ไม่ไปสอบ

210
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:40,240
Relax, man.
ใจเย็น

211
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,520
I just got out of the hospital.
กูไม่ค่อยสบาย เพิ่งออกจากโรงพยาบาล

212
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,420
You were sick and you didn't tell me about it?
มึงป่วยเหรอไม่บอกกูสักคำ

213
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,820
Let's talk inside, come on.
เข้าไปคุยกันข้างในเถอะ

214
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,000
The weather is so hot, right?
อากาศข้างนอกโคตรร้อนเลย

215
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,850
This is so good.
อร่อยดี

216
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,060
So what's up, man?
สรุปมึงเป็นอะไรวะ

217
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,080
I don't know where to start.
กูก็ไม่รู้จะเริ่มยังไงว่ะ

218
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:00,280
I don't even know that it's my vision
กูไม่รู้ว่ามันเป็นภาพหลอน

219
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,700
or a ghost.
หรือว่าผี

220
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:04,990
What do you think?
มึงคิดว่าไง

221
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:10,390
Do you get like a good look on his face?
มึงเห็นหน้าตามันไหม

222
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,940
Like... how does he look like?
มันหน้าตาเป็นยังไง

223
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,460
Yeah.
เห็น

224
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,380
He has white hair,
มันมีผมสีขาว

225
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:18,830
white beard...
หนวดขาว

226
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,920
and his eyes...!
และตามัน

227
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,880
He looks really angry.
ดูเหมือนกำลังโกรธอยู่

228
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,210
And he always appeared in the mirror.
มันชอบโผล่มาในกระจก

229
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,460
That's so super scary, dude.
เชี่ย น่ากลัวชิบ

230
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,830
Do you think ghosts are real?
มึงว่าผีมีจริงป่าววะ

231
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,380
I think they are.
กูเชื่อว่ามีนะ

232
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,540
They're like what got left behind
มันคือสิ่งที่หลงเหลือไว้

233
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,130
long after they were dead.
หลังจากที่พวกเขาตายไปแล้ว

234
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,750
What do you mean got left behind?
หลงเหลือยังไงวะ

235
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,040
Come here.
เข้ามานี่

236
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:47,790
Come closer.
ใกล้อีก

237
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:51,170
You smell that?
มึงได้กลิ่นไหม

238
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:52,000
Yeah.
เออ

239
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,500
A perfume?
น้ำหอมมึงเหรอ

240
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,540
Smells good, huh?
หอมเนอะ

241
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:58,880
What's wrong with you, man?
อะไรของมึง

242
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,330
Have you read a book the german book
มึงเคยอ่านหนังสือของเยอรมันไหม

243
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,080
"Perfume"?
เรื่องเพอร์ฟูม

244
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,460
Yeah, I think so.
น่าจะเคยมั้ง

245
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,040
What about it?
มันเกี่ยวกับอะไรวะ

246
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,170
In the book...
ในหนังสือ

247
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,270
It says that the perfumes
มันบอกว่าน้ำหอมเนี่ย

248
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:11,250
are just like withering flowers,
สกัดจากดอกไม้ที่ตายไปแล้ว

249
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,390
the smell got left behind
กลิ่นมันยังชวนให้หลอกหลอน

250
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,960
to haunt us long after it left.
แม้มันจะตายไปแล้ว

251
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:21,210
Hey.
เฮ้ย

252
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,420
You okay?
มึงโอเครึเปล่า

253
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,830
I don't know man.
กูก็ไม่รู้ว่ะ

254
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,580
I can't remember...
กูจำอะไรไม่ได้เลย

255
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,960
yesterday
เรื่องของเมื่อวาน

256
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,670
and the morning.
เมื่อเช้า

257
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,670
Even my father.
แม้แต่พ่อของกู

258
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,880
Or even you.
หรือแม้กระทั่งมึง

259
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,210
I don't know what to do.
กูไม่รู้ว่าต้องทำยังไง

260
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,460
It feels very bad.
รู้สึกแย่มาก ๆ เลยว่ะ

261
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,750
Hey.
เฮ้ ๆ

262
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,500
It's not that bad.
เดี๋ยวมึงก็ดีขึ้น

263
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,880
I don't know what to do, man!
กูไม่รู้จำทำยังไงว่ะ

264
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,790
You still remember me, right?
แต่มึงก็ยังจำกูได้ใช่ไหมล่ะ

265
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:56,750
You'll all get better.
เดี๋ยวมึงก็ดีขึ้น

266
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Thanks, man.
ขอบคุณมึงมาก

267
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:02,170
Everything will be fine.
ทุกอย่างจะต้องดีขึ้น

268
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,130
Let's go, man.
มาเร็ว

269
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,130
Don't worry.
มึงไม่ต้องกังวลหรอก

270
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:12,880
You look really normal to me. You're definitely not crazy.
กูว่ามึงก็ดูปกติดี

271
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,920
I mean, whatever is going on,
ไม่ว่าจะเกิดอะไรขึ้น

272
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,920
it should end soon.
เดี๋ยวมันก็ผ่านไป

273
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:19,630
Or may be...
หรือว่าบางที

274
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:22,670
there's like a vengeful ghost staying at your place
บ้านหลังนี้อาจเคยมีคนตายมากอ่น

275
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,640
and he's really angry that you
แล้วเขาก็โกรธมาก

276
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:26,080
and your father are staying here,
ที่มึงกับพ่อมาอยู่ที่นี่

277
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,330
so he's super pissed and he's here to haunt you.
เขาก็เลยมาหลอกหลอนมึง

278
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,290
Come on, man.
ไม่เอาน่า

279
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,080
Don't play a joke here.
เลิกแกล้งกูได้แล้ว

280
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,420
But...
แต่ว่า

281
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,750
What if he's real?
ถ้ามีผีจริง

282
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,040
What should I do?
กูควรทำยังไงดีวะ

283
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,250
You should communicate with him.
มึงควรสื่อสารกับเขา

284
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,830
You know, like maybe you can get a medium
มึงอาจพาหมอผีมา

285
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,880
or maybe you and your father
หรือมึงกับพ่อ

286
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,540
can pray and talk to him like…
อาจจะขอโทษแล้วบอกเขาว่า

287
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,920
Hello, excuse me. Can I stay here, please?
สวัสดีครับ ขอโทษนะครับ ขออยู่ที่นี่ได้ไหม

288
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,460
You're Thai, you should know that.
ลองก็ไม่เสียหายนะเว้ย

289
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,170
Stop it.
หยุดเลย พอเลย

290
00:21:58,210 --> 00:21:59,040
I'm trying to help.
กูพยายามช่วยอยู่

291
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,040
1 serious.
กูจริงจังนะเว้ย

292
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:02,630
You will be fine, trust me.
เดี๋ยวมึงก็ดีขึ้น เชื่อกูดิ

293
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:03,790
Okay.
โอเค

294
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,380
I'll see you next time.
ไว้เจอกัน

295
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:06,830
Okay.
โอเค

296
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,460
See you, man.
แล้วเจอกัน

297
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,500
Drive safe.
ขับรถดี ๆ

298
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,080
Who are you?

299
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:15,960
You're finally
awake, sleepy head?

300
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,710
So mean.

301
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,580
What kind of dream
feels this real?

302
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,130
So I'm the man of your dreams, right?

303
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,040
If this is not a dream,

304
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,040
then prove it.

305
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:27,210
Gotcha.

306
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,380
Thanks.

307
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,500
Is something wrong?

308
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:49,790
Nothing.

309
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,420
Just wanted to ask

310
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,250
if you've been able to
remember your dreams lately.

311
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,920
Are you still dreaming
about that ghostly old man?

312
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,210
Try to remember.

313
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:10,750
I think I do.

314
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,000
Are you still scared, Alan?

315
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,460
I'm still scared.

316
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,380
But...

317
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,540
But what?

318
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:24,330
I think...

319
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,830
he wanted to tell me something.

320
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,210
What makes you think that way?

321
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,580
I had no idea.

322
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,290
I just get the feeling

323
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:38,210
that there's something he wants to tell me.

324
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,630
You're overthinking, Alan.

325
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,080
No, Dad.

326
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:46,330
I definitely sense that.

327
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,040
Maybe

328
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,250
I should try opening
up and talk to him.

329
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,210
Open up to what?

330
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,670
You must understand
that all of this was a dream.

331
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,460
If you continue to think this way

332
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,290
then when will
you ever get better?

333
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,580
Sorry.

334
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:14,670
Have you recorded
today's dream in the diary

335
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:16,830
for the doctor to read?

336
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,460
I haven't.

337
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:25,710
Look, I told you many times
to write it down right away.

338
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,420
Otherwise, how are you going
to remember what you did?

339
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,630
I'll write it down as soon
as I get back to my room.

340
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,170
We've come this far, Alan.

341
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,000
You need to cooperate

342
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,380
if you want to recover.

343
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,920
Okay.

344
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,420
Was there anyone else

345
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,170
who entered your dreams?

346
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,330
So I'm the man of your dreams, right?

347
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,460
Nope.

348
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:39,960
Long, dirty hair.

349
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:41,710
Messy beard.

350
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,540
Serious and angered expression

351
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,130
beneath the wrinkled skin

352
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:47,420
on an unemotional face.

353
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:50,040
And those apathetic pair of eyes...

354
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,420
They are very familiar to me.

355
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:55,380
Still, I'm scared to communicate
with what's in front of me

356
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:58,330
because I'm well aware
that it's not human.

357
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:01,000
And I am the only person

358
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:03,080
that this ghost of
an old man is after.

359
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,380
What does he really want from me?

360
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Dad?

361
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:30,710
Dad!

362
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,960
Dad!

363
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,380
Dad.

364
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:58,750
Is that you?

365
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,420
So, what's it gonna be?

366
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:28,960
What do you want from me?

367
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,920
What do you want?

368
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,580
Where are you?

369
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,460
Huh?

370
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,460
Where you at?

371
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:38,960
Come out and show
me what you got!

372
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,380
Stop lurking in the shadows!

373
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,040
Come on!

374
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,380
Come out here!

375
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:48,830
Come at me, damnit!

376
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,290
Upstairs?

377
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:55,750
You're up there, huh?

378
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:01,540
Are we doing this or what?

379
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,790
Where the hell are you?

380
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:04,040
Think you're tough?

381
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,460
Then come out and get me!

382
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,080
Where are you?

383
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:08,830
You're not coming out?

384
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,000
If you don't come out,

385
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,040
you'll be stuck here
with me all night!

386
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:14,710
Get the hell out here!

387
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:18,040
Remember.

388
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:19,460
Come back to me.

389
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,710
Remember.

390
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:22,420
Remember.

391
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,630
Come back to me.

392
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,960
Remember.

393
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,540
Remember.

394
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,420
Remember.

395
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:30,290
Come back to me.

396
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,000
Remember!

397
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,380
Alan.

398
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,080
Alan!

399
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:44,830
Are you alright?

400
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,380
Alan.

401
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,460
What happened to you?

402
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:51,920
Dad?

403
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,580
How did you end up in the
tub first thing in the morning?

404
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,920
I guess I sleepwalked in there

405
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,960
by myself.

406
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:03,830
I don't remember.

407
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:12,290
What about earlier?

408
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:14,830
Any memories?

409
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,880
Not at all.

410
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,000
You're not hiding
something from me, are you?

411
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:32,130
I'm not.

412
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:36,250
You need to let me know
if something happens.

413
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:39,880
Don't forget that we're
now undergoing treatment.

414
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,330
Remember what the doctor said?

415
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,540
That if we didn't tell the truth,

416
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:47,630
then when would you get better?

417
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:54,540
Why are you always
thinking that I'm crazy, Dad?

418
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:58,420
You always believe
what others say.

419
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,250
You've never believed me for once.

420
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,330
I'm sorry

421
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:11,380
if I made you feel that way.

422
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,000
I just didn't want us to keep
secrets from each other.

423
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,830
I'm worried about you.

424
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,460
Then, can I ask you

425
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:24,040
why the others acted
strangely around me?

426
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:26,290
Is there something
I should know?

427
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,710
Not this again, Alan.

428
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,380
We've talked about this many times.

429
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:36,210
I don't know how to start.

430
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:38,380
Same old story, right?

431
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,750
Did he appear again?

432
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:43,790
Yes.

433
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,670
How did he do it?

434
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,710
He appeared for a split second,

435
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:55,130
but as soon as I turned
around, he was gone.

436
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,580
Were you scared?

437
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,500
At first, I was terrified.

438
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,000
But after some thought,

439
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,290
I actually got the impression

440
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,000
that he had been appearing to me

441
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,290
because he had
some kind of purpose.

442
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:14,750
And what did you do?

443
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,540
So I snapped

444
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,040
and called him out,

445
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:21,080
asking what he wanted
from haunting me.

446
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:23,830
I told you it was
just a hallucination.

447
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,080
But maybe...

448
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,500
all he wanted to
do was confront me.

449
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,040
Confront?

450
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,710
Who did you want to confront, Alan?

451
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:36,960
Everything was an
illusion you created.

452
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,880
If you let go

453
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:41,540
and did what the doctor said,

454
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,670
everything you
saw would be gone.

455
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:44,000
But...

456
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,130
You never helped.

457
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:47,710
While everyone was
doing their best to help you,

458
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:50,040
you kept obsessing over it.

459
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:53,330
We still haven't talk about
what you kept from me.

460
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,630
And what's going to
happen after I tell you?

461
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,290
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

462
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:02,540
Nobody listens to me.

463
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:06,960
Nobody has ever
believed what I think is true.

464
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,500
And has what you think

465
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,830
ever made
your condition better?

466
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,290
Well, if no one's going to listen to me,

467
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,460
then I'll follow my own thoughts.

468
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:21,830
What about everyone's
efforts to help you?

469
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,540
They never meant
anything to you, right?

470
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,750
If that old man ghost bullshit

471
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,420
is keeping you from moving on,

472
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,380
then you'll never see it again.

473
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:37,670
Damn it!

474
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,210
Where are you going, dad?

475
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,170
Dad?

476
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,130
Dad!

477
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:48,500
What are you doing, no!

478
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,000
- No.
- Get off me, Alan.

479
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,750
What are you doing, Dad?

480
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,540
Don't do it, dad!

481
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,380
Dad, don't!

482
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,460
Alan.

483
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:23,670
Alan!

484
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:59,130
You up, sleepyhead?

485
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,210
Who are you?

486
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:11,000
You're the new kid, yes?

487
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,960
Shocked?

488
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:22,330
Or...

489
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:25,290
Are you stunned by
how handsome I looked?

490
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,790
You're still dreaming, Alan.

491
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:38,290
Did you say something?

492
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:45,750
So you think you're
dreaming, huh?

493
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:51,290
Dude.

494
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,210
This is reality, not a dream.

495
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:56,580
If this is reality,

496
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,500
then I should have been lying

497
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,830
on my own bed.

498
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:09,790
Well, if this is a dream,

499
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:12,880
that means I'm the
man of your dreams.

500
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:17,790
Nah.

501
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,830
You're probably not
the man of my dreams.

502
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:21,750
This is obviously my own dream.

503
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,460
That hurts.

504
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,880
You didn't have to turn
me down that hard!

505
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:31,630
Mean.

506
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:34,790
Meany!

507
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:37,420
So mean.

508
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,500
But this place
really isn't my house.

509
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,790
Of course it isn't.

510
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:53,170
Welcome to the
hospital of the forgotten.

511
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:55,170
Huh?

512
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:00,460
This place is a hospital?

513
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:02,290
Yes sir.

514
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:03,420
A hospital.

515
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:05,880
Wake up, Alan.

516
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,670
Time to wake up.

517
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:09,710
Wake up, Wake up.

518
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:12,080
Stop, you're hurting
yourself for nothing.

519
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:14,330
You shut up!

520
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:17,250
Giving orders too, huh?

521
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,830
Cause this is my dream.

522
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:20,080
I have to be in control.

523
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:23,170
I said this is not a dream!

524
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,290
If this isn't a dream,

525
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
then you prove it.

526
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,540
Alright.

527
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,250
You asked for it.

528
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:41,920
What the heck was that?

529
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,210
A prove that this isn't a dream.

530
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,880
Jerk.

531
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:50,710
People can kiss in their
dream too, you know?

532
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,380
Then you can think
of that as a free kiss.

533
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,420
So, how was that?

534
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,420
Was it more like a
dream or a reality?

535
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:09,330
This isn't a dream?

536
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,540
I told you earlier, but
you didn't believe.

537
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:19,210
Then who are you?

538
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,710
I forgot to introduce myself.

539
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:27,330
My name's Win.

540
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Pleasure to meet you.

541
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Stop.

542
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:31,960
That's enough.

543
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,750
Don't get any closer.

544
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:36,790
Why?

545
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,040
Afraid you'll get another kiss?

546
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,290
It's not like that!

547
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,630
You're a stranger.

548
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,330
What's your name then?

549
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,790
- Alan.
- Alan?

550
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,420
We both know one
other's names now.

551
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:56,830
Guess we're no
strangers anymore.

552
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:03,250
Isn't that a bit too easy?

553
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:10,420
Or...you want me
to kiss you again?

554
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,170
Stop right there.

555
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:13,790
Fine, we're not strangers.

556
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:26,790
Then this place...

557
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,040
is a hospital?

558
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,330
Mm-hmm, yeah.

559
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:40,000
The hospital of
the forgotten ones.

560
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:46,040
How did we get here?

561
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:50,130
Probably the same as
the other patient here.

562
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,830
Someone brought us here

563
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:58,880
and forgot that we were here.

564
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Alan.

565
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,380
Alan.
