1
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,190
Father?

2
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,720
Deceased?

3
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,520
It's me, dad.

4
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,120
Something, when you know it,

5
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,040
might take all your
happiness away.

6
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:45,610
Remember!

7
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,480
Hello?

8
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,280
Hello?

9
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,840
Can you hear me?

10
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,440
Hello?

11
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,800
Can you hear me?

12
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,160
Dad.

13
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,400
Hello?

14
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,600
Alan?

15
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,400
Is that you?

16
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,340
Who exactly are you?

17
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,320
Alan, calm down.

18
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:07,900
Where are you?

19
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,120
How did you call me?

20
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,180
Calm down, Alan.

21
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,240
What's going on?

22
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,080
Where are you now?

23
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:14,880
Calm down?

24
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,600
My father has died,

25
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,329
it is stated in the medical record!

26
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,320
Alan.

27
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:21,959
Calm down.

28
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,440
Who exactly am I?

29
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,720
Listen to me first.

30
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,400
- Who the hell am I?
- Wait! Alan.

31
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:27,480
Hear me out!

32
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,050
- A clone?
- Where are you?

33
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,840
Take it easy.

34
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,910
Am I a clone?

35
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:32,800
Calm down.

36
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,380
How many clones
have been created?

37
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,770
How many times
has this happened?

38
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,320
- Alan, listen to me.
- Tell me what this is all about!

39
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:39,409
Tell me!

40
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,530
There, get him!

41
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,090
Quick!

42
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,760
Tell me, hurry!

43
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,800
Tell me!

44
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,150
Get him out!

45
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,010
Let go!

46
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,040
I said let go!

47
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,330
Take him back to his room now.

48
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,310
Yes, Doctor Nil.

49
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,520
Pete, Doctor Nil,

50
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,520
Both of you.

51
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,909
Let go of me!

52
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:58,640
Release me!

53
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,200
Stop causing trouble.

54
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,240
Please cooperate.

55
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,730
Alan, calm down.

56
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,040
Let's get you back
to the room, alright?

57
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,440
Alan.

58
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,310
Alan, calm yourself down.

59
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:12,160
ALAN!

60
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,070
Hold him still.

61
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:17,890
Let go!

62
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,920
Hold him.

63
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:21,620
Let go!

64
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:22,400
Let go, damn it.

65
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,960
I'm a clone, right?

66
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,080
- Which number of clone am I?
- Stop talking nonsense!

67
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,600
Please don't do
this to me, Doctor.

68
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,120
Let me go.

69
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,120
Doctor Nil.

70
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,159
I feel like things are starting
to get out of hand now.

71
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,640
The time has come.

72
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,560
Alan.

73
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:16,960
Alan.

74
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:28,840
With me, Pete.

75
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,560
Get up slowly, Alan.

76
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,280
Easy there.

77
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,560
Can you recall anything
about last night?

78
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,320
Last night?

79
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,520
Last night...

80
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,230
Let go!

81
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,010
Alan!

82
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,710
- Alan.
- Let go of me.

83
00:06:58,730 --> 00:06:59,090
Stop!

84
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,260
- Alan, stop!
- Stop right there.

85
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,570
Stay where you are, all of you.

86
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,390
Stop.

87
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,710
Don't come any closer.

88
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,280
What've you guys been
scheming against me?

89
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,320
Tell me right now.

90
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,200
Take a deep breath, Alan.

91
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,240
No, you're going to tell me!

92
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,160
What are you people
up to against me?

93
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,010
Answer me now.

94
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,920
Anyway, who are you?

95
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,280
You're not my dad.

96
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,520
My father has died.

97
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:22,610
Who are you?

98
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:23,600
Who the hell are you?

99
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,920
Just tell me the truth.

100
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,320
Say it!

101
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,040
Fuckin' tell me!

102
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,810
- Do you want to know the whole truth now?
- Sure shit!

103
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,040
- Tell me right now!
- Please calm down.

104
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,800
Today, you'll learn the
truth about everything.

105
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,400
However,

106
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,320
I will only reveal it to you

107
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,690
once you're calm

108
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,480
and actually ready to listen.

109
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,159
Are you ready, Alan?

110
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,360
I am ready.

111
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,560
Then I'll take you somewhere.

112
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,480
You want to know, do you?

113
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,720
The truth is in there.

114
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,440
Greetings, Alan.

115
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,280
Don't be afraid just yet.

116
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,040
If you're watching this video right now,

117
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,640
that means your
condition's been at its worst.

118
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,040
But first, Allow me to introduce myself.

119
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,440
My name's Alan.

120
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,480
Professer Alan Bunnalai.

121
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm a psychiatrist

122
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:16,040
and the founder of
this psychiatric hospital

123
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,960
"Familienhaus."

124
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:20,720
And I

125
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,680
am you.

126
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:30,440
What is this?

127
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,080
I know you might be shocked

128
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:41,120
and won't believe what
I'm going to say next,

129
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,520
But everything is true.

130
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,040
We're the same person.

131
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,280
We have Alzheimer's disease.

132
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,050
What you believe or peceive yourself as

133
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,250
as a young man

134
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,400
is actually

135
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,770
the result of you forgetting
your current identity.

136
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,240
Eight straight lines.

137
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,040
Now, what do you see?

138
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,320
Ant.

139
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,720
It can't be.

140
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,760
What is this?

141
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,130
The disease that we're having

142
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,520
- What is this?
- causes our memories

143
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,920
to rewind back

144
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,480
to the times that we were happy

145
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,400
and tie us to them.

146
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,280
How could you die?

147
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,000
You're in my memories,

148
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,080
and you'll be there forever.

149
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,800
Believe me, it's true.

150
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,000
In those days was the
time you met Darwin.

151
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:34,800
The guy

152
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,680
who liked to climb windows
just to see you all the time.

153
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:41,280
He was the one who made you fall in love.

154
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,920
Darwin was Win?

155
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,240
You and Win

156
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,400
grew up in
the orphanage together.

157
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,440
Both of you had been
best friends since childhood.

158
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,850
even during the academies,

159
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,280
you two had to study
at the same place.

160
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,280
The two of you had been
there through thick and thin,

161
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,360
sharing experiences and memories

162
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,240
before your relationship
blossomed into love.

163
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:01,080
Even this hospital

164
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,960
The two of you created it together

165
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,560
after the abbot had died.

166
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,880
The two of you

167
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:10,050
felt that it was a shame

168
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,280
that this place
would be destroyed.

169
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,560
Both of you were very happy,

170
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,500
spending your lives here
as if it were a second home.

171
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,120
A home that housed more
than just the two of you,

172
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,640
but also held another
life that you had adopted.

173
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,560
His name was

174
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,200
"Alex."

175
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,680
Alex?

176
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,080
You had been promoted to director

177
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:35,760
and Win was your soul mate,

178
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:37,680
with Alex

179
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:40,160
fulfilling joyfulness
for the family.

180
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,960
Win meant
everything in your life.

181
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:47,840
Never a day passed without
his presence by your side.

182
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,080
Win...

183
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,960
He loved you from
the bottom of his heart.

184
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,040
You also felt the
same way about him.

185
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:56,960
But today,

186
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,680
I'll have to tell you the truth.

187
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:02,120
Doctor Darwin Bunnalai

188
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,400
has passed away

189
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,520
from leukemia.

190
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,240
You promised

191
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,580
we wouldn't leave each other.

192
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:24,650
I gave you one minute,

193
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,440
but I haven't heard a
single apology from you.

194
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,160
Hello, Mister Alan.

195
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:30,570
Are you coming down to eat?

196
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,680
This way.

197
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,040
Quick.

198
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,350
Win!

199
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,980
I've called, but
you didn't answer.

200
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,120
Don't ever do this again.

201
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,290
Not cool.

202
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,760
You've promised, okay?

203
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:45,680
But his body

204
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,040
is still in the cemetery.

205
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,800
Dad.

206
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,760
Are you alright?

207
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,160
Win has passed away?

208
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,320
It...

209
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,420
It can't be.

210
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,360
That's not true!

211
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,580
I don't believe it.

212
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,080
I don't belive this!

213
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,570
I just seen him yesterday,

214
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,160
we were still together.

215
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,000
This is a big deal, Win.

216
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,480
I don't know anything about myself.

217
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,570
And I must learn the truth.

218
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,720
How can you be so sure

219
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,760
that knowing it will
make your life better?

220
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,580
We'd been doing well together...

221
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,760
The lies from others
weren't that bad.

222
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,480
But the lies you told

223
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,410
were the most agonizing!

224
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,600
Win...

225
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,350
who you have seen,

226
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:00,090
met,

227
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:00,730
This is...

228
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,080
or touched...

229
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:04,660
Why...

230
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,200
Why wasn't Win

231
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,920
in the photo with me?

232
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:14,720
because your brain created him.

233
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,040
You're still bound

234
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,120
by the happiness
you had with him.

235
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,440
You've been keeping
him existing to this day.

236
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,600
However, if you
don't believe me...

237
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,320
Do you notice
the piece of mirror

238
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,040
beside the bookshelf?

239
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,720
Try to concentrate

240
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,600
and carefully gaze into it.

241
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,200
You'll see the truth through that mirror.

242
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,840
I'm intentionally
recording this video for you

243
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,200
on the days I'm still healthy,

244
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,960
before my condition
deteriorates.

245
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,120
Finally,

246
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:10,720
I wish that you...

247
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,720
No, we...

248
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,520
would get through this together,

249
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:18,080
like we always have everytime.

250
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:20,400
If we're lucky,

251
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,280
I hope this will be the last time for us.

252
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,640
Please do remember, Alan.

253
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,760
Best of luck to you.

254
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,210
Have I...

255
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,760
really gone old now?

256
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,380
Dad.

257
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,280
I'd like to be alone
for a moment.

258
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,640
You must have known that knowing the truth

259
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,320
terrified me the most.

260
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:39,200
So you didn't want me to
hurt more than I already did.

261
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:41,760
I admit

262
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:44,280
I was scared
and frustrated

263
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:47,560
that I had to tell myself every day that...

264
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,240
from now on,

265
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:56,280
I would never have
you by my side again.

266
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,360
You know, Win?

267
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:03,120
Just the thought of
it was excruciating.

268
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,240
But from this day, I won't
be scared of anything.

269
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,640
Because I've gone through
everything I feared most.

270
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,600
If you're with me

271
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,760
right here and right now,

272
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,360
I want you to

273
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:19,760
get over the fear
together with me.

274
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,200
I want you to no
longer worry about me.

275
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:28,000
Nothing can ever hurt me again.

276
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:30,960
From now on,

277
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,480
I will live my life for you.

278
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,920
I promise I'll come
visit you everyday...

279
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,520
so you won't ever
be lonely again.

280
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,520
Have I been doing this many times?

281
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,360
Four times.

282
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,080
I told you to do all of this?

283
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,760
You did.

284
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,240
You gave us the command

285
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,720
that every time you had to restart,

286
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:19,920
if things had gotten too far,

287
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,920
we had to show you the video.

288
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:26,720
You must have grown tired of me

289
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,000
over and over again, right.

290
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,360
Dad.

291
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,280
Can you really remember me now?

292
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:46,360
Everyone of us has been trying
our best to follow your directives

293
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:49,120
and has always hoped

294
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,760
that each time
would be the last.

295
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:57,240
Thank you, son.

296
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,680
Thank you so much.

297
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,800
Sure, Dad.

298
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,080
Alan.

299
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:05,810
Time for your medication.

300
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,240
How dare you

301
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,960
call me by my name?

302
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,040
I'm your professor.

303
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:25,840
Professor...

304
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:28,160
Professor, you...

305
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,400
you remember me now, right?

306
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:31,880
Of course,

307
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,440
you were

308
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:35,480
my troublesome
student, you know?

309
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,940
You're much more
troublesome than me.

310
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,280
Thank you very much, Doctor.

311
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:47,040
Thank you everyone.

312
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,240
I truly appreciate it.

313
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:54,080
But I still have
another question.

314
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,960
Does Nate actually exists?

315
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,400
Uh...

316
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,320
Nate?

317
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,120
Who's that?

318
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:12,400
Does this mean that
I also created Nate?

319
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,760
I believe so.

320
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:20,440
He was probably the person
you created to be your friend,

321
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,640
similarly to children's
imaginary friends.

322
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,160
I really was a trouble maker.

323
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,140
You sure was!

324
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,120
Today must have
been tough for you, Nil?

325
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,880
I guess it wasn't just for me.

326
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,560
Yeah,

327
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:49,600
just like every other time.

328
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:52,000
But I believed

329
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:55,000
that we would get through it

330
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,280
You're always so positive, huh?

331
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,880
I'm just the way I am.

332
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,000
I don't see the
benefits of overthinking...

333
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,240
doing so would age the face.

334
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,680
Are you roasting me?

335
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,200
I know...

336
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,040
I know I've been

337
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,280
working so hard that
my face is all run-down.

338
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,760
Right?

339
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,880
Yet your face seems
as young as ever.

340
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,760
That's right.

341
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,280
Because you

342
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,480
take everything too seriously.

343
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,640
You should relax once in a while.

344
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:40,080
It's impossible to for me

345
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,840
to be completely relaxed, Alex.

346
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:46,780
You know what my
career's responsibilities were

347
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,360
and what I had to do.

348
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:50,400
I'm well aware

349
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:52,160
and understand.

350
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:56,760
But haven't things
been better than before?

351
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,240
Please don't put pressure on me.

352
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,290
Nil.

353
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,600
Am I making you uncomfortable?

354
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,370
I wouldn't say that.

355
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:35,000
Then what is it?

356
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,400
What made you put up a wall
between us

357
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,360
or was it just an excuse?

358
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,440
If you don't want to be with me,

359
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,240
you can be honest with me.

360
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,780
I don't...

361
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,440
I don't think I can give
you answers at this time.

362
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:02,160
Listen to me, Nil.

363
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,400
I'm mature enough to
understand everything.

364
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:08,320
Just say the word that
you want me to wait

365
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,280
and I'll always wait for you.

366
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,800
You know, I would
never ask you to do that.

367
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:20,000
Does this mean I have to
keep waiting for you to answer

368
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:23,200
without a destination like this?

369
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,560
You don't have to wait.

370
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:47,710
If you meet someone new,

371
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,240
have new ambitions, then I...

372
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,000
I want you to try opening
up to the opportunity.

373
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,960
Given what you've said...

374
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,600
I really have to
let you go, huh?

375
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,880
Thank you, Nil.

376
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,080
Thanks for everything.

377
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:52,480
But I wanted to let you know that

378
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,600
I will always be
waiting for you here.

379
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:01,920
Someday, when you're ready

380
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,000
and open up your heart,

381
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,880
remember that I'll be here.

382
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,520
Thank you.

383
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,720
What are you doing
standing here all by yourself?

384
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,440
Something on your
mind about Alan?

385
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,840
Would you take me for a walk?

386
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,080
Go for a walk?

387
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:00,960
The sun's almost set.

388
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:05,000
You're right.

389
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,680
How about this?

390
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,840
You're coming to stay
at my place to night.

391
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:11,480
Being alone

392
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,150
might get you lost
in your thoughts.

393
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,120
Also,

394
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,960
traveling back and forth to the
hospital is a waste of money.

395
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,040
Another thing,

396
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,800
if you don't get enough sleep,

397
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,960
you'll slack off at work again.

398
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:25,640
Why'd you suddenly invite
me to stay at your place?

399
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,440
Are you planning something?

400
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,600
What plan?

401
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,600
Why?

402
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:35,200
You can't have a sleepover?

403
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:39,160
I thought you said
we're boyfriends now.

404
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,160
Wait...

405
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:43,080
When did I become your boyfriend?

406
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,360
Let's see...

407
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,560
Oh!

408
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,480
I remembered.

409
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,760
You're right,

410
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:54,760
Honey.

411
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,160
- Here.
- Ouch!

412
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,330
That hurts.

413
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,360
What the hell?

414
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,600
Hey.

415
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:12,440
Can I ask you something?

416
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,280
Since when did you like me?

417
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,720
Well...

418
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,320
I dunno.

419
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,080
Starting from good feelings

420
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,400
that kept growing

421
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,360
till they became affection, I guess.

422
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:42,980
So

423
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,800
Are your parents okay with you

424
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:45,700
dating me?

425
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,700
Don't worry about that.

426
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,160
The most I need to do

427
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,960
is just let them know.

428
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,360
Anyway,

429
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,920
my life is my own.

430
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:54,000
And...

431
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,560
what about at the hospital?

432
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,400
When people look at us,

433
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:58,960
doesn't that bother you?

434
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:04,040
I believe

435
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:07,280
everyone needs to be able to
separate work and personal matters.

436
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,360
Oh,

437
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:11,160
one more thing.

438
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:13,920
You must not get in my hair

439
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,480
while I'm working.

440
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,600
Otherwise, I'll lose my focus.

441
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,140
Okay.

442
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,080
Then you

443
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:21,960
musn't get in my hair too.

444
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:24,040
You always do that.

445
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,760
Alright.

446
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:28,840
Then

447
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:30,600
I'm going back to my work.

448
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,360
Give me a call when
you get off work.

449
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,760
Hey, Doc.

450
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,920
Is this your number?

451
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,000
Try calling it.

452
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:44,880
If my phone rings,

453
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,130
that means the number's mine.

454
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:46,980
Alright.

455
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,160
I'm calling, one sec.

456
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,000
Hey.

457
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,640
It's actually this number!

458
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,320
Don't forget to add my
number to your contacts.

459
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,600
See you after work.

460
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,310
Okay.

461
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:04,920
There!

462
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,280
Quit it!

463
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,200
All set.

464
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:52,880
Please come in.

465
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,000
Okay.

466
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,600
You can place your
bags next to the bed.

467
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:36,000
Shouldn't you go wash up first?

468
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:39,240
Don't you like it this way?

469
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,990
Kinda sexy, I think.

470
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:47,360
If someday I grow older

471
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:49,400
and have Alzheimer's,

472
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,720
will you still be there for me?

473
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,600
Why asks this all of a sudden?

474
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,480
Are you thinking about Alan?

475
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,360
Yeah.

476
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,320
It makes me wonder...

477
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,960
how could we wake up each day

478
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,239
and forget about our loved ones?

479
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:22,159
You think we'll still be
together until we get old?

480
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,719
No idea.

481
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:26,679
But it's possible,
don't you think?

482
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,760
Pete.

483
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:36,920
We'll sort it out later.

484
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:39,920
But for now,

485
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:41,960
we love each other.

486
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:47,520
The way you think
about what's to come

487
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:49,600
is a good thing,

488
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,360
but if it makes the
present moment unhappy,

489
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,280
I think it's better to just let go.

490
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,560
Go take a shower.

491
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,960
Let me take care of
my work real quick.

492
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:08,240
Alright.

493
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,960
Now go take a shower.

494
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:46,360
After I've showered,

495
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,840
promise that

496
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,880
you'll reward me, okay?

497
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,650
Go.

498
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,520
Fine.

499
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,220
Here you go, Win.

500
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:16,640
Your favorite.

501
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,320
So you don't ever have to

502
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,320
go out to get one again.

503
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,200
I'm here to visit
you, as promised.

504
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,840
Thank you

505
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:31,680
for carrying out the promise
throughout your whole life.

506
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,680
You've never abandoned me...

507
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,800
Follow me, quick.

508
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:44,200
regardless of the
circumstances we're in.

509
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:46,920
I love you so much, Win.

510
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,360
From now on,

511
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,560
there won't ever be

512
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:53,720
a hospital for the
forgotten anymore.

513
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:00,360
Win...

514
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:03,360
You'll live on in
my memory forever.

515
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,560
You remember

516
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,560
when you told me

517
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:14,920
you wanted to see me
live a happy life every day?

518
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,560
I've been happy

519
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,840
every day, just like
you wanted me to.

520
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:32,640
You will be a part
of my life forever.

521
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,480
Good evening, professor.

522
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:10,240
Would you like to take
sleeping pills for tonight?

523
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,320
No, thank you.

524
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,720
Where'd you like to sleep tonight?

525
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:17,520
Room 203 or the one
on the upper floor?

526
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,920
I'd like to return to my room.

527
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,760
There's nothing to worry about.

528
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,480
I can take care of myself.

529
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:31,640
I'm going to sit here for a while.

530
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,040
You can go about your business.

531
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:37,640
Very well, sir.

532
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,410
Hey!

533
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,520
Win!

534
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:55,280
Who else but Win!

535
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,560
Is this really you?

536
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,410
How did you come back?

537
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,490
It's really you!

538
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,680
Yeah, it's me.

539
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,800
Touch me all you want.

540
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,960
You miss me?

541
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,380
It's been a while.

542
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,760
You need to answer me first.

543
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,640
How did you come back?

544
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,920
I think there might be a reason.

545
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,650
Normally,

546
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:27,880
when your memory came back,

547
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,800
I'd be disintergrated

548
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:33,040
like sugar cubes in coffee.

549
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:38,360
Actually, I'd braced myself

550
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,160
that when you
remembered everything,

551
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:45,520
you'd return to being the same Alan...

552
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:47,840
and then I'd disappear again.

553
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,640
But I didn't vanish this time?

554
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,000
Who do you think happened?

555
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,320
I'm not sure either.

556
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,440
Maybe my memory's gotten better.

557
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:05,400
Couldn't be.

558
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,720
Your dementia

559
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,440
is incurable.

560
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:13,810
We can only delay the symptoms

561
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,040
so they don't get worse.

562
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,960
But I came back to you this time

563
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,800
because of a promise.

564
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:28,520
A promise?

565
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,400
Do you remember
what we've promised?

566
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:37,760
I remembered now.

567
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:40,760
You once promised you'd
come back to pick me up.

568
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,960
Sleepy...

569
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:49,640
I'm feeling kinda tired.

570
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:50,800
You're tired?

571
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,040
But it's the middle of the day.

572
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:56,280
I'm in my old age now, Win.

573
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,040
My body needs some rest.

574
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,400
You should head back first.

575
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,480
I'm going to take a nap.

576
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,980
What do you mean old?

577
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,360
Take a good look
at yourself again.

578
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:09,680
If this isn't old, then
what do you call it?

579
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:11,270
You don't believe me?

580
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:12,480
Come, quick.

581
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,200
Here,

582
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,400
Look again.

583
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:34,800
Hey!

584
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:38,440
Is this real.

585
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,040
Is this really happening?

586
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:44,550
Jerk.

587
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,800
That hurts, Win.

588
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,960
To ensure you that
you're not dreaming.

589
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,000
Why am I becoming young again?

590
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:58,000
Because this is where
your journey starts.

591
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:01,800
Time to go back to your room.

592
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:04,880
Alan.

593
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,320
Alan.

594
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:12,360
Alan.

595
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:13,960
Alan!

596
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:22,800
A journey, right?

597
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:34,120
Are you ready?

598
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:38,840
I'm good to go.

599
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,200
Somebody

600
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,360
help!

601
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:57,200
Somebody help!

602
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:58,800
Alan.

603
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:00,520
Alan.

604
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:01,880
Alan

605
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,640
Please perform CPR on him.

606
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,240
Hurry!

607
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,640
When did he fall down?

608
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:10,960
A few minutes ago, doctor.

609
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:30,040
I promise

610
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:33,600
we'll always be together.

611
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:38,120
Forever?

612
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:41,400
Forever.

613
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:43,960
Forever.

614
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,680
Ready?

615
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,110
All set.

616
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:52,320
Are you ready too?

617
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:56,720
I'm ready.

618
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,000
Shall we go then?

619
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:03,000
Let's go.

620
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:12,480
Alan.

621
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:13,920
Alan.

622
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:15,680
What happened?

623
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:19,270
He's not breathing.

624
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,760
Pump faster.

625
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:22,920
Alan.

626
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,620
- Alan.
- Keep going.

627
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:26,760
Alan.

628
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:29,640
Alan.

629
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:32,440
Alan.

630
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,000
Pump faster.

631
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:38,880
Alan.

632
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:40,120
Does he have a pulse.

633
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:41,590
Alan.

634
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:43,540
Alan.

635
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,440
Come on, faster.

636
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:47,600
Alan.

637
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,160
Alan.

638
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:50,560
Alan.

639
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:26,120
The psychiatric hospital

640
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:27,800
"Familienhaus."

641
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:31,160
I'm glad I grew up here.

642
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:32,870
I'm glad

643
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,720
that I met the love of my life.

644
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:37,320
I'm glad

645
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:38,760
I've lived

646
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,800
and raised a family here.

647
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,440
And in the end...

648
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:46,640
I'm glad I've spent my
final moment in this place

649
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,960
with a lifelong partner
in crime of mine.

650
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:37,680
Hey.

651
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:39,920
I love you.

652
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,360
I love you too.

653
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:44,000
Forever?

654
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:46,960
Forever.

655
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:52,560
Hey!
เฮ้ย

656
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:54,640
Are you guys done saying you love each other?
พวกมึงรักกันพอรึยัง

657
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,440
I've been waiting for too long.
กูรอนานมาก

658
00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:00,440
Okay.
โอเค

659
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,120
Come on, dude.
มา ๆ เพื่อน
