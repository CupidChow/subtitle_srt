1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,770
Shall we go

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,110
look in the mirror together?

3
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,280
But if we see him,

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:14,270
don't leave me.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,079
Are you certain that it wasn't

6
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:17,460
another episode of sleepwalking?

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,290
There was

8
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,330
an elderly nurse

9
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:20,960
who walked into
the room, called me,

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:21,540
and brought me out there!

11
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:22,880
It wasn't a dream!

12
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,830
You don't need to overthink it.

13
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,330
Anybody can make
mistakes at any time.

14
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:27,250
If something happens,

15
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,330
you can let me know.

16
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,960
You see, if a patient
doesn't trust a doctor.

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,670
the treatment
will fail regardless.

18
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:32,790
No going outside at night.

19
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:33,790
Remember?

20
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:35,040
Alan!

21
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:37,960
I never wanted to leave you.

22
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,500
Get out.

23
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,380
Win!

24
00:01:36,539 --> 00:01:37,539
I'm so sorry.

25
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,670
I've never encountered
a situation like this before,

26
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,460
so I'm not sure what to do.

27
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,289
I haven't reported
to Dr.Nil yet.

28
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:45,380
Yes.

29
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,380
But I'd like to ask you a favor.

30
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,330
Please don't fire me.

31
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,250
Doctor O.

32
00:01:56,289 --> 00:01:57,289
I've found him.

33
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:58,960
Yes.

34
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,210
I promise it won't
ever happen again.

35
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,040
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,830
Alan.

37
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,710
Please don't run
away from me again.

38
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,380
I know

39
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,540
you may have been
directed to do something.

40
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,540
But that's how things work here.

41
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,210
You must follow it.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
If you don't follow the rules,

43
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,130
me and the other nurse

44
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,630
could get into trouble as well.

45
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,420
I'm really sorry, Pete.

46
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:30,210
But...

47
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,829
Dr.O hasn't
reported to Dr.Nil yet

48
00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:35,329
right?

49
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,829
Let's just say I'll make sure
Dr.Nil never hears about this.

50
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:39,829
Promise me

51
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:41,579
you won't ever do it again.

52
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,670
Let me walk you to your room.

53
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,540
Okay.

54
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,710
So, where did you go?

55
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,500
I went down there
to look for the cards,

56
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,880
but I couldn't find them.

57
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:00,210
Listen,

58
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:02,880
I'll tell you my secrets,

59
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,250
and then you'll tell yours.

60
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,040
So, we'll be even.

61
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:08,830
All right?

62
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,920
The truth is

63
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,079
I'm not into women.

64
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,630
Back in the day, I always thought

65
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,750
I was into women

66
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,960
because my parents

67
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:27,630
loved to pair me up with the girls.

68
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,920
But I'd never had a
date with any of them.

69
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,750
Then I realized that

70
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,250
I was actually attracted to men.

71
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,710
So...

72
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:40,420
have you ever had
a man as your lover?

73
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,460
I've told you enough.

74
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,630
It's your turn to tell me now.

75
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,960
Do you know a guy named Win?

76
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,380
Is this Win a friend of yours?

77
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:55,829
That's right.

78
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,290
He's my friend.

79
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,250
Well

80
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,420
He comes to see me all the time,

81
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,210
But I still have no idea

82
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,210
how he truly feels about me.

83
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,130
Has he

84
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,540
ever done this to anyone else?

85
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,920
From what I've seen,

86
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,579
he has only done this to me.

87
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,079
There it is,

88
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,210
the answer.

89
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:24,710
Mr. Alan.

90
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:29,130
Let's go.

91
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,420
Get some good rest, Alan.

92
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,500
Thank you.

93
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,000
Alan.

94
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,580
Wake up.

95
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,380
Why are you so shocked?

96
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,040
Hallucinating again?

97
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,960
Who are you?

98
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,580
What's this place?

99
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,080
You've forgotten me now?

100
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,630
Read this.

101
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,630
Read it.

102
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,420
Found it yet?

103
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,540
Who's this guy?

104
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:47,880
Win.

105
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,830
Anyone else this good-looking?

106
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:53,790
Come here.

107
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:54,830
Stop.

108
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,670
How did you get in here anyway?

109
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:59,710
You didn't put the lock on.

110
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,170
You sneaked in here again.

111
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I didn't sneaked.

112
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,460
I openly walked in

113
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,790
since you had been busy
dreaming about someone.

114
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,250
Who else would I
be dreaming about?

115
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,460
I dunno, just asking.

116
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,500
But you can't.

117
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,170
Do not dream about other people.

118
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,250
You hear that?

119
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,380
I'm the only one
you can dream about.

120
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,170
Hey,

121
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,750
Why can't I dream about
someone else too, huh?

122
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,500
Because

123
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,790
I want to be close
to you everywhere

124
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,170
whether in dreams

125
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,380
or in reality.

126
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:51,790
And

127
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,130
how close can you be?

128
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,500
Closer than you imagine.

129
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,830
An alarm?

130
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,380
Don't worry about it.

131
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,630
Win.

132
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,170
Hey!

133
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,130
You

134
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,420
You did it again!

135
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:35,960
Shocked?

136
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,170
- Bless you.
- Stop!

137
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:40,210
You're coming in
here silently again.

138
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,210
Sorry.

139
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,000
What are you doing?

140
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:43,830
Not hungry?

141
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:44,830
You're not going
to get breakfast?

142
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,580
I'm not hungry yet.

143
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,880
Are you hungry?

144
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,880
You go ahead and eat.

145
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:53,710
Nope.

146
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,960
How energetic you are,

147
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,960
washing clothes in the morning.

148
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,250
The weather is fine

149
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,290
so I wanted to wash my clothes.

150
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,290
Is that wrong?

151
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,460
No.

152
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,460
Or maybe...

153
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,080
What?

154
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,170
You pissed yourself on the bed?

155
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,210
Really!

156
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:23,750
Alan wetted the bed!

157
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,580
Alan wetted the bed!

158
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,580
Alan wetted the bed!

159
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,130
Stop.

160
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,420
What?

161
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,500
Alan peed himself.

162
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,330
What?

163
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,130
Can't a grown man
wet his bed sometimes?

164
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:36,790
Asshole.

165
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,880
I won't tell a single sole.

166
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,880
I promise.

167
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,500
You sure?

168
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,130
Jerk.

169
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:52,830
So

170
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,040
why did you peed your pants?

171
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,040
what did you dream of?

172
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,290
I...

173
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,540
I dreamed about you.

174
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,710
Me, really?

175
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,500
Well

176
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,040
In my dream,

177
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,250
I woke up and

178
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,170
was unable to
remember who you were.

179
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,000
That's something
you could dream of?

180
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:36,330
Dreamed that you forgot me?

181
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:40,830
Why couldn't I?

182
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,080
I have brain disease, remember?

183
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:47,960
That's fine.

184
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,380
I'm right here anyway.

185
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,040
You haven't forgotten me.

186
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,000
Watch it, I might wake up
and forget you for real someday.

187
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,250
Take this and write it down.

188
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,000
What if you really forget me?

189
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,210
Just say that you're
afraid of being forgotten.

190
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,130
Today, a nurse brought
me to the room C02.

191
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,170
Are you still conscious?

192
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,290
Breath in!

193
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,040
Sir.

194
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,080
Hey

195
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:34,420
Why did they bring
me to that room?

196
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,790
Was there a relation between me

197
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,130
and room C02?

198
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,460
I don't know either.

199
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,170
That helped me out a lot.

200
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,920
You should see it for yourself.

201
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,290
Alan.

202
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,880
Hurry up.

203
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,170
You think that's a human?

204
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,170
I think so.

205
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:04,830
Mister?

206
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,790
Sir?

207
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,290
Sir?

208
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:42,790
Alan?

209
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,290
Do you know who I am?

210
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,670
Do you know him?

211
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,920
No.

212
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,670
Why does he seem
to recognize me?

213
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,830
Mister

214
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,880
what's your disease?

215
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,880
Sir.

216
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,920
We need to go now.

217
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,880
Someone will come, hurry.

218
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,880
How's the patient condition?

219
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:52,670
What about the heart rate?

220
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,750
Alright.

221
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,170
Do it again.

222
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:03,920
Draw more.

223
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,710
That's so cute.

224
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,170
Amazing.

225
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,880
Pete.

226
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,750
We have to talk.

227
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,130
What is it, Doc?

228
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,130
Haven't I told you

229
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:20,460
not to randomly talk
with the patients?

230
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Just a moment ago, you
made a promise to me,

231
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,460
and now you've broken it.

232
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:27,460
What were you
talking about with him?

233
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,630
Why are you
nitpicking me so much?

234
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,830
I was chatting
about everyday stuff.

235
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:34,040
Nothing about
the patient at all.

236
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:39,420
Did you

237
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,420
not get enough sleep again?

238
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:42,790
No.

239
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:44,960
I don't think so.

240
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,250
Your eyes look really tired.

241
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,460
My house is far away,

242
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,670
so traveling back and forth

243
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,880
requires a lot of time.

244
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,630
Like today, I woke
up at four a.m.

245
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,920
I only had five hours of sleep.

246
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,500
Look,

247
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:59,380
there are apartments
available near the hospital.

248
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,170
How come you didn't rent them?

249
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,420
Because living in my own
home is less expensive.

250
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,040
Your house is that far away,

251
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,500
but I see you working
shifts every night.

252
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,000
I've been saving money to
study for a master's degree.

253
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:13,000
Which major?

254
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,000
Psychiatric nursing.

255
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:16,170
Working night shifts

256
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:18,579
is one way for me to make money.

257
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,670
So...

258
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,880
would you like to keep me
company on this night shift?

259
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,710
No can do.

260
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,329
Tonight is Doctor Tukta's shift.

261
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,880
Then

262
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,000
Do you have any tips for
getting rid of the sleepiness?

263
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,000
I've already had loads of coffee,

264
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:35,210
but that doesn't help.

265
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,710
Tips for getting
rid of sleepiness?

266
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,080
There might be a way.

267
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:44,210
Try doing jumping jacks.

268
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,500
Huh?

269
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,880
Are you serious, doc?

270
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,880
Many people are nearby.

271
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,540
Trust me.

272
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:53,380
Give it a try.

273
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:54,630
All right.

274
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:56,250
One

275
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,170
Two

276
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:57,710
Three

277
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,500
Four

278
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:05,790
Doc,

279
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,040
you teased me, didn't you?

280
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,500
I've never thought

281
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,920
you'd be this gullible.

282
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,630
Didn't you tell me

283
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,080
that the best way to rest

284
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:20,670
was to take a nap?

285
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,830
What the hell, doc.

286
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,880
I trusted you, you know?

287
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,250
I'm going to find a spot to nap then.

288
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,210
You're really asking for it, huh?

289
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:32,670
If I find you dozing off again,

290
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:34,290
I'll report to Doctor Nil.

291
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,500
I'm leaving now.

292
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,210
Too lazy to argue with you.

293
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,790
Guess who.

294
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,380
I've heard your bell ringing

295
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,880
since you walked into this room.

296
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,130
You still playing this as a grown-up?

297
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,210
Watch your mouth.

298
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,670
Mouth flick!

299
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:22,290
Want some more?

300
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,790
Hey, Tukta.

301
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,880
I have something to ask.

302
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,960
What?

303
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,670
Well

304
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:38,500
I have to go home this week.

305
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:39,790
And

306
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,710
you're working
tonight's shift, right?

307
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:43,040
Yeah.

308
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,130
What about it?

309
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,330
You're going to
ask for a shift trade?

310
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,920
Can I?

311
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,580
And now, out of the blue,

312
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,170
you're pleading with me?

313
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:55,210
Moron.

314
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:58,830
Tukta.

315
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,500
Here he comes.

316
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,330
Here comes my friend.

317
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:03,630
Please

318
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,750
pretty lady Tukta.

319
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,420
The prettiest person

320
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,460
in this hospital.

321
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,080
Help a friend out.

322
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,080
Alright.

323
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:23,830
What a precious friend I am,

324
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,420
you know it.

325
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,080
True!

326
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,540
I never turn down my friends.

327
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:30,580
I really appreciate it.

328
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:33,790
For this favor you've done for me,

329
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:36,630
I shall be ungrateful.

330
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,580
Alright.

331
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,460
No trading then.

332
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,210
Just kidding.

333
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,380
But wait.

334
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:48,080
I think this behavior of yours

335
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,330
is very familiar to me.

336
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,920
I figured it out.

337
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,130
The behavior of asking a friend for help

338
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,460
to skip group project
and go on a date instead.

339
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,210
Don't tell me.

340
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:11,250
You think I don't know
what you're up to?

341
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,290
You better tell me

342
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:17,130
who that doctor is.

343
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:20,170
Tell me everything right now.

344
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:24,540
I said I'm going back home.

345
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:26,290
You're goddamn nosy!

346
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,790
You're swearing now?

347
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,500
You only swear when
you're embarrased.

348
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,290
Want me to guess?

349
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,460
Your favorite type

350
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,880
have never escaped my keen eyes.

351
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,540
Who could he be?

352
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,880
Pete the new nurse, right?

353
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,580
I actually guessed right!

354
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,330
Just smile.

355
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,000
Admit it, you're embarrased.

356
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,920
Quit it.

357
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:06,040
How did it start?

358
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,500
You're not stopping
with the questions.

359
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,290
You can go now.

360
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:11,420
Shy?

361
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Shy.

362
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:14,960
Shy.

363
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,710
Go!

364
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:16,830
Smiling?

365
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:18,830
Shoo!

366
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,790
I'll go, alright.

367
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,290
You're no longer
of any use to me!

368
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,210
But only on one condition.

369
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:29,130
And that is?

370
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:32,750
You must come back and tell me

371
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,170
how everything went

372
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:36,130
on your date.

373
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,250
Okay?

374
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:39,290
Nothing's gonna happen.

375
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,080
Just go away.

376
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:41,670
Sure?

377
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,170
- Yeah.
- Sure.

378
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:44,170
Move it.

379
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,960
Somebody can't keep it together.

380
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,210
Go!

381
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,210
Alright, whatever.

382
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,670
Don't forget our agreement.

383
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,420
Alright, buddy?

384
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,500
So hot.

385
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,580
Wanna sit here?

386
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,250
It's kinda hot.

387
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,670
Have you note things down today?

388
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,080
You're probably
gonna forget me again.

389
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,670
I haven't.

390
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:38,630
Then write it down
now, I'll sit here with you.

391
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,330
Hey, you don't have to.

392
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,670
I'm fine being alone.

393
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,540
Wouldn't want to bore you.

394
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:46,130
I never get bored

395
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,790
looking at your face.

396
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,580
Idiot.

397
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:55,880
Stop teasing me.

398
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:00,380
Write it down.

399
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:01,330
Okay.

400
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,750
May I sit there with you?

401
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,540
It's you, Si.

402
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:15,460
Sure.

403
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,460
Have a seat.

404
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,580
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

405
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:24,210
No worries,

406
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,830
I'm not doing anything.

407
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,790
Si.

408
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,710
This is Win.

409
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,460
Win.

410
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,420
Si.

411
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:42,750
Have you seen each
other's faces before?

412
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:48,750
Of course I have.

413
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,380
I've been here for a long time.

414
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:53,830
Okay.

415
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,170
Oh, Chess.

416
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:00,380
I've been wanting to play chess.

417
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,460
Alan.

418
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,960
Care to play a game
of chess with me?

419
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,250
Chess?

420
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,920
That's right.

421
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,380
Chess.

422
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:14,750
Why do you ask me
to play all of a sudden?

423
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,250
You don't want to play?

424
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:20,790
It's not like that.

425
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,420
Well

426
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:25,750
I'm just not sure
how the game works.

427
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:31,290
Then it wouldn't
hurt to try out, right?

428
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,130
I'm not very good at it either.

429
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:35,420
Just wanted to
practice my skills.

430
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:37,170
Please?

431
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,250
You should try.

432
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,540
There's nothing
better to do anyway.

433
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:46,830
Maybe

434
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,750
it might help you

435
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,170
get some of your memories back.

436
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:53,960
Alright.

437
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:55,670
Let's give it a try.

438
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,290
But do not expect
too much from me.

439
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,540
Good players

440
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:07,330
usually say something
humble like this all the time.

441
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,670
You're not sure?

442
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:27,790
Yes.

443
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,880
What are you hesitant about?

444
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,540
I

445
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
just don't know

446
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:37,080
how to move them.

447
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,830
Try moving the pieces
based on your sensations

448
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,500
and instincts.

449
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,210
What if I made the wrong move?

450
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,880
Then simply restart a new game.

451
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,540
There's nothing to fear.

452
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:02,460
Okay.

453
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:12,420
Not a terrible start.

454
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,170
He left out of the blue
without saying anything.

455
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:31,500
When a person
is falling in love,

456
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:36,210
it is easy to tell.

457
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:42,250
What falling in love, Si?

458
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,420
It's not like that.

459
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,290
It's not?

460
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,130
Are you sure

461
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,880
that it's not?

462
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,540
I'm not exactly sure.

463
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,500
I just think

464
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,380
it can't be that easy.

465
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,500
What is it

466
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,080
that's not easy?

467
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,130
To fall in love with somebody.

468
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,420
I think it couldn't
happen that easily.

469
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,580
Alan.

470
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:18,920
When we fall in love with someone,

471
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:22,580
even though we've just met them,

472
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:25,460
they'll unexpectedly come into our lives,

473
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,580
and next thing we know,

474
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:32,130
we'll find ourselves in
the midst of a love forest.

475
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:35,670
Just like that.

476
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,960
So easily.

477
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,000
Yeah.

478
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,290
You need to ask yourself

479
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,750
whether or not you're
feeling that way.

480
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:55,170
Checkmate.

481
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,710
I've beaten you, Si.

482
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,330
You're pretty good at this.

483
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,380
If I

484
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,040
were to ask for permission

485
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,540
to call you

486
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,920
"Boss",

487
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,380
would that be acceptable?

488
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,880
You are showing
me too much respect.

489
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,000
Not at all.

490
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:22,290
Come on.

491
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,580
Please?

492
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,420
Of course.

493
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:27,330
Whatever you like.

494
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,290
Okay.

495
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,880
Thank you so much.

496
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,040
Boss.

497
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,920
When we realize

498
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:43,790
we're falling in
love with someone,

499
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,630
don't let the opportunity go.

500
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:48,630
One thing

501
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:51,500
that a person in love tends
to make a mistake about

502
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,880
is letting that opportunity go.

503
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:57,000
Please keep that in mind, Boss.

504
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:01,920
I will.

505
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:03,960
Thank you, Si.

506
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,250
Alan.

507
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,080
Time for Doctor
Nil's appointment.

508
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:16,330
Alright.

509
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:18,710
Then,

510
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,080
If you'll excuse me, Si.

511
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:21,830
Of course.

512
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:22,790
Be seeing you.

513
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,500
Okay.

514
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,880
Let's go, Alan.

515
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:42,880
Try putting both your arms up.

516
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,500
All the way up.

517
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:51,630
You can put them down now.

518
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,380
Now, try closing your eyes.

519
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:57,330
Close your eyes.

520
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:03,880
Then, touch your nose
with the right index finger .

521
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,130
Move your body naturally.

522
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:08,960
No need to slow down or rush it.

523
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:16,920
Alright.

524
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,000
Now, try switching to
using your left hand.

525
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,920
Put the left index finger on
your nose in the same way.

526
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,880
Alright.

527
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,540
You can open your eyes now.

528
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:34,630
Now repeat after me.

529
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:38,130
Grandma took her grandchild
to buy sweets at the market.

530
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:41,330
Grandma

531
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,460
took her grandchild
to buy sweets

532
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:44,920
at the market.

533
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,380
Okay.

534
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,540
I have some goodnews for you.

535
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,420
Your C.T. scan result

536
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,210
hasn't shown anything abnormal.

537
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:10,580
No Ischemic stroke.

538
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:11,960
No hemorrhagic stroke.

539
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,880
And no tumor found.

540
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,330
I believe we have
some additional relief.

541
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:22,790
This means

542
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:24,170
I'm cured

543
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:26,500
and can return
home now, right Doc?

544
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,040
A physical examination

545
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,250
cannot provide
complete information.

546
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:37,420
To diagnose

547
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:40,000
and determine whether or not
the condition's been resolved or not

548
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,710
is actually more up to
how the patient feels.

549
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,380
So

550
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,420
If I feel like I'm recovered,

551
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,290
does this mean I
can go home now?

552
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,670
If you think you're recovered,

553
00:32:58,130 --> 00:32:59,540
may I show you this?

554
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,710
Are you still afraid, Alan?

555
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,420
Yes.

556
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:20,710
Can you tell me one more
time that you're recovered?

557
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:27,040
I don't know.

558
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:36,790
Alan.

559
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,830
The primary issue of yours

560
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,920
is the fear.

561
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,420
What do we do when we get scared?

562
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:49,710
I don't know.

563
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,080
I'll tell you a secret.

564
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,920
At the end of fear,
there is nothing.

565
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:00,080
Fear is the dead end,

566
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,130
nothing else more than that.

567
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,420
Then

568
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,080
what do I have to do
to get over my fear?

569
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,670
A solution to deal with fear

570
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:14,420
is very simple.

571
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,290
Embrace your fear to the fullest.

572
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:19,920
Fear it

573
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,080
until we realize that

574
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,460
no matter how much we fear it

575
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,000
and how hard it tries to scare us,

576
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,750
there is nothing more
than fear in the end.

577
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,960
Nothing else.

578
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,500
Right?

579
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,040
Try to think about
what I said, alright?

580
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,460
Okay.

581
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,460
That's all I have for you today.

582
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,210
You can get some rest.

583
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:57,790
Okay.

584
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:35,670
Hey!

585
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,250
What's wrong with you?

586
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,250
What did Doctor Nil said?

587
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,420
He said

588
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:43,330
there's nothing wrong with me,

589
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:45,420
but I still haven't
gotten better.

590
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,250
I'm not sure if that
was good or bad.

591
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:50,290
Well

592
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,040
let's just that was a good news.

593
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,080
Let's go on a little trip.

594
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:53,750
Where?

595
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:54,790
Come on.

596
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:56,290
Hurry.

597
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:01,290
Quicker.

598
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:03,040
Wait.

599
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:05,790
Are we really going to
walk in here like this?

600
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:07,250
Why?

601
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,210
Don't tell me you're
scared of ghosts.

602
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:10,750
Yeah, that too.

603
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:13,420
But wouldn't our presence here

604
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:15,170
disturb them?

605
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:17,750
Disturb who?

606
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,250
The dead.

607
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,080
Don't you ever think

608
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,710
that maybe they're
waiting for us to visit?

609
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,290
My thought is that

610
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:29,830
a dead person and an alive
person aren't really different.

611
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,080
How are they not different?

612
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,880
Well

613
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:38,420
They probably share the same
feelings of loneliness or nostalgia,

614
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:39,830
don't you think?

615
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,250
I guess.

616
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,830
Why did the writing

617
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:47,830
on the gravestones
here fade so much?

618
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,960
Like I said,

619
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,630
no one has visited
and tended them.

620
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,460
The feeling of fear I had

621
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,210
has now turned into
loneliness instead.

622
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,250
I want to apologize
to you for something.

623
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,040
I still feel bad

624
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,000
that I took you to see that
nurse's photo the other day

625
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:20,960
and something went wrong.

626
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,330
It's fine.

627
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,380
You don't have
to think about it.

628
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,630
But I have to admit,

629
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:28,830
I was really scared.

630
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,460
Sorry.

631
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,130
Even knowing that you
were scared of ghosts,

632
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,080
I still brought you there.

633
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:40,750
Actually,

634
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,920
I wasn't scared of ghosts.

635
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,380
Then was there
something else scarier?

636
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,670
If you trust me,

637
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,710
everything will come
to an end with me

638
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,420
and right now.

639
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:17,630
Consider this place your safe spot.

640
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,080
And I'm also your "safe person."

641
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:26,710
You are now free to talk
about anything right now.

642
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:31,960
I was scared I
would get murdered.

643
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,460
Murdered?

644
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,500
Who would have done that?

645
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,250
I don't know.

646
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,750
Might be the old man ghost

647
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,920
or the nurse ghost.

648
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,750
I had fallen

649
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,170
into a depth of horror,

650
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,330
then my dad called me insane

651
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,080
and abandoned me here.

652
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:55,830
You were scared of being
abandoned too, right?

653
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,960
I was more scared of being forgotten.

654
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,830
You were the one who told me

655
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,290
this place was the
hospital of the forgotten.

656
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,540
I've wanted to
ask you for a while.

657
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,750
Why did you call this place
the hospital of the forgotten?

658
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:25,130
Because we've been forgotten,

659
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,290
that's why we still remain here.

660
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:31,460
When we are forgotten for a long time,

661
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,170
one day, we'll eventually lose track

662
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:38,830
of who

663
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:41,210
we really are.

664
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,500
Sometimes I feel like

665
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:51,420
we're no different than the
dead people in this cemetery.

666
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,290
How?

667
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:02,210
Our loneliness is no different

668
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:05,170
from that of a
forgotten dead person.

669
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:12,670
Perhaps if we die from
someone's memory,

670
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:16,330
we will cease to exist.

671
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:22,830
But

672
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,500
we're existing now.

673
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,540
Our flesh and
bones are still intact.

674
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,540
Being alive and existing

675
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:36,710
are not the same thing.

676
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:38,750
Do you know

677
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:42,830
what
keeps our existence going.

678
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:45,130
What is it?

679
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:46,710
Memories.

680
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,000
When we're able to remain
in someone's memory,

681
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:55,880
that's when we
know we're existing.

682
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:57,500
However,

683
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:00,880
If nobody remembers us one day,

684
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,830
we are no different
from the dead.

685
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:12,670
Hey.

686
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:16,830
You're existing to me.

687
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:19,500
How so?

688
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,750
You're right here at
the moment with me,

689
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:25,040
in my memory.

690
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:29,250
Even if I'm sometimes forgetful,

691
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,250
I'll always write
things about you

692
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,750
down in my journal,

693
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,880
and then I'll
remember you instantly.

694
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:39,380
See?

695
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:42,290
You'll always exist to me.

696
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:45,790
Then

697
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:48,630
I'm no longer like the dead, right?

698
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,750
How could you be dead

699
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:55,500
now that you're
already in my memory?

700
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,380
And you'll always be there.

701
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,630
I must go all out.

702
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:05,920
Let's go!

703
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:12,080
Doc!

704
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:13,290
Doc.

705
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:17,460
What's with you.

706
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,210
Didn't you tell me not to slack off?

707
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:28,960
Take a good look at yourself!

708
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:30,710
Sleep like a baby.

709
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:32,420
I wasn't slacking off.

710
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,710
All I did was take
a refreshing nap.

711
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:37,790
Lazy means lazy, Doc.

712
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,000
Don't try to deny it.

713
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:42,330
I wasn't being lazy.

714
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,210
I was just getting some rest

715
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:45,500
for tonight.

716
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,710
I have a night shift
with you tonight.

717
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:52,080
I thought you said tonight
was Dr.Tukta's shift.

718
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:54,920
I've traded with her.

719
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:57,460
What?

720
00:43:58,290 --> 00:43:59,290
Don't you

721
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:02,040
want to work the
night shift with me?

722
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:04,880
It's not like that.

723
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,630
I was just being curious.

724
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:09,750
Well...

725
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:13,750
I...

726
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,420
Just forget it.

727
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:21,330
I saw that you're a newbie,

728
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:24,080
so, in case you run
into any problems,

729
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:25,250
I can offer you an advice.

730
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:28,960
Alright.

731
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:30,460
But...

732
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:32,250
about tonight,

733
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:40,580
I didn't bring
enough sandwiches.

734
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:42,080
What are you going to eat then?

735
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,880
That's what you're
worried about?

736
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:49,880
I'm not going to
steal your food.

737
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,540
Feel free to eat them.

738
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:54,540
Are you sure?

739
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,040
Last time,

740
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:58,920
who was scavenging the
fridge in the middle of the night?

741
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,080
Just eat.

742
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:05,170
I won't take your food anymore.

743
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:06,290
Okay?

744
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:07,330
Alright.

745
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,250
I'll be sure to provoke
you while I eat.

746
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:12,790
I gotta go.

747
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,960
see you tonight, Doc.

748
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:41,580
So

749
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:43,170
Which one's your room?

750
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:45,880
I'll swing by there
in my free time.

751
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:48,130
It's okay.

752
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:49,170
I don't wanna bother you.

753
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,540
Want me to walk you to your room?

754
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:58,750
Are you having naughty thoughts?

755
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:01,710
What naughty?

756
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:03,540
Go back to your room now.

757
