1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,630
Currently, your memory pattern

2
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,210
is 1, 3, 5, 4 and 2.

3
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,670
even though it should have been

4
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:17,790
1 2 3 4 5.

5
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:18,750
Alan, listen to me.

6
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:20,170
You have a problem with memorization.

7
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:22,000
Maybe you had left that room,

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,170
but you just couldn't remember?

9
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:24,500
I don't want to be here anymore.

10
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:25,710
Please get me out of this place.

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,130
But me must plan carefully.

12
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:28,420
I'm not dreaming, am I?

13
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,960
Can we travel to somewhere
near Rangsit Khlong 12?

14
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,290
I have a friend named Nate.

15
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,830
Are you sure your friend won't send us back to the hospital?

16
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,790
Jealous?

17
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:35,580
I dunno.

18
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,880
I just don't want anyone else
to matter more to you than I do.

19
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:38,630
Alan.

20
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,830
Run, hurry!

21
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:40,880
Found him!

22
00:01:35,289 --> 00:01:36,630
Once upon a time, a man

23
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,630
had a dream he was a floating butterfly.

24
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,750
When the butterfly became weary,

25
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:43,210
it landed on the branch and fell asleep.

26
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,830
When the butterfly slept,

27
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,539
the man woke up.

28
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,500
When the man fell back asleep again,

29
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,000
the butterfly awakened.

30
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,630
When the butterfly went to sleep,

31
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,920
the man awoke.

32
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,750
The man'd slept,

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,210
the butterfly awoke.

34
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,500
Over and over.

35
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,540
Win.

36
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,829
Win.

37
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:12,500
Win.

38
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,130
Mister.

39
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,710
Oh, Alan.

40
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,540
Who are you?

41
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,130
Alan.

42
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,130
I'm your dad.

43
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,209
Dad?

44
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,000
Dad.

45
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,750
Dad.

46
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,960
Dad.

47
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,250
Alan!

48
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,210
Alan!

49
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,670
Dad.

50
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:06,290
I tried talking to him, but
he hadn't yet spoken much.

51
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,000
He seems different.

52
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:12,670
Did you do anything?

53
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,250
I increased his
medication dosage.

54
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:18,790
What medicine, Doctor?

55
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,500
This has been too
much for him already.

56
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,630
It was the same medication,
but at a higher dose.

57
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,750
It was also the best method

58
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,290
for controlling his behavior.

59
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,000
If we hadn't done this,

60
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,170
he wouldn't have calmed
down and cooperated.

61
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,670
And about his hospital escape,

62
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,290
how did he manage to get out?

63
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,170
He might have escaped
through the cemetery.

64
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,380
Why did he escape?

65
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,580
He's never escaped before.

66
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:54,170
Doctor Nil.

67
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,040
Should we try changing
the treatment method?

68
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,290
Change?

69
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:04,830
How would you change that?

70
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,580
Isn't what we've been
doing right now our best?

71
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,540
I believe that if
we keep doing this,

72
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,170
he will definitely be treated..

73
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,790
Listen to me, Doc.

74
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,380
I think this method may no
longer be effective with him.

75
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,290
He just forgot who I was today.

76
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,170
I don't want to leave him
here like this anymore.

77
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,380
If this keeps happening,

78
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,960
I'll come take him
home next week.

79
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,920
I...

80
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:44,920
You asked me to look after him,

81
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,750
but you never had
any faith in me?

82
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,170
I did.

83
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,250
I always trusted you.

84
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,330
But maybe we've
reached the dead-end.

85
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,040
Are you a doctor, huh?

86
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,250
Are you a doctor to state
that this is a dead end?

87
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,580
Are you a doctor with the
authority to judge me like that?

88
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,630
We've been in this
situation for too long.

89
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,750
Don't you ever get tired?

90
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,380
I love him so much, Doctor.

91
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,040
I want him to get better.

92
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,830
But if things like
this continue,

93
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,670
I will not stand it anymore.

94
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,210
You think I didn't love him, Alex?

95
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,960
I love him as much as you do.

96
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,000
And if I were you,

97
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,290
I would never let my loved
ones become like that forever.

98
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,080
Nevertheless,

99
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,000
I'll remain true to what I said.

100
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:48,790
Sorry Nil,

101
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,460
if I hurted your feelings.

102
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,210
You are free to do as you please.

103
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,750
My duty is over, so if you'd excuse me.

104
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,210
O.

105
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:54,330
Nil.

106
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,250
What are you doing all alone in here?

107
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I

108
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,580
I need a little change of scenery.

109
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,790
Sometimes being in the same corner

110
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,380
stresses me out.

111
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,000
I've got some things to think about.

112
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:17,420
Did you

113
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,040
have an argument with Alex in the morning?

114
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,330
Do you think doctors

115
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,750
are allowed to be discouraged?

116
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,500
Do you think we need to be able to handle

117
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,540
every situation?

118
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,960
Do we have to put up with
whatever everyone throws at us?

119
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,000
Doctors are human too.

120
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,540
It's normal for us to be tired.

121
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,710
Right?

122
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,830
What's your opinion on Alan's case?

123
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:02,790
What about that?

124
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,790
Do you believe we can treat him?

125
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,210
We definitely going to make him better.

126
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,330
Everything all right?

127
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,250
I think I may have to

128
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,580
find someone else

129
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,580
to take over my responsibilities.

130
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,330
Nil.

131
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,420
We have come too far

132
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,130
to give up at this point..

133
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,880
I didn't mean I was
going to stop treating him.

134
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,500
I just feel like I'm not ready.

135
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm having trouble managing
several things at once right now

136
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,790
so I may need to take a break before

137
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:45,630
I'm capable of resuming my duties as a doctor.

138
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:53,210
Would you look after Alan's case for me?

139
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:01,330
You can't just throw your work at me like that.

140
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,880
I've thought it through.

141
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:05,960
What if he doesn't approve of me?

142
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,500
You're closer to him than I am.

143
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,380
You've been with me and Alan

144
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,040
for long enough.

145
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,000
I believe you can do it.

146
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,420
What choices do I have?

147
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,170
Thank you.

148
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:33,500
I really mean it.

149
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,040
Don't make such a sad face,

150
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,540
you'll get me even more worried.

151
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,920
Alright?

152
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,540
Go for it.

153
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,170
My memory

154
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,540
has started to return

155
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,000
every time I read this journal.

156
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,380
Although I can't remember
exactly what happened that day,

157
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,830
the sensation has never faded.

158
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,790
I have a profound feeling

159
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,710
and I miss him very much.

160
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,630
But I'm starting to have a harder
time recognizing Win's face.

161
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:07,290
How many days have passed

162
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,130
since Win and I haven't met?

163
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,130
Did something happen to him

164
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,830
after the incident that day?

165
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,210
It's time for your medication, Alan.

166
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:43,500
Please take the pills.

167
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,540
When you're finished,

168
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,880
please open your mouth.

169
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,920
Is it really necessary to open my mouth?

170
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,790
Just making sure, Alan.

171
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,080
Sure about what?

172
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,420
Alan.

173
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,540
I'm just doing my job.

174
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,080
Who gave the order?

175
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:18,920
Was it Doctor Nil?

176
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,330
It was my order.

177
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:31,000
What gives you the authority to order me?

178
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,750
It's my authority as your
case's personal doctor.

179
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,290
My case's personal doctor?

180
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,080
What about Doctor Nil?

181
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,920
At this time,

182
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,170
Doctor Nil has his hands full of cases,

183
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,500
so I took this opportunity to

184
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:56,460
take over and handle your case in his place.

185
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,880
Personally,

186
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,290
I believe we're quite close.

187
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,500
This wouldn't be a problem for you, is it?

188
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:04,960
So what?

189
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,380
If I were to have a problem,

190
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,000
would anyone in this place care about me?

191
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,830
Alan.

192
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,170
Try to give it some careful thought.

193
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,830
Have the doctors

194
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,000
really never cared about you?

195
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,790
Weren't the doctors,

196
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,080
all this time,

197
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,170
the ones who were
trying to understand you?

198
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,750
Guess you're right.

199
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,000
I also wanted to let you know that,

200
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,710
as a doctor,

201
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,000
my responsibility is to treat you.

202
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:48,250
However, treating a
patient until they're cured

203
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,250
is not so simple.

204
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,170
There are numerous
other factors involved.

205
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,130
But do you know

206
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,580
what's the most important?

207
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,000
What is it?

208
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:03,540
Try to guess.

209
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,210
Medications?

210
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:12,330
Surgical procedures?

211
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:13,580
Wrong answers.

212
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,210
Just tell me what
the answer is, Doc.

213
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:18,130
It's the doctor-patient relationship.

214
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,750
Simply put,

215
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,670
the trust between a doctor and a patient.

216
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,830
Despite how well the treatment is,

217
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,880
if the doctor and the
patient don't trust each other,

218
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,710
that treatment wouldn't work out at all.

219
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,580
We don't need to talk about

220
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,920
whether you'll get better or not.

221
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,670
And the fact that I told
Pete to keep checking

222
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,790
to see if you had taken
all of your medications

223
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,040
not that I didn't trust you,

224
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,130
but I needed to keep records

225
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,830
in accordance with the treatment plan.

226
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,500
Therefore,

227
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,710
should we work together

228
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,960
to help you get better sooner?

229
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:20,830
If trusting you

230
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,210
means I'll get better sooner,

231
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,710
then let's go for it.

232
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,250
Thank you

233
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,210
for having faith in me.

234
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,500
I promise

235
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,330
that I'll do my best.

236
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:46,210
Okay.

237
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,670
Alan.

238
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:52,210
I believe

239
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,830
you'll certainly be well again.

240
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,829
What are your thoughts on the earlier.

241
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:10,670
That was pretty dramatic.

242
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,710
Dramatic?

243
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,130
I knew you were

244
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:18,500
acting to earn the patient's trust.

245
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,579
Which nursing school did you graduate from?

246
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,960
Any hospital makes use of this technique.

247
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,380
Hey.

248
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,080
Why do you have to be so serious?

249
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,000
I was just fooling around.

250
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,380
You had a smart mouth when you were in that room.

251
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,380
Guess whose face looks
so stressed right now.

252
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,630
I'm not stressed.

253
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,330
I'm a doctor,

254
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,330
so it's normal for me to appear serious

255
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,880
in order for the patient to trust me.

256
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,130
They called it

257
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:52,880
the doctor-patient relationship.

258
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,920
Got it?

259
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:56,670
Brilliant words!

260
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,830
And how about the doctor-nurse relationship?

261
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:01,830
What do you think?

262
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,960
What are you talking about?

263
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,250
What's the hurry?

264
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,750
What are you doing?

265
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,710
This is a hospital.

266
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,170
Well, a little birdy told me

267
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,500
that you like me.

268
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:32,670
Who told you that?

269
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,250
I'm going to tell you

270
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:39,920
that I like you too.

271
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,540
Is it okay to kiss you?

272
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,500
No.

273
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,210
Then,

274
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:32,920
maybe another time?

275
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,130
How would I know

276
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,920
you're not lying to me?

277
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:49,330
Guess I'll

278
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,960
have to leave you with this.

279
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:27,920
I like you, Doctor.

280
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:35,000
Would you mind if I sit with you?

281
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:44,380
Sitting alone with your
mind elsewhere like this,

282
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,380
did I wake you up

283
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,630
from the sweet daydream you were having?

284
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,710
Would you like a match?

285
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,380
The dark pieces are yours.

286
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:13,080
Today is the last day that I'll be here.

287
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,170
I'd like to play a last match with you

288
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,790
on my final day in this place.

289
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,710
If you win,

290
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:23,500
you can ask me anything.

291
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:26,170
I'll answer you as much as I can.

292
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,830
Are you interested

293
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,170
in this offer?

294
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:31,290
Where are you going?

295
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,460
I have to go back home.

296
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:38,880
So be it.

297
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:42,670
Today, it seems like

298
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:45,210
your mind is wandering off.

299
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:48,670
Perhaps I am going to be the victor.

300
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,750
Do I

301
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:55,630
look distracted?

302
00:22:58,130 --> 00:22:59,630
Yeah, you look strange.

303
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,880
I don't know.

304
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,290
I can sense that.

305
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,580
So

306
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,460
Win is not coming?

307
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,920
Win?

308
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:22,170
Alan!

309
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,710
Run, hurry!

310
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:28,000
I haven't seen
him for a while now.

311
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:29,710
Oh dear.

312
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:32,040
I thought the two of you were inseperable.

313
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:34,000
Did you guys fight or something?

314
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:36,580
No.

315
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,630
It's kinda strange though.

316
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,920
I didn't feel like I wanted to see him,

317
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:49,880
nor did I even miss him.

318
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:54,630
Very strange.

319
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,080
They increased your
medicine dose, haven't they?

320
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:06,830
Yes.

321
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,080
I see.

322
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,000
That medicine...

323
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,750
what about it?

324
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,670
Take a good look at yourself.

325
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:22,130
Since the dosage has been increased,

326
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,630
we're calmer than before.

327
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,750
That's because doctors here use medications

328
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,170
to keep the patients under control.

329
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,250
It felt a bit blurry

330
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:33,540
obedient,

331
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,250
and perfectly happy, right?

332
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,710
But you should ask yourself

333
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:49,210
if this is actually what you desire.

334
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,830
You seem to have a pretty good grasp of my thoughts.

335
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,040
despite having only known each other for a short time.

336
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:02,170
I'm just speaking as someone
who has been here for a long time.

337
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:04,000
and has witnessed lots of things.

338
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,080
Actually, I'm beginning to suspect

339
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:10,380
that the treatment in this place
haven't improved my condition at all.

340
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,080
There were also the medications

341
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,580
that you said the doctors
increased the dosage of,

342
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,880
which made me look like a nutcase.

343
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,380
Maybe

344
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:27,630
I was just talking nonsense.

345
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,540
What were you expecting from the patient...

346
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,330
That's not true.

347
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,330
...like me?

348
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,540
If you know something,

349
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:34,880
you better tell me.

350
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,040
I think that

351
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:40,460
the two of us

352
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,960
have something in common.

353
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:49,670
How are we alike?

354
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,080
You and I

355
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:54,000
have been trying to bridge the gap

356
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:56,080
between imagination

357
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,460
and reality.

358
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,130
Sometimes,

359
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:02,170
what we thought were imaginations

360
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,460
or dreams

361
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:07,710
turned out to be reality.

362
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,920
However, what we believed to be real

363
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:13,580
got muddled and mixed up

364
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,380
to the point that

365
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,080
we had no idea what was true.

366
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,670
Dreams...

367
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,790
were like hallucinations.

368
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,080
They might have had some kind of truth

369
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:29,380
trying to communicate with us.

370
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:32,750
Perhaps it was just a ripped page

371
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:36,210
from our memory journal.

372
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:40,080
But, no matter how torn apart it was,

373
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:43,210
it did contain something

374
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:45,580
that could be linked to our past.

375
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:47,130
Checkmate!

376
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,290
Darn it.

377
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,790
Even while hazy,

378
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,170
you still made a comeback.

379
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:58,540
I was just following my instincts.

380
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,790
Now.

381
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:05,170
Since I've won,

382
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,580
you have to keep your promise.

383
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,210
Time for you to answer my question

384
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,580
like we agreed.

385
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,040
Who is this man?

386
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:27,960
You knew him, right?

387
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,130
Who is this man?

388
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,080
I really can't

389
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,000
answer that.

390
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,790
You're lying.

391
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:42,290
You promised

392
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:44,250
you'd tell me if I won.

393
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,500
This is all I can help you.

394
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,130
You have to find the answers on your own, boss.

395
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,080
That's not true.

396
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,290
You promised me.

397
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,210
You told me we were alike.

398
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
If we really are alike

399
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,040
then you must understand how I feel!

400
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:02,420
Please

401
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,250
I beg you, Si.

402
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:04,080
Help me!

403
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,500
Please help me!

404
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:10,000
I've returned something for you under
the table where we first played chess.

405
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:14,000
No matter what the outcome was today,

406
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:16,670
I intended to give it back to you anyway.

407
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,290
What is it?

408
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,000
What is it, tell me?

409
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,500
Who is this old man?

410
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:25,380
Miss Si?

411
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,670
Where are you?

412
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,460
Your family is here to take you home.

413
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:47,000
No matter how many times

414
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
you get haunted,

415
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:50,960
I want you to trust your own instincts.

416
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,920
Trust your own instincts!

417
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:56,000
Good luck, chief.

418
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,000
I've returned something for you under
the table where we first played chess.

419
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,130
No matter what the outcome was today,

420
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:14,920
I intended to give it back to you anyway.

421
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:18,540
I've compared both of the journals.

422
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,000
The handwriting was certainly mine.

423
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,880
There's no denying that the stories were mine.

424
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,210
This is another notebook in which I wrote,

425
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,710
but I had written it five months ago.

426
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,130
What the heck is this?

427
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,920
Have I been here before?

428
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,290
6

429
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:35,250
7

430
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,250
8

431
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:37,460
9

432
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,380
Today, I had a treatment session

433
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:44,790
with Doctor Nil

434
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,210
and Doctor O.

435
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:50,670
Doctor Nil asked me about
the nurse on the other night.

436
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,790
I've never seen that nurse before.

437
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:55,420
Never had memories of her in my head.

438
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:58,000
Are you sure

439
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,880
you have never seen this nurse before?

440
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:04,000
One of the patients

441
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:06,080
came to greet me in the cafeteria today.

442
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:07,380
He was pretty cute

443
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,750
and friendly.

444
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:10,540
He told me his name was Win.

445
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,580
This is not the first time I'm here.

446
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:15,210
I first met Win five months ago.

447
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,290
Our beginning was the same.

448
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,000
I didn't like him

449
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,170
until we opened up,

450
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,170
spent time together,

451
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,880
fell in love.

452
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:31,330
What the hell?

453
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:34,210
My life is a movie that replays back and forth?

454
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,960
Alan?

455
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,250
Alan.

456
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:47,880
Alan.

457
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,330
There you are.

458
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,790
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

459
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:52,460
Oh, Pete.

460
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:55,250
Do you need anything?

461
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,040
Time for your medications.

462
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:00,000
Alright.

463
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,380
All done.

464
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,210
Alan.

465
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,830
Get plenty of rest

466
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,170
so you can get well soon.

467
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:35,040
Okay.

468
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,380
Win's room, as I've noted

469
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,040
is either 303

470
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:55,000
or 305.

471
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:57,290
I didn't write it down very clearly.

472
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:06,000
Win.

473
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:10,130
Win.

474
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,170
Win.

475
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,250
Win.

476
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:30,000
Alan.

477
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:33,330
Quick! Get in!

478
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,130
Alan.

479
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:16,210
How did you make it here this far?

480
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,080
I miss you so much.

481
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:29,380
I'm so sorry

482
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:33,210
I didn't visit you.

483
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:36,170
Since that day,

484
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,540
I've been scared.

485
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:42,960
I didn't want to get you in trouble anymore.

486
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,500
Win.

487
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,080
Why...

488
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,920
did you

489
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:01,290
decide to approach me?

490
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,040
Can you answer me that?

491
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:15,580
What?

492
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,080
I asked you

493
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:21,330
why you chose to talk to me

494
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,920
when there were a lot of other people.

495
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:30,630
I...

496
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I only thought you could be my friend.

497
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:39,830
I had been alone for a long time,

498
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:40,830
and I felt lonely.

499
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:42,710
I wanted to have friends.

500
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:45,330
Why?

501
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:47,250
Which time are you referring about, Win?

502
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:00,000
This notebook

503
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,670
contains our stories.

504
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,170
I just got it

505
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,750
not long ago.

506
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,210
The inside of this notebook

507
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:15,250
is filled with so many stories

508
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:18,920
between me and you.

509
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,130
Shall I read

510
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,460
some of them for you?

511
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:30,630
Which one should I pick first?

512
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Let's read this one.

513
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:38,750
It was May 5th.

514
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,540
The sun was scorching hot that day.

515
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:44,880
Win took me for a walk in the garden.

516
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:48,960
But the sun light was really hot,

517
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,630
so we hid in the shade.

518
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:54,210
On June 15,

519
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:57,960
Win was going to take me to the cemetery,

520
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,080
but I was terrified.

521
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:01,250
So Win told me that

522
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,170
if I no longer felt scared,

523
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,580
he would take me there again

524
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,880
on June 5th.

525
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:13,210
Win asked me to be his partner.

526
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,580
What's the meaning of all of this?

527
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,830
Hmm?

528
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,960
Would you tell me

529
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:30,580
what everything in this notebook is all about?

530
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,540
Hmm?

531
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:36,750
Or

532
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:40,540
did you scheme up

533
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:43,830
with those doctors to deceive me?

534
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:45,710
Huh?

535
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:49,580
Answer me, Win!

536
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:51,500
Answer me.

537
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:54,330
I never wanted to decieve you.

538
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:03,460
You know,

539
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:05,880
at this point in my life,

540
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,750
I have lost all my trust in everyone.

541
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,920
The doctors?

542
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,630
Or even with you.

543
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,210
Be honest with me, Win.

544
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,250
How does it feel

545
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:23,380
to have

546
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,040
to come see my face

547
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,290
everyday

548
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,210
and trick me

549
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,540
every time?

550
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:40,210
Hmm?

551
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:43,040
I have reasons

552
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:47,250
why I had to approach you this way.

553
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:50,420
What reasons?

554
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,710
Because you have a
memory condition, Alan.

555
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:07,290
I had to become a stranger in your eyes

556
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,670
again and again.

557
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:14,330
Why didn't you tell me?

558
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:18,500
It wasn't easy

559
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:23,000
that I had to come to you and
tell you we'd known each other,

560
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,790
but you couldn't remember.

561
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,540
I wasn't easy for me at all.

562
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:40,420
I'd always be the one
missing from your memory,

563
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,210
while in my memory,

564
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:47,920
you're still in there.

565
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,170
But I've never blamed you, Alan.

566
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,000
Because I loved you so much,

567
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,380
that's why I allowed things to go this way

568
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,580
no matter how many times they'd happen.

569
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:16,790
If I go back to forgetting things again,

570
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,040
would you come back for me?

571
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,330
Please don't leave me.

572
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,080
Please come back for me.

573
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,460
I promise

574
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,080
no matter how many times it happens again,

575
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:49,960
I'll always come back for you.

576
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:53,580
Hey.

577
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:57,170
There's a place

578
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,830
I'd like to go.

579
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,330
In this notebook

580
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,380
of mine.

581
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:12,170
I wrote down multiple stories

582
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:14,830
between myself

583
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:16,580
and the director's office.

584
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:21,880
I noted that

585
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,670
I had seen the old man ghost

586
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:27,500
at the director's office.

587
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,880
I'm sure you know.

588
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:38,130
There must have been some connection

589
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:40,210
between me and
that room, for sure.

590
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:45,880
Would you take me to that room?

591
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,290
If you want me to trust you again,

592
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,630
of course.

593
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:55,710
Would you, Win?

594
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,040
Is this here?

595
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,710
Why is this the only separated building?

596
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:23,710
So weird.

597
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:27,000
This place was probably
where he spent most of his life.

598
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:31,630
Let's take a look inside.

599
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:07,960
What do you know about this former director?

600
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:12,710
He had intended to utilize this land
as a community for psychiatric patients,

601
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:15,630
but that never happened.

602
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:19,920
What kind of person was he?

603
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,000
I only know that

604
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:25,000
he had good intentions

605
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:26,420
when he built this place.

606
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:31,210
Because he had also struggled hard

607
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:33,830
since he had nothing.

608
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,960
From an orphan with no family

609
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,000
to becoming a psychiatrist

610
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:44,000
who had been acknowledged at that era.

611
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:48,790
So where is he right now?

612
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:50,630
Is he dead?

613
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,210
No one knows.

614
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:05,290
Are you ready?

615
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,420
I'm right here with you,

616
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:23,960
but in the end...

617
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:27,000
You're going to have to make
your own decision what to do next.

618
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:30,040
But if this is the only way

619
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:32,580
that'll get you the answers,

620
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,290
then there's nothing more to be afraid of.

621
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:00,790
What?

622
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:03,250
I saw you were stunned and thought you'd been haunted.

623
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:05,250
You asshole.

624
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:06,670
I almost pissed myself.

625
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,080
Shit!

626
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:10,830
Alan.

627
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:20,960
Where are you?

628
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Where are you?

629
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:25,630
Where are you?

630
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:29,710
Where are you?

631
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:31,040
Get yourself out here!

632
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:42,460
Alan.

633
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:52,830
Who are you?

634
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:54,500
What do you want from me?

635
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:00,540
Just answer me!

636
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,630
Remember.

637
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,130
If you can't remember, come back to me.

638
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:09,330
Return to where?

639
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:12,080
Where do you want me to go?

640
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:14,080
Where do I have to return to?

641
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:15,130
Huh?

642
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:16,830
Come back to me.

643
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:19,080
He's not your father.

644
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,210
Who's not my father?

645
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,250
Who's not my father?

646
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:29,500
Who's not my father?

647
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,380
Hey, wait!

648
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:34,500
Come back!

649
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:46,290
Did you hear?

650
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:48,040
Did you hear what he said?

651
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:50,920
No.

652
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:52,830
What did he say?

653
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:54,920
He said my dad

654
00:46:58,330 --> 00:46:59,630
wasn't my real father.

655
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:31,170
Dad?
