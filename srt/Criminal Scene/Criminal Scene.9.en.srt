=Episode 9=

3
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,260
Sneaking around all the time.

4
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:47,980
Secretly filming?

5
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:48,590
You got what?

6
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,110
Let me see.

7
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:52,260
Hand it over.

8
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:55,540
Buddy, you sure aim high.

9
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:00,500
You're back.

10
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:03,340
Have you eaten?

11
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,430
Enjoy your meal.

12
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:12,780
Xiaotang told me

13
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,190
that on the Horror Night at the bar,

14
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:16,780
someone pushed her into the river.

15
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:18,940
I was recusing myself then.

16
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:20,500
Do you know what happened?

17
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,620
Back then, Liu Ang's case
hadn't been closed,

18
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,150
and Jiang Xiaotang was still involved.

19
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,310
Can you talk about it now?

20
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,780
That night, Jiang Xiaotang

21
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,430
was wandering around.

22
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,620
She said someone pushed her
into the river.

23
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,620
There are no security cameras
along the way.

24
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,340
Our tech team looked into it.

25
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,900
But they couldn't find any useful clues.

26
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:52,940
Xiaotang,

27
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,100
let's have dinner tonight.

28
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:57,710
I'll pick you up.

29
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,150
When you paint, don't be distracted.

30
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,900
Feel it with your heart.

31
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,540
How is it going
with you and Jiang Xiaotang?

32
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,310
I've looked for her several times

33
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,310
and even sent gifts.

34
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,060
But it doesn't seem to work.

35
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,270
What you want is her forgiveness.

36
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,660
Does it really matter

37
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,940
how you get it?

38
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,060
I'll do my best.

39
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,820
I'll use whatever it takes.

40
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,900
This painting is a big improvement.

41
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,710
You know,

42
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,380
all good people have one thing
in common.

43
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,600
They sympathize with the weak.

44
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,550
Do you think
Jiang Xiaotang is a good person?

45
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:51,940
(Jiang Xiaotang)

46
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,820
(Sorry. The number you've dialed...)

47
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,550
Are you okay, miss?

48
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,260
Yeah, I'm fine.

49
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,230
Let's go to the hospital.

50
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,500
It's okay. You can go.

51
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,190
Thank you.

52
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,580
Then be careful.

53
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:06,580
Xiaotang.

54
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,550
Geezer Gu.

55
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,550
What happened to you?

56
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:09,360
Did anyone bully you?

57
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,350
No one bullied me.

58
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,870
I fell while skateboarding.

59
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,790
Let me see where got hurt.

60
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,910
Nothing serious.

61
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,790
You silly girl.

62
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:22,870
I was worried sick.

63
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:23,940
I've called you many times.

64
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:24,620
But no answer.

65
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,310
What did you do?

66
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,430
I was playing with my phone in class

67
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,190
until it died.

68
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,260
So I missed your calls.

69
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,700
Look at you.

70
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,790
Real impressive, huh?

71
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,110
Playing on your phone in class.
Seriously?

72
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,620
I'm sorry. Sorry.

73
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:37,750
Don't just stand there.

74
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:38,820
Get on.

75
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,350
Stop pretending. Hop in.

76
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,940
I'm not faking it. I'm really in pain.

77
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:45,940
I'm in pain

78
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,500
and I can't endure this bumpy road.

79
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,110
Fine, get down.

80
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:53,580
I got an idea.

81
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,430
Hop on.

82
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,380
I'm not used

83
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,190
to you being nice like this.

84
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,430
I'm just looking out for you.

85
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,870
This moment

86
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,620
is so touching.

87
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:08,140
I feel like saying something
from the heart.

88
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,020
Buy me an electric skateboard.

89
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,670
With that brain of yours?

90
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,350
You can't even handle this one.

91
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,620
An electric one?

92
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,500
You would probably fall on your bum.

93
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,910
When you graduate

94
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,750
and start making your own money,

95
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,620
you buy whatever board you want.

96
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,350
Right?

97
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,460
You're just stingy.

98
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,430
Can't you just get me one?

99
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,430
Push harder, Geezer Gu.

100
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,190
Full speed ahead!

101
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,580
Captain Gu, I was looking for you.

102
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,670
A letter for you.

103
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,270
Thanks.

104
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,460
I was about to get it.

105
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,510
You look all dressed up.

106
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,340
Another blind date?

107
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,940
You should marry yourself off quickly.

108
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,740
Just worry about yourself.

109
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,820
I'll get married before you.

110
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,060
(I've been watching you guys. X)

111
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:16,630
Captain,

112
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,740
I have something important

113
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,860
but nothing serious to tell you.

114
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:22,460
What is it?

115
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,580
Jiang Xiaotang is in trouble.

116
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,660
(Life has been so hard for you.
Don't you want revenge? X)

117
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:06,740
Hello?

118
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:08,580
Who are you?

119
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,340
Are you content?

120
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,550
I just realized something.

121
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:31,940
How did you know

122
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,340
that she's in trouble before I did?

123
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,310
Jiang Xiaotang,
you're really something.

124
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,820
You think you can hit people
because your brother's a police?

125
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,190
He messed with me. He deserved it.

126
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,740
You've got some nerve, huh?

127
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,430
He bothered you.

128
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,790
You could've told the teacher.

129
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,790
Why resort to violence?

130
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,670
Jiang Xiaotang,
did you cause trouble again?

131
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,150
He... He was following me!
Secretly filming me every day.

132
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:55,270
Freaking creep!

133
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,340
A stalker, huh?

134
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,580
Hey, you! Why did you follow my sister?

135
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,460
But I won't hurt her!

136
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,630
I just... I like her.

137
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:13,460
Oh, look.

138
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,030
Li Qi.

139
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,580
As a man,

140
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,910
can't you even lift this?

141
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,390
Don't tell me you're already weak
in the waist at your age?

142
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,950
Wang Qian, don't you have
anything better to do?

143
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,550
If you're so capable, ace the next exam

144
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,510
like Li Qi and score a scholarship.

145
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,290
If you're so tough, lift it!

146
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,220
No, you do it.

147
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:44,460
Not bad.

148
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:50,510
After that day,

149
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,030
I just wanted to...

150
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,580
I just wanted to be around her

151
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,190
because she was so cool.

152
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,060
I admired her so much.

153
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,580
Listen.

154
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,580
Next time, speak up earlier, okay?

155
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,700
I'm sorry about that.

156
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,270
Sorry.

157
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,580
Great taste.

158
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:09,940
Great taste.

159
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,910
Students should focus on studying,

160
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,390
not dating.

161
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,340
Stop following her.

162
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,220
Do you know stalking

163
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,030
and secretly taking photos are illegal?

164
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,460
I only wanted to protect her.

165
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,740
You? Protect me?

166
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,270
How about protecting yourself first?

167
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:30,580
Xiaotang,

168
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,460
there is this guy
who has been following you.

169
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,100
Following me?

170
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,940
Geezer Gu,

171
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,860
you scared me.

172
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,060
Let's go home.

173
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:45,190
Sneaking around? Secretly recording?

174
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:46,940
What did you get? Let me see.

175
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,220
Hand it over.

176
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,580
Buddy, you sure aim high.

177
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,980
Wanna hook up with Jiang Xiaotang?

178
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:58,510
What?

179
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:14,910
Are there more?

180
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:16,980
There's another time.

181
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:47,510
Miss.

182
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,310
Are you okay, miss?

183
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:49,980
Yeah, I'm fine.

184
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,860
Go to the hospital?

185
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,060
It's okay. You can go.

186
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:52,580
Thank you.

187
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,220
Then be careful.

188
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,390
Xiaotang.

189
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,220
Geezer Gu.

190
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:02,790
What happened?

191
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:03,600
Did anyone bully you?

192
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,820
I fell while skateboarding.

193
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,910
Can't you just get me one?

194
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,460
Go, go, Geezer Gu!

195
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,150
Full speed ahead!

196
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,510
Li Qi, what is this that you're taking?

197
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,150
Your photography skills are too bad.

198
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,820
Jiang Xiaotang, don't joke around.

199
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,980
So you went to warn Jiang Xiaotang today

200
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:40,190
but ended up getting beaten up?

201
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,100
But it's not her fault.

202
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,820
I just didn't explain myself well.

203
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,820
Too bad your photos aren't very clear.

204
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:49,340
All right.

205
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,980
I'll check
the nearby security footage later.

206
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:52,630
Here.

207
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,060
Captain Gu,

208
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,510
could someone be trying

209
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,630
to get revenge on your family?

210
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:03,580
Li Qi,

211
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,310
can you send me those photos?

212
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,270
Sure.

213
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,980
You can send them to me.

214
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,940
I'll add you to my contacts.

215
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,460
Next time, just tell me directly.

216
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,740
Stop sneaking around.

217
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,150
Okay.

218
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,150
I won't do it again.

219
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:23,700
Ms. Shen,

220
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,390
Sorry for causing you trouble again.

221
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,190
I'm truly sorry.

222
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:26,910
Don't worry.

223
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:27,670
Well.

224
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,390
I'll take Xiaotang

225
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,740
home myself today.

226
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,910
And I will leave our brave student

227
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,100
to our brave officer.

228
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:38,440
He need someone to escort?

229
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:39,790
Of course.

230
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,460
Let's go.

231
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:44,980
You can get up now.

232
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:46,510
Come with me.

233
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:54,980
Geezer Gu

234
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,030
Stop looking all so serious.

235
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,100
Maybe a guy
has a crush on me, like Li Qi,

236
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,110
and that's why he was following me.

237
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:03,780
Maybe.

238
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,110
You might actually be growing up

239
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:09,070
and catching the attention
of all these boys.

240
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,070
From now on,

241
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,120
I'll pick you up
and drop you off at school.

242
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:16,460
Really?

243
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:18,460
Don't joke around.

244
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,070
You won't have the time.

245
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:22,110
I'm a man of my word, okay?

246
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:27,670
Gu Zhen!

247
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,990
- Your sister.
- Say something!

248
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:32,980
Sis,

249
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:35,740
why are you calling Geezer Gu this late?

250
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,910
Do you still have feelings for him?

251
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,390
Jiang Xiaotang,

252
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,090
you'll get yourself killed because
of him if you don't listen to me.

253
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,070
From today, you're staying
in the university dorm.

254
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,350
You can only go home on weekends.

255
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,150
Go pack your stuff now.

256
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:49,940
Gu Zhen,

257
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,980
you know exactly why my sister

258
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,390
keeps getting into trouble.

259
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:55,590
Do her a favor

260
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,740
and stop dragging her down.

261
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,540
I'm a university student.

262
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,940
Stop treating me like a child.

263
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:03,870
Geezer Gu,

264
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,670
I'll always stand by you.

265
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:06,430
Don't worry.

266
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,590
I will always support you.

267
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,990
Even my sister can't change that.

268
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,630
Listen to your sister.

269
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:14,540
Go pack your things.

270
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:19,220
You're giving up already?

271
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:20,910
Traitor.

272
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:27,900
(Life has been so hard for you.
Don't you want revenge? X)

273
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:34,630
Someone was here.

274
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,460
He left a letter,

275
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,750
the same kind of threat as yours.

276
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,290
(Life has been so hard for you.
Don't you want revenge? X)

277
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,650
But I don't seem to be his target.

278
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,780
Are you okay?

279
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,500
He already left

280
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,260
when I got home.

281
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:55,940
Harassing calls,

282
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,110
threatening letters,

283
00:17:58,730 --> 00:17:59,670
and breaking into here.

284
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,740
That's enough for criminal case-filing.

285
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,460
Notify the team right now

286
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,670
to trace the phone calls.

287
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:06,670
It's already been filed.

288
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,780
We traced the number

289
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,150
as soon as we filed a report.

290
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,740
But we found no useful leads so far.

291
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:18,910
Have you considered

292
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,400
that Yin Qing fell
in front of Jiang Xiaotang

293
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:24,780
might not be a coincidence?

294
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,670
(Yin Qing)
Get out of the way!

295
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:37,400
Put the knife down!

296
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,260
Put your gun down!

297
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,430
Or I'll kill her!

298
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,350
That guy was probably after me.

299
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,350
I got home late

300
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,630
because someone was following Xiaotang.

301
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,020
But he didn't do anything.

302
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,220
No legal basis for an arrest.

303
00:18:58,630 --> 00:18:59,940
But I already told Xiaotang

304
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,590
to move back into her dorm.

305
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:04,870
Why don't you...

306
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,460
I'm a police.

307
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,740
The fact that he broke in

308
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,540
means I can't back down.

309
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,150
Yin Qing

310
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,870
was thrown in front of Xiaotang.

311
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,220
The stalker

312
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,540
could very well be the one

313
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,870
who killed Yin Qing.

314
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,540
But who is this person?

315
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:43,460
Captain Gu,

316
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,690
are you worried about Xiaotang?

317
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,300
Should we apply

318
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:54,740
for 24-hour protection for her?

319
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,020
Normally,

320
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:03,500
police protection is only granted

321
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,590
to witnesses or whistleblowers
in major cases

322
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,260
when a security threat is confirmed.

323
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,300
But in Xiaotang's case,

324
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,260
we don't even know
what the suspect wants to do.

325
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,740
So it doesn't meet the criteria.

326
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,150
Besides,

327
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:20,350
I'm a police

328
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,430
and also her brother.

329
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,260
If I can't protect her,

330
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,590
who else can?

331
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,870
I think I know

332
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:26,940
someone who can.

333
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,190
My dad just retired.

334
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,590
Thirty years as a detective.

335
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:34,540
Let him keep an eye on Xiaotang

336
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,070
and make sure she's safe.

337
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,150
Wait a minute. This...

338
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,700
That doesn't sound right.

339
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,350
Just let him do it.

340
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,430
He's bored out of his mind.

341
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:45,020
He would either quarrel with my mom

342
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,330
or force me to go on blind dates.

343
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:47,780
Keeping him occupied

344
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,630
is considered saving
my mom and me from misery.

345
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:52,020
Then please thank him for me.

346
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:53,940
Also,

347
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,980
we don't know who the suspect is yet.

348
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,090
We have to protect her in secret

349
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,830
to avoid alerting them.

350
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,390
Then it's settled.

351
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:32,740
Don't move.

352
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,980
You hurt your leg.

353
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,220
I'll get what you need for you.

354
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:36,350
That color.

355
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:37,630
This one?

356
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,630
I can't believe you.

357
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,590
You injured your leg

358
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:55,870
just to get me a cup of milk tea.

359
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,700
Be more careful next time, okay?

360
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:01,110
As long as you forgive me,

361
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,650
I don't care how many times I get hurt.

362
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:03,500
Take those words back.

363
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,500
Stop saying nonsense.

364
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:06,700
How's the painting going?

365
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,190
Want some fruit?

366
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:09,940
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

367
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,910
I'll eat after I finish.

368
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:12,630
Okay.

369
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,980
Your sketching basics are solid.

370
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,630
But you need
to work on the color combination.

371
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,830
The overall saturation is too high.

372
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,220
If you tone it down a bit,

373
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,740
your work will be more refined.

374
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:38,220
But I like painting this way.

375
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,260
If I have to change my style

376
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,670
just for an exam,

377
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,430
I'd rather not paint at all.

378
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,460
Sometimes you have to make sacrifices

379
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,780
to achieve your goals.

380
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:50,300
Mr. Wang,

381
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,070
that sounds way too deep.

382
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,940
I only want to paint the way I like,

383
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,540
naturally and freely.

384
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:58,350
That makes me happy.

385
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,350
You're not obedient like Tongtong.

386
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:05,190
What did you say?

387
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:09,460
Oh, nothing.

388
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:12,740
You just remind me of a student

389
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:14,110
I had before.

390
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:17,220
Talented and hardworking.

391
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:19,940
But...

392
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,260
But what?

393
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,690
Excuse me, I need to take this call.

394
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,740
Geezer Gu, I'm painting right now.

395
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:35,590
What?

396
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:37,590
You sent someone to follow me?

397
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:41,590
Fine, fine,

398
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,460
whatever.

399
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:45,260
I've been feeling like
someone's following me lately

400
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,470
and it's a little terrifying.

401
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:49,110
Okay, bye.

402
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,430
How about we call it a day?

403
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:57,150
Mr. Wang, I'm a bit tired.

404
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:57,700
I'll go first.

405
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,190
Okay.

406
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,150
You go ahead.

407
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,390
I'm leaving.

408
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:04,940
Bye.

409
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,460
Mr. Wang.

410
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,350
I did it.
