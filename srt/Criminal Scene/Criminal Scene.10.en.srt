(Hu Yang. Debt Case. On the run)
So many lives were lost

5
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,190
because of unpaid debts.

6
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,140
What we can confirm so far

7
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,110
is that Mr. Xue

8
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,090
She is the mastermind
of the hawala operation..

9
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,750
I've informed the Financial Crime Unit.

10
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,950
They'll coordinate with us
on the joint investigation.

11
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:08,220
Hello?

12
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,780
(Fate has been unfair to you.)

13
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,190
(But I can help.)

14
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,500
Where are you? I'll come and find you.

15
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,030
There's nothing to discuss.

16
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,100
I know you lost so much,

17
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,380
many years ago.

18
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:20,870
But someone

19
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:22,710
gained so many things.

20
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:25,430
I don't get what you mean.

21
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,310
Yes, you do.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,290
The call duration was too short.

25
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:45,870
this month's revenue

26
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,060
went up by six percent.

27
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,550
Compared to last month,
we've finally turned a profit.

28
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,500
My brother-in-law always says
I can't make money,

29
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,820
and my companies all went bust.

30
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:53,780
How is that my fault?

31
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,590
It's those darn cops
always coming after me,

32
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,290
doing all they can
to stop me getting rich.

33
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,550
Otherwise, I'd already
be a billionaire by now.

How may I be of any service to you?

38
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,750
Sure, no problem.

39

Visit our office
if it's convenient for you.

40
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,990
Our boss is also here.

41
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,590
You can call him Mr. Xue.

42
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,710
Okay, we'll be expecting you.

43
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,990

in a surveillance blind spot.

48
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,380
But a nearby camera

49
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,780
captured the driver.

50
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:34,660
Unfortunately,

51
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:35,950
the license plate was fake.

52
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,990
I want to review

Feng Chao's connections

54
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,590
to check for conflicts.

55
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,060
Also recheck all individuals

56
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,470
who were involved
in the Feng Chao case.

57
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:57,660
Miss,

58
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,660
no collateral needed
for loans under 100,000 yuan.

59
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,030
But you'll need one for 500,000 yuan.

60
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:06,710
Miss,

61
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,820
we really need the money.

62
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,470
But

63
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,350
we have nothing to use as collateral.

64
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,260
How about
a higher interest rate instead?

65
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,750
Our goal is to meet

66
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,140
every customer's needs.

67
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,820

to take some artistic photos,

71
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,060
the loan is yours.

72
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:27,750
What...

73
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,580

74
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:32,820

00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,550
please take care of my sister.

194
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,220
Don't worry.

195
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,100
Move it, quick.

196
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,460
Bring another stretcher!

197
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,150
Make way!

198
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,580
Captain Gu.

199
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,430
How's your arm.

200
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,190
It's fine.

201
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,580
Help them.

202
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,030
Okay.

203
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,270
Head that way!

204
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,390
Help them out!

205
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:18,910
Go over there.

206
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,650
You were walking in this direction?

207
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,220
Yes.

208
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,670
Can you tell us in detail

209
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,820
what you saw?

210
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:55,910
I saw nothing.

211
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,220
I only heard a loud sound.

212
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:08,940
Gu Zhen,

213
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:12,460
the provincial and city leaders
are taking this very seriously.

214
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,940
They want you
to finish the site investigation fast.

215
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,430
Yes, sir!

216
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,030
Okay, thanks.

217
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:17,460
Qin.

218
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,150
Captain Gu.

219
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:19,790
Any update?

220
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,090
The Transport Department checked.

221
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,790
The minibus was privately owned.

222
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,220
It was equipped

223
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,270
with an old model dashcam

224
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,820
that doesn't support live transmission.

225
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,510
So there's no footage of the explosion.

226
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,740
Can we still recover the dashcam?

227
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,400
Still searching.

228
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,430
We need to find out

229
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,460
if this explosion was an accident
or intentional.

230
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,180

(Third Grade, Volume 2)

232
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,790
Were you at the scene

233
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,910
when the explosion happened?

234
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,190
- Yes.
- Yes.

235
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,150
Do you know what exactly happened?

236
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,100
I don't know.

237
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:46,980
- Nope.
- Not really.

238
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,220
Did you see anyone suspicious?

239
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:49,940
No.

240
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,150
I don't know.

241
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,060
Oh, Heavenly Father.

242
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,580
Oh, Earth Mother.

243
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,220
Let my son

244
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,910
come home.

245
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,910
You're the reason my son died.

246
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:08,270
You'll die a miserable death.

247
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:09,980
You'll receive retribution.

248
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,510
I'll report you to the King of Hell.

(People's Public Security)

250
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,100
(At approximately 8:30
this morning,)

251
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,190
(a minibus exploded)

252
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,940
(while traveling across Huaihe Bridge,)

253
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,390
(resulting in three fatalities
and multiple injuries.)

254
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,860
(The area surrounding Huaihe Bridge
has been sealed off,)

255
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,910
(and authorities have yet to determine
whether the incident was caused)

256
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,860
(by human factors or an accident.)

257
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:51,220
(Provincial and municipal leaders)

258
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,790
(have expressed great concern
over it)

259
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,540
(and are on - site
to oversee the response.)

260
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,090
(Provincial Public Security Department,
Director Liu Yu stated)

261
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,460
(that people's safety and interests
are top priority.)

262
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,190
(He assured the law enforcement
would do everything)

263
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,700
(to uncover the truth)

264
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,940
(and provide a full account)

265
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,550
(to the citizens as soon as possible.)

266
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:06,980
All right.

267
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,550
(It's said...)

268
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,190
Since you've been to the scene,

269
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,510
you should know the situation.

270
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:14,060
Let's hear from an expert, Officer Zhu,

271
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,920
from the Provincial
Public Security Department.

272
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,430
Everyone.

273
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,100
Based on the initial examination,

274
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,630
most of the explosive residue

275
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,220
was washed away

276
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,450
during the firefighting effort.

277
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,700
The explosion itself have destroyed

278
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,700
the original material.

279
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,550
We can only accurately collect,

280
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,580
process,

281
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,150
and analyze key samples

282
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,510
if we fully understand

283
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,510
the characteristics,
distribution patterns,

284
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,340
collection methods,

285
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,670
and analysis techniques

286
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,820
of explosive evidence.

287
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,610
I was at the scene when it happened.

288
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:47,790
There was an intense fireball
inside the bus

289
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:48,550
burning fiercely.

290
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,190
But it produced very little smoke.

291
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,340
If the explosion had been caused

292
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,800
by ammonium nitrate-based explosives,

293
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,190
we'd have seen a large amount

294
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,060
of reddish-brown or white smoke.

295
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,940
However,
in the case of a gasoline explosion,

296
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:03,310
fireballs and flash burns are common.

297
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,940
But smoke production is minimal.

298
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,270
So

299
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,580
the blast was likely caused by gasoline.

300
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,700
Given this lead,

301
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,910
we'll immediately deploy teams to start

302
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:14,940
a citywide investigation.

303
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,730
What's the status of the survivors?

304
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,820
Affected bystanders
only suffered minor injuries.

305
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,870
But none of them knew
what happened inside the bus.

306
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,150
There were 11 passengers onboard.

307
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,340
Three were killed,

308
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,390
and the remaining survivors
suffered severe burns

309
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,390
and are unconscious.

310
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,510
They're undergoing emergency treatment

311
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,190
and can't be questioned for now.

312
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:33,820
Have we identified all the passengers?

313
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,550
They're employees and their families
from a chemical plant on an outing.

314
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,060
We're still verifying their identities.

315
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,580
However, the three deceased victims

316
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,860
suffered extensive burns

317
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,740
and severe damage,

318
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,030
which will take time to process.

319
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:46,510
The forensic team is working overtime

320
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,580
to confirm their identities.

321
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,460
Be quick.

322
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,220
This incident

323
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,820
has caused widespread panic
among the public.

324
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,940
The Provincial Public
Security Department issued

325
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,100
an immediate directive

326
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,670
to establish the 4.25 Task Force,

327
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,950
with me as the lead investigator.

328
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:01,590
Provincial and municipal authorities
are prioritizing this case.

329
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,830
They hope we solve it quickly.

330
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:03,670
Do you understand?

331
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,830
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

332
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,940
Let's start by analyzing

333
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:07,780
the evidence we have.

334
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,980
I'll brief everyone

335
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,630
on the specific action plan shortly.

336
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,020
You can move out now.

337
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:12,590
Yes, sir.

338
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,060
(Police)

339
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,500
(Case 4.25,
Seized Vehicle Storage)

340
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,740
(Forensic Investigation)

341
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,390
Qian,

342
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,540
have you handled
case like this before?

343
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:52,740
Cases like this are very rare.

344
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,110
I thought you were calm

345
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,110
because you've handled
such cases before.

346
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,150
I will never get used to this.

347
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,460
But I must remain calm

348
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,460
because I want to tell them

349
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,110
why their lives ended this way

350
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,190
and who caused it.

351
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,110
I need to remind the living

352
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,870
that someone still cares about them.

353
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,430
Someone has to trace the source

354
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,350
of the resentment
and injustice they carry.

355
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:21,500
A forensic pathologist's job

356
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,150
is to uncover the truth for the deceased

357
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:26,070
and give the living the answers.

358
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,420
(Gender: Male. Year of Birth:1987)

359
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,830
These are injured bystanders.

360
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:44,840
Their injuries are minor

361
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,300
so they can be questioned.

362
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,070
But the eight survivors from the bus

363
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,110
are still unconscious.

364
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,590
They also have severe burns.

365
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,180
Skin is prone to infection.

366
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,730
So they cannot be exposed to outsiders.

367
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:56,020
I understand.

368
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,870
Go ahead with the questioning.

369
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:59,110
Record it.

370
00:17:59,350 --> 00:17:59,700
Yes, sir.

371
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,310
Get started.

372
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,220
Please get a doctor for me.

373
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:08,430
Stay still.

374
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:08,870
Miss,

375
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:12,350
I want to know which room

376
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,220
Jiang Xiaotang is in.

377
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:14,500
I'm her brother.

378
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,350
Please wait.

379
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,260
I'll check it for you.

380
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,020
Okay.

381
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,500
Darn it!

382
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,220
Which scum did this?

383
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,300
Is he out of his mind?

384
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,740
How dare he blow up my parents?

385
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,350
If I find out who it was,

386
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,830
I'll wipe out his whole darn family!

387
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,150
What standing still?

388
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,870
Go and save my parents!

389
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,190
Daddy...

390
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,260
Daddy, is that you?

391
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,980
Daddy. Daddy.

392
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,260
Daddy, I miss you.

393
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,020
Daddy...

394
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,940
Daddy, I miss you.

395
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,190
Xiaotang.

396
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,430
Zhen.

397
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,070
Are you okay?

398
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:01,390
I'm okay.

399
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:02,270
How are you feeling?

400
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:03,870
Not bad.

401
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,350
She has a concussion.

402
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:08,110
She might experience
moments of confusion.

403
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,500
She needs two-day observation.

404
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,150
It shouldn't be anything serious.

405
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:11,830
Don't worry.

406
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:13,870
Thank you, nurse.

407
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:15,670
Xiaotang,

408
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:16,980
you heard it.

409
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:18,940
Just get proper rest these days

410
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:19,940
and listen to the doctor.

411
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,220
Don't worry, Zhen.

412
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,110
I'm okay.

413
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:22,700
Okay.

414
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,340
(Disposal Room)

415
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,350
Your wound was already infected.

416
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,300
Be careful and make sure to keep it dry.

417
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,700
It's not that serious, right?

418
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,780
If an infected wound is untreated,

419
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,110
it could turn into sepsis,

420
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,260
and that can be fatal.

421
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:43,500
Compared to those
who have lost their lives,

422
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,670
what's a little injury like this?

423
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,910
Then take good care
of yourself even more

424
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,350
so you can protect even more people.

425
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,150
All done.

426
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:55,740
All done?

427
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:56,780
Thanks.

428
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:15,350
Here.

429
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,540
It's sweet.

430
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,390
If you listen to the doctor
and rest well,

431
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,150
you'll recover in no time.

432
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,300
Fruit will speed up your recovery.

433
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,260
Dig in.

434
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:47,500
Here.

435
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,590
Chief Shen.

436
00:21:59,260 --> 00:21:59,700
All right.

437
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,740
I'll be right there.

438
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,460
Xiaotang,

439
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,390
something came up at work.
I have to go now.

440
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:08,460
Zhen,

441
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:12,110
can you keep this from my sister?

442
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,590
She's overseas
and can't come home anyway.

443
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:16,870
I don't want her to worry.

444
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:18,830
Don't worry.

445
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:44,830
Hello?

446
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,430
Hello.

447
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,460
I've been trying to call you.

448
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,720
Are you and my nephew all right?

449
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,070
We're all right.

450
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,540
It's been hectic at the hospital.

451
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,110
So I didn't have time to check my phone.

452
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:55,220
I'm glad to hear that.

453
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,300
I... I saw him.

454
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,020
It's in the past.

455
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,780
I know it's not his fault.

456
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,220
But I just can't hold it in.

457
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,430
Mr. Wang?

458
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:29,830
Anna?

459
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,780
What are you doing here?

460
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,590
My friend got hurt.

461
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:37,430
I came to visit him.

462
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:38,910
What a coincidence.

463
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:39,980
Xiaotang got hurt too.

464
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:43,020
I think I saw them earlier.

465
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:43,840
The room is crowded.

466
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,220
Then I'll send this fruit over.

467
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:46,910
Wait for me.

468
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:48,110
Anna,

469
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,400
people tend to remember those
who help in times of need.

470
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,360
They won't remember your kindness

471
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:54,630
when things are going well.

472
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:05,670
I get it now.

473
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,220
Hello?

474
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:11,550
Brother-in-law,

475
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,390
the new place was raided
by the cops again,

476
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:14,800
and some investors want to pull out.

477
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:15,880
What do I do now?

478
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:18,870
Got it.

479
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:20,630
Mr. Wang,

480
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:21,670
the lift is here.

481
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:32,740
Why is there a woman with him?

482
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,150
Have you prepared my money?

483
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:46,980
Come on, man.

484
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:49,670
I came to see you to discuss

485
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:51,110
if you could give me a few more days.

486
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,190
It's hard to get money back

487
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,110
after lending it out.

488
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:53,980
I don't care.

489
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,830
If you don't pay back

490
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:57,630
the money within a week.

491
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,180
You'll suffer the consequences.

492
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,020
It isn't enough. Give me more time.

493
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:02,980
Come on, man.

494
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:06,910
Darn it.

495
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,260
Yes?

496
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:15,870
Get out of the car!

497
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:16,300
What...

498
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,430
What did you just say?

499
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:18,300
What did you say, huh?

500
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,110
Darn it, huh?

501
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:20,460
Kid,

502
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,460
learn some lessons.

503
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,390
I want you

504
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:27,630
to pay me back my money
with interest within a week.

505
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,110
If you don't,

506
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,300
you will suffer.

507
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,110
Darn it.

508
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:46,500
More ruthless than me.

509
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,220
Since the victims' facial features
are unrecognizable,

510
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,980
we need to collect DNA samples

511
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,460
and document physical characteristics

512
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,460
to speed up
the victims' identifications.

513
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:01,670
We have already documented
the positions of the bodies

514
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:02,780
inside the vehicle.

515
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,540
Make sure
to preserve dental impressions,

516
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,910
record blood types,
and collect blood samples.

517
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:09,220
Our goal is to return the remains
to the families

518
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,670
in the most intact condition.

519
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:11,220
Yes, ma'am.

520
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:19,070
This body has sustained
the most severe damage.

521
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:22,070
The body is likely
at the center of the explosion.

522
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,670
Let's designate it as Victim 01,

523
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:28,500
and number the others accordingly.

524
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:30,780
Let's begin.

525
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:31,350
Yes, madam.

526
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,860
(Name: 01)

527
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:43,190
(This morning, the police confirmed)

528
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,870
(that the April 25th minibus explosion)

529
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:47,630
(has resulted in three fatalities
and eight critically injured.)

530
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:49,500
(Additionally, thirteen bystanders sustained)

531
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,190
(minor injuries
of varying degrees.)

532
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:52,830
(All injured ones have been admitted)

533
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,740

(will follow up on further developments.)

536
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:58,870
Hello?

537
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,110
(Officer Kong,)

538
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,980
(it must be hard at work.)

539
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,460
Who are you?

540
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,740
I only want to help you.

541
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:10,590
Do I know you?

542
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:12,500
You don't know me.

543
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,220
But I know you very well.

544
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,910
It's troublesome to keep changing
your numbers.

545
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:21,870
Why don't you just tell me

546
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,700
what you really want?

547
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:26,350
I just told you that.

548
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,980
I want to help you.

549
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,500
You? Help me with what?

550
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,980
(Relieve your pain.)

551
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,110
Why?

552
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,740
Why are you standing here alive?

553
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,870
Tell me why!

554
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,620
