=Episode 5=

3
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,030
Just a moment.

4
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:39,750
Okay.

5
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:06,710
(He ordered at least three suits)

6
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,190
(from me every year.)

7
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,620
(But never spent his own money.)

8
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:20,470
To be honest,

9
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:23,340
I didn't have a good impression
of Liu Ang.

10
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:24,470
No,

11
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,190
a really bad one.

12
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:27,710
Really bad?

13
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,470
Did he do something?

14
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,060
I got two kinds of customers.

15
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,660
Some walk in on their own.

16
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,060
Others

17
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,870
tagged along with someone else.

18
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,780
The moment they step in,

19
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,470
I can tell which type they are

20
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:42,870
by the way they carry themselves.

21
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,590
Liu Ang? He was definitely the latter.

22
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,780
Take a look at this girl.

23
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:49,710
Did she bring him here

24
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,820
to buy clothes?

25
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,990
She was wearing a mask

26
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,550
that covers her face.

27
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,190
But

28
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,470
I do remember one thing though.

29
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,220
She spent all her living expenses on him

30
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,430
and even begged me for a discount.

31
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:16,940
Hello?

32
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,870
The DNA test results are in.

33
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,440
The one Liu Ang scratched
wasn't Jiang Xiaotang.

34
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,990
We checked the footage.

35
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,060
After leaving the bar,

36
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,260
Jiang Xiaotang never went back.

37
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,750
Cameras caught her
near the river, a restroom,

38
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,870
and then heading straight to school,

39
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,150
wearing a red dress.

40
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,590
Her whereabouts confirm

41
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,500
she didn't have enough time

42
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,590
to go back to kill him.

43
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,750
She's basically cleared.

44
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,680
She can leave
once the paperwork is done.

45
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,340
Thanks, man.

46
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:51,710
Thank you.

47
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:52,500
No problem.

48
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:53,870
But

49
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,500
there's one more thing

50
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,990
we need her to confirm.

51
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,860
(Waiting Room)

52
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,500
Geezer Gu.

53
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,380
Sit down!

54
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,150
Look at you.

55
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,350
You were obsessed

56
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:12,580
with that celebrity before.

57
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,230
Then you stop being a fangirl.

58
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,910
But your dating led to a murder!

59
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,550
Can you not cause trouble for one day?

60
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,140
Geezer Gu,

61
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,140
I want to go home.

62
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,620
I didn't kill anyone.

63
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,380
Still arguing?

64
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,140
Go home?

65
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:27,790
You spent

66
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,620
all your living expenses...

67
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:30,910
Collected thousands of yuan

68
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,110
to buy clothes for that scum.

69
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,350
Do you have any self-respect?

70
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,430
What...

71
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,550
What clothes?

72
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,700
Still lying?

73
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,190
I'm not lying.

74
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,230
You and him...

75
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,110
How far did both of you go?

76
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,460
We only dated for two weeks!

77
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,910
How far could it have gone?

78
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:48,750
Two weeks?

79
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,500
For a guy you barely knew,

80
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,430
you went out there screaming
that you'd kill him?

81
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:55,460
Fine.

82
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,580
You don't believe me?

83
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,670
I did it! I killed him!

84
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,620
Arrest me and kill me!

85
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,430
Shut up!

86
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:05,820
Do you know where you are?

87
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,700
Stop talking nonsense!

88
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,910
Geezer Gu,

89
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,430
I just want to go home.

90
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,060
Please, take me home.

91
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,820
I'm sorry.

92
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,460
I'm really sorry.

93
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:35,790
Take it.

94
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,990
I just want to go home.

95
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,620
Next time, be smarter.

96
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,870
When you date someone,

97
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,310
open your eyes widely.

98
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,650
Not everyone is worth your trust.

99
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,620
Geezer Gu...

100
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,620
What are you waiting for?

101
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:54,820
Go home!

102
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,260
(XC: Brother-in-law, sorry.
Station 3 is gone too.)

103
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,430
What now?

104
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,310
What can we do?

105
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,230
What if Xiaotang gets accused of murder?

106
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,620
Why?

107
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,500
Why?

108
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,910
Everything was fine that day.

109
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,580
Her brother-in-law is a cop.

110
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,940
Why are you worried?

111
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,060
She will be fine.

112
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:26,820
Yes.

113
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,020
You're right.

114
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,020
Xiaotang will be fine.

115
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,550
How did you know
her brother-in-law is a police?

116
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,020
You told me.

117
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,110
Don't you remember?

118
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,190
Did I?

119
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,150
I guess I forgot.

120
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:32,940
Oh, that's right.

121
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,630
He's the Captain
of the Criminal Investigation Unit.

122
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,510
How could anything happen to her?

123
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,190
See?

124
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,820
Someone else
would have a different fate.

125
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,340
Really?

126
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:50,790
Na,

127
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,820
life is never fair.

128
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,150
Fate only punishes the weak.

129
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,060
If you want to fight fate,

130
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,820
you have to become stronger.

131
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,390
Don't you think so?

132
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:05,860
Yes.

133
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:10,980
I didn't kill anyone.

134
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:11,630
Officer,

135
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,580
I've always been a good kid.

136
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,030
I swear I didn't kill anyone.

137
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:16,980
Officer,

138
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,630
I didn't kill anyone.

139
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,630
Calm down.

140
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,100
Just tell us what happened.

141
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:22,790
I'll tell you.

142
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,700
But where should I start?

143
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,820
From the moment
you first saw the victim.

144
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,860
My name is Bai Chang.

145
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,980
My friends call me "Pale Reaper."

146
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,550
I hosted a party last night

147
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,790
and lots of people came.

148
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,270
I heard she is a nurse
from the infectious disease hospital,

149
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,310
named Xin.

150
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,820
I don't even know

151
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,860
who invited her.

152
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,580
Before I could even talk to her,

153
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,430
she slipped away.

154
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,860
Maybe she thought she wasn't

155
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:29,910
good enough for me.

156
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,220
I drank too much

157
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,260
and was looking for a taxi.

158
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,150
But I ended up passing out outside.

159
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,940
No, no more.

160
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,060
I can't drink anymore.

161
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:18,860
Miss.

162
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:20,510
Miss.

163
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,510
Wake up, miss.

164
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,740
Pale Reaper killed someone!

165
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:25,940
Pale Reaper...

166
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,910
Pale Reaper has killed someone!

167
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,940
Pale Reaper has killed someone!

168
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,390
Then write down the names
and contact details

169
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,550
of those at the party.

170
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,460
We can check with them

171
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,430
to confirm her identity.

172
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,510
Sure, no problem.

173
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:47,100
Two murders in one night.

174
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,630
Come in.

175
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,630
Qian, what do we have?

176
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,430
The man I dealt with today

177
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,270
was wearing a suit worth fifty thousand.

178
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,790
This woman's no different.

179
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,910
Her shoes alone cost
a few thousand yuan.

180
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,220
Now that's Cinderella's glass slippers.

181
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,630
Except that instead of finding a prince,

182
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,820
she found death.

183
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,190
Who knows which ghost she ran into

184
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,390
on Ghost Festival.

185
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,940
There are no ghosts in this world.

186
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,820
Only humans are scarier than ghosts.

187
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,030
The same store.

188
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,510
It seems like
every wealthy person around here

189
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,910
is their customer.

190
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,420
(K. Tailoring Studio)

191
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,860
Wow, this is expensive.

192
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,190
There will always be

193
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,790
something better

194
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,740
than what you thought was the best.

195
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,860
Once you get hooked,

196
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,940
you'll never find your way out.

197
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,510
Confucius was right.

198
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:15,630
Can you repeat that?

199
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,030
I already told you everything

200
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,940
I know about Liu Ang.

201
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,310
We're here to confirm

202
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,580
something about a dress.

203
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,430
A dress?

204
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,100
(Evidence)
Was this dress made at your store?

205
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,430
Wait...

206
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,310
Did something happen
to the owner of this dress too?

207
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:40,860
Ye,

208
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,300
bring me the client records.

209
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,790
Here are our customers' info.

210
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,030
Her name is Tang Xinxin.

211
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,670
Here are her phone number and address.

212
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,670
Tang Xinxin?

213
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,220
From the infectious disease hospital?

214
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,790
Did she shop here often?

215
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,310
A regular nurse wouldn't be able
to afford it.

216
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,510
But her fiancé, Xu Dongyang,

217
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,340
definitely could.

218
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,740
Xu Dongyang?

219
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,670
The founder of the

220
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,940
"She, He, and It" mini-program?

221
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,340
I thought he went bankrupt.

222
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,390
Early last year,

223
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,820
when Xu Dongyang

224
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,150
was at the peak of his success,

225
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,860
he brought Tang Xinxin to the store.

226
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,730
(K. Tailoring Studio)

227
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,820
Mr. Xu,

228
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,860
I heard your company
is about to go public.

229
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:38,600
Congratulations.

230
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,100
Yes, that's right.

231
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,860
That's my girlfriend.

232
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,030
When that happens,

233
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,580
help me design a custom gown for her.

234
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,030
When my company goes public,

235
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,700
I want to take her to the stock exchange

236
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,670
and ring the bell.

237
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,390
No problem.

238
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:54,700
Dongyang,

239
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,340
I love this long dress.

240
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,220
But this short one is gorgeous too.

241
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,630
If you like them both,

242
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,740
we'll buy them both.

243
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,860
You're so generous to your girlfriend.

244
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:05,580
She'll

245
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:06,980
be my wife soon.

246
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,220
Who said I'd marry a shorty like you?

247
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,100
Oh? You dare say no to me?

248
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,030
What kind

249
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,550
of customers

250
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,700
were they?

251
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,100
She had her eye

252
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,740
(Evidence Seal Bag)
on this style.

253
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,150
But he preferred

254
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:24,630
that style.

255
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,390
But in the end,

256
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,310
she made the decision

257
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,220
to buy the first one.

258
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,060
How was their relationship?

259
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,940
It's hard to say if Tang Xinxin

260
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:36,920
really loved Xu Dongyang.

261
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,740
But Xu Dongyang probably meant it
when he said

262
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:40,940
he wanted to marry her.

263
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,740
Xiaotang's in the clear now.

264
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,670
Too bad

265
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,310
she'll never see her boyfriend Liu Ang.

266
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,580
I had a university coursemate
named Liu Ang too.

267
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,180
He was good at sweet-talking women.

268
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,190
I think

269
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:23,060
one girl even took her own life
because of him.

270
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:32,510
Why crying?

271
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:36,860
I'm not.

272
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,670
I need to use the restroom.

273
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,260
What do you think
about my mask collection?

274
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,190
You collect these?

275
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,780
Everyone has their secrets.

276
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:36,700
For example,

277
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,300
you're upset

278
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,350
not just because of Jiang Xiaotang,
right?

279
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:43,870
No.

280
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:47,190
I wasn't.

281
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:53,300
When Jiang Xiaotang went out
with her boyfriend,

282
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,290
you went to the bar and got drunk.

283
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,630
Now that her boyfriend is dead,

284
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,350
you're crying even harder than she is.

285
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:03,260
Are you also keeping a secret

286
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,590
that no one knows?

287
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,190
Stop.

288
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:09,870
Please, just stop.

289
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,870
I beg you, stop!

290
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:27,180
(Huaizhou Public Security Bureau.
Criminal Investigation Division)

291
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,660
(Branch Commander's Office)

292
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,390
(Oh...)

293
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:31,500
(You've been working)

294
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,110
(with another woman, huh?)

295
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,670
(You, shameless piece of trash!)

296
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:36,150
(Enough!)

297
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,220
(You think I won't hit you?)

298
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:39,350
(Fine!)

299
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,430
(Let's see who takes who down first!)

300
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:43,190
(Stop it!)

301
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,540
(What are you doing?)

302
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,110
(Back off!)

303
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:31,300
Captain Gu.

304
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,700
I've rewatched the footage many times.

305
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,460
Nothing discovered.

306
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:45,700
The camera caught this corner,

307
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,430
where Liu Ang's booth was.

308
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,980
It's right next to the dance floor

309
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,430
and the hallway to the restroom.

310
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,500
People were walking back
and forth all night,

311
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,830
and blocking Liu Ang from the view.

312
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,140
The camera barely caught anything.

313
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,390
Su Qian estimated

314
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:02,020
that Liu Ang was killed around 3 AM.

315
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,780
But why wasn't his body discovered
until 5 AM?

316
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,590
The bar usually closes

317
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:07,390
around 3 AM.

318
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,430
But the staff said

319
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:09,630
some tables were still partying

320
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,260
past 4 AM.

321
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,020
The cleaning lady found the body

322
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,390
when she turned on the main lights.

323
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,300
So, what was the motive?

324
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:19,780
I think

325
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,220
it's most likely a crime of passion.

326
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,260
Listen.

327
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,630
Who'd want him dead?

328
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:27,540
Obviously, the women he used and dumped.

329
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:30,940
We're here

330
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,630
to ask about Liu Ang.

331
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:37,350
He was just a self-proclaimed artist
when he was a total player.

332
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,390
Living off women.

333
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,350
You knew that.

334
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,540
But why did you date him?

335
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:45,150
I was never into him.

336
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:47,110
We just had fun together, that's all.

337
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,830
He did try to pursue me.

338
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:50,870
But

339
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,540
he had unusual fetishes.

340
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:53,910
So I rejected him.

341
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,700
After that,

342
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,020
he kept sending me gifts
in my livestreams.

343
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,500
No reason for me to refuse, right?

344
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,630
Besides,

345
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,020
he was decent-looking.

346
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,780
I cam bring him out in public.

347
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,300
So, why not?

348
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,630
You're straightforward

349
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,300
about it.

350
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,740
What do you mean about him

351
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,670
living off women?

352
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:15,670
It's exactly what it sounds like.

353
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,190
I thought he was some rich kid at first.

354
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:20,700
But it turns out,

355
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,190
all his money came from his girlfriends.

356
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,500
I even teased him

357
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,150
about being a bootlicker.

358
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,150
Matteo.

359
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,540
Liu Ang.

360
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,350
He got mad.

361
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:36,070
He said they were the ones
who gave the money to him.

362
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:37,980
He even bragged

363
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,670
that some even skipped meals
to buy him clothes.

364
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,260
Okay.

365
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,500
Tell us where you were last night.

366
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,280
What you were doing?

367
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,700
I went to the bar with Liu Ang.

368
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,500
I didn't stay with him for long.

369
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,870
Not long after we got there,

370
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,500
I met an even hotter guy

371
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,430
and left with him.

372
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,190
We spent the whole night
in a karaoke room.

373
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,630
Check the security footage.

374
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,460
What did Liu Ang commit?

375
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,020
I swear I don't know anything.

376
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:17,430
I was never involved in whatever he did.

377
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,700
We were just messing around.

378
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,110
We're not accusing you.

379
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,460
We just want some information.

380
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,390
You mentioned
he had some fetishes earlier.

381
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:27,260
What is it?

382
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,670
He liked filming his girlfriends

383
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:31,630
during private moments.

384
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,590
I mean

385
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:36,150
couples playing around is one thing.

386
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,110
But I'm not that open-minded.

387
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,460
From what I heard,

388
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,590
one of his ex-girlfriend's

389
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:42,700
private videos

390
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,260
were somehow leaked

391
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,350
for unknown reasons.

392
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,020
Her reputation was ruined.

393
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,300
In situations like this,

394
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,830
it's always the woman who suffers.

395
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,300
Do you remember her name?

396
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,630
No.

397
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,390
But I know

398
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:57,540
she's dead.

399
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,260
They say she killed herself.

400
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,350
She seemed carefree
when they were together.

401
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,020
Why did she...

402
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,150
I went off-topic.

403
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,150
What's your connection to Lei Wei?

404
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,700
He's the ex-boyfriend

405
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:15,540
of my ex-boyfriend's ex-girlfriend.

406
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,630
We were together for just one night.

407
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:20,590
I noticed he had violent tendencies.

408
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,540
It scared me to death.

409
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,350
And what's Lei Wei's connection
to Liu Ang?

410
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:27,940
I heard they were always competing
to win over women.

411
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,830
Typical guys

412
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:32,350
always fight over women for fun.

413
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,300
Then losing interest once they win.

414
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:40,630
(We found something.)

415
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:42,350
(A blood-stained knife was found)

416
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,910
(in the bar's drainage system.)
