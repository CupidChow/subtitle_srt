=Episode 3=

3
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,160
(Liu Sifan, criminal suspect)

4
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:46,780
Stay away!

5
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,980
Back off, or I'll jump!

6
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:49,780
Miss,

7
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:50,620
relax.

8
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,900
We're only here to talk, okay?

9
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:54,390
So stay calm.

10
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:55,900
I don't believe you.

11
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,500
You already took Wang Qian in
for questioning.

12
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,190
That means you know everything.

13
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,220
Liking someone isn't wrong.

14
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,380
I didn't expect things
to turn out this way.

15
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:06,270
I...

16
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,430
I just like Zisu too much.

17
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:09,710
Miss,

18
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,820
all of Zisu's fans like him.

19
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:13,710
You need

20
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,150
to tell the truth.

21
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,190
If you do,

22
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:17,310
you can help clear

23
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,380
his name, right?

24
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,750
No, you don't get it!

25
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,430
I love him more than anyone else!

26
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,100
No one can compare!

27
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,500
What have you done for him?

28
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:25,310
I...

29
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,310
I've been obsessed with Zisu

30
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,870
ever since his debut.

31
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,150
I love his music,

32
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,430
his shows,

33
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:39,940
the way he treats his fans,

34
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,620
and everything about him.

35
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,100
Whenever I had the chance,

36
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,900
I tried to get closer to him.

37
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,780
Then you and Lin Xiaojing did

38
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,430
the same thing.

39
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,550
No!

40
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,750
We're nothing alike!

41
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,750
She may have the money
and time to follow his schedule.

42
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,310
But I have brains.

43
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,750
I know ways

44
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,550
to get even closer to him.

45
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,430
I taught Lin Xiaojing

46
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,470
how to sneak into hotel rooms.

47
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,080
She took photos secretly
and shared them with us.

48
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,100
But she crossed the line

49
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,030
when she started stealing Zisu's things!

50
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,220
And everyone praised her for it.

51
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,940
No one gave me credit for making plans!

52
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:20,900
Stay back!

53
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,660
Or I'll jump!

54
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,150
Okay, okay.

55
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,030
We're not coming over.

56
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,190
Miss,

57
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,500
just come down.

58
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,750
Let's sit down and talk, okay?

59
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,780
Before, all our fan activities
were in other cities.

60
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,310
I was too busy with exams to join.

61
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,620
So I let it go.

62
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,820
But this time, Zisu came here to film.

63
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,470
I wanted to do it on my own.

64
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,820
Then Lin Xiaojing reached out
to me first.

65
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,470
She wanted us to work together.

66
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,430
Zisu!

67
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,380
- Zisu, I love you!
- Zisu!

68
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,900
Zisu! Zisu!

69
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,100
Zisu!

70
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:56,990
A box office hit!

71
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,660
(We both hid cameras in toys.)

72
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,940
(But she only gave him hers on purpose!)

73
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,030
(I had arranged everything
with the cleaning lady, Madam Zheng,)

74
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,590
(to get the uniform and room key.)

75
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,030
Thanks.

76
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,820
But Lin Xiaojing got there first

77
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,870
and took everything.

78
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:09,990
You're a bit slow.

79
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,230
Guess I'll go first this time.

80
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,230
Don't be upset.

81
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,110
He's staying here

82
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,550
for a while.

83
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:19,830
Next time, okay?

84
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:20,820
Bye.

85
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,230
(Lin Xiaojing snuck into the room)

86
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,500
(when no one was around.)

87
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,770
(She took photos and posted them
in the fan group.)

88
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,350
(She was even going
to steal his brooch and bracelet.)

89
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:48,580
I...

90
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,350
I told her to give me a brooch
as compensation.

91
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,380
But she said all those things

92
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,940
would be part of her private collection

93
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,310
and wouldn't give me anything!

94
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,620
But I was the one who planned everything

95
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,620
and also the one
who gave her the chance!

96
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,110
I even paid for the hidden camera toy!

97
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,910
But she took everything for herself

98
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,990
and showed off in the group!

99
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:08,820
Fine.

100
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,190
Then I'll do it myself!

101
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,460
(I knew the film crew was coming)

102
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,870
(and Zisu would be staying in a suite.)

103
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,580
(So I asked Wang Qian)

104
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:22,020
(to book the room across from his room,)

105
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,430
(perfect for celebrating
our 36-day anniversary.)

106
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,990
(Wang Qian reserved the room)

107
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,870
(and got the wine ready.)

108
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:29,310
Hello?

109
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:30,820
I got the room.

110
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,190
What?

111
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,620
You can't come?

112
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,110
Seriously? Of all times,

113
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,110
you get your period now?

114
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:41,550
No, no.

115
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,380
I'm not picking a fight.

116
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,790
I'm sorry. Okay?

117
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:45,700
Hello?

118
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,310
(All I cared about was Zisu.)

119
00:04:58,910 --> 00:04:59,870
Hey, Slick Dog.

120
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:01,870
What am I doing?

121
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,460
Nothing much now.

122
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,460
She can't come and I can't get a refund.

123
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:06,700
Wasted a few hundred yuan.

124
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:09,990
A gaming night?

125
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,140
No problem, my man.

126
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,670
I'll be right there.

127
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,020
(I reached out to Slick Dog,
Wang Qian's best friend.)

128
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,060
(I told him I stood Wang Qian up)

129
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,140
(and felt sorry.)

130
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,060
(So I wanted to treat them
to an all-night)

131
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,580
(gaming session.)

132
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,780
(They had to keep it a secret.)

133
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,140
(You know the guys.)

134
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,550
(They love gaming.)

135
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,550
(They thought I was being thoughtful)

136
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,140
(and agreed right away.)

137
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,260
Zisu, take your time, no rush.

138
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:43,490
We've made the reservation.

139
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:44,910
Come this way.

140
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,230
(But then Lin Xiaojing showed up again.)

141
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,990
(Meng Zisu is used
to drinking wine before bed.)

142
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:15,620
(That's why I came up)

143
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,140
(with the idea of spiking his drink.)

144
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,820
(But that wretch beat me to it.)

145
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,430
Be careful.

146
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,630
Slowly.

147
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:32,510
Thank you.

148
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,700
Get some rest.

149
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,550
I'll take care of him.

150
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:35,580
Come.

151
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:38,940
Zisu,

152
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,860
you have an early schedule tomorrow.

153
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,030
Why did you drink so much?

154
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:43,580
If you're late again,

155
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,390
the producer will lose it.

156
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,700
Yeah...

157
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,910
I know.

158
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,100
(All I could think about)

159
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,460
(was killing that female manager)

160
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,940
(when she touched Meng Zisu.)

161
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,190
(Lin Xiaojing would feel the same too!)

162
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:06,790
Cover yourself.

163
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:09,940
Zisu,

164
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,270
don't oversleep, all right?

165
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,670
The director told the producer

166
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,270
he would replace you

167
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,820
if you delayed the shoot again.

168
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,510
I know, I know.

169
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,740
Just go.

170
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,580
I want to sleep.

171
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,270
Zisu.

172
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:10,150
Zisu.

173
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:16,980
Zisu.

174
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,670
I love you more than anyone

175
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,580
in this world.

176
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,390
Zisu.

177
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,510
Tonight,

178
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,670
it's just the two of us.

179
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,550
(Zisu was my idol.)

180
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,190
(And she defiled him.)

181
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,700
(I couldn't stand it!)

182
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,430
(Drinking from Meng Zisu's glass)

183
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,030
(is like an indirect kiss.)

184
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,910
Ugh, disgusting wretch.

185
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:51,910
I...

186
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,910
I only wanted Zisu

187
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,390
to wake up and see her there.

188
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,150
So he would hate her.

189
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,510
Maybe even call the police.

190
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:02,980
Then

191
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,510
she would never

192
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,340
get close to him again.

193
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:08,980
But

194
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,820
I never thought she would die.

195
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,670
I did my research!

196
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,190
It was just a sedative,

197
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,980
not poison!

198
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,910
People react differently

199
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,580
to medication.

200
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:18,740
Unfortunately,

201
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,270
her body had an extreme reaction
to the sedative.

202
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:22,980
So when she lost consciousness,

203
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,150
she vomited,

204
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,150
which blocked her airway,

205
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,080
leading to asphyxiation.

206
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,190
It's all my fault.

207
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,580
If I hadn't left,

208
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,740
she wouldn't have died.

209
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:39,220
Miss.

210
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,100
Stay back!

211
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,190
- Back off!
- Miss.

212
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,060
Miss, calm down.

213
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:42,910
I...

214
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,060
Let's talk, okay?

215
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,580
I betrayed Lin Xiaojing.

216
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,430
I betrayed Zisu.

217
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,910
I ruined his reputation.

218
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,790
I can only atone with my life.

219
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:53,510
Miss! Miss!

220
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,460
Stay still, miss.

221
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,580
Calm down.

222
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:56,940
Meng Zisu's reputation

223
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,430
has nothing to do with you.

224
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:00,150
He was taken in for questioning

225
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,190
over tax evasion.

226
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,120
It's not your fault.

227
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:03,510
Come on down.

228
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,670
I don't believe you.

229
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,350
He married secretly and had a kid.

230
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:14,030
His personal life is a mess,
and he's suspected of a crime.

231
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,670
Is it worth it to die for him?

232
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:19,820
No...

233
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:21,430
He wouldn't.

234
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,060
I really misjudged him.

235
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,190
Don't...

236
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:41,460
Don't let go.

237
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,190
Hold on!

238
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,270
Give me your other hand!

239
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:32,740
Xiaotang.

240
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,030
Geezer Gu.

241
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,510
What happened? Who bullied you?

242
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,910
I'm gravely injured!

243
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,510
Let me see.

244
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:43,910
Wow, what a serious injury.

245
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:49,580
Come on.

246
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,340
Get inside.

247
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:53,670
You need to get

248
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,820
to the hospital now.

249
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,460
If you wait any longer,

250
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,550
you might fully recover.

251
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,030
My idol's reputation is ruined.

252
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:02,100
Instead of comforting me,
you're making fun of me.

253
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,790
That's just heartless.

254
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,190
Rubai,

255
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,310
don't you think so?

256
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:10,460
Honestly,

257
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,060
I'd say it's

258
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,030
good riddance.

259
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,320
With his popularity sinking,

260
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,340
you can finally focus on your studies.

261
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,100
Seriously,

262
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,190
do you know how expensive your fees are?

263
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,190
What a waste!

264
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,060
I'd study in your place

265
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,310
if I could.

266
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,340
I've done some deep thinking

267
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,340
and made a decision to...

268
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,190
Focus on your studies.

269
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,380
This celebrity is better.

270
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,550
I announce
that I'm moving on to a new idol.

271
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,460
Wow, what an ambition.

272
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:41,630
Zhen,

273
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,630
I'm hungry.

274
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,820
Let's go out to eat.

275
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,030
My treat and you can pay.

276
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,910
Help me recover from this heartbreak.

277
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:52,700
Fine.

278
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,150
Let me get changed first.

279
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:55,910
Okay.

280
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,630
Stop kissing.

281
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,740
I said, stop it!

282
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:12,460
What is wrong with you?

283
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,460
You, wretch!

284
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,070
Sorry, my sister is drunk.

285
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:18,740
Come on! Hit me!

286
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,350
That's enough!

287
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,020
Sorry.

288
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:22,630
Let's go.

289
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:23,430
Come.

290
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:24,910
Are you trying

291
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,460
to use other's hands

292
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,460
to punish yourself?

293
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:28,940
I...

294
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:30,980
What's wrong?

295
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:13,180
(Have a glass of milk when you wake up.
Be kind to yourself.)

296
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,540
(That guy has been chasing me for days)

297
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,540
(and already considered himself
my boyfriend.)

298
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,390
(He kept trying to touch me.)

299
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,430
(It's so annoying.)

300
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,940
(He keeps asking me to spend money.)

301
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,910
(I can't believe
he's that kind of person.)

302
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,100
(I'm done being a fangirl.)

303
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:34,980
(You?)

304
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:40,420
(Have a glass of milk when you wake up.
Be kind to yourself.)

305
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,420
(Money Maker)

306
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,190
Geezer Gu,

307
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,980
are you going to find her or not?

308
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:32,980
No.

309
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:35,260
Your girlfriend

310
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,910
is going to date someone else abroad.

311
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,070
We already broke up.

312
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:41,670
Geezer Gu,

313
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,910
If you don't go after her now,

314
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,630
you'll never be my brother-in-law.

315
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:46,740
Do you realize that?

316
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,590
Jiang Xiaotang!

317
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,500
Let me tell you one last time.

318
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,070
What happened between me and your sister

319
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,190
is our business,

320
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,460
not yours!

321
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,540
You're a student.

322
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,070
Your job is to focus on school!

323
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,300
Fine.

324
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,590
I'll stop meddling, happy?

325
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,020
Where are you going?

326
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,220
None of your business!

327
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,460
I just don't want
to be around you anymore!

(Branch Commander's Office)

329
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,500
I'm not scared. The police will save me.

330
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,390
Kong, watch out!

331
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,140
(Branch Commander's Office)

332
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:18,020
Gu Zhi,

333
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:21,870
here are

334
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:23,260
the recent burglary case files.

335
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:24,670
Thanks.

336
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:33,910
Rubai.

337
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,980
If you're free tonight, stay

338
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,670
and go through these cases with me.

339
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:55,260
(Branch Commander's Office)

340
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,670
Judging by the method used,

341
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:01,020
the suspect is likely the same person.

342
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,830
I don't think so.

343
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,260
According to eyewitnesses,

344
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,630
there were too many suspects.

345
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:08,540
Each varies

346
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:10,670
in height, build,

347
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:11,830
and even gender.

348
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,990
Can't be the same guy.

349
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,260
Did any of the witness

350
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:15,910
mention

351
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:18,260
the exact differences
in height and build?

352
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,350
Gender can be disguised.

353
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,150
Height and build

354
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,740
can be altered to some extent too.

355
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,070
The way a crime is carried out

356
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,740
can easily turn into a habit.

357
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,110
All right.

358
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,390
If you're right,

359
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:32,630
then this person

360
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,670
is a master of disguise

361
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,700
and adept at committing crimes.

362
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,260
He may be a repeat offender.

363
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,150
There must be a record.

364
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,350
I'll inform the video analysis team

365
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,590
to run a comparison.

366
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,350
If we find anything,

367
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,350
we'll follow the lead

368
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,500
and track down the suspect.

What?
