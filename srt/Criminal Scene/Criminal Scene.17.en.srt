=Episode 17=

3
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,060
Happy birthday to me.

4
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,980
Happy birthday to me.

5
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,390
Happy birthday to me.

6
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:49,980
I survived another year.

7
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,140
Come on. Let's dig in.

8
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,500
This is delicious.

9
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,540
(Gu Zhen. Jiang Ying)

10
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,340
Meng.

11
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:58,750
Meng.

12
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,100
Meng.

13
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,430
Meng.

14
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,940
Why did you leave the hospital?

15
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:05,440
I'll get your medicine.

16
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,620
No, don't go.

17
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,100
Stay here.

18
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,870
Can I go to be with Tong?

19
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:14,590
No.

20
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,750
Tong is still young.

21
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,030
She'll feel scared

22
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,750
without me in the underworld.

23
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,940
It's my fault.

24
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,470
No.

25
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,780
- It's not your fault.
- It's my fault.

26
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,310
She wouldn't have died
if I didn't go to the food stall.

27
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,470
No, it wasn't like that.

28
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,310
It was all my fault. I'm so sorry.

29
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,870
No, it's not.

30
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,060
It was my fault.

31
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,940
No, it's not your fault.

32
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:43,870
It was mine.

33
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,220
It was my fault.

34
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,940
Let me see Tong again.

35
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,870
Just once.

36
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,700
Mommy is the messy eater.

37
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,140
Let me see who's the messy eater.

38
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,350
Daddy,

39
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,110
you said if I'm brave,
I will get a reward.

40
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,140
I want to ride the roller coaster
at the amusement park.

41
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,580
When will you take me?

42
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,210
That's right.

43
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:27,380
Riding the roller coaster

44
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,870
takes a lot of courage.

45
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,870
Tomorrow's the weekend.

46
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,190
How about we go there tomorrow?

47
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,460
Thank you, Daddy.

48
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,380
You're welcome.

49
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,620
I'll take you to the amusement park.

50
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:53,620
Meng.

51
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:56,790
Meng?

52
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:58,910
Meng.

53
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,020
Daddy.

54
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,350
Daddy.

55
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:57,550
The past will only hold you back.

56
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,550
Mr. Wang,

57
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,260
It's time to let go.

58
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,460
If you're willing to move forward,

59
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,820
I'll always be by your side.

60
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,230
Are you sure

61
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,670
you want to stay with someone like me?

62
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,060
The police came to see me.

63
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,260
I know everything.

64
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,110
Turn yourself in.

65
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,580
You changed your number
and still texted me.

66
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,310
Didn't you want me to find you?

67
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,230
Come with me.

68
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,870
Who do you think you are?

69
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,990
Do you think a few words

70
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,380
will change my mind?

71
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,380
Let me tell you,

72
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:49,700
no one can help me, understand?

73
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,670
Mr. Wang...

74
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,820
Why...

75
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,430
No one can help me.

76
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,460
Not even you.

77
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:27,790
Qin,

78
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,020
did you get all that?

79
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:30,500
Yeah.

80
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,260
Captain Gu.

81
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:34,580
Kong Rubai,

82
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,580
how's thing going?

83
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,190
We searched the studio and the gallery.

84
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,580
But we didn't find anything useful.

85
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,910
Wang Jian has long been planning this.

86
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,350
He definitely has a hideout.

87
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:44,870
Right now,

88
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,910
we have to start with Xue Cheng

89
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,700
and follow the trail to Wang Jian.

90
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,140
But for now,

91
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,550
we have a new case.

92
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:52,910
What case?

93
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,310
A body dumped in an abandoned well.

94
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,060
Wang Jian isn't the only suspect
in this world.

95
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,230
Our team has plenty of work to do.

96
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:02,620
Are you done?

97
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,870
Let's get to work.

98
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,660
(Police)

99
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,860
(Police)

100
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,140
(Forensic Investigation)

101
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,060
This well opening is small.

102
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,820
It should be 50 centimeters wide.

103
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,630
How did they dump a body in there?

104
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,670
Judging from the feet,

105
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,490
the victim should be a big guy

106
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,390
when he was alive.

107
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,390
Getting him out won't be easy.

108
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,310
If the villagers haven't been clearing

109
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,740
the area for farming,

110
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,060
who knows how long
it'd take to find him?

111
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,310
His feet have turned pale.

112
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,700
The body is badly decomposed.

113
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,740
Be careful when pulling it out

114
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,390
to avoid further damage.

115
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,430
It's wedged in tight.

116
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,910
Considering the bloating

117
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,190
and advanced decomposition,

118
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,390
if we pull too hard...

119
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,030
Move slowly and keep it steady.

120
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,430
Let's retrieve it in one piece.

121
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,630
The victim's face is completely smashed,

122
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,150
making identification difficult.

123
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,860
Severe soft tissue decay is one thing,

124
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,580
but even the bones are shattered.

125
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,740
Facial reconstruction
might not be possible.

126
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,340
The killer knew what they were doing.

127
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,340
He took off the victim's clothes

128
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,740
to reduce friction

129
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,150
so it's easier to fit the body
into the well.

130
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,100
He destroyed the face

131
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,630
to make sure we couldn't

132
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,940
easily confirm who the victim was.

133
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,630
Qin has a point.

134
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,340
The victim was too big

135
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,820
and got stuck.

136
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,580
He couldn't fall in or be pulled out.

137
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,590
So the killer could just leave it here.

138
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,740
It looks like the killer's luck ran out.

139
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,430
Time of death?

140
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,580
The body shows signs
of postmortem bloating.

141
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,860
This usually happens three to seven days

142
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,310
after death in spring and autumn,

143
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,550
two to three days in summer,

144
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,190
and 15 to 30 days in winter.

145
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,060
Based on the decomposition,

146
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,980
I'd say about a week.

147
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,390
Cause of death?

148
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,820
As we can see,

149
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,740
other than the head and face,

150
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,310
there are no major external injuries

151
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,150
or signs of poisoning.

152
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,030
For the preliminary investigation,

153
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,630
the fatal wound appears
to be blunt force trauma to the face.

154
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,190
As for the weapon,

155
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,820
it was some kind of blunt object.

156
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,290
I can't tell what type it is for now.

157
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,940
There are clear signs of struggle

158
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,980
under the victim's fingernails.

159
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,220
This means

160
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,510
he wasn't dead when he was thrown

161
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,630
into the well.

162
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,700
He was likely knocked unconscious

163
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,670
by the head injury.

164
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,980
When he woke up,
he was already in the well.

165
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,820
He tried to fight his way out

166
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,030
due to survival instinct.

167
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,820
But he had severe blood loss

168
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,150
and

169
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,740
was dumped headfirst into the wall.

170
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,580
So after losing blood
and being upside down for too long,

171
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,030
his body gave out.

172
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:18,910
In the end...

173
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,340
Captain Gu,

174
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,200
there's something
at the bottom of the well.

175
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:25,670
Qin,

176
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,100
bring a magnet.

177
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:33,510
Yes, sir.

178
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,630
Help!

179
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,060
Captain Gu,

180
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,910
there are no missing person reports
matching the victim.

181
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:36,580
Captain Gu.

182
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,740
How's the facial reconstruction?

183
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,630
The skull is too damaged.

184
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,660
We can't rebuild the face.

185
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,190
We also checked missing persons.

186
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,220
But there's no match.

187
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,700
The crime scene

188
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,900
was hit by multiple rainstorms.

189
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,030
By the time we found the body,

190
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,200
too many people had gathered.

191
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,310
The crime scene is heavily contaminated.

192
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:56,310
By the way,

193
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,680
any findings on the murder weapon?

194
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,790
The wrench only
had the victim's blood on it,

195
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:00,580
and no fingerprints.

196
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,460
We find no useful evidence.

197
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,390
The local police

198
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,150
received a report about a stolen car.

199
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,590
Here's the information
on the car owner

200
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:13,790
and the person who rented it.

201
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:14,460
(ID Card)

202
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,580
(Shi Chen)
The report stated

203
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,430
that the renter of his car
had disappeared.

204
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,790
The police suspect

205
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,630
he might have been killed.

206
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,100
Do we have the car's location?

207
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,580
It's at a repair shop.

208
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,790
And the shop owner

209
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,430
is Cheng Xu.

210
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,190
Wang Jian also drove
Cheng Xu's car before.

211
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,190
All clues lead back

212
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,430
to Wang Jian.

213
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:34,310
Qin. Rubai.

214
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,150
Get to work.

215
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:50,670
Boss!

216
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:52,630
Boss!

217
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,630
I'm here.

218
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,430
What's up?

219
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:55,550
You're the owner here, right?

220
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,340
My car's got a small issue.

221
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,190
Can you take a look?

222
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:58,980
What's the problem?

223
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,340
The engine's making noise.

224
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,450
Give me the keys
and pick it up tomorrow.

225
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:03,630
The owner is here.

226
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,390
Hand me the keys.

227
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,270
You guys talk.

228
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,310
I'll take a look around.

229
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,340
Excuse me, don't go over there.

230
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,190
Relax, I'm just looking around.

231
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:11,980
About the grille...

232
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:12,670
Just take a look.

233
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,630
It'll dirty your shoes.

234
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,150
Can you change the front grille for me?

235
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:17,930
Wang,

236
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:18,980
that area's for paint jobs.

237
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:19,720
No entry to anyone.

238
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,270
Okay.

239
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,100
Hey you!

240
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,060
Found it!

241
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:32,550
Let me go!

242
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:33,910
Don't move!

243
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:34,940
Police! Stay still!

244
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:36,910
Don't move!

245
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,980
- Police! Don't move!
- Freeze!

246
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,580
Don't move!

247
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:42,980
- Don't make a move!
- Don't move!

248
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,560
On the ground!

249
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,630
- Stay still!
- Police! Stay where you are!

250
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,220
Don't move!

251
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:09,860
So, tell me.

252
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:10,740
Why did you run?

253
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,310
I know why you're arresting me.

254
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:15,740
Yeah, I admit.

255
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,910
I lent money at high interest rates

256
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:18,990
forcefully collected debts.

257
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:20,790
But

258
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,740
I swear to God

259
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,220
I didn't kill anyone.

260
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,640
If you're innocent, why did you run?

261
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:26,980
Keep talking.

262
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,340
These days,

263
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,790
debtors act like they're kings.

264
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,550
I worked hard for the money.

265
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,060
I lent that money to them,

266
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,710
but getting it back
is nearly impossible.

267
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:38,940
This whole mess?

268
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,060
It was all Hu Yang's doing.

269
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:41,910
Explain.

270
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,550
He owed me money but couldn't pay.

271
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,460
So he went into hiding.

272
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,580
I called all his relatives and friends,

273
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,390
demanding he pay up.

274
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,940
I even sent my guys
to threaten his parents.

275
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:55,390
You do realize
all of that is illegal, right?

276
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,740
If I admit I knew,

277
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,630
aren't I deliberately violating the law?

278
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,940
Don't start with that nonsense.

279
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:02,980
Go on.

280
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,310
I figured

281
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:06,060
if I pressured him enough, he'd pay up.

282
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:07,790
But

283
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,670
that scum didn't even try.

284
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:12,060
He had no intention of paying me back.

285
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,890
I cornered him a few times
but it was useless.

286
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,670
You think I'd just let that slide?

287
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,030
That's not who I am.

288
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,060
But turns out, he had backup.

289
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,150
Wait.

290
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,700
Are you saying Shi Chen was the helper?

291
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:25,940
Yes.

292
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,860
Then why was his car at your shop?

293
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:29,860
Because of Shi Chen,

294
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,740
we failed to corner Hu Yang every time.

295
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:35,270
I lost face in front of my guys.

296
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,670
So, of course, I had to get even.

297
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,060
I had my men track Shi Chen's car

298
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,550
and we finally found them.

299
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,150
And then?

300
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:45,270
You killed him?

301
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,430
That part

302
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,860
wasn't me.

303
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,500
No! Please, stop!

304
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,430
Quick!

305
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,590
Hu Yang.

306
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,540
You've got some nerve.

307
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:22,260
Living your life free and easy

308
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,190
without paying me my money back, huh?

309
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:27,780
Xue,

310
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,260
I beg you.

311
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,630
Stop beating me up.

312
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,590
I can't take it anymore.

313
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,300
Hu Yang,

314
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,700
don't give in to them.

315
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,390
These guys

316
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,700
are nothing

317
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,190
without their weapons.

318
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,500
Do you think we can't handle you?

319
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:41,740
Come on, then.

320
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,190
So long as we're still alive,

321
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,630
we will make your life difficult!

322
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,670
Tough guy, huh?

323
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,220
Of course.

324
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,910
We're friends.

325
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:53,940
Best friends.

326
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,300
How about this?

327
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,110
I'm not someone

328
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,830
who lacks money.

329
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,260
Today,

330
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,670
you two fight each other.

331
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:05,910
The winner

332
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,110
gets 100,000 yuan.

333
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,150
Kill the other guy?

334
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:10,630
I'll make it 200,000 yuan.

335
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:13,220
Do you think you can turn us
against each other

336
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,870
with that small amount of money?

337
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,700
Buddy, I...

338
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:22,740
Sorry, man.

339
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,460
I'm sorry.

340
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,700
Forgive me, man.

341
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,430
I'm sorry.

342
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,430
When I have money,

343
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,150
I'll burn more joss paper for you.

344
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,070
Stay away from me.

345
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,300
Don't get the blood on me.

346
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,260
Mr. Xue,

347
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,830
you said

348
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,190
if I kill him,

349
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,780
you'll give me 200,000 yuan grand.

350
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,740
Does that mean

351
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,500
my debt is cleared?

352
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,740
I was just simply saying that.

353
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,190
And you actually do it?

354
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,260
Mr. Xue,

355
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,500
don't push me.

356
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,150
Fine.

357
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,070
The money clears part of your debt.

358
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,460
But with interest,
you owe me 300,000 yuan.

359
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,700
How are you paying the rest?

360
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,540
Shi Chen's car.

361
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:36,780
Take it.

362
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,780
That car's worthless.

363
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,590
The cops will trace it back to me.

364
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,430
Why would I want it?

365
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,590
Shi Chen's parents are long gone.

366
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,220
He has no one left.

367
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,980
No one's going to come to you.

368
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:50,740
So don't worry.

369
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,110
After you drive the car away,

370
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,190
just swap the license plate,

371
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:56,020
grind off the engine number
and it's yours.

372
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:56,700
Mr. Xue.

373
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,150
You killed him.

374
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,020
So you deal with the body yourself.

375
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:04,980
I'm not taking the fall for this.

376
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:07,780
The body...

377
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,460
The body...

378
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:11,260
Oh, I know

379
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:12,740
there's an abandoned well

380
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,700
not far from here.

381
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,590
I'll dump the body into the well.

382
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,390
No one will ever find it

383
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,260
Hu Yang dumped the body into the well

384
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,350
and just left.

385
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,700
So you're saying

386
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,190
Hu Yang was the one
who actually did the killing?

387
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,780
You guys never laid a hand on him?

388
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,110
I just said it as a joke.

389
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,070
He took it seriously.

390
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,320
We didn't have time to stop him.

391
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,590
Where is Hu Yang now?

392
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,260
He already fled.

393
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,020
I had my own problems to deal with.

394
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,190
So I didn't look for him.

395
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:39,190
But that guy is heartless.

396
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,070
Shi Chen took him in

397
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:41,940
and stood up for him.

398
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:44,260
But he repaid him by killing him

399
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,980
and using his car to pay off his debt.

400
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:49,350
Someone who lacks loyalty

401
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,500
and backstabbed his friend

402
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,830
won't last long.

403
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:52,940
He's doomed sooner or later.

404
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,630
You knew that car was stolen.

405
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,780
Why did you still keep it?

406
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:00,300
It was a good car.

407
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,980
I really liked it.

408
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,430
I thought no one would find out.

409
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,500
My brother-in-law used to say,

410
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,110
"Don't lose the greater for the lesser."

411
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,280
I wasn't convinced back then.

412
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,430
But now...

413
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,590
Where's your brother-in-law?

414
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,780
He forgot about my sister.

415
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,700
We had a falling out

416
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,210
and I haven't seen him since.

417
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:30,730
This is the file

418
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,830
we found

419
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,110
at your hideout.

420
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,300
It contains records

421
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,550
of all your illegal activities.

422
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,670
You ran an underground loan operation,

423
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,670
illegally took public deposits,

424
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:43,110
and charged high interest rates.

425
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,020
Then you laundered the money

426
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,390
through art auctions and galleries.

427
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,630
You even set up

428
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,870
an art investment company

429
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:51,670
scammed investors under the pretext

430
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:52,950
of restoring historic buildings.

431
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,830
The money

432
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,500
was then transferred overseas

433
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,780
for your own luxury.

434
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,110
Listen here.

435
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,940
Based on the evidence we have,

436
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,870
you're the leader
of this entire operation.

437
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,070
I am just a figurehead.

438
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,260
Wang Jian managed the money.

439
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,830
We've been watching you for a long time.

440
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:12,190
All assets linked to this case

441
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,350
have already been frozen.

442
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:14,980
The only thing you can do now

443
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,190
is tell us

444
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,500
everything you know.

445
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,830
I swear to God,

446
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,540
this was all Wang Jian's doing.

447
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,780
He's the mastermind.

448
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:23,430
I'm only an accomplice at most.

449
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,700
I'm giving you one last chance!

450
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,540
Where's Wang Jian?

451
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:29,260
Protecting him won't do you
any favors now.

452
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,940
My brother-in-law is too cunning.

453
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,630
He trusts no one.

454
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,300
He's a mad person.

455
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,300
He had plenty of chances to escape.

456
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,300
But he refused.

457
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,410
He's determined
to drag a few people to die with him.

458
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,780
But I really don't know

459
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,630
who he is after.

460
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,700
(People's Public Security)

461
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:51,980
Qin Tai'an. Kong Rubai.

462
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,500
Find Xue Cheng's accomplices.

463
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,870
Interrogate them separately

464
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,150
and compare their statements.

465
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:56,740
Yes, sir.

466
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,460
Yu Yue,

467
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,670
apply for an arrest warrant.

468
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:00,110
Capture Hu Yang as soon as possible.

469
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:00,670
Yes, sir.

470
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:01,800
Let's get to work.

471
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,740
(Dry Well Case)

472
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:18,670
Hello, Geezer Gu.

473
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,390
Come home early tonight.

474
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,350
I've got a surprise for you.

475
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:25,870
Suddenly acting nice, are you

476
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:26,940
plotting or feeling guilty?

477
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,780
Why are you suddenly
being nice to me?

478
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,430
You're a lonely middle-aged man
in need of some love.

479
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,150
If I don't treat you well,

480
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,190
who will?

481
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,670
And what did I do

482
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:40,460
to deserve this overwhelming kindness?

483
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:43,110
Geezer Gu,
you should have more confidence.

484
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,920
I don't even fangirl
over celebrities anymore.

485
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:48,070
The real superstar in my eyes

486
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,390
is the great Detective Gu Zhen!

487
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,460
Yeah, right.

488
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,630
So, what do you want?

489
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,190
I'm serious.

490
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:57,540
Just come home early.

491
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,980
I've got a big surprise for you.

492
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,070
Is it more like a scare?

493
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:03,740
Of course not!

494
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,870
You'll see when you get here.

495
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:05,830
Don't be late.

496
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,740
I'll be waiting.

497
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:07,460
Bye-bye.

498
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,740
This brat...

499
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,540
If Tong were still alive,

500
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,190
she'd probably be pretty too.

501
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:49,940
Stay quiet.

502
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:51,940
Don't be afraid.

503
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:56,430
I only want to play
a little game with you.

504
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:03,220
Why are you doing this to me?

505
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,540
Because you betrayed me!

506
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,390
You want me to turn myself in?

507
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:12,670
Anna,

508
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,590
did you actually believe
a little kindness

509
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,390
would change me?

510
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,150
What are you trying to do?

511
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,980
I told you

512
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,790
I wanted to play a little game with you.

513
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,460
If I lose,

514
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,460
you'll live.

515
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:38,350
If I win,

516
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:41,670
let's go down together, okay?

517
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,430
What's your stake?

518
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,350
Human nature.

519
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:32,940
Hello, Su Qian.

520
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,910
Captain Gu, where are you?

521
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,020
I just reached home. Why?

522
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,910
I only saw Xiaotang's message
after I was done with work.

523
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,630
She said she had set up
a blind date for me

524
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:43,090
and told me to head to her house now.

525
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,740
Do you know what's going on?

526
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:46,980
Are you okay?

527
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,980
I... I'm fine.

528
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,740
Xiaotang was just messing around.

529
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,390
Just ignore her.

530
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:52,980
Okay.

531
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:54,500
Then I'll write my report.

532
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,260
Okay.

533
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:01,110
This brat

534
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,460
is always messing around.

535
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:14,830
Xiaotang.

536
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:17,700
Xiaotang!

537
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,410
I'll let myself in
if you don't open the door.

538
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:31,580
(Jiang Xiaotang: Come and find me here.)

539
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:35,260
All right.

540
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,260
I'll pick you up.

541
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:50,870
Anna,

542
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,910
where are we?

543
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:56,940
It doesn't matter

544
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,670
where you are.

545
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,430
What do you want?

546
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:07,260
Gu Zhen, hurry and save us!
