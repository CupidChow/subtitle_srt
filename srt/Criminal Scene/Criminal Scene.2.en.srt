00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:36,260
=Episode 2=

3
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,020
(Great painting!)

4
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,750
(Meng Zisu)
Your shirt!

5
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:48,660
I'll pay you.

6
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,470
Never mind.

7
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,620
Let me wash it for you.

8
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,340
Be more careful.

9
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,940
I washed the shirt.

10
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:00,900
Here you go.

11
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,460
(Swing by the studio
when you're free.)

12
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:15,990
Mr. Shen.

13
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,100
I'm sorry.

14
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:17,660
Sorry.

15
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,870
Xiaotang had a scare last night.

16
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:21,900
Yeah.

17
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,150
Let her catch a breath.

18
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,660
When she's calmed down,

19
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,710
I'll send her to school.

20
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,340
Sorry for the trouble.

21
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:29,870
Thank you so much.

22
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,190
I think you should get your sister

23
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,270
a proper therapist.

24
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,100
The suspect is extremely twisted.

25
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,830
The victim was heavily burned
before discarding.

26
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,100
Who knows if this was
an indiscriminate crime

27
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,100
for the sake of catharsis

28
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,340
or a revenge with specific targets?

29
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,940
Did you find the suspect?

30
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,660
The cameras on the street was broken.

31
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,190
The victim's injury was too severe.

32
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,590
They didn't make it at the hospital.

33
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,340
However, we all know the victim.

34
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,060
Who is it?

35
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,500
Yin Qing?

36
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,820
Girlfriend of Feng Chao,
the serial kidnapper and murderer

37
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,900
from five years ago.

38
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,750
She was sentenced

39
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,670
to four years in jail.

40
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,550
Just days after she was released...

41
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,670
Is this an act of revenge?

42
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,910
If so, who is the target?
Yin Qing or Feng Chao?

43
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,700
Feng Chao has been dead for five years.

44
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,670
Who would take revenge on a dead guy?

45
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,550
Five years...

46
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:32,460
Captain,

47
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,230
this case...

48
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:34,870
This case has been

49
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,310
handed to Team Two.

50
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,990
Our priority is to solve

51
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,750
the superstar's case.

52
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,250
Which department are you from?

53
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:48,870
Can you please do your job?

54
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,460
Scram if you're no good.

55
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:54,580
Let's have a look.

56
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,230
You must be the director.

57
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,350
We're the police.

58
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,310
Hello.

59
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,060
Hello.

60
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,380
We came to learn more about

61
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,700
Meng Zisu's case.

62
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,460
His head got big as soon
as he got famous.

63
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,670
He's becoming more arrogant.

64
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,470
I'm not drinking it.

65
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,620
He is becoming more rude
to those around him.

66
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,940
And who would that be?

67
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,310
The cameramen, the lighting crew,
the logistics.

68
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,750
Anyone can mess with him.

69
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:26,020
He can only take it out

70
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:26,750
on his manager.

71
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:29,750
Slower!

72
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,430
The manager, Kelly,

73
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,310
doesn't look like
the type who'd get bullied.

74
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,060
I saw her secretly crying alone
by the corner

75
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,380
several times.

76
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,310
He's nitpicking every little thing.

77
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,790
Even the toughest girl
can't withstand it.

78
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,140
Do you know this person?

79
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,910
However, if the girl got into
Meng Zisu's room,

80
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,060
she must have been a fan.

81
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,190
You should ask them.

82
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:57,550
(Meng Zisu)

83
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,140
(Meng Zisu)
I think we shouldn't worry too much.

84
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,110
I believe Zisu is innocent.

85
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,460
My big brother is a cop.

86
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,750
He is the best detective there is.

87
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,110
I know he can prove Zisu's innocence.

88
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,230
We must believe in him.

89
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,460
Believe in him, okay?

90
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,580
We believe him!

91
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,790
Geezer Gu.

92
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:17,380
Jiang Xiaotang.

93
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,820
I was on the phone with your teacher,

94
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,750
saying you're unwell
and couldn't go to school.

95
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,940
But look at you now.

96
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:23,990
You look so lively.

97
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,820
Sorry.

98
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,990
We're here for the case,

99
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:28,940
not you.

100
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:31,820
Mr. Gu.

101
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,140
Zisu is not a murderer.

102
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,750
He is the kindest and most gentle man

103
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,910
in the world.

104
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,500
He is innocent.

105
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,990
You have to save him.

106
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:40,460
Yeah.

107
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:43,750
Everybody,

108
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,140
gather around.

109
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:47,700
Police.

110
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,140
I need your help

111
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,230
with a photo.

112
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,260
Have you seen the girl in this photo?

113
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,350
How about this?

114
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,620
Please stay if you know her.

115
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,500
If you don't, please move over there.

116
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:16,870
You two know her?

117
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:18,940
I...

118
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:21,870
I...

119
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,190
Well...

120
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,020
She looks familiar.

121
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,820
I think she looks like Lin Xiaojing.

122
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,990
Yeah, that's her.

123
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,140
She is the leader
of the ninth fan club division.

124
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,750
I remember she once said she'd

125
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,620
graduate from Huaizhou University
next year.

126
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,230
Wang Qian.

127
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,500
The officers want to see you.

128
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,110
Hello.

129
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,140
Wang Qian.

130
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,020
We're with the police.

131
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:55,670
Hello.

132
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,550
We have some questions for you.

133
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,820
Have you been
to the Grand Studio Hotel lately

134
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,700
to book a room?

135
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,190
Yeah.

136
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,330
Checked out the next day.

137
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,670
Did you hear any noises

138
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,910
coming from the room across
the hallway?

139
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:07,750
No idea.

140
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,750
I never went there.

141
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,140
You booked a room but never went there?

142
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,670
Why?

143
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,500
All because of my girlfriend.

144
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,550
She wanted to get a room,

145
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,990
but then she backed out.

146
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,660
I went to the counter for a refund,

147
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:19,940
but exceeded the deadline.

148
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,140
We couldn't get a refund.

149
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,020
I didn't want to be in the room alone.

150
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:23,670
It'd be boring.

151
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,700
My friends asked me to join their game.

152
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,990
So, I went to the internet cafe.

153
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:27,860
I felt sleepy then

154
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,060
and slept at the internet cafe.

155
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,940
What is the name of the internet cafe?

156
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,630
Was anyone with you?

157
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,390
I get it.

158
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,460
I need an alibi.

159
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,510
I'll write the names.

160
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,940
Ask them and see if I'm right.

161
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,390
We want your
and your girlfriend's names,

162
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,740
phone numbers, and addresses.

163
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,510
All of it.

164
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,550
No problem.

165
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,550
(Speedy Internet Cafe)
Your girlfriend wanted a room

166
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,720
but never went there.

167
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,940
Do you know why?

168
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,750
Women are unpredictable
and hard to please.

169
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,700
We'll need you
for further investigation.

170
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,510
You'll have my full cooperation.

171
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,030
Make sure we can reach you.

172
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:03,940
Sure.

173
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:04,580
This way.

174
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,660
(Forensic Studio)

175
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,460
(Renal artery, renal vein)

176
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,140
(The blood sample was sent
to the morgue. History of drug use.)

177
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,260
(Do not touch!)

178
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,310
Hello.

179
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,270
Busy working?

180
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:57,860
Well?

181
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,310
Any new lead?

182
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,740
GHB was detected in the red wine.

183
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,220
Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid.

184
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,510
It's an aphrodisiac.

185
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,700
Aphrodisiac?

186
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,340
We found this substance in bars
and nightclubs.

187
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,740
This substance is odorless
and tasteless.

188
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,820
It was a sedative used to treat

189
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,580
insomnia and depression.

190
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:21,060
But the bad guys use it
to harm the innocent.

191
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,100
After consuming, the victim

192
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,030
will lose consciousness.

193
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,790
Then bradycardia,
respiratory depression,

194
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,860
hallucinations, and dizziness.

195
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,580
This drug is used to

196
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,980
knock out and violate women.

197
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,740
The report from the lab.

198
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,910
The fingerprints,

199
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,820
footprints, and hair found
at the crime scene

200
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:47,940
indicate Meng Zisu,

201
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,030
Kelly the manager,

202
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,670
Madam Zheng the cleaner

203
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,190
and the two actors drinking
with Meng Zisu that night

204
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:55,150
were all there.

205
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,510
Madam Zheng and the actors

206
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,790
have solid alibis.

207
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,790
Based on the evidence,

208
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,910
the only suspects

209
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,790
are Meng Zisu and Kelly.

210
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,340
Is the autopsy report ready?

211
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,150
The time of death

212
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,700
is around the early morning,

213
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,220
from 4 AM to 6 AM.

214
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,150
The cause of death was
asphyxiation due to vomit.

215
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,510
There were no visible
external or internal injuries.

216
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:18,390
It's suspected that the victim
asphyxiated on vomit

217
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,390
after being sedated.

218
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,510
Are you telling me

219
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,270
she choked on her own vomit?

220
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:25,100
The safe dosage range
for GHB is very narrow.

221
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,700
Overuse can cause nausea,

222
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,580
vomiting, and coma.

223
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,630
Lin Xiaojing likely
experienced a vomiting

224
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,940
reaction after an overdose.

225
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,740
However, since she was
in a comatose state,

226
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,910
her airway was blocked by vomit,

227
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:38,850
leading to asphyxiation.

228
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,190
In other words,

229
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,030
she might have consumed it accidentally

230
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,460
or drugged by someone,

231
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,460
which knocked her out.

232
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,580
And then, the asphyxiation
from her vomit led to her death.

233
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,430
If she was drugged,

234
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,060
was the overdose intentional or not?

235
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,100
That will warrant further investigation.

236
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,190
Wait.

237
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,310
How could Meng Zisu unaware

238
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:03,190
if someone was dying
from choking on vomit

239
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:03,860
in his room?

240
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,430
We also found traces of

241
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:07,310
GHB in his blood.

242
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,550
And based on his statement,

243
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,310
after returning,

244
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,270
he drank some red wine
because he was thirsty.

245
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:13,550
Once a person drinks

246
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,460
wine laced with GHB,

247
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,310
they will become unconscious
immediately.

248
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,460
That state will last
from dozens of minutes

249
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,550
to a couple of hours.

250
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,940
Therefore, it's debatable whether or not
Meng Zisu was capable of

251
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:24,780
committing the crime.

252
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,580
It's possible he didn't notice

253
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,580
the victim was vomiting.

254
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,740
If someone drugged Meng Zisu

255
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,220
and killed Lin Xiaojing,

256
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,910
what is their motive?

257
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,510
Any progress?

258
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:52,790
Yang,

259
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,750
autopsy report is here.

260
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,310
The camera in the form of a charger

261
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,460
was remotely transmitted.

262
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,310
We can't track down
where the signal goes

263
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:02,790
or who installed it.

264
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:03,700
However,

265
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,740
there is good stuff in those presents

266
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:07,940
from the fans.

267
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,820
Zisu! Your movie is going
to be a real hit!

268
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,940
We love you!

269
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,940
A voice recording.

270
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,790
There is more than meets the eye.

271
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,910
If this camera could tell us
who drugged them,

272
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,150
that'd be of great of to us.

273
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,430
Well, let's find out.

274
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:43,820
Zisu!

275
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,740
Your movie will be a hit!

276
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,980
We love you!

277
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,910
Everyone, quiet down.

278
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,220
Our staff will collect

279
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,510
all the gifts from you.

280
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,700
Thanks for coming.

281
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,340
Thank you.

282
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,980
Zisu, we love you!

283
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,460
He looked at me!

284
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,510
What did they send me?

285
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,510
Just some trash.

286
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,340
Quiet down.

287
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,220
If a fan hears this,

288
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,580
your image is ruined.

289
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,630
There are worse things.

290
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,340
Hold on.

291
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,670
Mind the lipstick.

292
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,580
Let's have a drink tonight.

293
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,860
You have a job tomorrow.

294
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:52,940
Don't get drunk.

295
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,630
Okay.

296
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,790
You nag like my mom.

297
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,340
It skips the best part.

298
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,860
At least we know

299
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,740
who installed the hidden camera.

300
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:16,910
Kelly.

301
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:21,150
You installed a hidden camera
to spy on someone.

302
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:24,340
You violated his privacy.
This is against the law.

303
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,820
You are legally responsible.

304
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,060
How could you do this when you are

305
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:29,980
Meng Zisu's manager?

306
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,860
This goes against your work ethic.

307
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,580
I admit it.

308
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,860
I installed the charger
with a hidden camera.

309
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,700
But I didn't kill anyone.

310
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,740
I didn't even know the victim.

311
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,390
Why did you spy on Meng Zisu?

312
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,430
Actually,

313
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,550
we've been in a relationship.

314
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:55,340
And why is that a reason
to install a hidden camera?

315
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,790
He wouldn't
make our relationship official.

316
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,430
To maintain his image of a single idol,

317
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,630
he didn't let me

318
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,430
get too intimate with him.

319
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,030
He even berated me in front of others

320
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,980
to play up the hostility between us.

321
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,430
Over the years,

322
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,510
the fans have been bullying me online.

323
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,940
They claim that I seduced him.

324
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,980
I can't take this secret relationship.

325
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,980
I only wanted to film
some intimate moments

326
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,950
to sell to the paparazzi.

327
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,910
Then, he can make it official.

328
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,550
I can finally be recognized.

329
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,670
I can finally tell the world
we are in love.

330
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,340
What did you film?

331
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,630
Nothing.

332
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,940
The camera was busted.

333
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,860
I got scammed by the seller.

334
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,550
Check it if you don't believe me.

335
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,340
I didn't film anything.

336
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,350
I don't think there are more
cameras and mics.

337
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,260
Sorry.

338
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,020
I'm paranoid.

339
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,260
I get it.

340
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,070
We came to find out

341
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,020
more about

342
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,540
your relationship with Kelly.

343
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,390
The reporters won't find out

344
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,350
what I tell you, right?

345
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:24,300
Rest assured,

346
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,910
the police won't leak any private info.

347
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,540
Kelly and I...

348
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,110
She installed the camera

349
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,350
to film some footage

350
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,870
to tell the world we were in love.

351
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,220
I've known it from the get-go.

352
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,070
But who am I now?

353
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,780
I will never be in love with her.

354
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,460
She was too naive.

355
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,190
I broke the camera

356
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,220
a long time ago.

357
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:53,940
Sir.

358
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,110
Mr. Gu.

359
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,220
She is too scared

360
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,220
to go to the police.

361
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,500
She can only meet you here.

362
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,700
I hope you understand.

363
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:02,700
Gu,

364
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,540
mind your attitude.

365
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:06,870
Don't scare the girl.

366
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:09,670
Give us some space.

367
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:13,910
Miss,

368
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:15,190
we're the police.

369
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,540
(The deceased's)
We're here

370
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,830
(VIP fan club member)
to learn more about Lin Xiaojing.

371
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:20,980
Don't be afraid.

372
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,020
Tell us what you know.

373
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,350
Your hunk is here to pick you up.

374
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,780
He is not mine.

375
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,500
I can tell.

376
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,220
Hello, handsome.

377
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,260
It's peak hour soon.

378
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,110
Hard to get a taxi.

379
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,350
Let me give you a ride.

380
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,260
Sure.

381
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:48,430
Thanks.

382
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,020
Thank you.

383
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,540
Gotta answer this.

384
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,150
Hello?

385
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:57,260
Liu Ang?

386
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,220
You still remember me.

387
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,870
I thought you've forgotten me.

388
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:04,830
Sure.

389
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,740
Come and pick me up

390
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,020
at the entrance
of Grandview Eco Resort Hotel.

391
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:10,700
Okay.

392
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,260
Bye.

393
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:13,940
It's Liu Ang.

394
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:17,070
Handsome.

395
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,630
My friend is picking me up.

396
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,830
Could you send Anna home for me?

397
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:22,630
Okay.

398
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,430
Thanks.

399
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,980
Think it through.

400
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:40,740
Come on, get in.

401
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,460
(Huaizhou Public Security Bureau)

402
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,460
I talked to the police officers.

403
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,430
I booked the room across
Meng Zisu's room.

404
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,020
But I had no idea he was there.

405
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,910
Besides, I never spent the night there.

406
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,350
I was at the internet cafe all night.

407
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,500
My girlfriend can prove it.

408
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,150
Calm down.

409
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:01,830
We only need you

410
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,190
to help us out.

411
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:10,630
No way.

412
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,300
This looks like
my girlfriend, Liu Sifan.

413
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,070
Liu Sifan?

414
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,110
But she told me she wasn't feeling well.

415
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,740
Why did she back to the hotel?

416
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:22,630
Liu Sifan is missing.

417
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:23,940
Is she on the run?

418
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,350
But Yu Yue's GPS shows

419
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,350
she's on campus.

420
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,630
I remember now.

421
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,430
It was something Jiang Xiaotang told me.

422
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,940
The scene that gave Meng Zisu

423
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,830
a meteoric rise

424
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,150
was the confession on the rooftop.

425
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:38,260
His fans love recreating that scene

426
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,220
on the rooftop.

427
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,780
Would anyone go this far?

428
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:45,220
I think I know where she is.

429
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:45,940
Let's go.

430
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,500
Do you believe it now?

431
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:02,630
Tai'an.

432
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:03,870
A suicide at the school.

433
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:04,500
We need backup.

434
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,540
Stay away!

435
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,910
Back off, or I'll jump!
