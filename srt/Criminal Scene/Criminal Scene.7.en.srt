00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,780
=Criminal Scene=

2
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:36,260
=Episode 7=

3
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:41,950
Captain Gu and Kong Rubai
are handling Liu Ang's case.

4
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:42,950
We're in charge of this.

5
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:45,870
You said

6
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,230
he cleaned the place
with all kinds of cleaning agents.

7
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,100
There might not be any evidence left.

8
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,420
Then let's change our approach.

9
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,830
This guy has severe OCD

10
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:56,190
and an obsession with cleanliness.

11
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:57,700
If he killed someone,

12
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:59,590
what would he do?

13
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,340
(Demolish)

14
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,310
This is the area.

15
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,220
Ah!

16
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,710
Xu Dongyang's living room walls

17
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,500
had uneven shades of color.

18
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,340
It looked like

19
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:36,900
a sofa was missing.

20
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,470
If he got rid of it recently,

21
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,940
the sofa shouldn't be far away.

22
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,600
Call the resident committee.

23
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:00,940
Officers,

24
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,990
this area is about to be demolished.

25
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,620
The sanitation isn't great.

26
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,190
Hello.

27
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:21,940
Hello?

28
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,780
Who dares disturb my royal rest?

29
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,550
We're the police.

30
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,900
This sofa is crucial evidence.

31
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,990
We need to inspect it.

32
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,900
Please get up.

33
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,550
How dare you!

34
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,220
This is my imperial throne!

35
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,380
No one shall touch it!

36
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,030
All right, Your Majesty.

37
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,710
Get up, Fang.

38
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,520
They're waiting for you
in the imperial court.

39
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,310
Imperial court?

40
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:45,900
Eunuch Li,

41
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:46,820
escort me to court!

42
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

43
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:25,910
Notify the team.

44
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:26,580
Okay.

45
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:31,910
Nice work.

46
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,870
I removed the broken fingernail
from the victim

47
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,350
and it's a perfect match
with the one you found on the sofa.

48
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:39,500
Also,

49
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,190
the DNA

50
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,910
under Liu Ang's nails came back.

51
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:44,310
The person he scratched

52
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,580
was Ke Hai.

53
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,060
(Interrogation Room 1)

54
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,940
(Interrogation Room 2)

55
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,550
It's all here in the report.

56
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:42,550
Captain Gu,

57
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:43,790
we got it.

58
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,750
Start the interrogation.

59
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,020
Ke Hai,

60
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,060
let's start with you and He Xiao.

61
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:05,700
She's already dead.

62
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:08,350
What's there to talk about?

63
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:10,940
Talk about Liu Ang.

64
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,670
He ruined so many girls.

65
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,020
He deserved to die.

66
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,450
Don't you think he deserved to die?

67
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:25,940
Do you know

68
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,310
what this scum

69
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,670
did to Xiao?

70
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,700
I found a few videos

71
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,350
in her room.

72
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,380
Can you believe it?

73
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,820
Just a few minutes of footage

74
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,430
drove my daughter,

75
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,550
my precious Xiao,
who was about to get married,

76
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,870
to take her own life.

77
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:47,820
Stop filming.

78
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:49,940
It's nothing, Xiao.

79
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:50,940
Get rid of the blanket.

80
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:52,430
No, don't!

81
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,500
You're my girlfriend.

82
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,580
It's normal for men
to film their girlfriends.

83
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,110
Or

84
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,790
do you not trust me at all?

85
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:04,430
Fine.

86
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,430
I guess I was delusional.

87
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,350
I thought you really liked me.

88
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,960
You even say no
to this small request?

89
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:10,940
Liu Ang.

90
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,190
I swear

91
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,460
I'll never show these videos to anyone.

92
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,750
They're just for me.

93
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,230
So

94
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,750
I can watch them

95
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,260
when I miss you.

96
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:28,820
Okay?

97
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,670
We've broken up.

98
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,380
Why did you send those videos

99
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,670
to my boyfriend?

100
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:50,870
Boyfriend?

101
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,580
Did I agree with the breakup?

102
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,020
I am your boyfriend!

103
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,580
If people watch your videos,

104
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,530
would they still want to be with you?

105
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,140
Liu Ang,

106
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,430
I'm begging you.

107
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,550
Please let me go.

108
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,430
Let you go?

109
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,380
After seeing how wild you are in bed?

110
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,430
You think I'll let you go?

111
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,820
I swear, I didn't mess with anyone else.

112
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,820
Do you think they'll believe you
after watching those videos?

113
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,340
Listen carefully.

114
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,190
From now on,

115
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,700
your phone stays on 24/7.

116
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,460
If I can't reach you even once,

117
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,390
your boyfriend will receive more videos,

118
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,190
including your friends and colleagues.

119
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,510
Everyone you know

120
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,790
will get to see your videos.

121
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,510
Also those online.

122
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,430
A woman who's been with me

123
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,150
belongs to me

124
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,060
whether she's dead or alive.

125
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,100
Got it?

126
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,650
I don't believe Wei still wants you!

127
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,060
Please.

128
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,790
Let me go.

129
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,670
Let me go.

130
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,820
Do you still want to leave me?

131
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:14,580
Still want to leave?

132
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,060
Fine.

133
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,390
Then die.

134
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,460
(Wei)

135
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,310
Hello.

136
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,630
Wei.

137
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:48,980
Are you home?

138
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:50,940
I'm coming to get my things.

139
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:51,860
Wei,

140
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,390
let me explain.

141
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,980
That video...

142
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,940
Liu Ang forced me to do it.

143
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,510
I love you, I really do.

144
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:02,820
Stop crying.

145
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,580
I'm already downstairs. We...

146
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,700
I almost fell for your tricks again.

147
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,820
Nothing between you two?

148
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,460
Then why he's coming out of your house?

149
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,820
I've been a fool all along!

150
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:15,580
No...

151
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,150
He Xiao, you're unbelievable!

152
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:17,700
Wei...

153
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:18,820
You wretch.

154
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,430
You can keep my things!

155
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,130
If you try to contact me again,
I'll make you pay!

156
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,740
Screw you!

157
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,150
Wei,

158
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,860
let me explain.

159
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,910
(If I can't reach you even once,)

160
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,700
(your boyfriend will receive
more videos,)

161
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,580
(including your friends and colleagues.)

162
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,740
(Everyone you know)

163
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,030
(will get to see your videos.)

164
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:24,820
(You wretch.)

165
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,950
(If you try to contact me again,
I'll make you pay!)

166
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,270
(Screw you!)

167
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,310
(You wretch.)

168
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,270
(Screw you!)

169
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,060
No!

170
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,100
Xiao!

171
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,820
Since you knew

172
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,820
Liu Ang was spreading those videos

173
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,150
and you had the evidence,

174
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:44,690
why didn't you go to the police?

175
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:46,340
The police?

176
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,580
What could they do?

177
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,580
Also,

178
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:54,150
the security footage showed
He Xiao jumping on her own.

179
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,190
Even if Liu Ang is sentenced,

180
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,460
how many years will he get?

181
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,630
So instead,

182
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,460
you chose revenge.

183
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,820
You ruined yourself to take him down?
Was it worth it?

184
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,820
After He Xiao jumped,

185
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,580
she lay in a pool of blood.

186
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,940
Her ribs punctured

187
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,270
her lungs.

188
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,340
She drowned in her own blood!

189
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:31,820
In my dreams, I can still hear her,

190
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,510
"Daddy, help...

191
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,700
Daddy, help..."

192
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,060
So

193
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,390
I slit his throat.

194
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,460
I saw Liu Ang

195
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,060
lying there, twitching, choking,

196
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:50,910
struggling,

197
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,270
and unable to make a sound.

198
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:55,390
So hilarious.

199
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,860
Absolutely hilarious!

200
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,430
So you admit

201
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,060
that you killed Liu Ang?

202
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,790
He loved being a player, right?

203
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:08,980
All right, then.

204
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:12,860
So I made sure he died
playing in his favorite place.

205
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,980
So long as he is rotting in hell,

206
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,690
I can finally say
justice is served for Xiao.

207
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,340
Then why did you frame Wei?

208
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,820
He's no saint either.

209
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,820
He kept saying he loved Xiao.

210
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,060
Love? Really?

211
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,910
Then why did he leave her

212
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,980
when she needed him most?

213
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,310
Living

214
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,790
in darkness forever

215
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,580
isn't the scariest thing.

216
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,310
The scariest is knowing

217
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,550
what hope feels like.

218
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,270
Xiao saw hope.

219
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,790
And for her, that hope was Wei.

220
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,030
But when she was at her weakest,

221
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:51,670
he destroyed

222
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,460
that hope.

223
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,700
He destroyed it!

224
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,100
But Lei Wei didn't know

225
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,670
Liu Ang was blackmailing her.

226
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:04,940
Then why did he break up with her?

227
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,270
Why did he leave her
at that exact moment?

228
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,670
Why couldn't he believe her,

229
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:14,390
the woman he was going to marry?

230
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,190
He was the one who let go

231
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:19,510
when he was the last thing
Xiao was holding on to.

232
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,510
He wasn't innocent.

233
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,350
He wasn't worth pitying.

234
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,980
All I did was use a piece of tape

235
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,850
to transfer his fingerprints
from his glass

236
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,790
onto the knife.

237
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:31,630
I didn't expect

238
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,060
you'd trace it back to him.

239
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:37,700
Do you regret it?

240
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,580
Regret?

241
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,910
The only thing I regret

242
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,980
is letting that scumbag, Liu Ang,

243
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,310
die too easily!

244
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,830
Then let me tell you something.

245
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:53,990
When our forensic team

246
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,940
was examining Liu Ang's body,

247
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,990
they discovered that he had late-stage

248
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,260
liver cancer.

249
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:00,350
And you

250
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,300
gave him a painless death.

251
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,070
What?

252
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:08,740
He had cancer?

253
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:11,390
No...

254
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:13,940
Impossible!

255
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,300
You're lying!

256
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,460
I don't regret it.

257
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,350
I don't regret it!

258
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:30,740
No, I don't!

259
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,830
Xiao suffered

260
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,630
too much in her life.

261
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:47,540
I wanted to give her a good future.

262
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,460
I worked so hard in the city

263
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,870
for over twenty years

264
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,630
and finally made something of myself.

265
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,830
I thought

266
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,190
if I had money,

267
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,110
my daughter would finally accept me,

268
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:08,020
and we could have a good life together.

269
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,430
But Xiao...

270
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,590
My daughter

271
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,870
is never coming back!

272
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,590
Between 3 and 4 AM

273
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,940
yesterday,

274
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:36,500
where were you

275
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,760
and what were you doing?

276
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,870
I already told you

277
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:42,940
that I was sleeping.

278
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:43,940
Sleeping?

279
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,740
Then explain how did you

280
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,020
suddenly showed up here.

281
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,980
Here's a hint.

282
00:17:59,110 --> 00:17:59,780
This car

283
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,910
was parked at the alley
behind the bar last night.

284
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,150
(Inside the suitcase)

285
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,500
(was Tang Xinxin's body.)

286
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,700
(You were planning to dump it)

287
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,870
(somewhere far away.)

288
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,430
(But you crashed into the car.)

289
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,350
(The suitcase was broken too.)

290
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,940
(So you had no choice)

291
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,190
(but to dump the body)

292
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,350
(near the trash bins and run.)

293
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,260
Is throwing out some trash at night

294
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,430
a crime?

295
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,150
Xu Dongyang,

296
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,780
we wouldn't be arresting you

297
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,910
without solid evidence.

298
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,390
If you refuse to confess,

299
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,540
you're only making things worse
for yourself.

300
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,350
The person who can help you now

301
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:56,780
is yourself.

302
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,590
We also found a sofa.

303
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:33,260
Its style, color, and size match

304
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,350
the ones from your living room.

305
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,540
Under one of the cushions,

306
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,190
we found your hair

307
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,500
and half of Tang Xinxin's fingernail.

308
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:44,910
How do you explain?

309
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,780
The sofa got dirty.

310
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:57,850
So I threw it out.

311
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,260
If someone else killed her on it,

312
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,190
that's not my problem, right?

313
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,980
Tang Xinxin and I fought before.

314
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,700
Maybe

315
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,910
she lost the nail back then.

316
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:09,830
That's possible, right?

317
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:11,430
You have

318
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:13,260
severe OCD
and a major cleanliness obsession.

319
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,540
There's no way
you'd keep something in your house

320
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,460
if someone died on it.

321
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,300
So you got rid of it

322
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,110
as fast as you could.

323
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,590
But what you didn't expect

324
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,910
was that Tang Xinxin left behind

325
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,460
something very important.

326
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,110
Why make me take
the clothes home today?

327
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:40,500
I have a date.

328
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,460
Why make me take
the clothes home today?

329
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:49,670
I have a date.

330
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,830
Who are you drinking with?

331
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:03,150
Found yourself a new guy already?

332
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:04,910
Answer me.

333
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,740
Did you take the money

334
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,670
I left for my dad?

335
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:10,740
You were the one

336
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,950
who promised me two million yuan
for emotional damages.

337
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:13,700
Where's the money?

338
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:14,780
I want my money.

339
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:16,870
I only took 500,000 yuan.

340
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:18,260
You still owe me 1.5 million yuan.

341
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,590
That was the money I set aside
for my dad's retirement!

342
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:21,870
Tang Xinxin,

343
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:24,630
you must not cross the line.

344
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:27,700
I found out you were married before
and had a kid.

345
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,740
You were trying
to scam me into marriage.

346
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,070
You lied to me,

347
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,980
saying you were single, unmarried,
and even pretended to be a virgin.

348
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,700
You should be the one paying me!

349
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,870
So what if I was married and had a kid?

350
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,630
Have you looked in the mirror?

351
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:41,150
With so many handsome guys out there,

352
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:42,700
you think I would pick you?

353
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,500
You're pathetic!

354
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,980
I bought you plenty of things, didn't I?

355
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:48,630
You are so greedy.

356
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,070
I deserve those things.

357
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:51,500
I don't care.

358
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,070
You still owe me 1.5 million.

359
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,780
If you don't pay up,

360
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,870
I'll report you for tax evasion

361
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,150
and embezzlement.

362
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,540
If it weren't for you forcing me
to buy luxury goods

363
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,350
and a villa,

364
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,990
I wouldn't have had to do any of that!

365
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,350
You were the one who did those things.

366
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,540
Don't drag me into it.

367
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,350
If I had known you were so useless,

368
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,430
I would not have wasted

369
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,670
so much time on you.

370
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:13,150
You're short and have no looks.

371
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:14,740
You even want to be an entrepreneur

372
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,400
and drag me down with your misfortunes?

373
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,700
Do you have to be so heartless?

374
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,870
I don't care.

375
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:20,780
You have one week

376
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,460
to transfer another 500,000 yuan.

377
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,910
If the money is not in my account,

378
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,260
I'll expose your deeds online!

379
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,070
What's wrong with you?

380
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,460
What are you doing?

381
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,190
Let me go, Xu Dongyang!

382
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,460
Get off me!

383
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,500
Help! Help!

384
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,350
You want money, huh?

385
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,630
Here's your money!

386
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:07,260
You wretched woman,

387
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,300
you can die with it!

388
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,670
You want money, huh?

389
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:14,870
Here's your money!

390
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:16,630
You wretched woman,

391
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:18,590
you can die with it!

392
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:35,630
You have no idea

393
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,300
how greedy

394
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:39,940
Tang Xinxin was.

395
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:43,430
You don't know

396
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:44,830
how hard I worked

397
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:45,870
to build "She, He, and It".

398
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,260
"She, He, and It"

399
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,020
had drained my creativity.

400
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,670
And Tang Xinxin

401
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,390
stole everything
that I've accomplished from me!

402
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:01,940
I only wanted

403
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,020
to get rid

404
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:05,670
of that filthy sofa

405
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,700
as soon as possible

406
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,190
and punish

407
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:12,740
that woman

408
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,630
in my own way.

409
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,590
(I grew up poor.)

410
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,740
(I worked hard to get into university.)

411
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:23,550
(I worked part-time jobs
to pay my way through university.)

412
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,550
(I even gave up my spot
for postgraduate studies)

413
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,260
(to start making money faster.)

414
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,670
(No company wanted to hire me.)

415
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,170
(I had to deliver packages
during the day)

416
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,190
(and code at night.)

417
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,260
(I created over a dozen mini-programs)

418
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:40,490
(but none of them took off.)

419
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:43,350
(It wasn't until I launched
"She, He, and It".)

420
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:44,830
(Do you know)

421
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,430
(how much effort it took)

422
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,780
(to go from 100 downloads to a million?)

423
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,350
(Fixing bugs)

424
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,870
(and dealing with massive amounts
of data every day.)

425
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:54,870
(Back-end Monitoring Data)

426
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:57,500
(Then investors finally
started noticing me.)

427
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:00,590
(I thought my big break had come.)

428
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:01,940
(That was)

429
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,630
(when I met her.)

430
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,740
I never cared about looks

431
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,870
or family background.

432
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:09,220
I only want to find an honest
and reliable man

433
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:09,950
who treat me well,

434
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:11,070
listen to me,

435
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:13,110
and truly want to get married.

436
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,780
I promise I'll be good to you.

437
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,120
I'll listen to you no matter what.

438
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,390
I think men should have dreams too.

439
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,590
You don't have to sacrifice anything
for me.

440
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,870
I want to be the woman
behind your success.

441
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:23,700
You're so nice.

442
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,940
(I didn't have any experience
in dating.)

443
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,630
(She was my first love.)

444
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,940
(I did everything she asked.)

445
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,070
Is this dress pretty?

446
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:33,980
(I gave her everything)

447
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:34,740
(she wanted.)

448
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,350
It looks great.

449
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,260
(But then)

450
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:36,870
It's pretty.

451
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,590
(her demands kept growing)

452
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:39,830
(and were more costly.)

453
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,690
(When I couldn't afford them,)

454
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,630
(she started making a fuss.)

455
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,380
(Collateral Loan Agreement)

456
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,360
(Mr. Xue)

457
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,960
(Robbery Suspect Hunt Leads
to Underground Bank)
