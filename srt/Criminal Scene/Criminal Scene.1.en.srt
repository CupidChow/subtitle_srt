Come on.

54
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,500
Any compensation needed,
ask for Gu Zhen

55

(Interrogation Room)

57
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,720
During your time on the run,

58
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,279
you lived like a rat on the streets,

59
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,399
constantly in fear.

60
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:38,600
Even at night,

61
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,199
you had to hide in corners.

62
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,680
You couldn't even breathe freely.

63
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,160
You couldn't make friends.

64
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,959
You couldn't go home.

65
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,680
You couldn't even walk

66
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:51,360
with your head held high.

67
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,439
I've said a lot on your behalf.

68
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,160
Say something for yourself?

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,839
During the five years evading the law,

70
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,610
(Huaizhou Criminal Investigation Division Officer)
you escaped punishment

71
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,760
(Criminal Psychology Expert, Kong Rubai)
and gained freedom.

72
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,120
But is this

73
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,040
the freedom you want?

74
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,800
Is this the freedom you want?

75
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,560
You escaped punishment,

76
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,800
but is this

77
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,240
the freedom you want?

78
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,839
I... I've been on the run for five years.

79
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,319
I...

80
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,240
I'm so tired of it all.

81
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,120
Officer.

82
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:41,920
Captain Gu,

83
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,839
I heard from Chief Shen

84
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:45,040
this is the psychology expert

85
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,519
who is going to be transferred here.

86
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,199
Kong Rubai.

87
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,920
No wonder
he got a master's in psychology.

88
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,879
Talented and good-looking.

89
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,639
I'm free,

90
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:01,000
but I'm lonely.

91
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,040
I...

92
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:03,000
I...

93
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:05,640
(Yu Yue, Huaizhou Criminal)
I just want to go home

94
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,440
(Investigation Division Officer)
and have my mom's beef noodles.

(Huaizhou Public Security Bureau)

96
00:06:13,112 --> 00:06:14,740
(Criminal Investigation Division)

97
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:22,319
Captain Gu is incredible!

98
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,600
He caught the one
on the run for five years.

99
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,120
Captain Gu,

100
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,160
with his clairvoyance,

101
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:31,199
he saw through layers of deception,

102
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,079
found the clues,

103
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:35,160
and set up a flawless trap.

104
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,439
He waited patiently

105
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,879
and caught the suspect.

106
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,000
Shut up.

107
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,959
That flattery was over the top.

108
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:43,879
Clairvoyance?

109
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:45,160
Is him Monkey King?

110
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,839
Don't be a wet blanket!

111
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:47,680
I can do what I want.

112
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,399
Captain Gu is sharp-minded.

113
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:51,600
Hear that?

114
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,879
Yu knows me best.

115
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,600
But no good stamina.

116
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,240
No one mention that.

117
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,040
Listen.

118
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,680
The only reason that punk

119
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:01,759
lasted so long

120
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,120
was because I hadn't eaten.

121
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,439
He wouldn't have had a chance otherwise!

122
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,800
Rubai,

123
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,839
our police force

125
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:14,399
Just let me know
if there's anything you need.

126
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,639
I'll support you in any way.

127
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,240
This way.

133
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:37,639
He reports for duty today.

134
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,600
Gu Zhen,

135
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,800
get him settled in.

136
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:40,519
Yes, sir.

137
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,519
A warm welcome.

138
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,279

139
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,509
show our new colleague around.

140
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,320
I know my way around.

141
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:58,639
You interned here before?

142
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,220
I'm Kong Yingsong's younger brother.

143
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:06,360
Why? Why are you still standing here?

144
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,319
Answer me!

145

Welcome.

148
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:18,160
Welcome.

150
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:28,480
It's 12 PM, Wednesday.

151
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,199
The target suspect has appeared

152
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,720
at an inappropriate time and location,

153
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,039
participating in an unauthorized gathering.

154
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:37,399
Shall we take action?

155
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:38,440
We must.

156
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,919
Su Qian, you're still working

157
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,120
when you're on break.

158
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,879
That's commendable.

159
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,240
But

160
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,080
I have to make this arrest myself.

161
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,000
Yu...

162
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,540
Don't worry!

163
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,650
I'll take care of our new member.

164
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,000
Kong,

165
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,279
these are our latest cases.

166
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,080
Have a check.

167
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,600
Feel free to ask me.

168
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,279
Anything at all.

169
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,039
All right.

170
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,720
You're done here. Go on.

171
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,060
There's a seat over there.

172
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:13,919
You can sit there.

173
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,159
Go on.

174
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:28,240

you're the coolest in the world!

Let's have

180
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:44,279
a talk?

181
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,080
Take a seat.

182
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,080
Given that the suspect's crime is minor,

183
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,919
a verbal warning will do, Captain Gu.

184
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,000
Don't resort to force.

185
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:56,600
Minor?

186
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,240
She's already been disciplined twice!

187
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,320
One more time, and she's getting fired!

188

Where's that silly?

192
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,600
We love you!

193
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,240
Meng Zisu,
you're the coolest in the world!

194
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,320
The coolest!

195
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,639
Meng Zisu, we love you!

196
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:36,039
It's late. Why are you still here?

197
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,840
Nowhere to go.

198
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,159
I remember you...

199
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:42,159
I just transferred here.

200
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:43,120
My house is still

201
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,780
under renovation.

202
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,919
Besides,

203
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,480
I'm used to living alone.

204
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,639
It doesn't matter.

205
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,679
I don't really know this place.

206
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,399
Feels wrong to trouble others.

207
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,960
If you need anything, just ask.

208
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,320
Come in.

209
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:57,679
I got this place for

210
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:59,480
when I planned to get married.

211
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,679
This is my room.

212
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:01,840
That room over there is empty.

213
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,480
It's yours now.

214
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:18,639
Zisu!

215
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,720
Zisu, get up!

216
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,759
You're going to be late.

217
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:26,440
The director
was already upset yesterday.

218
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:32,399
Zisu!

219
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,440
Zisu,

220
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:38,799
if you don't open the door,

221
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:39,879
I'm calling the staff.

222
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,000
I heard you!

223
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:07,080
I didn't expect this to happen.

224
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:08,840
I just wanted to make some money.

225
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,440
Cancel today's schedule.

226
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,800
- I have
- Did you

227
00:12:11,801 --> 00:12:12,639
- no...
- hear anything

228
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,279
- Cut his scenes? No way!
- last night?

229
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:15,360
- He'll kill me!
- No.

230
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:29,960
Captain Gu.

231
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:50,519
Su Qian.

232
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,039
Any discovery?

233
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,279
No visible external injuries.

234
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:55,440
There's vomit in the mouth.

235
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,320
Initial assessment
suggests asphyxiation.

236
00:12:57,879 --> 00:12:59,000
The exact cause of death

237
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,720
will need an autopsy.

238
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,320
How many people were there?

239
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,080
Before the manager entered,

240
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,799
only Meng Zisu and the deceased

241
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:06,799
were inside.

242
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:07,840
Did the victim

243
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,200
have a phone or ID on them?

244
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,679
Only this uniform

245
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:13,240
and an employee room card.

246
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,240
No other items

247
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,639
to confirm her identity.

248
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,919
She's dressed up nicely.

249
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,759
A cleaner wouldn't normally do that.

250
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,880
She's wearing high heels.

251
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,780
Check where the room card came from.

252
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,440
Yes, sir.

253
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,000
Captain Gu, please come over.

254
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,240
The victim's room card

255
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,799
belonged to the cleaner, Madam Zheng.

256
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,960
She confessed.

257
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,360
The deceased

258
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,600
was a fan of Meng Zisu.

259
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:36,799
She paid

260
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:38,240
Madam Zheng 2,000 yuan

261
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,159
for a cleaner's uniform

262
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:41,120
and a staff room card

263
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,200
to get her idol's personal belongings

264
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,639
as souvenirs.

265
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,240
But Madam Zheng doesn't know

266
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,159
when she entered here.

267
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:49,960
And the camera?

268
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,080
Meng Zisu requested

269
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,519
that no cameras

270
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,720
be placed

271
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,279
near his room.

272
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,440
Then check the entry

273
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:59,720
and exit records
for the floor from last night.

274
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:00,799
One by one.

275
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:01,360
Yes, sir.

276
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,120
Did you take photos?

277
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:03,720
Yes.

278
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:04,919
Captain Gu,

279
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,120
take a look at this.

280
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:08,080
Anything wrong?

281
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,840
This looks like a hidden camera.

282
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,279
It stays powered
and records continuously.

283
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,120
Memory card?

284
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,820
It's a wireless direct-connection model.

285
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,200
No memory card.

286
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,240
Typically,

287
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,550
the receiver wouldn't be far away.

288
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,879
It's likely in one of the rooms

289
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:25,799
in this hotel.

290
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,799
If we find the one who planted it

291
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,120
and retrieve the footage,

292
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,080
we should know

293
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,120
what happened that night.

294
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,639
Check all the surrounding hotel guests

295
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:35,159
right now.

296
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:36,759
Got it.

297
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:37,320
Go.

298
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,540
(For The People)

299
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,860
(Interrogation Room)

300
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,799
This is a job

301
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,120
for the expert.

302
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:08,799
He's yours.

303
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:14,639
Do you recognize her?

304
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,159
I only saw a hand.

305
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:18,159
Didn't even see the face.

306
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,279
How could I know her?

307
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,039
Take a look.

308
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:25,840
You might recognize her.

309
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,399
I'm not looking.

310
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:31,679
The thought of a corpse below my bed

311
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:32,320
makes me sick.

312
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:36,080
Based on hotel surveillance,

313
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,840
the victim snuck onto your floor

314
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,600
around 10 PM last night.

315
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,679
She never left after that.

316
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,240
From last night

317
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,879
until the body was discovered,

318
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:46,039
where were you,

319
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:47,380
with whom, and what were you doing?

320
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,440
Everything in detail.

321
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,039
Don't leave anything out.

322
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:55,639
Let me think.

323
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,799
I was filming all day.

324
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:01,600
The whole crew can confirm that.

325
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,519
We wrapped up around 7 or 8 PM.

326
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,360
Then I went back to the hotel to change

327
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,840
and went out
to get some food with the crew.

328
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,600
15.

329
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:12,919
Drink up!

330
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,159
Zisu!

331
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:15,080
Take it easy.

332
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,559
The director

333
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,879
was too harsh on Zisu today.

334
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,519
So what if he was a little late?

335
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,519
Scolding him
in front of everyone like that.

336
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:23,440
Who does he think he is?

337
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,840
If it weren't for Zisu,

338
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,080
that nobody director

339
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,279
wouldn't even get investment.

340
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,399
That's right.

341
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,759
Zisu is classy.

342
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:33,759
Let it go.

343
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,039
If it were me,

344
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,120
I'd have walked off set.

345
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,360
Screw it!

346
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,360
I'm telling you,

347
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,039
a big shot like me...

348
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,879
If it weren't for Producer Fu,

349
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:48,279
a big shot like me

350
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:49,440
wouldn't even bother with this

351
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,879
lousy production.

352
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,240
Zisu!

353
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,240
Mind your words.

354
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:54,960
All right.

355
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,639
Enough.

356
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:56,159
Let's drink.

357
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:56,879
Drink up!

358
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,720
Be careful.

359
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,759
We finished quite late.

360
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:00,879
It was around

361
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,240
2 or 3 AM.

362
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,200
I was wasted.

363
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,319
They sent me back.

364
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,839
My manager, Kelly, opened the door.

365
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,960
Thanks, guys.

366
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,200
Get some rest.

367
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:11,390
I'll take care of him.

368
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:15,799
Zisu,

369
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,680
you have an early morning tomorrow.

370
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,839
But you drank so much.

371
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:19,839
If you're late again,

372
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,400
the producer will be furious.

373
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,640
Got it.

374
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,079
Got it.

375
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,599
Lift your hips.

376
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:32,079
Put this on.

377
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,440
Go away! I want to sleep.

378
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,039
Thanks.

379
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:54,720
Ms. Kelly,

380
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:57,000
don't be nervous. Relax.

381
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,599
We just need your cooperation
for the investigation.

382
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,359
Please tell us

383
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,640
what happened that night.

384
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,960
I took Zisu back to his room

385
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,240
at around 3 AM.

386
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,319
I... I was really tired.

387
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:14,480
I didn't pay attention
to whether someone else

388
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,720
was hiding in the room.

389
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,440
I just wanted to go back to sleep.

390
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,680
It was my oversight.

391
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,119
Did anything in the room seem disturbed?

392
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:26,519
Disturbed?

393
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,039
He doesn't like
people touching his things.

394
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,680
I'm not really sure.

395
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:35,000
Did Meng Zisu come looking for you
that night?

396
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:35,880
No.

397
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:37,680
I slept until the next morning

398
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,720
when I went to wake him up.

399
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,799
I was worried the director

400
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:44,680
would replace me,

401
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,359
so I couldn't really sleep well

402
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,240
the entire night.

403
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:51,799
Eventually, I got up to get some water.

404
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,759
Half-asleep,

405
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:54,960
I saw a glass on the table.

406
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,240
I picked it up and drank from it.

407
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,680
It was the red wine
Kelly had poured for me.

408
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,240
After that, I felt really drowsy

409
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,279
and slept until this morning.

410
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,480
Red wine?

411
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,400
I never poured him any red wine.

412
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,400
Didn't he pour it himself?

413
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,920
Among all the suspects,

414
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:21,319
he is definitely the most handsome.

415
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,221
(Case of Lin Xiaojing)

416
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,119
You all know

417
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,920
that cases involving public figures

418
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,920
always attract a lot of media attention.

419
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,640
Chief Shen has emphasized

420
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,799
that this investigation

421
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:39,440
must be kept strictly confidential

422
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:41,480
to avoid public interference.

423
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:44,200
We need to work quickly.

424
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,039
(Case of Lin Xiaojing)

425
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,039
Uncovering the truth
and reporting the findings

426
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,039
to prevent media speculation.

427
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:49,599
Captain Gu.

428
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,400
After cross-examining
all relevant personnel,

429
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,559
we can confirm that Meng Zisu

430
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,720
went out for a meal after filming.

431
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,759
He returned to the hotel around 3 AM

432
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,200
and never left again.

433
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,039
Although hotel surveillance

434
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:04,000
did not capture the entrance
to Meng Zisu's suite,

435
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,880
the lobby and elevator footage

436
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,839
confirm that the victim,

437
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:09,599
disguised as a cleaner,

438
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,160
used an employee's room card

439
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,960
to enter the floor

440
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,160
at around 10 PM that night.

441
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,519
She was never seen leaving.

442
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,039
Qin,

443
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,240
how about the other guests?

444
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:21,960
I checked.

445
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:23,079
Most of them

446
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:24,960
on that floor were crew members.

447
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,039
They sharing rooms in pairs

448
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:27,050
and vouch for each other.

449
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:29,000
Hotel surveillance also confirms

450
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,060
their comings and goings.

451
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,160
However, there is one exception.

452
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,240
The room opposite Meng Zisu's suite

453
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,640
was booked before the film crew arrived.

454
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:38,880
I looked into it.

455
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,440
The guest that night was a student

456
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,839
from a local university.

457
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,480
Checked out noon next day.

458
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:45,000
I've arranged with the school

459
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,440
to investigate tomorrow.

460
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:47,640
Right.

461
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,160
Dr. Su didn't find

462
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,759
any new clues either.

463
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:53,400
So from here on,

464
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:55,200
our focus is on

465
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:57,720
determining the motive.

466
00:20:58,039 --> 00:20:58,839
Tomorrow,

467
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:00,559
we'll split into two teams.

468
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,519
Qin and Yu Yue,

469
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:02,279
you two investigate

470
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:03,359
the university student.

471
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:04,359
Kong Rubai,

472
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,599
you'll with me.

473
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,240
Hello?

474
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,200
Anna.

475
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,559
Tomorrow, we'll set up a huge

476
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,960
support display
to show Zisu we're cheering him on!

477
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,359
He's at his lowest right now.

478
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:22,799
We have to show up for him!

479
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,039
What's worse, not supporting him

480
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,519
or getting beaten up?

481
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:31,990
If you don't come, you're a traitor!

482
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,279
Screw you! Do you know how to drive?

483
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,440
Hit and run

484
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,160
plus throwing things?

485
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,960
What was the license plate number?

486
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,240
Pick up, Gu Zhen!

487
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:19,680
Xiaotang.

488
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,640
Gu Zhen!

489
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,079
Save me!

490
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,839
Help me!

491
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,500
(Yin Qing)
