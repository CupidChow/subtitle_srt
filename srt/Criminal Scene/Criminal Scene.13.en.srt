00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:36,260
=Episode 13=

3
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,340
Do you recognize him?

4
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:40,830
No.

5
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,060
This is Jiang Peng.

6
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,140
He used to work at your quarry.

7
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:48,700
I have a lot of workers.

8
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:50,420
I can't remember everyone.

9
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,110
We've met before at the hospital.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,500
Your parents were victims too, right?

11
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,190
Yeah, my parents were just unlucky.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,030
They ran into a mad person

13
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,380
and suffered for it.

14
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,710
It wasn't bad luck.

15
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,750
The man with the gasoline can
was after them.

16
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,780
That's impossible.

17
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:14,990
All my life,

18
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,220
I've never seen
my parents offend anyone.

19
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:18,340
They didn't.

20
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,270
But you did.

21
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,990
Jiang Peng worked at your quarry.

22
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,600
You kept his ID as collateral.

23
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:26,500
Do you remember?

24
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,660
Your quarry had a collapse,

25
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,990
which led to Jiang Peng
becoming infertile.

26
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,660
He demanded 500,000 yuan
in compensation.

27
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,270
But you only offered 50,000 yuan.

28
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,430
When the negotiation failed,

29
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,100
he brought his friend, Fu Qiyong,

30
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,780
to confront you.

31
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,660
But instead of paying,

32
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,150
you had them beaten up.

33
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,310
Is that true?

34
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:51,870
They came seven or eight times!

35
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,430
I've paid out 700,000
to 800,000 yuan!

36
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,470
How was that not enough?

37
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:55,550
That's more than Jiang Peng

38
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,780
would've made in ten years!

39
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,500
How greedy they are.

40
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:01,660
I figured

41
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,270
they were just scammers

42
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,310
trying to squeeze more money out of me.

43
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,750
Even if I had the money,

44
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,590
I can't afford to let them bleed me dry.

45
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:09,990
So I sent some guys

46
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,430
to teach them a lesson.

47
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,060
You want money?

48
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,620
Huh?

49
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,100
Money?

50
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,340
Take this for a change!

51
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:20,870
Enough!

52
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,780
Money, huh?

53
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,620
Why still beating them?

54
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,500
Gosh, you guys are rough.

55
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,870
What are you guys doing?

56
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,660
It hurts, huh?

57
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,620
Listen up, you two pieces of trash.

58
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,270
Haven't you learned your lesson yet?

59
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,340
Messing with me?

60
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,900
Let me make this clear.

61
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,150
From now on,

62
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,150
you're not getting another cent from me.

63
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,590
Now get lost.

64
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,820
Don't ever let me see you again.

65
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,500
Here you go.

66
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,750
Take this.

67
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,270
Go ahead, use it.

68
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,470
Okay.

69
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,620
One for you too.

70
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,310
Do you think it still works?

71
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,500
Big size.

72
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,060
Yeah.

73
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,940
Can he still use it?

74
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,260
- You think?
- Can he?

75
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,910
Their medical records show

76
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,500
they were badly injured.

77
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,060
After that incident,

78
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,460
they set their sights on your family,

79
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,430
waiting to get revenge.

80
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,380
But with so many people around you,

81
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,400
they couldn't make a move.

82
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,310
So they targeted your parents.

83
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:33,060
Jiang Peng lost his ability

84
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,260
to have kids because of that accident.

85
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,310
Fu Qiyong

86
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,060
was drowning in debt.

87
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:41,260
After tracking
your parents' travel schedule,

88
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,670
they got on the bus with the gasoline.

89
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,420
They planned to hijack it
and make the driver

90
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:47,820
drive to the chemical plant,

91
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,140
killing everyone on board,

92
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,120
including your parents.

93
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,230
If it weren't for a woman
who risked her life to stop them,

94
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,360
the rest wouldn't have survived.

95
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,620
They could have come at me!

96
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,380
We've confirmed

97
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,550
your involvement in intentional assault.

98
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,310
Please come with us.

99
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:18,700
(Jiang Peng)

100
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,060
(Bus route map)

101
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,500
When these two went
to Bai Zhigang for compensation,

102
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,140
they must have been humiliated.

103
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,800
But what about the other passengers?

104
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,260
What do they have to do with this?

105
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,230
Yeah.

106
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,990
Most of them survived.

107
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,620
But many suffered severe burns.

108
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:53,990
Some are even disfigured for life.

109
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,190
Do you remember that little boy,

110
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:01,990
Qu Nianyuan?

111
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,190
He had just started elementary school.

112
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:05,910
As he grows up,

113
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,210
he'll have to undergo skin graft
surgeries every year.

114
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:12,460
And the others?

115
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,110
They'll never be able
to live a normal life.

116
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,460
All the possibilities of their futures

117
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,460
were destroyed

118
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,870
by two selfish, cowardly,

119
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:23,940
and despicable men!

120
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,500
And Hui Yingzi?

121
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,460
She loved her boyfriend so much.

122
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,310
But she died at his hands.

123
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:42,820
She sacrificed herself

124
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:44,790
to save everyone else.

125
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,060
Who will ever know

126
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,450
what she felt in that moment?

127
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:58,110
(What Jiang Peng and Fu Qiyong
did was monstrous.)

128
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,760
(But Bai Zhigang played a huge role
in pushing them to that point.)

129
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,230
(He claimed)

130
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,580
(he paid Jiang Peng 800,000 yuan.)

131
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,970
(But in reality,
he didn't give him a single cent.)

132
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,990
(Instead, he repeatedly beat
and humiliated him.)

133
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,380
(But none of that justified
their crimes.)

134
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,790
(When your rights are violated,)

135
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,060
(you should use the law
to fight for justice,)

136
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,350
- (not resort to violence.)
- Have you eaten?

137
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,650
- (Let alone hurting innocent people.)
- See what I brought for you.

138
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,430
I was thinking

139
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,460
that when you got discharged,

140
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,000
we should have a big procession.

141
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,430
But you know

142
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,990
I'm broke.

143
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,060
So I'll have to make do with
what I have.

144
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:19,990
You know nothing.

145
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,750
This ride has a full panoramic sunroof.

146
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,350
A perfect 360-degree view.

147
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,620
Great for enjoying the ride.

148
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,430
I didn't expect you to get so many gifts

149
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,540
from your classmates
while you were in the hospital.

150
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,980
You really are popular.

151
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,580
Of course! I'm pretty and lovable.

152
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,790
Stop flattering yourself.

153
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:54,670
Excuse me.

154
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,940
Would you like a balloon?

155
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,270
It's completely safe with helium.

156
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,190
It's 25 yuan each.

157
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,550
No wonder I always see you around.

158
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,580
I always see you with so many balloons.

159
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,790
I guess you sell balloons.

160
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,460
I sell them on weekends

161
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,190
to make some extra cash.

162
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,700
My name is Yuan Yu.

163
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:12,940
I study at Huaizhou University.

164
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:13,910
I'm Wu Zichu

165
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:14,920
from the same university.

166
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,150
I can feel the romance in the air.

167
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,310
Geezer Gu,

168
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:35,630
I want some buns.

169
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,980
(Jiang Xiaotang's Home)

170
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,150
Ah, home sweet home.

171
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:55,910
Xiaotang,

172
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,740
I have work later.

173
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,740
I need to head back.

174
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,550
Okay, I know how busy you are.

175
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,340
Go ahead.

176
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,460
The buns are cold.

177
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,630
Remember to warm them up.

178
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,190
Such a cute doll.

179
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,980
Anna knows me so well.

180
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,510
Bai Zhigang,

181
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,150
you've been involved
in multiple violent incidents

182
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,530
over business disputes and turf wars.

183
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,980
What do you have to say for yourself?

184
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,220
I admit

185
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:56,700
to the assaults.

186
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:00,060
But I just can't stand
being taken advantage of.

187
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,860
I want to report a crime.

188
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:04,860
Go ahead.

189
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:06,940
I

190
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,340
got scammed.

191
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,270
Be specific.

192
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,310
Who scammed you?

193
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,310
Xue.

194
00:10:15,003 --> 00:10:16,778
That piece of dung!

195
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:19,310
His name is Xue Cheng.

196
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:28,900
(Mr. Xue. Xue Cheng)

197
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,550
This case

198
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,580
is much bigger
than just financial fraud.

199
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:39,670
Qin,

200
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,820
send all information on Xue Cheng

201
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,190
to the financial crimes unit.

202
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,910
Also, dig into

203
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,460
everyone connected to Xue Cheng

204
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,630
Okay, I'm on it.

205
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,430
Captain Gu,

206
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,340
the old lady who got crushed

207
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,400
and broke both of her legs,

208
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,390
guess who that is.

209
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,220
Who?

210
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,550
Feng Chao's mother.

211
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,340
After her son's death,

212
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,320
she kept telling everyone

213
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,030
the police were responsible for it.

214
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,910
Was her injury an accident?

215
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,510
On the surface, yes.

216
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,190
She piled the scraps so high

217
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,430
that it collapsed on her.

218
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,630
She lived alone.

219
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,680
No one was there to help.

220
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,790
Being old and frail,

221
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,700
she has no strength

222
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,580
to get herself out.

223
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,310
After breaking her legs,
she was alone in the house

224
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,510
and passed out multiple times.

225
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,220
She also had poor hearing and eyesight.

226
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,940
She didn't even know if anyone went in.

227
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,670
The police did find

228
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,860
a man's footprint inside

229
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,550
(Case Registration Form)
and a piece of burnt paper.

230
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,460
She was clutching

231
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,820
a few coins in her hand,
refusing to let go.

232
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:34,910
She said her son came back

233
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,310
to bring her money.

234
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,060
Money?

235
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:57,940
Chao,

236
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,430
did you send me money?

237
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,940
You're such a good boy.

238
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,510
Chao,

239
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,100
you're a good boy.

240
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,340
Help me.

241
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,100
Help me.

242
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:15,820
Son...

243
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,580
My son...

244
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,550
Son...

245
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:29,140
(Case Registration Form)

246
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,510
That footprint

247
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,390
could belong

248
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,190
to a scrap collector or the one

249
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,940
who pushed the pile over.

250
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,630
This evidence is not solid enough.

251
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,460
Team Two was in charge
of the Yin Qing case.

252
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,740
Chief Shen wants them
to take this one too.

253
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,820
They've already started investigating

254
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,630
people connected to Feng Chao's

255
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,220
mother.

256
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,100
If someone is targeting Feng Chao,

257
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:03,430
then anyone linked to him

258
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,190
is in danger.

259
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,030
If your guess is right,

260
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,890
then this person is extremely dangerous.

261
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,940
We need to find them fast.

262
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,940
Whoever attacked Yin Qing
and Feng Chao's mother

263
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,630
is most likely

264
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,820
a victim of the Feng Chao case.

265
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,220
Hello?

266
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:32,680
Brother-in-law,

267
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,940
Bai Zhigang was arrested.

268
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,580
So we don't have
to pay him back, right?

269
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,290
The police really did me a favor
this time

270
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,980
and got revenge for me too.

271
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:43,550
Don't be so naive.

272
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,630
What if Bai Zhigang rats you out?

273
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,940
He wouldn't, right?

274
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,660
That'll only add more charges
to his case.

275
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,550
If he cooperates,

276
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,910
he could get a reduced sentence.

277
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:56,310
Then what do we do?

278
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:57,700
We should

279
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,630
leave the country now.

280
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,220
(Lu Qingming)

281
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,310
Everything is ready.

282
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,030
Get the gallery's goods

283
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,580
out as soon as possible.

284
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,060
Same plan as always.

285
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,670
You'll hold an auction

286
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,050
and I use the money
from the underground bank to buy them.

287
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,790
Once we launder it,
we'll transfer it overseas.

288
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,190
Leave after this last deal.

289
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:32,980
Leave the country.

290
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,390
What about you?

291
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,320
I have unfinished business.

292
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,460
So I can't leave yet.

293
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,820
Mr. Wang, I bought a cake!

294
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,310
Let's go and watch a movie later.

295
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,860
Oh, you have a guest?

296
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,310
Wow,

297
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:53,980
your female student

298
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,390
is visiting you at this late hour.

299
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:58,550
These flowers,

300
00:15:59,100 --> 00:15:59,830
this cake,

301
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,020
and a movie?

302
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:03,540
You're

303
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,700
living quite well.

304
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,190
She's only my student.

305
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:10,500
Brother-in-law,

306
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:11,350
come on.

307
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,590
Mr. Wang,

308
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,830
my sister has been gone for years.

309
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,500
It's normal

310
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:18,350
to move on.

311
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,110
We're both men.

312
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,460
So I understand.

313
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,260
Don't get us wrong.

314
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,780
There's nothing between us.

315
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,590
None of your business!

316
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,190
You're not staying

317
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,110
because of work.

318
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,480
It's because of someone, isn't it?

319
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,220
Xue Cheng,

320
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,220
do what you need to do,

321
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:43,590
and say what you need to say.

322
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,630
Know your place.

323
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:52,940
Fine.

324
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,430
You win.

325
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:55,500
I'm done with this!

326
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,300
Are you okay?

327
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:06,830
Mr. Wang,

328
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,670
did I get you in trouble again?

329
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,540
No.

330
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,630
But I can't go to the movies
with you today.

331
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:17,540
Freeze!

332
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:25,580
(Two hours ago)

333
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,870
I thought we were supposed to look
for the victims of the Feng Chao case?

334
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:32,990
Why are we at a food stall?

335
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,770
He was one of the victims
five years ago.

336
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,000
Mister, I want this one and this one.

337
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,980
He was injured saving one.

338
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,910
All right, a moment.

339
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:45,070
But his girlfriend left him

340
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,910
because of the scars on his face.

341
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:48,190
Stop right there! Stop!

342
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:52,830
Officer Kong.

343
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,260
Sorry to trouble you

344
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,430
over something so small.

345
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,150
Sorry.

346
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:00,630
It's okay.

347
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,390
By the way,

348
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:04,980
I received this a few days ago.

349
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,700
I don't know who sent it.

350
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:08,150
But I figured

351
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,260
it would be safer

352
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:09,980
to give it to you.

353
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,150
I'll take it back for check.

354
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:11,670
Okay.

355
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:12,260
Thanks.

356
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:15,910
You go ahead.

357
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:16,740
We'll be going.

358
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,460
Okay, I'll get back to work.

359
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:19,910
Thanks.

360
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,220
In the past five years,

361
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,740
I've stayed in touch with the victims,

362
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,500
hoping to offer them

363
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,540
some psychological support.

364
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,670
But most of them have
either left Huaizhou

365
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,020
or moved abroad.

366
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,460
Then we lost contact.

367
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,670
After what happened,

368
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,300
who would want to stay here?

369
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,350
This year, the victims

370
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,220
have been receiving small amounts

371
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,910
of money in envelopes
with cut-out words.

372
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:47,870
(Victims should help each other)

373
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,350
This letter

374
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,540
is similar to the threats
Captain Gu received.

375
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,220
The sender claims to be a victim.

376
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,980
But why would they hate Captain Gu?

377
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:04,070
Second Uncle.

378
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:06,630
What?

379
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,980
Your second uncle lives in Zhao Manor?

380
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,430
This place is a famous art village.

381
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,870
A lot of artists live here.

382
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,980
It's precisely
because of these so-called artists

383
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,630
and their peculiar acts

384
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,590
like setting houses on fire
for a fireworks show

385
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,020
and locking people in glass boxes
as part of survival art,

386
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,870
that the villagers called the police
out of worries.

387
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:41,300
Second Uncle probably got scared again.

388
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:47,020
Second Uncle.

389
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,390
What took you so long?

390
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,880
Why didn't you call the police

391
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,020
if it's serious?

392
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,830
All the previous reports
were false alarms,

393
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:58,870
and I got scolded for it.

394
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,260
So I thought of asking my niece

395
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,170
to check it out first.

396
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,350
Come. It's right over there.

397
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,430
Stay low.

398
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:28,540
Freeze!
