3
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:37,620
Second Uncle,

4
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,340
what made you think something was off?

5
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,780
That guy secretly

6
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,500
paid 2,000 yuan to a scrap collector

7
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,780
for a box of something.

8
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,830
Does that sound normal to you?

9
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,590
I was worried
Wang might be up to something.

10
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:51,900
So I came to check it out.

11
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:54,870
Here's 2,000 yuan.

12
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:56,390
Thanks.

13
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,540
It's pretty heavy.

14
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:00,900
Fresh stuff.
The more moisture, the heavier it is.

15
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,710
Oh, my.

16
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,430
What is it? So expensive.

17
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,270
I'm just the delivery guy.

18
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:14,550
I have no idea what's inside.

19
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:15,990
I'm leaving now.

20
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,710
Hey, great artist,

21
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,490
what kind of masterpiece
are you making?

22
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,190
Body art.

23
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,150
You wouldn't get it.

24
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,420
Isn't it just some adult content?

25
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,030
I need to take a look.

26
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,270
Someone has been murdered!

27
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,870
The eyes exist

28
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,150
to see beauty.

29
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,220
But you people

30
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,590
only focus on ugliness.

31
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,550
That's truly pathetic.

32
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,270
Just answer the question.

33
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:33,900
Did you kill someone?

34
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,780
Where did that head come from?

35
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,710
No, no, no.

36
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,820
I bought it legally.

37
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,060
It's just material

38
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,030
for my artwork.

39
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,820
You use a human head for art?

40
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,590
Of course.

41
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,310
The human body is God's masterpiece,

42
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,270
especially the skull.

43
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,030
No sculptor

44
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,310
can ever replicate

45
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,310
the natural beauty of real bone.

46
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,470
Did you pay

47
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,030
Liu Xiangui 2,000 yuan

48
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:07,220
for human body parts for your artwork?

49
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:08,620
That's right.

50
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:13,460
My work explores the relationship
between life and death.

51
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,910
It's a reflection
on the ultimate meaning of existence.

52
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,060
I needed these materials

53
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,190
to express my thoughts.

54
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,460
Did it ever cross your mind

55
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,380
that the head you bought

56
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,870
might be linked to a murder?

57
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,620
So what?

58
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,460
I didn't kill anyone.

59
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,910
Did you hire someone

60
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,230
to kill for you

61
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,910
just to get your hands on a human head?

62
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:36,790
Of course not.

63
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,550
I don't know where Liu Xiangui

64
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,750
got them from,

65
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:42,910
and I don't care.

66
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,310
Even if he killed somebody,

67
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,940
that has nothing to do with me.

68
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,500
I'm not a murderer.

69
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,380
That's the truth.

70
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,820
You claim your art
is about exploring life.

71
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,230
Yet you have no respect for it.

72
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,620
Once someone dies,

73
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,190
the body is worthless.

74
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,940
I bought it

75
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,910
and used it in my art.

76
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,790
In a way,

77
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,910
I'm continuing their existence

78
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,110
and elevating their physical form
to something greater.

79
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:17,450
Do you realize this is a crime?

80
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,230
I'm doing this for art.

81
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,020
Geezer Gu,

82
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,380
an important day is coming up.

83
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,750
Guess what it is.

84
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:57,870
Geezer Gu,

85
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,060
an important day is coming up.

86
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,550
Guess what it is.

87
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,350
This brat is testing me.

88
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:14,910
Mr. Su.

89
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:16,870
Everything is okay tonight.

90
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,110
Why is that car just sitting there?

91
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:29,670
A ride-hailing service?

92
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:30,990
I checked with the security guard.

93
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,550
It is here to pick up students.

94
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,430
The car is almost here
every night lately.

95
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:38,910
Okay.

96
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:40,820
I'll take a look.

97
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,190
Gu!

98
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,500
Are you here to pick Xiaotang up?

99
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,260
Yes.

100
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,110
I think she already left.

101
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,580
I guess I came late again.

102
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,190
I'm going to meet my boyfriend.

103
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,310
We're going to watch a movie.

104
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,310
Okay, have fun.

105
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,870
Bye-bye.

106
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:26,700
Hello, Yu Yue.

107
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,990
Check a license plate for me.

108
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,820
Hey, sis.

109
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,870
Why haven't you called me lately?

110
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,060
I've been busy.

111
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,990
How are you lately?

112
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,820
I'm pretty good.

113
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,940
Just going to class, nothing special.

114
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,380
Listen,

115
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,430
I have come around.

116
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,500
I won't try
to get you two back together.

117
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,110
If you really love each other,

118
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,020
you'll get back together eventually,
right?

119
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,260
I'm dating someone new.

120
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,990
It's been a while since we broke up.

121
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,020
So I figured it was time to move on.

122
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:19,060
He treats me well

123
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,580
and even said he'd like to meet you.

124
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:25,910
That's fine.

125
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:29,270
Who you date has nothing to do with me,

126
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,270
as long as you're happy.

127
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,270
I just feel bad for Geezer Gu.

128
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,340
He's a good guy.

129
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,670
He is.

130
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,670
But our relationship has come to an end.

131
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,670
I thought about trying again.

132
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,060
But he's always too busy

133
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:47,990
and never had the time.

134
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,820
I was the one who had been

135
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:52,940
holding you guys back.

136
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,220
No, it's not.

137
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,740
Our breakup had nothing to do with you.

138
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,580
You're... I just...

139
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,700
It's okay.

140
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:07,340
It's good
that you have already found someone.

141
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,270
In any case,
I'm a university student now.

142
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,310
I can take care of myself now.

143
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,960
I won't be a burden to you guys anymore.

144
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:14,860
Xiaotang.

145
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,670
Listen to me.

146
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:17,910
It's not what you think.

147
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:18,700
Let me explain.

148
00:08:21,912 --> 00:08:26,300
(Geezer Gu, I have
a new brother-in-law.)

149
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,300
(Will you also find
a new sister-in-law for me?)

150
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,380
(I'm happy for her.)

151
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,340
(No.)

152
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:55,420
(Zhen, you're the only family I have.
I miss you.)

153
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,180
(Your birthday is coming soon, right?
I'll celebrate it with you.)

154
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:24,500
(Haha. Okay.)

155
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,340
Liu Xiangui!

156
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,150
Wang Licha said

157
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,310
he bought a skull from you.

158
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,190
Where did you get it?

159
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:34,910
Don't get it wrong.

160
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,790
Wang Licha told me to do it.

161
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,670
I didn't kill anyone.

162
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,700
Why did you try to flee?

163
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,510
I stole the skull.

164
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:41,980
I...

165
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,030
I was scared
the villagers would report me.

166
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,340
What exactly happened?

167
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,430
Tell me everything!

168
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:47,670
I was...

169
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:51,790
Well, you see.

170
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,100
Wang Licha

171
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,270
is into that whole artsy thing, right?

172
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,390
He often comes up

173
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,910
with those bizarre things.

174
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:01,580
Then I'm a scrap collector.

175
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,270
I often find things

176
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,220
that no one wants.

177
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,630
Yet, it's what he wants.

178
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:08,580
He's very generous

179
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,220
when he buys scraps from me.

180
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,670
Later, I told him

181
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,670
I could help him find what he needed.

182
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:15,980
From that moment,

183
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,390
he would tell me what he needed.

184
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,630
Until one day,

185
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,670
he suddenly said
he wanted a human skull.

186
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,460
And you agreed?

187
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,820
At first,

188
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,550
I was shocked

189
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,740
when he said that.

190
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,940
I mean why would he want
to buy a human skull.

191
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,100
You know

192
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,550
how it is in TV dramas.

193
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,150
I figured it out after that.

194
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,940
He

195
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,190
only wanted a human head.

196
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,670
It could be anyone's head.

197
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,220
It didn't matter

198
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,030
if it was of a male or a female.

199
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,220
So I figured,

200
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,030
with so many dead people around,

201
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,910
I could just find one, right?

202
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:49,510
And then?

203
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,190
There was a guy in our village

204
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,510
with no heirs.

205
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,220
He had no wife and no parents.

206
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:58,220
He passed away a few days ago.

207
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,190
So I dug up his grave

208
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,630
and took his head.

209
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,820
Then why did no one cremate the body?

210
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,030
You don't understand.

211
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,430
People

212
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,430
didn't really like him.

213
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,310
He had no family.

214
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,340
As for the villagers,

215
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,630
you know how they are.

216
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,100
No one really cared.

217
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:14,510
Officer!

218
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:25,980
What is it?

219
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,510
Officer,

220
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,670
you have already

221
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,390
dug up the body, right?

222
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,700
Can we just put him back

223
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,940
and let him rest in peace?

224
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,060
Not now for sure.

225
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,430
We need to take him for an autopsy.

226
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,030
But Liu Tianci died of illness.

227
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,740
We have the hospital records

228
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,980
and death certificate.

229
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,100
Everyone in the village saw

230
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,310
how he was getting weaker by the day

231
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:46,510
and finally passing away.

232
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,200
Am I right, guys?

233
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,190
Yes.

234
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,310
- I guess.
- Yeah.

235
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,670
Madam, tell him.

236
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,700
Officer,

237
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,390
Liu Tianci's condition

238
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,190
was getting worse every day.

239
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:57,700
Sometimes, he would complain

240
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,550
about terrible headaches.

241
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,430
He looked terrible.

242
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:02,580
He was so pitiful.

243
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,740
Excuse me, officer.

244
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,700
Let me explain.

245
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,860
Liu Tianci

246
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,460
actually took my car to the hospital.

247
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,220
On the way back,

248
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,270
he kept saying

249
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,670
the doctors found

250
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,910
a tumor in his brain.

251
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:21,980
Officer,

252
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:23,150
I'm one of the oldest

253
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,580
in the village.

254
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,340
Everything they said

255
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,220
is true.

256
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:28,940
Poor kid.

257
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,190
He lost his parents
when he was very young.

258
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,150
Now he's gone at a young age too.

259
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,910
If he can't rest in peace,

260
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,190
that's just too tragic.

261
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,670
He should be buried as soon as possible.

262
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,390
Mister,

263
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,550
I understand how you feel.

264
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,340
But we have to follow the law.

265
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,260
Besides, the government
encourages cremation

266
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,670
instead of burials.

267
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:53,220
Liu Tianci died from an illness.

268
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,700
Why do you need to investigate?

269
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:55,190
I...

270
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,700
For a guy like him,

271
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,820
if he didn't die of cancer,

272
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,300
he would've been struck by lightning.

273
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,340
Stop talking nonsense

274
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,550
in front of the police!

275
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,510
Watch your mouth.

276
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,700
I'm just telling the truth.

277
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:04,550
I...

278
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:05,790
Officer,

279
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,190
we saw the photo too.

280
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,460
It's Liu Tianci.

281
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,630
Whether it's cremation

282
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,220
or not,

283
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,060
we'll cooperate.

284
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,390
It seems like Liu Tianci

285
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:18,270
wasn't very well-liked in your village.

286
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,630
That photo only showed bones.

287
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,750
Yet you could recognize him?

288
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,150
Uh...

289
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,270
Officer,

290
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,460
we'll fully cooperate
with the investigation.

291
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,740
Everyone in the village

292
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,790
will cooperate.

293
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,700
Qian, what's the result?

294
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,970
Anything unusual about the body?

295
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,940
Do the head and torso match?

296
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,630
Yes, they belong to the same person.

297
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,430
The cut on the neck is clean

298
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,700
and there was no major bleeding.

299
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,260
The head was removed after death.

300
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,110
But as for the cause of death...

301
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,740
Was it poisoning or illness?

302
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,910
Actually, it's the opposite.

303
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:32,780
He was perfectly healthy.

304
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,110
Based on my examination so far,

305
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:37,350
Liu Tianci's body and limbs

306
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:38,500
show no signs of disease.

307
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,940
There are no injuries,

308
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,630
not even bruises.

309
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:44,190
I've never seen a corpse like this.

310
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,300
His organs are intact and healthy

311
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,980
and his bones are not damaged.

312
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,870
No signs of suffocation

313
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,500
or electrocution.

314
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:55,260
Even the usual poisoning symptoms
aren't present.

315
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,830
His skin has no signs of wounds.

316
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:01,780
I've sent blood samples for testing.

317
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,940
But in my professional opinion,

318
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,740
poisoning is highly unlikely.

319
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,870
His death report states

320
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:11,110
he died suddenly
from a ruptured brain aneurysm.

321
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,590
The hospital confirmed this.

322
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,390
Statistically,

323
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,780
about three

324
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,500
in every hundred people have aneurysms,

325
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,260
and they're a leading cause

326
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,590
of sudden death in adults.

327
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,430
So it's possible that Liu Tianci died

328
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,460
from a brain aneurysm.

329
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,390
But the only thing to confirm that
is his head.

330
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:34,500
If there's nothing wrong with his brain,

331
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,150
then Liu Tianci died naturally?

332
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,300
A perfectly healthy adult man

333
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,300
suddenly dying for no reason

334
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,190
doesn't seem natural at all.

335
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,220
If someone deliberately
destroyed his head,

336
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,700
they might be trying to hide

337
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,500
the real cause of his death.

338
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:01,460
Denggao,

339
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,260
do you think we'll get in trouble?

340
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,630
What trouble?

341
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,500
The death certificate isn't fake.

342
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,540
Even if Liu Tianci could come back
from the dead,

343
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:13,110
the official record
would still say the same thing.

344
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,740
Once you're in the underworld,

345
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,460
the result

346
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,460
will still be the same.

347
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,870
But the police took the body.

348
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,740
Won't they start suspecting us?

349
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,390
Are you drunk?

350
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,540
You should've never been
made village chief.

351
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:30,780
Useless.

352
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,940
The officer said

353
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,310
they were just following procedure.

354
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,350
What can they possibly find?

355
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,540
I just don't feel right about this.

356
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,780
Look at you, scared over nothing.

357
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,070
First thing tomorrow,

358
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,350
go around the village

359
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,300
and tell everyone this.

360
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,460
If the police ask them anything,

361
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,270
don't say anything reckless.

362
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,300
Those officers today

363
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,460
didn't seem easy to deal with.

364
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:57,700
No kidding.

365
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,300
Do you think weaklings can become cops?

366
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,780
It'll be fine so long as everyone

367
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,830
says they know nothing.

368
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,500
Listen.

369
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,500
First thing in the morning,
call the city.

370
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,780
Tell them

371
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,980
if they don't return the body...

372
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:12,430
Who's there?

373
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,110
Gu Zhen,

374
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:46,980
come.

375
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,740
Chief.

376
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:48,980
Liufu Village called.

377
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,150
They want to claim

378
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,220
the body for cremation.

379
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,770
Find some time to process the paperwork.

380
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,910
We can't release

381
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,630
that body yet.

382
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,190
I've checked all the documents.

383
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:01,500
The death certificate
and medical report are all in order.

384
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:02,830
The head and body match.

385
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,390
So, what's the issue?

386
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:05,020
There's no

387
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,220
external or internal injuries.

388
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,590
But the medical records say

389
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,870
Liu Tianci had a brain aneurysm.

390
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:09,870
We can't confirm

391
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:12,070
if that's what really caused his death.

392
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,350
On paper,

393
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,700
everything checks out.

394
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,980
But something isn't right
with Liufu Village.

395
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,260
I hope you can give us more time.

396
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,540
If there are doubts,

397
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,460
keep investigating.

398
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,350
But be mindful of how you

399
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,500
handle the villagers.

400
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,540
Stay professional.

401
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,540
Yes, Chief.

402
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,200
Go back to work.

403
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:36,630
Madam.

404
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,110
Let's go.

405
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:44,500
Captain Gu,

406
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:46,220
something's off about this village.

407
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,980
I think they're being threatened.

408
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:50,830
Officers,

409
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,150
you're here
about returning the body, right?

410
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,540
You could've just called.

411
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,540
No need to come all this way.

412
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,540
Sorry.

413
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,300
But we can't release the body yet.

414
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,670
We're still running tests.

415
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,670
We're here to ask about Liu Tianci's

416
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,020
medical condition
before he died.

417
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,190
Oh, his illness?

418
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,780
Ask Uncle Denggao.

419
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:11,540
He knows best.

420
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:12,980
Mister,

421
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,830
you're a doctor?

422
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:16,700
Oh, no.

423
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,870
I don't know all that.

424
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,070
I was just the one

425
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,070
who took Tianci to the hospital.

426
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:25,390
So I guess you and Liu Tianci

427
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:26,110
were close.

428
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,070
Most people surnamed Liu here

429
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,700
are related in one way or another.

430
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,740
I watched

431
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,540
the younger generations grow up.

432
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,530
So we get along the same.

433
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,350
Did Liu Tianci have

434
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:38,540
any conflicts with anyone

435
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,670
before he died?

436
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:45,500
Mr. Liu,

437
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,500
you probably know best

438
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,630
about the relationships
between the villagers, right?

439
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,590
Denggao probably knows more

440
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:54,300
about the villagers' relationships
than I do.

441
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:55,940
As a village chief,

442
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,670
don't you know
if the villagers get along?

443
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:58,150
I...

444
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,220
He's always busy with development
and economic projects.

445
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,740
He doesn't have time

446
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,540
for small matters like this.

447
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,940
As an elder,

448
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:06,830
so let me speak

449
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,260
on the chief's behalf.

450
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,780
Our village has always been
a model village.

451
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,110
We all get along

452
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:13,910
with no grudges.

453
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:14,460
But...

454
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,110
We're here to talk about...

455
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:16,630
Qin,

456
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:18,320
the dead deserve respect.

457
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,500
It'd be rude
if we ask too many questions.

458
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,070
Don't worry.

459
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:24,980
Once the autopsy report

460
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:25,870
is completed,

461
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,190
we'll return the body immediately.

462
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:29,190
If there's nothing else,
we'll take our leave.

463
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:29,630
Okay.

464
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:30,840
Thank you for your cooperation.

465
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,070
No need.

466
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:32,500
Thank you.

467
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:33,910
Let's go.

468
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:34,430
Take care.

469
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:41,540
The villagers

470
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,110
aren't cooperating at all.

471
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,350
Saying they don't know anything.

472
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,190
See him avoiding us?

473
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:47,980
Something is definitely off.

474
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,350
They thought they said nothing.

475
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,700
But their behavior said it all.

476
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:54,110
There must be something

477
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:55,210
behind Liu Tianci's death.

478
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,670
What if they won't cooperate?

479
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,780
The medical records don't lie.

480
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,630
This old house is stunning.

481
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,940
(Liu Family Courtyard)
It must have a long history.

482
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:10,210
It's even a protected cultural site
at the provincial level.

483
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:12,190
The owner is Liu Tiebin?

484
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,910
Such a shame

485
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:24,880
that it burned down like this.
