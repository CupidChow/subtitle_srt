00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:36,260
=Episode 15=

3
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:39,500
This old house is stunning.

4
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,720
(Liu Family Courtyard)
It must have a long history.

5
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,990
It's even a protected cultural site
at the provincial level.

6
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,030
The owner is Liu Tiebin?

7
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,620
Such a shame

8
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,540
that it burned down like this.

9
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:10,940
You're the owner of this house?

10
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,030
What do you want?

11
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:14,270
Nothing.

12
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,270
We were just passing by

13
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:17,940
and thought this house was beautiful.

14
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,790
It's such a shame
that it was burned down.

15
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:22,990
Well, disasters happen.

16
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,430
Nothing we can do.

17
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,820
The people in this village seem strange.

18
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,750
Maybe they're hiding something.

19
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,750
I'm sure they are.

20
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,750
They avoid us

21
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,500
like we're debt collectors.

22
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,550
Technically, we are here
to investigate their past.

23
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,340
That man just now is Liu Tiebin.

24
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,780
And right behind this house

25
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,190
is Liu Tianci's home.

26
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,310
Could there be any connection

27
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,990
between them?

28
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,380
Come.

29
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,550
I think those two

30
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,940
might have something to say.

31
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,500
Hello, officers.

32
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,750
I thought you already left.

33
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,500
Did you get lost?

34
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,750
How about we guide you
out of the village?

35
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,030
No, no need.

36
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,660
We were just taking a stroll

37
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,380
and saw this big old house.

38
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,310
This house looked impressive.

39
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:33,710
Ah, yes.

40
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,820
Officer Qin actually

41
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,750
has an interest
in historical architecture.

42
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,270
Right?

43
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,780
A little bit.

44
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:44,550
This is

45
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:45,990
from the Republic era?

46
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,780
It's from the Qing Dynasty.

47
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,290
Qing Dynasty?

48
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,550
Wow, that's even older.

49
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,900
It must have been beautiful
in its prime.

50
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,620
Oh, absolutely.

51
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,550
A massive courtyard with three sections.

52
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,310
You know?

53
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,940
The beams inside

54
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,900
are all solid wood,

55
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,420
carved with designs of flowers, people,

56
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,820
you name it.

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,530
But it's all burned down. Nothing left.

58
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,060
That's too bad.

59
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,220
I agree.

60
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,430
This house had been around

61
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,350
for many years.

62
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:12,870
We had already found investors willing

63
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,260
to put in billions of yuan

64
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,870
to turn it into a tourist attraction.

65
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,670
The entire village was going
to be shareholders.

66
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,060
And then the place burned down.

67
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,460
How did such a beautiful house

68
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,870
end up burning down?

69
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,550
It was all thanks to Liu Tianci.

70
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,500
His kitchen

71
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,750
is right next to the back wall
of this house.

72
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,430
The kitchen caught fire

73
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,460
and sparks spread to this old house.

74
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,140
The house

75
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,460
was made of wood.

76
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,190
It happened

77
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,350
in the middle of the night.

78
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,620
Everyone was fast asleep.

79
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:45,430
The midnight?

80
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,910
How did the kitchen catch fire?

81
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,910
The young guy probably got hungry

82
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,580
in the middle of the night

83
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,500
and cooked something.

84
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,700
But he didn't watch the fire.

85
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,550
That's how it happened.

86
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,460
Yes.

87
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,430
If it hadn't been for that fire,

88
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,580
it would've been a tourist attraction.

89
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,460
Yeah, that's right.

90
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:04,870
You know?

91
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,620
The investors came to visit, too.

92
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,870
He was all refined

93
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:08,990
and cultured.

94
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,940
He even drew a plan for us.

95
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,230
We had already transferred
the investment funds

96
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,430
to the art investment company's account.

97
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,940
But the house burned down.

98
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:17,500
And

99
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:18,750
the money was gone.

100
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,670
That was the end of it.

101
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,230
Can't it be rebuilt?

102
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:21,940
Rebuild with what?

103
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,090
The blueprints are gone.
There's no way to restore it.

104
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,460
Liu Shun, stop it.

105
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,820
Can't keep your mouth shut, huh?

106
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,350
You have to be blabbermouth, huh?

107
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,190
Stop it, Liu Shun.

108
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:50,820
Just stop.

109
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,750
Watch your mouth.

110
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,260
If I hear another word
you shouldn't say,

111
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,990
you'll lose more than just your leg.

112
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:57,910
Got it?

113
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,500
Yeah.

114
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:03,580
I got it.

115
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,340
(Name: Liu Tianci)

116
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,350
Just by entering a name,

117
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,090
you can check
the patient's medical records.

118
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,110
This scan is very clear.

119
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,460
It shows that the patient had
a cerebral aneurysm.

120
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,580
The aneurysm was located
at a major artery junction in the brain.

121
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,060
It was quite large,

122
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,620
and already in the late stage.

123
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,940
It could rupture at any moment.

124
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,020
Dr. Zhu,

125
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,350
can you check

126
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,550
if these scans belong
to the same person?

127
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,580
This doesn't seem right.

128
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,060
If the aneurysm had ruptured,

129
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:45,940
there would be signs

130
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,620
of severe bleeding in the brain

131
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,190
and blood clots in the brain tissue.

132
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,580
But there are no signs of bleeding,

133
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,190
no blood clots,

134
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,060
and no abnormal blood vessel formations.

135
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,670
More importantly,

136
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,820
the ultrasound clearly showed
a large aneurysm.

137
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,110
But in this scan, there's nothing

138
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:01,990
in the same location.

139
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,060
These reports are obviously
from two different people.

140
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,550
Who was Liu Tianci's attending doctor?

141
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,110
(Doctor's Signature: Liu Tiebin)
Dr. Liu Tiebin from our department?

142
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,140
What's up with him?

143
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:22,500
He's an excellent doctor,
both in skill and character.

144
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,790
Except for an extended leave
when his mother passed away,

145
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,190
he's been dedicated to his work

146
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,310
without breaks.

147
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,860
He's been the model employee every year.

148
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,460
(Gu Zhen)

149
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,580
Yes, Captain Gu.

150
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,310
What did you get?

151
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:41,990
We're at the hospital.

152
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,620
We just confirmed that Liu Tianci's

153
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,730
medical records were forged.

154
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,060
That so-called artist

155
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,460
didn't damage his brain.

156
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,190
We've found the most crucial evidence.

157
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,550
Liu Tianci was actually in good health

158
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,580
and never had a brain aneurysm.

159
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:56,620
And

160
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,700
he was never hospitalized for treatment.

161
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,550
So he was tricked

162
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,140
into believing he had a brain tumor

163
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,870
and just gave up treatment?

164
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,310
A normal man would do
everything to survive.

165
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,700
Why would his doctor fake

166
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,230
his diagnosis?

167
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,670
Was it to push unnecessary treatments

168
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:15,650
and scam him for money,

169
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,580
or for something else?

170
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,020
Dig deeper into his attending physician.

171
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,620
We've identified his attending doctor.

172
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,580
His name is Liu Tiebin.

173
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,060
We're about to make contact.

174
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:25,550
Liu Tiebin?

175
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:30,340
Liu Tianci's neighbor's name
is also Liu Tiebin.

176
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,670
We ran into him earlier in the village.

177
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,100
I think I know

178
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,430
how Liu Tianci died.

179
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,060
I suggest

180
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,450
we bring in Liu Tiebin immediately.

181
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:48,169
(Police)

182
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,990
(Criminal Investigation Office)
My husband hasn't returned for two days.

183
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,510
Even when he goes out to have fun,

184
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,860
he never stays out
for more than a night.

185
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,980
Something must have happened to him.

186
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:57,980
Madam,

187
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,550
calm down.

188
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,700
Why don't you start

189
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,030
by telling me your husband's name

190
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,910
and what happened?

191
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,790
His name is Song Hou.

192
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,820
People call him Monkey Song.

193
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,220
Okay, got it.

194
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,310
What's the matter?

195
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,790
Monkey Song is missing.

196
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,460
He rented a place

197
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,820
to Feng Chao back then.

198
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,700
And the Feng Chao case...

199
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:27,740
Chao,

200
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,460
someone reported me.

201
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,860
They said we were making
too much noise at night.

202
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,670
Monkey Song,

203
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,270
I already paid this month's rent.

204
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,700
What are you doing here?

205
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:05,790
Don't worry.

206
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,460
That guy won't be making
any noise again.

207
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,150
It'll be quiet from now on.

208
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,460
I don't care what you do in there.

209
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,060
As long as you pay rent on time,

210
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,790
I won't ask questions.

211
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,430
I'll let it go this time.

212
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,310
But if someone complains again,

213
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,790
I'm raising your rent.

214
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,580
I heard this place was rented

215
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,060
by a kidnapper before.

216
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,310
If he makes trouble again,

217
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,060
I'll kill him.

218
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,700
The hostage had his tongue cut out

219
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,430
and bled to death right in this room.

220
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,150
That's why the rent is so cheap.

221
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,910
Don't listen to rumors.

222
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,940
Even if someone died,

223
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,990
that was on the kidnapper.

224
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,310
It had nothing to do with me.

225
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,740
But if you had paid more attention

226
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,660
and realized something was off
with your tenant,

227
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,270
that hostage might still be alive.

228
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,550
That hostage was some rich guy.

229
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,860
If he died, he had it coming.

230
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,670
I'm the one who lost the most.

231
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,460
Someone died in my house.

232
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,150
It's really bad luck.

233
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:49,220
Freeze!

234
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,370
Everyone, be careful.

235
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:13,270
There's a basement.

236
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:52,910
Don't be afraid.

237
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,060
We're the police.

238
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:55,580
We're the police.

239
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,320
If you keep crying, I'll kill you.

240
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,390
Do you always have

241
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,630
to go around killing people?

242
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,460
Last time, you went too far

243
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,220
and killed someone.

244
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:47,060
The police is looking for us
the whole city .

245
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,270
We barely made it out.

246
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,390
If we're scared of the cops,

247
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,890
we shouldn't be doing this at all.

248
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,940
Let's run. They're coming.

249
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,670
Hurry up! Let's go!

250
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:34,980
Stop wasting time! Let's go.

251
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,980
Come on, let's go!

252
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:49,980
Hey, kid.

253
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,100
Kid.

254
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:54,980
Don't be scared.

255
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,220
We're the police.

256
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,270
You're safe now.

257
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,070
Qin.

258
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:07,460
Qin?

259
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:12,540
Wang,

260
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:13,780
come here.

261
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,020
The victim's tongue seems to be cut off.

262
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,450
We'll get you to the hospital.

263
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,830
Find something to open this.

264
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:21,390
Yes, sir.

265
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,220
Most people
would be traumatized for life

266
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,700
after going through something like that.

267
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:42,500
But you, brat,

268
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,670
actually became a cop.

269
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,260
I can't live in fear forever, can I?

270
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,190
Let's go.

271
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,980
(People's Public Security)

272
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,350
Monkey Song's tongue

273
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,540
was deliberately cut off.

274
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,350
So he can't speak.

275
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:15,110
He is still in shock

276
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:16,670
and can't provide

277
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,700
any useful information for now.

278
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:21,070
In such a short time,

279
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:22,150
Yin Qing,

280
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:23,220
Feng Chao's mother,

281
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,190
and Monkey Song all suffered.

282
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:30,070
This person called Kong Rubai

283
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:32,020
and sent money to Mr. Chang.

284
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:35,630
If he's also the one
who sent those letters,

285
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,910
then he's clearly out for revenge.

286
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,070
That means

287
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,500
his next target is...

288
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,390
Let him come.

289
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,350
I'll be waiting.

290
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,870
I'm more worried
he won't go after you directly

291
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,350
but will target the people around you.

292
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:57,780
I'll figure something out

293
00:17:58,910 --> 00:17:59,910
about this matter.

294
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,110
By the way,

295
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:03,500
have you contacted

296
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,140
all the victims from the Feng Chao case?

297
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,740
Other than the ones
we've stayed in touch with,

298
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,070
there's only Wang Letong's family left.

299
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,590
After what happened to Wang Letong,

300
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,220
her mother was devastated.

301
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,300
With her weak heart,

302
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,700
she passed away the following year.

303
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,830
Her father was deeply depressed
and left the country.

304
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,100
No one has heard from him since.

305
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,940
I'll try to track him down.

306
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,590
Oh, Captain Gu.

307
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:25,540
I've checked

308
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,910
the license plate of the car spotted
near the school.

309
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,630
The owner is Cheng Xu.

310
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,980
He runs a local auto repair shop.

311
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35,150
His customers often borrow his car.

312
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,670
But no one at the shop knows exactly

313
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,110
who had it that night.

314
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,190
Okay.

315
00:18:43,781 --> 00:18:46,780
(Waiting Room)

316
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,220
Liu Xiangui.

317
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:05,430
tell us the truth

318
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:06,880
about Liu Tianci and Liu Tiebin.

319
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,150
What kind of relationship

320
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:13,780
did they have?

321
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:17,590
Well,

322
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,150
it's a long story.

323
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,300
You can start by telling us

324
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,740
what kind of person Liu Tianci was.

325
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,070
The elders in the village always said

326
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,300
Liu Tianci was born rebellious

327
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,430
and a troublemaker.

328
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,300
You little brat!

329
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,500
You dare steal my eggs!

330
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,260
I'll teach you a lesson!

331
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,460
You rascal! You disgusting rascal!

332
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,700
Honey, he stole our eggs!

333
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:45,780
Stop right there!

334
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,630
You rascal!

335
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:49,070
What are you doing?

336
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:50,500
Hey, watch it!

337
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,630
Liu Tianci, you little brat!

338
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:54,670
You'll face retribution!

339
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:55,670
Stop!

340
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:56,740
Catch me if you can!

341
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,590
Darn you!

342
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:59,980
Come and get me.

343
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:00,780
It's mine now!

344
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,700
He was

345
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,180
(Reporting Crime)
about my age.

346
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,190
Naughty since childhood.

347
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,500
His father had him

348
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,500
when he was old.

349
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,630
They spoiled him rotten

350
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,870
since they had money.

351
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:17,500
That only made him worse,

352
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,930
running wild and breaking the rules.

353
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:21,350
Liu Tianci! I...

354
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,940
But the villagers say

355
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,540
Liu Tianci was an orphan.

356
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,500
What was that about?

357
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,630
I call that retribution.

358
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:37,980
Two years earlier,

359
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,740
he racked up gambling debts.

360
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,540
The debt collectors
looked for him at home.

361
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,020
Uncle Changfu had a stroke on the spot

362
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,540
and passed away shortly after.

363
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:49,150
His wife cried for two months straight
and then passed away.

364
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,070
With both parents gone,

365
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:54,350
Liu Tianci became even more reckless.

366
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,630
He would break into
widows' homes at night

367
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,390
and beat up cripples during the day.

368
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,590
He had his hands full of bad deeds.

369
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:03,020
Did Liu Tianci and Liu Tiebin
have any grudges?

370
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,300
Oh, they do.

371
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,980
Liu Tiebin had an older brother,

372
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,870
Liu Tiezhu.

373
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,780
He wasn't all there in the head

374
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,150
and couldn't find a wife

375
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,220
even in his thirties.

376
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,670
So his family spent a fortune

377
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,300
to find a bride for him.

378
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,320
Just as they were getting ready
for the wedding,

379
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:19,430
Liu Tiezhu found out Liu Tianci

380
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:20,560
snuck into his bridal chamber

381
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,740
and slept with the bride.

382
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,460
Can you imagine...

383
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:25,110
Uncle.

384
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:25,830
Third Aunt.

385
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:26,910
Come in. Please come in.

386
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:27,980
Enjoy your meal.

387
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,070
Have a seat.

388
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:31,830
Okay.

389
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,500
Come in.

390
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,120
What are you doing here?

391
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,590
Liu Tianci!

392
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:42,460
Wait.

393
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,260
What are you doing?

394
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,540
Zhu. Stop it, Zhu!

395
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,260
Pay me a new bride!

396
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,020
What's going on?

397
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:46,460
Hey you!

398
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,590
I only peed.

399
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,070
Zhu!

400
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:49,670
Zhu! Zhu!

401
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,700
Zhu! Stop!

402
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,670
Get back here!

403
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,590
Zhu! Zhu! Zhu!

404
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,980
You slept with my wife!

405
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,390
I'll kill you for this!

406
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:02,430
The bride slept with someone else
before getting married.

407
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,670
This is not good.

408
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:06,790
Even a rabbit doesn't eat
the grass near its burrow.

409
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:07,870
But Tianci

410
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,110
sure has no limits.

411
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,020
Liu Tiezhu lost his mind on the spot

412
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,530
and was sent to a psychiatric hospital.

413
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:19,390
Liu Tiebin is a doctor in the city

414
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:21,190
and an educated man.

415
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,430
Why didn't he report it to the police?

416
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,980
His mother wouldn't allow it

417
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,830
because she thought it was too shameful.

418
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,670
The bride ran away in the end.

419
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:32,500
So the wedding was ruined.

420
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,870
So, is that why Liu Tiebin

421
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,460
held a grudge against Liu Tianci?

422
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,260
That was just one of many conflicts.

423
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,700
But that was a big one.

424
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,700
There was another incident later

425
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,910
that completely turned them
into enemies.

426
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,350
Guess what happened?

427
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,500
Keep talking.

428
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,150
Okay.

429
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,980
Liu Tiebin's family had an ancestor
who passed the imperial exams

430
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,880
and became an official.

431
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:56,460
Their old family house

432
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,390
was passed down from that ancestor.

433
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:01,260
When Tiebin moved to the city
to work as a doctor,

434
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:03,780
he brought his parents along,

435
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,390
leaving the house vacant.

436
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,870
A year ago, a big company reached out

437
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,350
to our village chief, Liu Shun.

438
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:11,740
They wanted to turn the old house
into a tourist attraction.

439
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:14,110
So Liu Shun and Tiebin discussed
the plan

440
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,390
and got the whole village

441
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:17,390
to invest in renovating
the house together.

442
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,830
The money earned would be split

443
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,700
between Tiebin's family and the village.

444
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,740
Just imagine

445
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,390
how much money that would be?

446
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:26,070
Tiebin's family
was about to become filthy rich.

447
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:28,020
And how is any of this related

448
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,350
to Liu Tianci?

449
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,740
Tianci was broke.

450
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,870
Seeing such a golden opportunity,

451
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:34,990
how could he not be jealous?

452
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,220
So he showed up

453
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:40,070
and claimed that his kitchen
was at the back wall of the house,

454
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,500
which was part of the historical site.

455
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,590
He demanded a profit share.

456
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:43,830
Of course, no one agreed.

457
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,300
Then one night,

458
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,190
a fire broke out

459
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:49,300
in Tianci's kitchen.

460
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,910
The flames spread
to the house's back wall.

461
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:55,590
That place was entirely made of wood.

462
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,300
Once a spark hit

463
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,190
and some wind,

464
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:00,980
it went up in flames like dry firewood.

465
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,870
Everyone was sound asleep at the time.

466
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,590
By the time someone noticed,

467
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:07,220
the entire house
was already burned to the ground.

468
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,220
Life is so unfair!

469
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,120
You refused to include me
in sharing the profit.

470
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:31,460
Now that your house burned down,
and suddenly I'm included?

471
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,630
My kitchen was burned down.

472
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:33,700
Pay me for my loss!

473
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,980
The fire spread from your kitchen!

474
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,020
Do you even have shame?

475
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,460
Did you see it yourself?

476
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,070
The fire...

477
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,260
The fire spread from Liu Tiebin's place.

478
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:41,630
If you don't believe me,

479
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:42,300
you can sue me!

480
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,630
What kind...

481
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:45,190
You shouldn't be saying this.

482
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,300
You don't have a conscience?

483
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,220
He is just a scumbag.

484
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:48,700
I'm the bad guy?

485
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,350
You're no better!

486
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:53,150
You even accused me
of raping your sister-in-law.

487
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,540
I bet it was you!

488
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,220
None of you are decent people.

489
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,540
You... You...

490
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,220
Someone, help!

491
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:03,020
Mom! Mom! Mom!

492
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,220
You saw that, right?

493
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,190
I didn't touch her.

494
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:07,260
She fell on her own.

495
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,190
It's not my fault!

496
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,910
How could you say something like that?

497
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:12,460
Liu Tianci was very mean with his words.

498
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,070
Tiebin's mom

499
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,460
couldn't catch her breath,

500
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,070
and then

501
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:17,540
she was gone.

502
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:20,910
Wouldn't this be considered
a grudge for his mother's death?

503
00:25:23,461 --> 00:25:25,860
(Inquiry Room)

504
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,220
What did you say?

505
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:33,700
Murder Liu Tianci?

506
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,490
Don't you think that's ridiculous?

507
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:39,780
Then explain

508
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,350
why you switched
Liu Tianci's medical records.

509
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,260
Did I?

510
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,590
I handle a huge workload every day.

511
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:50,070
Maybe I made a mistake.

512
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:51,630
A mistake?

513
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:54,350
Let me refresh your memory.

514
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:57,700
We've already questioned

515
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,670
Liu Shun and Liu Denggao.

516
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:00,020
They both admitted

517
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,390
that under your instructions,

518
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,780
the entire village started rumors
about Liu Tianci,

519
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,500
looking pale and sickly.

520
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:08,430
So they took him

521
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:09,500
to you for a checkup.

522
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,270
That's when you switched
his medical records,

523
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,350
making him believe
he had a terminal illness.

524
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,430
He died

525
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,150
from sheer fear.

526
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:18,590
Come on.

527
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,350
I've been a doctor for years.

528
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:22,070
I've never heard of someone

529
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,590
literally being scared to death.

530
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:25,300
It may be rare.

531
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,390
But it happens.

532
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:29,700
In psychology,
it's called self-fulfilling prophecy

533
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:31,940
What does that mean?

534
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,980
A type of psychological suggestion.

535
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:35,940
There was an experiment did

536
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,150
by a foreign scientist.

537
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,500
He made the test subjects drink

538
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,040
large amounts of sugar water every day.

539
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,220
As a result, they developed

540
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:42,980
high blood sugar,

541
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,020
diabetes symptoms,

542
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,430
and increased urination.

543
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:48,390
Then he stopped giving them sugar water

544
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,260
and switched to verbal suggestions

545
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,700
to convince the test subjects

546
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,740
that they were still drinking
the sugar water.

547
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:54,940
As a result,

548
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,870
the same symptoms appeared.

549
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,980
The scientist made a conclusion.

550
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,350
Verbal suggestion
can replace actual stimuli,

551
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,790
triggering a reaction in the brain.

552
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,020
The power of psychological influence
is very strong.

553
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:07,540
Interesting.

554
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:11,150
I just learned something new.

555
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:14,540
But everyone in the village knows

556
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,830
I had a grudge against Liu Tianci.

557
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:20,220
Why would he believe what I said?

558
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,500
He might not trust you.

559
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,940
But if the entire village said
the same thing,

560
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,340
he had no choice but to believe it.
