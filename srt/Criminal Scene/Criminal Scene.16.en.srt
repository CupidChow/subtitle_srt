00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:36,260
=Episode 16=

3
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:42,620
Liu Tiebin,

4
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:45,550
you didn't expect this, did you?

5
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,900
Liu Denggao is the smartest man
in your village, right?

6
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:51,750
He secretly recorded

7
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,700
your entire conversation on his phone.

8
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,550
Just in case something happened,

9
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,260
you told him to take the blame for you.

10
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,750
Now you can listen for yourself

11
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,620
and see if the recording is real or not.

12
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,430
Uncle Gao, listen to me.

13
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,550
Liu Tianci was scared to death.

14
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,780
Justice has been served for my brother,

15
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,150
mother, and the entire village.

16
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,100
Shut it! Just shut it!

17
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:16,900
A healthy person dying

18
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,150
from fear alone is extremely unlikely.

19
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,190
But that's what you were counting on.

20
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,820
If Liu Tianci died from fear,

21
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:24,990
your revenge was complete.

22
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,990
And even if he didn't die,

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,060
he'd be left a mental scar

24
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,260
that haunts him the whole life.

25
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,030
For ten years,

26
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:38,150
that man tormented your family

27
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,380
and caused their deaths.

28
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,550
But you could do nothing.

29
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,270
Tell me,

30
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,270
if you were in my place,

31
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,310
what would you have done?

32
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,060
A doctor's duty

33
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:49,870
is to save lives,

34
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:50,660
not to kill.

35
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,940
Was I supposed to endure him?

36
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,550
What is a doctor's oath?

37
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,430
I'm guessing you don't even remember

38
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,820
since you've did all this.

39
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:05,990
Let me remind you.

40
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,780
As a medical professional,

41
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,340
I solemnly swear

42
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,500
to dedicate my life to humanity.

43
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,620
My patient's health and well-being
will always come first.

44
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,500
I will respect their autonomy
and dignity.

45
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,900
I will treat them
with the utmost respect,

46
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:31,430
regardless of age, illness,

47
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,900
disability, beliefs, race,

48
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,150
gender, nationality,

49
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,820
politics, sexual orientation,

50
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,430
or social status.

51
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,820
My patient's health and well-being
will always come first.

52
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,270
I will follow
the highest medical standards

53
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,500
with integrity and compassion.

54
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,940
I will share my medical knowledge

55
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,470
to benefit patients
and advance healthcare.

56
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,220
I will never use my knowledge

57
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,220
to violate human rights or freedom.

58
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,150
I make this pledge with sincerity,

59
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,540
of my own free will, and with honor.

60
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,820
That is the oath you took.

61
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,750
An oath sworn

62
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,500
with your conscience

63
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:08,900
and professional ethics.

64
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,990
And to answer your question.

65
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:24,500
The law will deliver

66
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,110
justice to those who deserve it.

67
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,460
But as a citizen,

68
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,870
you broke the law

69
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,310
and defied the rules.

70
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,820
As a doctor,

71
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,750
you abused your authority

72
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,790
and knowledge.

73
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,190
Liu Tianci may not have been
a good person.

74
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,020
But neither are you.

75
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,850
You thought
you were taking revenge on him.

76
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,140
But in reality, you destroyed yourself.

77
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,430
You killed the part of you
that was once a good man.

78
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:56,790
Liu Tiebin,

79
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,750
you probably don't know yet.

80
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:02,020
Liu Tianci never did anything

81
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:02,890
to your sister-in-law.

82
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,350
He didn't burn down your house too.

83
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:06,790
All of these

84
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,350
were Liu Shun's doing.

85
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,350
What?

86
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,790
Limping Liu from your village

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,550
has been bullied by Liu Shun for years.

88
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,650
So he kept following him.

89
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,580
My little darling, I missed you so much.

90
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:22,870
You sneaky devil.

91
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,140
Why are you here?

92
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,380
Why do you think I'm here?

93
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,820
I'm here to congratulate you.

94
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,110
Someone will see us.

95
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,350
They are all outside drinking.

96
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,750
(When Liu Shun was having an affair
with your sister-in-law,)

97
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,450
(Liu Tianci happened to be nearby.)

98
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,310
Come in.

99
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:40,790
Okay.

100
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:41,380
Come inside.

101
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,500
Uncle, Aunty. Come in.

102
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,310
Enjoy your meal.

103
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:43,940
Welcome.

104
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,380
(So the whole village
misunderstood him.)

105
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,310
Liu Tianci!

106
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:58,990
What's your problem?

107
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,350
Why are they here?

108
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,790
Limping Liu always had a grudge
against Liu Tianci.

109
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,140
So he never stepped forward

110
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,020
to clear his name.

111
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,750
Liu Shun had a fight with Liu Tianci.

112
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,420
So he threw a cigarette butt
at his house,

113
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,230
which ended up burning down his kitchen

114
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,230
and your house too.

115
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,020
Liu Tianci, you rascal!

116
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,940
You dare take advantage of me

117
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,670
and even try to take my money?

118
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,670
I'll deal with you!

119
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:33,940
Take this!

120
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:56,620
Tell me!

121
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,350
(Limping Liu saw everything.)

122
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,350
(But he's been bullied for years,)

123
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,500
(and none of you stood up for him.)

124
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:05,910
(So)

125
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:07,990
(he didn't step forward)

126
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:08,750
(to testify.)

127
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:12,700
Liu Tiebin,

128
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,460
you abused your position
as a doctor for personal revenge.

129
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,350
But you targeted the wrong person.

130
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,870
What on earth have I been doing?

131
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,940
- Stop!
- Stop!

132
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:37,700
Stop running!

133
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,580
- Stop!
- I said stop!

134
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,310
- Stop!
- Hey, stop!

135
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,060
- Stop!
- Stop now!

136
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:45,910
- Stop!
- Stop!

137
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:46,580
Stop running!

138
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,310
Buddy, you're here.

139
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,750
If you had come any later,

140
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,580
I'd be dead!

141
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,430
Let's see

142
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,350
who dares to cause trouble on my turf.

143
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,110
This kid owes me money.

144
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,350
So stay out of it.

145
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,620
Money, huh?

146
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,060
Look at what you did to my friend.

147
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,990
You're lucky
I don't make you pay for that.

148
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,110
Break one leg each!

149
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,190
What are you guys doing?

150
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,500
We're just fooling around, sir.

151
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:17,990
Nothing.

152
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:18,790
We're friends.

153
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:19,500
Yeah.

154
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,910
Don't cause any trouble.

155
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:21,700
Disperse!

156
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,430
Yes, sir.

157
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,350
Okay.

158
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,100
What's up?

159
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,510
You're Anna's boyfriend, right?

160
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:15,980
I...

161
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,430
Was it you

162
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,060
who parked the car there?

163
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,820
I wanted to come over to say hi.

164
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,190
But you guys drove off.

165
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,820
Have we met before?

166
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,860
I think you've mistaken me.

167
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:32,580
You're Wang Qifeng, right?

168
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,270
Wang Letong's father.

169
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,670
Five years ago...

170
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,150
After I recovered,

171
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,460
I actually wanted to find you.

172
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,860
So I asked around.

173
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,390
But I heard you went abroad.

174
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:53,820
How have you been

175
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,060
these past few years?

176
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,940
It's been five years.

177
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,550
It's all in the past now.

178
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,910
Nothing to talk about.

179
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:10,550
Don't dwell on it too much.

180
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:16,940
You treat your girlfriend really well.

181
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:17,910
Always picking her up.

182
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,580
What's wrong with treating women well?

183
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,190
Yeah.

184
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,390
You're right.

185
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:44,860
Gu.

186
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,270
Anna.

187
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,390
Picking Xiaotang up again?

188
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,060
Yeah.

189
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,100
I think she took a ride home already.

190
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,510
So every time I come, I just miss her.

191
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,190
Then we should get going now.

192
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:55,860
Ah, you go ahead.

193
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,340
Go ahead.

194
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:56,740
Okay.

195
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:57,580
Drive safe.

196
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:00,220
Bye.

197
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:00,940
See you.

198
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,390
Bye.

199
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,190
Stone Head,

200
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,700
you're driving a nice car now.

201
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:29,820
Hu Yang,

202
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,910
how long has it been since we last met?

203
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,740
What do you want to do tonight?

204
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,190
I'll set up everything.

205
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:35,670
Shi...

206
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,390
Shi,

207
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,790
you've really made it big, huh?

208
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,460
Not that big.

209
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,630
I just made some money.

210
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:43,860
Hu,

211
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,460
what kind of trouble
did you get into tonight?

212
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,790
I just made a big score,

213
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,430
and now I have to clean up after you.

214
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,390
It's nothing.

215
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:52,700
I just...

216
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:53,550
I just...

217
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,700
I just lost some money.

218
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,860
Why are you stuttering?

219
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,270
We grew up together.

220
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,820
When have I ever forgotten you

221
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,580
when things were good?

222
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,030
I used to be your senior.

223
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,220
Sorry, what?

224
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:08,740
Nothing.

225
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:09,580
Shi,

226
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,060
now that you've got money,

227
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,700
how about giving me a chance?

228
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,700
You didn't even finish high school.

229
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:18,310
The work I do doesn't suit you.

230
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:20,740
Buddy,

231
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,060
I need

232
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,910
a pile of cash.

233
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,510
Then

234
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,460
I'll take that money

235
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,060
and crush that scum Xue Cheng with it

236
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:34,340
for messing with me.

237
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:50,510
Hu Yang,

238
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:52,580
I've already booked

239
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,790
a room.

240
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,460
I used my ID.

241
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,030
So they won't find you here.

242
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,100
I have also paid

243
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,430
for the room.

244
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,270
So just stay here without worry.

245
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,030
Shi,

246
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,080
can you lend me some money
for my debt?

247
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:10,820
Hu Yang,

248
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,060
I have plenty

249
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,510
of money.

250
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,220
But even between friends,

251
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,510
we have to be clear about things.

252
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,430
I don't mind lending you money.

253
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,820
But can you even pay it back?

254
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,150
Just help me out this time.

255
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,150
It's not much,

256
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,500
just a few hundred thousand yuan.

257
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:29,820
I know you

258
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:31,580
too well.

259
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,740
You're drowning in debt,

260
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,700
can't even make 100,000 yuan in a year,

261
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,310
and you gambled away

262
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,670
your parents' house.

263
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,390
Shi,

264
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,510
if you don't help me, no one will.

265
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,060
Get up.

266
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,580
You look pathetic like this.

267
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,820
Letting you stay here

268
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,510
is already a favor.

269
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,580
As for the money,

270
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,510
figure it out yourself.

271
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,430
Here, take this for now.

272
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,910
We're friends
so no need for all the talk.

273
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,860
This is all I have on me today.

274
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:06,740
Make do with it.

275
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:08,860
Okay.

276
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,100
Captain Gu,

277
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,270
here's the surveillance footage

278
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,630
related to the Monkey Song case.

279
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:36,510
Also,

280
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,030
(Assessment Report)
the rental records were fake.

281
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,310
The place was completely wiped clean.

282
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,670
But our tech team managed

283
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,190
to recover some fingerprints.

284
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:46,910
The match confirms

285
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,150
the tenant

286
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:50,940
was Wang Qifeng.

287
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,270
Bring him here now.

288
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:11,630
Tong, your face is all messy.

289
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,940
What a messy eater.

290
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,310
You're the messy one.

291
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,860
Let me see who the real messy one is.

292
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:19,940
Daddy,

293
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,820
you said if I'm brave,
I will get a reward.

294
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,430
I want to go on the roller coaster
at the amusement park.

295
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,940
When will you take me?

296
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,980
That takes a lot of courage.

297
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,670
But you're the bravest, right?

298
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,270
Tomorrow's the weekend.

299
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,700
How about I take you tomorrow?

300
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,580
Thank you, Daddy!

301
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,630
You are welcome.

302
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,940
Tomorrow,
we're going to the amusement park.

303
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,030
Mister,

304
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,270
is our food ready?

305
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,340
Almost done!

306
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,190
Sorry about that.

307
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,130
It's really busy today.

308
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,100
Tong, are you too hungry
to wait for the vegetables?

309
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,030
How about I go

310
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,470
and order two dishes at that stall?

311
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,430
Can I go and pick some myself?

312
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:55,790
- You're not well.
- Yourself?

313
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,030
I want to take care of Mommy.

314
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,740
My good girl.

315
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,030
Do you want me to go with you?

316
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:00,460
It's okay.

317
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,630
Be careful, okay?

318
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,390
Be careful!

319
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,550
She's growing up.

320
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,030
Yeah.

321
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,860
She's thoughtful now.

322
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:10,860
Honey,

323
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:12,670
let's have a drink together.

324
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,550
You're so annoying.

325
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,150
Just a little.

326
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:14,910
Give it to me.

327
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,610
No matter how good this wine is,

328
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,150
you should drink less, got it?

329
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,060
You have an art exhibit coming up.

330
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,690
What if your hands shake while painting?

331
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:23,460
Yes, ma'am.

332
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:24,670
No more drinking.

333
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:28,190
Mister, I want this one and this one.

334
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,060
This one and this one?

335
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:29,790
Okay.

336
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:30,910
I'll prepare them for you.

337
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:31,310
Okay.

338
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:32,980
Cheng helped out a lot

339
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,390
with the art exhibit this time.

340
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,550
As his brother-in-law,

341
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,940
you better bring out your best work.

342
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,820
Of course.

343
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:42,310
Honey,

344
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,390
do you know

345
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,190
what my proudest work is?

346
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:47,630
What?

347
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,550
Our daughter, Tong.

348
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,670
Thank you

349
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,580
for giving me a happy family.

350
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,030
That's why I have to work even harder

351
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,190
to make sure
both of you have a wonderful life.

352
00:15:59,190 --> 00:15:59,880
Have some shrimp.

353
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:01,700
Move!

354
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,870
Stop!

355
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,500
Stop running!

356
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,500
Get out of my way!

357
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,190
Stop!

358
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,300
Hold it right there!

359
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:08,940
Stop!

360
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:09,500
Out of my way!

361
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:10,630
Move aside!

362
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:11,910
Stop running!

363
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,110
Move aside!

364
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:13,870
Out of my way!

365
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:14,590
Take cover!

366
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,020
Don't come!

367
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,870
I will kill her for real!

368
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,490
- Put the gun down!
- Put the knife down!

369
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:21,500
Put down your gun!

370
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,020
Don't move!

371
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:22,460
Tong!

372
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:22,910
Don't move!

373
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,630
Put your gun down!
Don't make me kill her!

374
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,150
- I will kill her!
- Tong!

375
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:26,870
Tong!

376
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,070
Don't go over there!

377
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:28,980
It's dangerous!

378
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:29,870
Tong!

379
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:30,460
I'm not scared.

380
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,870
The police will save me.

381
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,460
Don't make me do this!

382
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:34,870
Put your gun down!

383
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,190
I will kill her if you don't!

384
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:37,740
Meng!

385
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,390
Put your knife down first.

386
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:42,110
Meng!

387
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,220
Meng!

388
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:43,590
Down!

389
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,350
Meng, are you okay?

390
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,300
Don't make me do this!

391
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,110
Where's your medicine?

392
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:53,700
Calm down.

393
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:03,870
Okay!

394
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:06,880
I'll put it down.

395
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,590
Let her go and I'll your hostage.

396
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:11,430
Don't come near me!

397
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,700
Yingsong, be careful!

398
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,910
Eat your medicine.

399
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,150
Don't come any closer!

400
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,300
Tong!

401
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,460
Meng.

402
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,300
Are you okay?

403
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:19,630
Let's die together then.

404
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:38,980
Tong!

405
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,860
(Gu Zhen. Kong Yingsong. Kong Rubai.
Yin Qing. Jiang Xiaotang)

406
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,860
(Wang Jian. Wang Letong. Xue Meng)

407
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:03,940
Stayed up late again?

408
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:05,980
Have some breakfast.

409
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,540
The first time I saw him

410
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,700
was at the scene
of the food stall explosion.

411
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:21,740
His name was Wang Qifeng,

412
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,700
a well-known painter.

413
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,070
After that incident,

414
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,460
he fell into severe depression

415
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,500
and went abroad.

416
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:30,700
Years later,

417
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,670
he returned under the name Wang Jian,

418
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,870
opened an art gallery,

419
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,300
and even became the owner
of art training centers.

420
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,630
He seemed to be
a successful businessman.

421
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:41,740
But behind the scenes,

422
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,670
he and his brother-in-law,
Xue Cheng, were involved

423
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:45,740
(Wang Jian. Xue Cheng)

424
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:48,180
(Bai Zhigang. Hu Yang)
in illegal loans and money laundering.

425
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,150
Money was just a tool.

426
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,350
Everything he did

427
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,460
was for revenge.

428
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:57,630
His targets were...

429
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:58,630
Yin Qing,

430
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,430
Feng Chao's mother,

431
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:03,780
Monkey Song,

432
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:06,910
and me.

433
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,940
This is the scapegoat effect.

434
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,540
When someone experiences
intense emotions and impulses

435
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,910
due to an incident

436
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,740
but has no way

437
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,260
to direct them to the real cause.

438
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,330
They'll shift those feelings
onto another target.

439
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,350
In his case,

440
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,360
Feng Chao was responsible
for his daughter's death.

441
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,020
But Feng Chao died in the explosion.

442
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,070
He couldn't target on him.

443
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,980
So he directed his revenge

444
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:33,190
on the people connected
to Feng Chao instead.

445
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,300
Yin Qing was Feng Chao's girlfriend.

446
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,350
She used her looks

447
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,590
to help him kidnap people

448
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,780
and was an accomplice in the case.

449
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,590
So Wang Jian burned her alive.

450
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:47,190
Feng Chao's mother spoiled him
to the extreme.

451
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,300
So Wang Jian crushed her legs
with scrap metal.

452
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:52,150
Monkey Song rented a place to Feng Chao

453
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,890
and kept quiet about his activities.

454
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,830
So Wang Jian cut out his tongue.

455
00:19:58,870 --> 00:19:59,500
As for me,

456
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,780
I failed to save his daughter.

457
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:06,110
The caller who sympathized with me

458
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:07,630
was probably Wang Jian

459
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,500
because I'm also the family of a victim.

460
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,300
Wang Jian lost his family

461
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,980
and is indeed pitiful.

462
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:21,420
But we can't let personal emotions
interfere with the case.

463
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,910
What he had done

464
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,430
was already a serious crime.

465
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:26,670
Our top priority

466
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,670
is to track him down

467
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:29,690
and bring him to justice.

468
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:30,870
Yingsong...

469
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,190
I mean Rubai.

470
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:37,220
We need to put in

471
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,550
more effort on this case.

472
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:45,260
By the way,

473
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,150
is your place habitable?

474
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,590
If it is,

475
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,020
you should move back.

476
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,980
You're afraid Wang Jian
will come after you

477
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,840
and drag me into it.

478
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,020
No, that's not it.

479
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,940
Don't overthink it.

480
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,590
What I mean is,

481
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,190
we're two grown men.

482
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,150
Living together

483
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:08,590
isn't exactly convenient.

484
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,020
I can stay with you and help you.

485
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:10,930
Stop talking nonsense!

486
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,590
I'm your superior!

487
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,980
When I give an order, you follow it!

488
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:14,940
Just move out!

489
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:25,110
Okay.

490
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,500
Then take care.

491
00:21:44,014 --> 00:21:50,460
(Criminal Investigation Division)

492
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,110
If you remember anything
about Wang Jian,

493
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,150
let us know immediately.

494
00:21:59,701 --> 00:22:01,900
(Criminal Investigation Division)

495
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,940
(Huaizhou Public Security Bureau)

496
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,110
He and Liu Ang were classmates.

497
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:33,740
Unfortunately,

498
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,780
we've already looked into

499
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,980
all of Wang Jian's connections

500
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,260
and possible hideouts.

501
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:39,540
But we've got nothing.

502
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,350
I've asked them to check
the surveillance

503
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,220
to see if we can track him down.

504
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,540
Is this his daughter?

505
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,390
(The one who hurt Yin Qing,
Feng Chao's mother, and Monkey Song)

506
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:07,350
(was Wang Jian.)

507
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:10,500
(Who will he target next?)

508
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,020
(Jiang Xiaotang's Residence)

509
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,220
Smells so good, Geezer Gu.

510
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:18,220
This is nothing.

511
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,630
Why making so many dishes?

512
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,220
That's nothing.

513
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,590
The real highlight is right here.

514
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:25,830
Geezer Gu,

515
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,670
did you learn to make this dish?

516
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,300
You never made this before.

517
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,150
I learned

518
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:31,780
to make this dish from Mr. Chang

519
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,500
because it's your birthday.

520
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,700
So, is this my birthday gift?

521
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,540
What else do you expect?

522
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:42,740
Geezer Gu,

523
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,700
you are seriously
the most clueless guy.

524
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:47,150
But I appreciate the effort.

525
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:49,940
It's the thought that counts.

526
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,980
Enough with the talking.

527
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:54,910
I'll get the door.

528
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:55,830
Go.

529
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,390
Su, come inside.

530
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:00,910
Xiaotang.

531
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:02,740
You're finally here.

532
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,150
Geezer Gu.

533
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:05,980
What are you doing here?

534
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,460
Xiaotang called me eighteen times.

535
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,990
If I don't show up, it'd be a terrible.

536
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:10,070
Take a seat.

537
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:10,500
Sit there.

538
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:11,430
Sit down.

539
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:12,390
Xiaotang,

540
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,070
here's a gift.

541
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:15,700
Happy birthday.

542
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,910
A smartwatch?

543
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,110
Look!

544
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,300
Thank you, Su!

545
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,670
What's so great about a smartwatch?

546
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:24,540
I like it very much.

547
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,190
It's not as practical as food.

548
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:27,780
Geezer Gu.

549
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,070
You may be the best brother
in the world.

550
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,390
But you are still lacking

551
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:32,870
compared to Su.

552
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:33,910
Wow.

553
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,700
All it takes is a smartwatch
to buy you over.

554
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:38,670
You'd make a great traitor.

555
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:39,590
Enough showing off.

556
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,220
Let's eat.

557
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,300
All right, time to eat!

558
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,670
Geezer Gu,

559
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,390
for my lunar birthday next month,

560
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:51,150
can you get me a Ming-style Hanfu dress?

561
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,070
All my classmates have one.

562
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,540
Even Anna has several.

563
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,020
What? A smart dress?

564
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,740
A dress from the Ming Dynasty.

565
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,350
Same as always.

566
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,590
Once you graduate and start working,

567
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,460
you can buy whatever you want.

568
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,430
That hurts.

569
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:10,070
She's using the lunar birthday

570
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,700
as an excuse to get another gift.

571
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,300
Gu,

572
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,460
your wallet is in danger.

573
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,020
Su,

574
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:19,390
Gu is stingy and you're mean.

575
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,460
You two really are a perfect match.

576
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:23,870
Enough joking.

577
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:25,980
It's time to light the candles.

578
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,540
Come.

579
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,500
Make a wish, Xiaotang.

580
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,500
I'll make my wish then.

581
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:37,460
I hope Geezer Gu and my sister,
Jiang Ying,

582
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:39,980
can find happiness,

583
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,070
stop arguing,

584
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,740
and live well.

585
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:45,630
And I hope their smart, adorable,
and lively little sister,

586
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:46,390
Jiang Xiaotang,

587
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:47,830
can grow up happy

588
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,500
and safe.

589
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:53,980
Happy birthday to you.

590
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,300
Happy birthday to you.

591
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:01,020
Happy birthday to me.

592
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:04,430
(Happy birthday to me.)

593
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,540
I survived another year.

594
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,020
Hurry now.

595
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:12,670
Let's eat.

596
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:26,220
This dish is tasty.

597
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:27,910
Is it?

598
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:28,460
Yes.
