(Command Center)

4
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:41,620
Hello?

5
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,190
What?

6
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,870
A dead body at the bar?

7
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,660
(Branch Commander's Office)

8
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:31,100
Su Qian,

9
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,840
Any findings about the victim?

10
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,340
Rigor mortis has set in.

11
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:36,580
Estimated time of death
was two to three hours ago.

12
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,150
It's 6:30 AM now.

13
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,620
So that puts the time of death
at around 3 or 4 AM.

14
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,940
Based on the angle of the wounds,

15
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,820
the attacker likely struck from behind.

16
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,380
(Lei Wei, Bar Owner)
I wasn't at the scene.

17
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,190
I was drinking in a private room

18
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,060
when I suddenly heard people shouting

19
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:18,750
about a death.

20
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,750
So I went out to check

21
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,620
and there he was.

22
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:23,620
And you?

23
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,660
Last night was hectic.

24
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,620
Five of us were working

25
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,100
and swamped.

26
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,270
You're the bar owner, right?

27
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,310
Yes.

28
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,340
Tell me what happened.

29
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,190
Well, someone threatened
to kill him last night.

30
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,990
I didn't expect him
to end up dead for real.

31
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:43,990
Captain Gu!

32
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:45,590
I'm here!

33
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,590
I'm already here!

34
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,270
Sorry,

35
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:49,900
I came late.

36
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,900
I got stuck in traffic.

37
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,500
Maybe when you

38
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,430
ditch your big SUV
for an electric scooter,

39
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,590
you won't be late.

40
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:58,900
All right.

41
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,470
Now,

42
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,150
back to the case.

43

You guys

44
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,100
won't believe this.

45

A female university student

46
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,470
barged in and attacked Matteo.

47
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,710
I remember Matteo saying,

48
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,430
"If I die tonight,

49
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,380
it's that crazy Jiang Xiaotang
who did it."

52
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,380
Just cooperate.

(Forensic Studio)

54
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:01,750
Don't be nervous.

55
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:02,940
You should know

56
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,940
that dealing with the living
is actually harder.

57
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:05,380
No,

58
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,620
I'm not nervous.

59
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,100
Have you identified the victim?

60
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,310
Lei Wei said

61
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,310
he only knew the victim's English name,

62
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,260
Matteo.

63
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,820
He was a regular there.

64
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,020
Matteo, huh?

65
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,550
English names are tricky to track.

66
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:27,500
Lei Wei said

67
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,580
the victim went there every week

68
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,260
and was always with a different girl.

69
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,430
Wait, it's him?

70
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:39,460
You know him?

71
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:41,990
Well, not personally.

72
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,700
But I know of him.

73
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,310
Just get to the point.

74
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,190
His real name was Liu Ang.

75
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,910
He was an art instructor
at an adult education center,

76
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,110
specializing in figure drawing.

77
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,820
His artwork often depicted women

78
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,820
with a kind of melancholic charm.

79
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,820
He's regarded as the contemporary artist
who understands women best.

80
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,230
Like so-called women's best friend.

81
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,580
So he was quite popular.

82
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,200
Open your mouth.

83
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:29,910
Geezer Gu.

84
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,260
Captain Gu,

85
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:32,700
you shouldn't be here.

86
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,190
Okay.

87
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,140
Captain Gu,

88
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,190
the suspect is your girlfriend's sister.

89
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,430
Even though you're not related,

90
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,060
you should recuse yourself.

91
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:44,500
No,

92
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,260
we already broke up.

93
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,340
Still, best recuse yourself.

94
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:50,990
Captain Gu,

95
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,550
don't take it personally.

96
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,500
Xiaotang...

97
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,990
She is just going
through standard procedures.

98
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,990
There's no solid evidence
against her yet.

99
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:00,380
So don't worry.

100
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,190
Yue.

101
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,550
Be serious.

102
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,310
Jiang Xiaotang,

103
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,280
what was your relationship with Liu Ang?

104
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,940
He was kind of my ex-boyfriend.

105
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,060
Did you say in the bar

106
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,140
you'd kill him?

107
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,430
Yes, I did.

108
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,033
(Q: Did you say in the bar
you'd kill him?)

109
00:06:39,034 --> 00:06:39,780
(A: Yes, I did.)

110
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,380
Welcome!

111
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,140
Have a good time tonight!

112
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:56,790
Excuse me.

113
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,540
Gotta do something.

114
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:04,910
Hey, ladies.

115
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,140
Do you want to have fun with us?

116
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,230
Go away.

117
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,060
Let's go.

118
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,190
Oh...

119
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,430
You've been working overtime

120
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,190
with another woman, huh?

121
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,910
You piece of trash!

122
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:30,550
Stop it!

123
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,100
Xiaotang!

124
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:31,940
You trash!

125
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:32,820
Stop it.

126
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,310
You think I won't hit you, a woman?

127
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:36,940
Fine!

128
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,550
Let's see who takes who down first!

129
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,550
Stop hitting...

130
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,790
What are you doing?

131
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:42,740
Stay out of this!

132
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,460
Just stop it already!

133
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,980
I'm going to kill you today!

(Weili Bar)

135
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:00,860
Everyone saw that.

136
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,220
If I die, it's that crazy

137
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,100
Jiang Xiaotang who did it!

138
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,190
Listen here.

139
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,030
We can't both exist in the same world.
It's either me or you!

140
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:08,630
Miss.

141
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,340
Crazy!

142
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:09,700
Come.

143
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,520
- Leave.
- Let's go.

144
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,700
I'll kill you!

145
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,190
Leave.

146
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:13,670
Let's go.

147
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,580
Where did you go

148
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,510
after that?

149
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:19,700
I...

150
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,630
I wandered around the streets.

151
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,790
Was anyone with you?

152
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,340
Anna followed me at first.

153
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,340
But she was annoying so I left her.

156
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,940
Leave me alone.

157
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:34,940
You can go if you want.

160
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:38,860
Come with me.

161
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,670
Leave me alone. Just go home.

163
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:06,860
Help!

00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,550
Help me!

165
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,670
Oh, Earth Mother.

166
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:19,030
Let my son return to me.

167
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,510
Help, madam!

168
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,150
Come back.

169
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,310
Come back.

170
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,550
Oh, Heavenly Father.

171
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,550
Help!

172
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,310
Madam, help me!

173
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,100
Dead?

174
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,460
Help!

175
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,340
Whose son died?

176
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,980
My son died?

177
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,550
Why him?

178
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,460
Why not you?

179
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,580
Help me, madam.

180
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,630
You should just die.

181
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,700
Then you can marry my son
in the afterlife.

182
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,910
Be his wife.

183
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,270
(Women's Bathroom)

184
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:10,150
(I was out of it
and someone pushed me into the river.)

185
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,270
(My clothes got all dirty.)

186
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,580
I can't believe someone pushed me.

187
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,390
(I went to a restroom to clean up.)

188
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,150
(When I was done,
it was already morning.)

189
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:22,580
Look.

190
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,550
There are still mud stains
on my clothes.

191
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,860
My hands are scraped too.

192
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,430
And after that?

193
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,100
The school gate opened,
so I went straight to class.

194
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,910
Why didn't you go home?

195
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:43,860
I...

196
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,150
I don't have a home

197
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:47,910
to go back to.

198
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,190
Otherwise, I wouldn't

199
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,700
have ended up dating a loser like him.

200
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:55,550
Is he accusing me of assault?

201
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,220
Listen,

202
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,460
we fought each other.

203
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,670
If you're arresting me,

204
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,310
it's only fair if you arrest him too.

205
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,860
He's already dead.

206
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,790
I want to see Geezer Gu.

207
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:17,550
Captain Gu.

208
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:25,580
Rubai.

209
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,580
Can I have a few minutes?

210
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,340
Just a quick word.

211
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,340
Did you forget

212
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,460
the "Recusal Principle?

213
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,390
I know the rules.

214
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,270
I won't interfere
with the investigation.

215
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,220
I only want to provide
some personal details

216
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,060
about Xiaotang as a witness.

217
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,740
Maybe it'll help you.

218
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,080
(Forensic Studio)
Bringing personal feelings

219
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,060
into an investigation is a big taboo.

220
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:43,980
Look at you.

221
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,580
Your emotions are all over your face.

222
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:47,860
What?

223
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:49,940
I'm not like Kong Rubai,

224
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,460
wearing a long face all day.

225
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,860
Like the world owes him something.

226
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,790
He died from a single stab wound.

227
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,030
The attacker was precise and efficient.

228
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,190
The weapon

229
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,030
was likely a short knife,
around 20 cm long.

230
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,510
Also,

231
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,580
the victim had a high alcohol level
in his blood.

232
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,390
There's one more thing.

233
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,630
The victim had late-stage

234
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,860
liver cancer.

235
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,100
Less than six months to live.

236
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,670
Liver cancer
and he was still drinking that much?

237
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:17,860
The symptoms aren't obvious at first.

238
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,150
The patient would only

239
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,670
feel fatigue and loss of appetite

240
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,100
without obvious discomfort.

241
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,910
There's a good chance

242
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,940
Liu Ang didn't even know

243
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:27,940
he had liver cancer.

244
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,340
His wallet, watch, and other valuables

245
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,270
weren't taken.

246
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,630
So it wasn't a robbery.

247
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:35,790
If

248
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,030
the killer knew

249
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,460
the target was already dying,

250
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:40,550
how'd they feel?

251
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,790
Found the murder weapon?

252
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,630
Not yet.

253
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:50,100
The killer was left-handed.

254
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,630
But Xiaotang is right-handed.

255
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,630
Doesn't that mean she's...

256
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,670
It takes a lot of strength

257
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,430
to ambush and control

258
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:00,820
a grown man from behind.

259
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,220
A girl like Xiaotang

260
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,670
would struggle with that.

261
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:05,820
Of course,

262
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,740
it's just speculation,

263
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,460
not solid proof.

264
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,580
When the killer made his move
on Liu Ang,

265
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,220
the stab severed an artery,

266
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,430
meaning the victim's blood

267
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,940
would have sprayed out instantly.

268
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:19,860
If that's the case,

269
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,430
there should be bloodstains

270
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,510
on the killer's sleeves.

271
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,100
I'll check the security footage

272
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,150
to track Xiaotang's movements
last night.

273
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:29,510
No need.

274
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,580
I sent someone to do it.

275
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,460
We'll know it soon.

276
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,130
When did you get here?

277
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:33,940
Just now.

278
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,030
So you heard everything?

279
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:39,460
But don't you think this suit lining
is a little too fancy?

280
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,150
Are all men's suits

281
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,150
this flashy inside?

282
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,550
Wow, this is good stuff.

283
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,100
What do you mean?

284
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:47,980
Let me take a look.

285
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,670
The lining of this suit

286
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,220
is a Van Gogh painting.

287
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:53,430
This

288
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,940
has to be custom-made

289
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,430
at a specialty fabric manufacturer.

290
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:58,980
The fabric, lining,

291
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:02,150
and buttons of this suit

292
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,630
are all custom-made and high-end.

293
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:06,860
Give me an estimate.

294
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,740
Five thousand yuan?

295
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,700
Add another zero.

296
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,910
That's way too extravagant

297
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:15,980
for an instructor.

298
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,630
And this shirt

299
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,740
is high-thread-count Egyptian cotton.

300
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,100
It's custom-made

301
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,350
from the same store as the suit.

302
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,100
How much for the shirt?

303
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,100
Around fifteen thousand,

304
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,510
maybe more.

305
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,820
Seems like our instructor
was living large.

306
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,940
Where did he get the money for all this?

307
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,630
I don't know where the money came from.

308
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,270
But I think I know where the store is.

309
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,820
Heavenly Father...

310
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,550
Earth Mother...

311
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:47,030
Please let my son

312
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,940
come home.

313
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,190
Heavenly Father...

314
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,150
Earth Mother...

315
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,150
Please let my son

316
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,430
come home.

317
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,670
Son,

318
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,460
come home.

319
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,300
Miss.

320
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,460
Wake up, miss.

321
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,540
Pale Reaper has killed someone!

322
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:24,540
Pale Reaper!

323
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,070
Pale Reaper has killed someone!

324
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:33,940
Move and stay put.

325
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:34,830
I didn't do it.

326
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,740
- Behave.
- I didn't do it.

327
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,460
Stop struggling!

328
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:43,220
We searched the whole bar.

329
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,220
But just miss this spot.

330
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,270
Then another body turns up.

331
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,830
The timing is too perfect.

332
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,260
Captain Gu,

333
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,870
the role-playing show
doesn't disappoint.

334
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,300
Either there are no murders,

335
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,540
or there are two at once.

336
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,150
No coat in this weather,

337
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,350
no bag either.

338
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,430
That means they were either disposed of

339
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,590
or dumped somewhere else.

340
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,780
Or the victim wasn't killed here.

341
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,190
Back shows postmortem staining,

342
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:20,940
meaning she was lying down

343
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:22,150
after her death.

344
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:23,460
So it means

345
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,110
she was likely moved here later.

346
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,540
This could be a body dump site.

347
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,150
It's possible.

348
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:31,940
But we need more evidence.

349
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,500
Bleeding in the eyes,

350
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,980
damage to the mouth's inner lining,

351
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,020
facial swelling, and pale discoloration

352
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,350
around the nose and mouth.

353
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:44,110
Her mouth and nose
were most likely covered,

354
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,350
which led to suffocation.

355
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:45,830
(Forensic)

356
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:48,020
We'll need further tests to confirm.

357
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:52,300
Missing half a fingernail.

358
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,980
Looks like she fought back hard

359
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,500
before she died.

360
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,220
The lividity is starting to blur.

361
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,940
There's mild clouding in the corneas.

362
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,910
The victim has been dead

363
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,590
for about twelve hours.

364
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,940
She was likely killed around dawn.

365
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,940
There are marks
on her wrists and ankles.

366
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,940
It looks like she was tied up

367
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,970
before being brought here.

368
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,110
Killing her out of hate is one thing.

369
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,270
But posing the body so delicately...

370
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,110
Could it be love?

371
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,430
Loving her, then killing her.

372
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:31,780
After death, dumping her here.

373
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,460
Pale Reaper will take you all

374
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,500
and drag you to hell

375
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:42,190
to climb the Mountain of Blades
and sink into the Boiling Oil.

376
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:44,910
Meet your doom!

377
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,910
Anyone who comes to my store

378
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,670
is my client.

379
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,980
And my clients' information

380
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,150
is something I must protect.

381
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,500
They come here for custom suits,

382
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:10,070
spending more time and money

383
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,830
than they would
on an off-the-rack piece.

384
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,940
That's not so I can gossip about them.

385
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,190
But the problem is,

386
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,500
one of your clients was murdered
in a bar

387
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,870
while wearing your suit.

388
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:21,740
Murder?

389
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,070
Someone died?

390
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,460
It was that serious?

391
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:29,670
My store

392
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,350
doesn't cater to anyone.

393
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:35,190
Liu Ang clearly didn't belong here.

394
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,260
Did he buy more

395
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:40,020
than one suit from you?

396
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,350
Let me check the records.

397
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:45,220
If I remember right, he ordered
at least seven or eight shirts.

398
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,110
And more suits.

399
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,110
Did he pay for all of them himself?

400
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,300
Depends on how you look at it.

401
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,300
What do you mean?

402
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,070
Mr. K,

403
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:06,390
just get to the point already.

404
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,630
We're friends

405
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:08,780
and there are no outsiders.

406
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:09,980
Back then,

407
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,630
my dad had ordered suits from you

408
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,110
before you even had this shop.

409
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,910
Just tell us.

410
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:19,940
Mister,

411
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,110
your ring looks unique.

412
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,590
This?

413
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,700
Looks like a ring, doesn't it?

414
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,670
It's actually a thimble
I've been used for years.

415
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,220
Tailors like us

416
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:33,940
can only wear thimbles on our fingers.

417
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,190
Give me a moment.

418
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:41,430
I'll check the records.

419
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:53,020
Here are all the client records.

420
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:00,380
(K Tailoring Purchase Records)

421
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:02,590
Liu Ang first came
to my store four years ago.

422
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,220
What I remember is,

423
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,740
every time he visited,

424
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,780
he brought a different woman.

425
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,670
This… This is too expensive.

426
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:18,500
Maybe another one.

427
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,910
If I want to prove my sincerity,

428
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:20,910
what's a little money?

429
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,670
All right. Just a moment.

430
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:26,260
Okay.

431
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,700
(Q: Did you say in the bar
you'd kill him?)
