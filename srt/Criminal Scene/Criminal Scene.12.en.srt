=Episode 12=

3
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:13,820
Xiaotang.

4
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:14,780
Hello, Anna.

5
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,500
I got your gift.

6
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,470
I like it very much.

7
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,100
By the way,

8
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,060
I don't even know if Zhen has caught

9
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,620
that creep who's been following me yet.

10
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,710
Do you know
who is the one following you?

11
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,780
Every time he appears
in security footage,

12
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,030
he's wearing a hat.

13
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,230
We can't see his face at all.

14
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,550
Anna, say something.

15
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,100
What's wrong, Anna?

16
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:38,190
Nothing.

17
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,470
I was thinking
that Gu was a police officer.

18
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,150
He got someone to protect you.

19
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,500
You'll be fine.

20
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,190
Something came up.

21
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,220
So I'm hanging up now.

22
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:47,900
Okay.

23
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,710
You, go ahead.

24
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,150
Bye.

25
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,550
Mr. Wang,

26
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:54,780
you're back.

27
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,270
Why did you touch my things?

28
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,660
Why did you touch my things?

29
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:15,990
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,030
You saw everything,

31
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:26,550
didn't you?

32
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,030
I...

33
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,820
I was looking through some references
and saw it by accident.

34
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,470
Let me tell you a story.

35
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,310
There was this pitiful man.

36
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,430
To others,

37
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,580
he appeared glamorous

38
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,700
and a promising artist.

39
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,110
But in reality, he had nothing.

40
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,430
Maybe he was a little rich.

41
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,310
But he was nothing more
than a lonely stray dog.

42
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,190
Until one day,

43
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,110
he met a kind woman.

44
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,670
And suddenly, his life

45
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:48,820
and his world

46
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,500
became bright.

47
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,140
Then

48
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,190
they had a daughter.

49
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,550
A beautiful little girl.

50
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,310
Every day, he watched his wife

51
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,750
and daughter,

52
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,910
feeling like

53
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,350
this was the life

54
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,790
and the world

55
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,670
he was meant to have.

56
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,700
But one day,

57
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,580
he watched helplessly

58
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,110
as his daughter died right
in front of him.

59
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,060
He couldn't do anything.

60
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,190
His wife

61
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,700
broke down little by little.

62
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,820
He was powerless.

63
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,500
He could never forget

64
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,020
that moment his daughter died
in front of him.

65
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,990
Flames were everywhere.

66
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,750
Everywhere.

67
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,110
He could hear his daughter crying out,

68
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,940
"Daddy, it hurts.

69
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,230
It hurts so much.

70
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,230
Please help me.

71
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,140
- It hurts..."
- Daddy. Daddy.

72
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,670
So

73
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,580
it was all his fault.

74
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,060
It was all his fault!

75
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,790
He should have died!

76
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,990
It's his fault!

77
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,350
He should've died!

78
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,310
No, that's not true.

79
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,260
You have to live for your daughter.

80
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:36,910
It's okay now.

81
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,310
It's okay.

82
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,230
Everything is okay now.

83
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:44,580
Anna,

84
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,310
tell me something.

85
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,990
Will you always believe me?

86
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,060
I will.

87
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,140
I believe you.

88
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:01,350
I will.

89
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,380
What if one day

90
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,670
I lose my mind?

91
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,940
Will you still believe me?

92
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,060
Yes.

93
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,750
I will.

94
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,460
I will believe you.

95
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:17,580
It's okay now.

96
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:54,740
(Wuhou Town)

97
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:55,700
Officers,

98
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,020
Wu Shenglin is up ahead.

99
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,430
In our village, only these two brothers
surnamed Wu,

100
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,260
Wu Shenglin

101
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,060
and Wu Shengshan.

102
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,870
Is there anyone else in their family?

103
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,820
Wu Shengshan has a wife.

104
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,190
But they had a fight

105
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,140
a few days ago.

106
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,820
She went to her parents' house.

107
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,460
I gave him a scolding for it.

108
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,260
He went to pick her up today.

109
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,620
Probably not home.

110
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:16,310
As for Wu Shenglin, he's single.

111
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,230
He's the younger one.

112
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:17,940
He should be home.

113
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,750
What kind of person is Wu Shenglin?

114
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,620
He likes to take small advantages

115
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,750
but nothing serious.

116
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,940
Did he commit any crime?

117
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,580
No.

118
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,230
We just need to ask him a few questions.

119
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:27,980
Lin!

120
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,060
Come here.

121
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:29,980
Yes, Mr. Wang.

122
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,700
These two officers want to talk to you.

123
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,340
Stop!

124
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,740
Why are you running?

125
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:41,860
Next time,

126
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,000
don't run from police

127
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,220
if you didn't commit any crime.

128
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,310
Is this your ID?

129
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,310
Is this mine?

130
00:07:58,850 --> 00:07:59,820
It doesn't look like it.

131
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:04,700
Then where's your ID?

132
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,270
I don't have it.

133
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,430
Have you been to Huaizhou recently?

134
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:15,220
Huaizhou?

135
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,030
No.

136
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:16,730
Never been there.

137
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,190
I swear!

138
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,200
I haven't left the village

139
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,310
in over half a month.

140
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,580
Think again.

141
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:26,990
If you don't believe me, ask Mr. Wang.

142
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,550
Mr. Wang, you know

143
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,190
I've never been there.

144
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,940
The kid's telling the truth.

145
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,940
He's been hanging around the village

146
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,150
drinking and playing cards.

147
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,820
I see him every day.

148
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,030
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

149
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:42,980
Your ID is missing,

150
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:44,670
and you can't explain why.

151
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,980
So many people died

152
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,200
in the Huaizhou explosion case.

153
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,150
I'm sure you know
since it's all over the news.

154
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,260
Do you really think
you can just cover this up?

155
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,030
I don't know anything!

156
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,060
Wait... I remember now.

157
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,630
I lost my ID.

158
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,100
Jiang Peng lost it!

159
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,150
Sit down.

160
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,150
Mr. Wang, do you still remember

161
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,700
Jiang Peng?

162
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:05,940
Yes, I do.

163
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,460
I remember he looked quite a bit

164
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,820
like you two brothers.

165
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,910
But how did your ID end up with him?

166
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,190
He got it from me.

167
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,550
This is a serious situation.

168
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,940
Just tell the truth.

169
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,980
Do you really think
you can fool the police?

170
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,820
You haven't even had a wife yet.

171
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,630
All right. All right!

172
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,820
About two months ago,

173
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,700
Jiang Peng came to me.

174
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,910
He asked to borrow my ID for a bit.

175
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:29,980
Lin, one more drink.

176
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,060
Lin, I came to have a drink with you

177
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,060
because I need a favor.

178
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,940
Can I borrow your ID for a while?

179
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,860
I want to go to the internet café
to play games.

180
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,190
You finally feel like playing?

181
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,430
That's the spirit!

182
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,940
(Name: Wu Shenglin)
Go and have fun.

183
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,100
Where's your ID?

184
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,270
Why do you need mine?

185
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,740
They kept mine as collateral.

186
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,830
They haven't given it back.

187
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:58,940
Those scums.

188
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,630
Tomorrow, I'll go

189
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,150
and curse them out for you.

190
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:03,940
Take it.

191
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:05,860
Thanks, Lin.

192
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,190
About that thing...

193
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,910
Just let it go.

194
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,630
If you can let it go,

195
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,790
all will be good.

196
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,100
Two days later, he told me

197
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,190
his bag had been stolen
when he was at the internet café.

198
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,460
My ID was in it.

199
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,790
I figured

200
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,460
he didn't do it on purpose.

201
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:31,630
Besides,

202
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,460
getting a new ID isn't that troublesome.

203
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,700
So I didn't say anything.

204
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,630
You just casually lent out

205
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,980
something as important as your ID?

206
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,550
Jiang Peng was a good guy.

207
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,940
He often buys me drinks.

208
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,630
When my family was struggling,

209
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:44,790
he always helped out.

210
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,670
Besides,

211
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,980
we work together.

212
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,150
Mr. Wang, isn't that right?

213
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,700
Right?

214
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,630
What's right about that?

215
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:54,060
Do you want to spend a few days
behind bars?

216
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,550
I've watched you grow up.

217
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,250
I know exactly
what kind of person you are.

218
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,460
You must've gotten something in return.

219
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,820
Otherwise,
why would you lend him your ID?

220
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,700
Stop hitting!

221
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,030
Please

222
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:04,910
stop!

223
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,060
I'll say it. I asked him for 500 yuan.

224
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,150
First, he gave me 200 yuan
as collateral.

225
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,700
Then he paid me another 300 yuan.

226
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,910
That's not illegal, is it?

227
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,100
All this trouble

228
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,580
for 500 yuan?

229
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,100
Enough!

230
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,460
I want both of you

231
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,430
to take turns

232
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,510
to see which one is Jiang Peng.

233
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,500
You, come over here.

234
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,670
You, face the other way.

235
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,270
This one.

236
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:40,510
Are you sure?

237
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,220
Yes, I'm sure.

238
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,030
Okay.

239
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:42,740
You, come here.

240
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,150
This is Jiang Peng.

241
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,860
But 01 looks familiar.

242
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:07,820
Mr. Wang,

243
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:08,790
take a look.

244
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,580
I think so.

245
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,630
This is Jiang Peng.

246
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,220
Okay, you can sit down.

247
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:22,860
Is Jiang Peng from here?

248
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,700
No.

249
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,510
He came to our village over a year ago.

250
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,630
He's from Xinquan.

251
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,860
He had no family
and wanted to make a living.

252
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,790
So he worked at the quarry.

253
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,100
He was honest and hardworking.

254
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:36,060
Someone in the village
even took a liking to him

255
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,220
and was making him

256
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,550
a live-in son-in-law.

257
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,390
But then the quarry collapsed,

258
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,430
and he got caught in it.

259
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,100
He may have survived.

260
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,190
But...

261
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,740
He wasn't a whole man anymore.

262
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,150
Then he tried

263
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,580
to get compensation from the quarry,

264
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,740
asking for 500,000 yuan,

265
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,860
but they were only willing
to pay him 50,000 yuan

266
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,630
He kept pushing for compensation.

267
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,510
But instead of paying him,

268
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,310
they beat him up.

269
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,550
After that, he just left.

270
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:02,700
Where did he go?

271
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,910
He never told me.

272
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,190
Mr. Wang,

273
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,790
that Victim 01,

274
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,030
I remember he was close to Jiang Peng.

275
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,630
Do you remember

276
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,150
he used to come and see him?

277
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,310
Ah, yes.

278
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,700
It was that 01.

279
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,820
They even went to the quarry together
to demand compensation.

280
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,700
But they never came back after that.

281
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,150
What was Jiang Peng's

282
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,860
friend's name?

283
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,700
I don't know.

284
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,030
I just remember

285
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,580
Jiang Peng calling him "Yong."

286
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,500
(People's Public Security)

287
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,820
(Wu Shenglin ID)

288
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,340
Jiang Peng is Victim 02.

289
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:57,100
He borrowed Wu Shenglin's ID.

290
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,740
This is Wu Shenglin's
full ID information.

291
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,150
Why would Jiang Peng

292
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,630
need to use Wu Shenglin's ID?

293
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,700
If he lost his ID,

294
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,050
he could've applied for a new one.

295
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:09,860
From what we understand so far,

296
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,700
the quarry confiscated his ID.

297
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:12,910
But we can't rule out

298
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,630
the possibility that Jiang Peng tricked
Wu Shenglin's ID

299
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:17,270
to hide his real identity.

300
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,460
So

301
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,310
our focus now

302
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,670
is to track all records tied
to Jiang Peng

303
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,330
while he was using
Wu Shenglin's identity,

304
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,310
Hotel bookings, tickets,

305
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,630
and anything related.

306
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:27,940
Yu,

307
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:28,820
it's your job.

308
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:29,630
Yes, sir.

309
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,430
I'll start now.

310
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,580
As of now,

311
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,820
both victims are prime suspects.

312
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,150
So

313
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,390
our priority is figuring out

314
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,220
their motive.

315
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,060
Qin,

316
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,580
go and request approval from the chief

317
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,630
for a reward announcement.

318
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,390
Get their photos out to the media

319
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,910
and ask the public

320
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,030
for any sightings

321
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,030
of them

322
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,940
in the past ten days.

323
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,740
I'll go right away.

324
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,430
Okay.

325
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,310
Song, you're here.

326
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,630
Got some free time today?

327
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,190
This month's rent...

328
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,030
You bad boy,

329
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,100
I'll wait for you tonight.

330
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,060
Just come over.

331
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,460
Mr. Song.

332
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,270
Mr. Song?

333
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:33,460
How did they find your place

334
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,220
and rent this room?

335
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,030
Online.

336
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,430
That short guy booked my place

337
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,820
on a rental platform two months ago.

338
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,790
What was his name again...

339
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:44,630
Mister?

340
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,150
I'm Fu Qiyong.

341
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,550
You're showing me
the house today, remember?

342
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,510
Oh, come in.

343
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,220
Take a look.

344
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,670
Is this your friend?

345
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,670
Yes, he's my friend.

346
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,500
We'll share the room.

347
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:01,870
You said it was just for you.

348
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:02,590
Why you two now?

349
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,350
Mister,

350
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,110
it's not easy making money nowadays.

351
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,460
Sharing the rent helps save costs.

352
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,390
Fine.

353
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,940
Another 100 yuan for management.

354
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,700
Give me your IDs for registration.

355
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,350
I forgot mine.

356
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,590
No ID?

357
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:18,070
If you have no ID,

358
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,460
I can't rent this place to you.

359
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,550
I need proper documentation.

360
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,780
I'll bring it these days.

361
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,300
Then we'll sign the contract until then.

362
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,190
Don't take too long.

363
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,830
My place is reasonably priced,

364
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:27,830
well-located,

365
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:28,700
and in high demand.

366
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:29,590
Okay, mister.

367
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:30,390
But

368
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,740
can you drop the extra 100 yuan?

369
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:34,430
Now, it's 200 yuan.

370
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,260
That's unfair!

371
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,740
Okay, 200 yuan it is.

372
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,430
But don't enter our room after that.

373
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:42,630
Don't worry.

374
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,190
I don't care what you do inside

375
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,670
so long you pay your rent.

376
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,070
Why did you agree to that?

377
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,700
In less than two days,

378
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,070
they came with the IDs.

379
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:52,940
I took photos of them.

380
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,020
(Name: Fu Qiyong)

381
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,300
(Name: Wu Shenglin)

382
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,110
Did they really sleep here

383
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,500
in the same bed?

384
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,190
Yeah.

385
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,670
They weren't around during the day

386
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:07,760
and only came back at night.

387
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,300
It's understandable.

388
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:09,980
Laborers.

389
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,430
After that bus explosion a few days ago,

390
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,460
they never returned.

391
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,430
Thinking about it,
something was definitely off.

392
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,630
We will now conduct
a legal search of this property.

393
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:20,500
Here's the warrant.

394
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:21,780
Please witness the process.

395
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,020
Thank you.

396
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,100
(Huaizhou People's Hospital)

397
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,860
(Revenge. Revenge)

398
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:56,430
The motive?

399
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,590
We found it.

400
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:09,780
Mr. Song,

401
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,740
whose luggage is this?

402
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:14,430
Theirs.

403
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,110
They brought two identical suitcases

404
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,910
and two identical travel bags

405
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,150
when they moved in.

406
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,260
One of the travel bags is missing.

407
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:28,780
Wait...

408
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,350
I didn't take

409
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,590
any of their belongings.

410
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,830
I was wondering

411
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,980
why they left
without taking their stuff.

412
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,460
At first, I thought

413
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,150
they ran off to avoid paying the rent.

414
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,460
I never expected them to be dead.

415
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:41,390
Good thing I collected the rent
in advance.

416
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,630
Or I'd have suffered a big loss.

417
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:45,190
Officer,

418
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,300
about the reward
for providing information...

419
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,840
We'll notify you
about the paperwork later.

420
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:54,870
(Public Security Bureau)

421
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,190
We can now confirm that Fu Qiyong

422
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,190
and Jiang Peng jointly

423
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,460
carried out the explosion case.

424
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,460
Yu,

425
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:02,350
any leads
on their financial transactions?

426
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:05,020
I found out that Fu Qiyong
was addicted to gambling.

427
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,670
A few months ago, he took out

428
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,500
several online loans using his ID.

429
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,880
The interest rates were very high,

430
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,780
and with the rolling interest,

431
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,910
his debt has reached hundreds
of thousands of yuan.

432
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,430
He had no way to pay it back.

433
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,260
Based on the medical records we found

434
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,350
in Jiang Peng's rented room,

435
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:20,350
combined with Wu Shenglin's statement

436
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,150
that Jiang Peng was injured

437
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,270
while working at the quarry.

438
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,070
Considering both factors,

439
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,700
the injury left

440
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,390
Jiang Peng permanently infertile.

441
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,980
After failing to get compensation,

442
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,190
he decided to take revenge
on the quarry owner,

443
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:35,220
Mr. Bai.

444
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,150
That's right.

445
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,300
The owner of the quarry

446
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,540
where Jiang Peng worked

447
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,390
is Bai Zhigang.

448
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,830
(Searching...)

449
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:46,590
Found him.

450
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,260
Bai Zhigang is a family member

451
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,590
of the victims in this case.

452
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,110
His parents were on that bus.

453
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,430
The bus's surveillance footage
has been restored.

454
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,780
It's being sent to me now.

455
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,630
I'll download it now.

456
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:04,150
Okay.

457
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,940
(On the Day of the Explosion)

458
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,190
Let me help you with your bags.

459
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:28,940
This bus is less crowded.

460
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,260
Mr. Bai arranged for you

461
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,110
to take this one.

462
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:31,590
Okay.

463
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,980
Come, watch your steps.

464
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:33,940
Okay.

Come, madam.

467
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,500
Those at the back, please keep up.

468
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,700
Okay, find a seat and settle in.

469
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,430
Liao,

470
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,780
the bus before us has departed.

471
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,390
We should hurry.

472
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:53,500
Okay.

473
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,450
Behave well during the outing, okay?

474
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:11,740
Wait!

475
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:12,980
Wait for me!

476
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,780
Are you a family member of the employee?

477
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,700
Yes.

478
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,070
We're getting married soon.

479
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,220
Okay, have a seat.

480
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:23,630
Peng.

481
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:29,460
Peng,

482
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,910
luckily I made it.

483
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,910
I made you lunch.

484
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,590
Keep quiet.

485
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:50,870
Miss,

486
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:52,590
are you the chemical plant's
employee too?

487
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,830
Chemical plant?

488
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,430
Peng,

489
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,830
I thought you worked at the quarry.

490
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:03,910
This bus is for the chemical plant's
team-building event.

491
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:04,980
Don't get on the wrong bus.

492
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:07,980
You're from the quarry.

493
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,670
Why are you joining our event?

494
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,110
Did you board the wrong bus?

495
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,540
Stay seated.

496
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,430
Don't move.

497
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,910
Uncle, what's that smell?

498
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:25,630
It smells like gasoline.

499
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:28,020
Don't move!

500
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:31,740
Peng,

501
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,780
what are you doing?

502
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,300
Anyone who moves,

503
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,350
we will all die together!

504
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:47,460
If I see anyone making a phone call,

505
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,300
I'll kill you.

506
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:55,300
If you try anything, I'll kill you.

507
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,460
Lock the door

508
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:57,460
and keep driving.

509
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:58,740
Buddy,

510
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,430
let's talk this out.

511
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:01,350
Just drive!

512
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,830
Young man,

513
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,190
let's talk this through.

514
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:12,590
Everyone on this bus works for my son.

515
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,300
Did anyone wrong you?

516
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,300
You two old fools raised

517
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:18,740
a scumbag of a son.

518
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,150
Now, the whole bus will pay for it.

519
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:22,910
If this is about my son,

520
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,350
take it out on us.

521
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,910
Just let the rest go.

522
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,590
I apologize on my son's behalf.

523
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,070
Please don't do anything foolish.

524
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,460
You're going too far!

525
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,670
Trying to be a hero?

526
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:34,540
A tough guy, huh?

527
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:35,500
Fine!

528
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:36,670
Let's die together!

529
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:37,220
Come on!

530
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,700
I've been bullied my whole life.

531
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,150
Let's see who can push me around today!

532
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:54,500
Peng.

533
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:55,940
Peng.

534
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:57,700
Have you lost your mind?

535
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,070
I'm your girlfriend.

536
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:00,630
Are you dragging me along too?

537
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:07,540
You don't understand.

538
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:09,740
You kept asking

539
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,070
why I hadn't touched you in six months.

540
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,500
Bai Zhigang beat me up.

541
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:17,390
I'm not a whole man anymore.

542
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,070
If you knew,

543
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,870
you would've dumped me, right?

544
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:26,630
Peng,

545
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,910
what do you take me for?

546
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,700
Even if you told me,

547
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,390
I wouldn't have left you.

548
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,300
I already knew

549
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,390
what you do for a living!

550
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:42,540
Whatever.

551
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,070
Yingzi.

552
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,110
I won't

553
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,350
let you keep cheating on me.

554
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,020
If you want revenge,
go after Mr. Bai himself.

555
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,630
We're just workers.

556
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,980
We didn't do anything to you.

557
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,940
Just let us go!

558
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,190
I've never even had a boyfriend!

559
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:06,940
I don't wanna die!

560
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:07,700
Shut up!

561
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,590
Mister, this isn't right.

562
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,300
Just keep your mouth shut!

563
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:19,300
Jiang Peng, you coward.

564
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,350
If you back out now,

565
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,780
you'll just spend
the rest of your life in prison!

566
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,110
I won't let you do this!

567
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:30,740
Honey!

568
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,260
Step on the gas!

569
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,190
Honey!

570
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,740
Honey!

571
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,630
Everyone, get him!

572
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:41,300
Hold him off!

573
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,220
Hurry!

574
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,630
How dare you!

575
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:44,430
Get off me!

576
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:47,630
Let me go!

577
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:52,150
Die!

578
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,830
Put the gasoline barrel away!

579
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,630
I'll stab anyone who moves!

580
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,020
The door is open. Run!

581
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,020
Let go!

582
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:49,940
Do it!

583
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,430
Yingzi, let's meet in the next life.

584
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:47,260
I want to see my parents.

585
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:49,350
All the injured
are out of critical condition.

586
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,700
But they have severe burns.

587
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,780
No visitors are allowed yet.

588
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:57,500
That's fine.

589
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:59,110
Make sure my parents

590
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:00,500
get these supplements.

591
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,500
Listen here.

592
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,540
My parents need

593
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,350
the best of everything.

594
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,070
Got it?

595
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,540
They can't eat this yet.

596
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:12,500
Hello?

597
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,700
Did you tell Xue Cheng what I said?

598
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,260
Listen here.

599
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,110
I need to use money urgently.

600
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,540
So I don't care what you do,

601
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,500
I want you to return

602
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,500
the money I invested right this instant!

603
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,540
Stop feigning ignorance.

604
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:28,940
I'm warning you...

605
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:30,590
Hello?

606
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:31,870
Hey!

607
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,630
How dare he hang up on me?

608
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,070
Darn it.

609
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,190
I'll kill you!

610
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:38,980
Let's go.

611
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,150
Bai Zhigang, right?

612
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:41,780
Yeah.

613
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,390
What?

614
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:43,100
We're the police.

615
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,670
We need to ask you a few questions.
