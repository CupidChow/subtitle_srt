00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:36,260
=Episode 8=

3
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,820
(Interrogation Room 2)

4
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,700
I never had a girlfriend before.

5
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:44,620
She was my first love.

6
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:46,780
I loved her very much.

7
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,390
I did

8
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,230
everything she asked.

9
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,540
I gave her everything

10
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:51,750
she wanted.

11
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:53,340
But then

12
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,340
her demands

13
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,340
kept growing

14
00:00:58,650 --> 00:00:59,500
and were more costly.

15
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,750
When I couldn't afford them,

16
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,160
she started making a fuss.

17
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:05,310
Xinxin,

18
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,550
slow down.

19
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:08,660
Watch the steps.

20
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,060
All right, don't be mad.

21
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,820
I'm just about to put down the deposit

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,290
for that luxury beachfront villa.

23
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:30,150
Where's the money?

24
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:31,340
Where is it?

25
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,780
That villa is too expensive.

26
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,100
How about we get a large flat instead?

27
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:38,850
Fine, you don't have to buy it.

28
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:40,750
But

29
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,100
I'll spill all your secrets.

30
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,190
What do you mean?

31
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,150
Oh, nothing.

32
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,820
It's just
that you've been evading taxes.

33
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,060
Enough to get you a few years in jail.

34
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,750
Xinxin, don't mess around.

35
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:54,870
Don't touch me!

36
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,150
(I had no choice.)

37
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,060
(I had to cook the books.)

38
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,940
(I took money from the company)

39
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,870
(to buy her a villa.)

40
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,220
(But it was discovered soon.)

41
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:12,710
I invested in you

42
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,430
to make money,

43
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,710
not so you could spend

44
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,150
my money on a woman!

45
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,990
(When the investors audited
the accounts,)

46
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:19,820
Mr. Chen.

47
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,550
(I begged them desperately.)

48
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,550
Give me one more chance.

49
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,270
I'll return it.

50
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,550
(I put up my house)

51
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,150
- (and car)
- Please

52
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,150
give me one more chance.

53
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,620
(as collateral.)

54
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,650
(Then they didn't press charges.)

55
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,310
(But "She, He, and It")

56
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,500
(was already losing users.)

57
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:37,900
(There were)

58
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,150
(Agreement)

59
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,030
(no more investments.)

60
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,060
(Everything collapsed.)

61
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,660
(And then Tang Xinxin broke up with me.)

62
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,480
(She even demanded two million yuan
for wasting her youth.)

63
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:48,220
(Total Assets: 8.51)

64
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,100
(I had no money.)

65
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,270
(So she took the money)

66
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,190
(I had saved for my father's retirement.)

67
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,620
(I don't care about my suffering.)

68
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,750
But I couldn't
let my father suffer with me.

69
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:58,590
(So)

70
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,430
You wretch!

71
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,190
(I found an excuse)

72
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,500
(to trick her to my place.)

73
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,310
I actually thought

74
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,750
about ending my life.

75
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:13,870
Jumping off a building

76
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:16,820
and getting it over with.

77
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:18,700
But

78
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,750
even then,

79
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,910
I never wanted

80
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,020
to resort to murder.

81
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,380
If she had just said sorry even once,

82
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,190
I wouldn't have done it.

83
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,550
I loved her.

84
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,620
But she pushed me to the edge.

85
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,700
She left me no choice!

86
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,450
If she did something wrong,

87
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,110
the law would punish her.

88
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,420
You can always start over
after failing in your business.

89
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,950
But once you take the wrong path,

90
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,350
it's already beyond saving.

91
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,580
I was haunted by bad luck.

92
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,500
Bad things happen at the worst moment.

93
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,620
Even the van had something against me.

94
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,550
It broke down at that time.

95
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,990
Or I wouldn't have to move the body
with the electric bike.

96
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:23,940
And

97
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,910
you wouldn't have found out.

98
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,350
You keep saying you punish Tang Xinxin

99
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,580
to seek justice for your father.

100
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,940
But you made him commit perjury

101
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,350
to fake an alibi for you.

102
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,790
We've already uncovered
the video chat logs.

103
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,260
You faked them.

104
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,750
According to the relevant provisions

105
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,870
of the Criminal Law of China,

106
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,940
in criminal proceedings,
if a witness, expert witness,

107
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,820
recorder, or translator
deliberately provides

108
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,110
false testimony, records,

109
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,260
assessments, or translations

110
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,110
in matters

111
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,060
significantly related

112
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:02,820
to the case,

113
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,310
or intends to frame others

114
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,260
or conceal evidence,

115
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,990
they shall be sentenced to up
to three years of imprisonment.

116
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,580
In severe cases,

117
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,700
the imprisonment shall be

118
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,230
between three and seven years.

119
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:13,990
So we're saying

120
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,260
you might've dragged
your father into this.

121
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:19,750
No!

122
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,580
He doesn't know anything!

123
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,310
It was all me!

124
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,910
It has nothing to do with him.

125
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,750
He knows nothing!

126
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,060
He knows nothing.

127
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,870
He knows nothing!

128
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,750
Dad,

129
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,670
it's my fault.

130
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,460
Dad...

131
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,580
Dad...

132
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,140
Listen to me.

133
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,350
Xinxin

134
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:59,990
was an outstanding child.

135
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,390
I always told her this
since she was young.

136
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,790
She must choose wisely

137
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,260
when picking a husband.

138
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,670
She must find someone with a big house,

139
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,910
a stable career,

140
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,140
and from a wealthy family.

141
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,620
Someone with power and money.

142
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,310
That's the only way to have a good life.

143
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,260
Tell me,

144
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,310
was I wrong?

145
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:22,020
If she hadn't picked
that broke Xu Dongyang,

146
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,050
would this have happened?

147
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,150
So...

148
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,020
Tang Xinxin's father?

149
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,940
Xu Dongyang is a narrow-minded person

150
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,350
and a low-class to begin with.

151
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,140
He kill her over something so trivial.

152
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,500
He's a scum
who tricked my daughter into marriage!

153
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:38,350
Mister,

154
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,020
please calm down.

155
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,460
We understand how painful it is

156
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,110
for you to lose your daughter.

157
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:43,990
But

158
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,460
we have solid evidence proving

159
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,750
your daughter blackmailed

160
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,060
Xu Dongyang

161
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,620
over his embezzlement and tax fraud.

162
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,670
Mister, calm down.

163
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,240
Are you saying it's my daughter's fault?

164
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,580
Is he that innocent

165
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,750
and scared of my daughter exposing him?

166
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:02,190
That guy's nothing
but a wolf in sheep's clothing!

167
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,020
Instead of punishing that murderer,

168
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,460
you're standing here lecturing me,

169
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,350
the victim's father?

170
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,990
Xu Dongyang broke the law

171
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,230
and we will prosecute him.

172
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:14,110
But was Tang Xinxin completely innocent?

173
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,260
Morality is the highest form of law.

174
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,380
If you look at it that way,

175
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,790
does that justify her greed

176
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,190
and lack of boundaries?

177
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,750
She manipulated people's feelings
for money

178
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,190
and resorted to extortion.

179
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,020
In the end, she paid with her life.

180
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:27,980
Shouldn't she take

181
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,310
some responsibility
for what happened to her?

182
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:47,340
(Chat History)

183
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,780
(I've been waiting a long time
for you to catch me. X)

184
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,940
Both murder cases are finally closed.

185
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,940
But neither Xu Dongyang nor Ke Hai

186
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,430
admitted to sending the threat letter.

187
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,790
So who did?

188
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,180
(I've been waiting a long time
for you to catch me. X)

189
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,390
Yu Yue.

190
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,150
Yu Yue!

191
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,060
I'm looking
through Tang Xinxin's chat logs.

192
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,680
You wouldn't believe it.

193
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,190
She may appear young and innocent.

194
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,060
But she was great at making money.

195
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,220
She only had close contact

196
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,670
with two or three men on WeChat,

197
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,550
but these guys are loaded

198
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,700
and generous.

199
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,030
Just wanting a cup of coffee?

200
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:32,630
Boom, 7,000 yuan.

201
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,270
Felt like shopping?

202
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,910
They give even more.

203
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:37,150
Wasn't that case

204
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,390
transferred to the Procuratorate

205
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,190
for prosecution?

206
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,150
I know.

207
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,390
I'm just going

208
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,790
through the digital evidence

209
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,310
from Tang Xinxin and Liu Ang's phones.

210
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,670
I'm curious

211
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,270
if there were any other victims.

212
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:50,630
Come here.

213
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,550
Look at this.

214
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,220
This group chat name is creepy.

215
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:07,910
"Mastery of Manipulation Group?"

216
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,100
Some things need

217
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,030
to be addressed at the root.

218
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,860
(Li Kai, killed debt collector.
Xu Dongyang,)

219
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,220
(No investment, killed girlfriend.
Mr. Xue)

220
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,550
The investor funding
Xu Dongyang's company is surnamed Xue.

221
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,190
The last name
of Li Kai's creditor is also Xue.

222
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,580
(Li Kai. Xu Dongyang. Mr. Xue)

223
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,270
Is that just a coincidence?

224
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,390
Kong Rubai,

225
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,670
can I ask you something?

226
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,150
Are you still holding a grudge

227
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:42,060
against Captain Gu

228
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,270
because of your brother?

229
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,910
After studying all this psychology,

230
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,550
and you still talk so bluntly?

231
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,860
Come on, don't be mad.
You're a grown man.

232
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,300
I'll treat you to a late-night snack.

233
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,430
Food?

234
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:57,980
Okay, let's go.

235
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,790
Have a seat and wait a bit.

236
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,580
Ready soon.

237
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:16,550
Gu, nice to see you.

238
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:20,910
Mr. Chang.

239
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,630
How have you been?

240
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,630
I'm doing well.

241
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:25,100
Is there anything

242
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:25,820
you'd like to eat?

243
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,100
Give me any two cold dishes.

244
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:27,630
Okay.

245
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,270
How's business?

246
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,190
Not bad.

247
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,270
Not too much.

248
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:46,580
Okay.

249
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,790
That's 12.80 yuan.

250
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,220
Just give me 12 yuan.

251
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:58,910
Thanks.

252
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,390
Take care.

253
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,220
See you around.

254
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,270
Mister,

255
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,550
what would you like?

256
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:26,430
Xiaotang.

257
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:28,510
Xiaotang.

258
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,460
What's wrong?

259
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:34,790
Zhen,

260
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,580
the person
who bought Liu Ang's custom shirts

261
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,390
was Anna.

262
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:46,190
This kid...

263
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:49,440
She tried to kill herself

264
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,940
because Liu Ang died.

265
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,860
I went to see her at the hospital.

266
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,270
She told me everything.

267
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,060
It turns out she and Liu Ang
had been dating all along.

268
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,910
She gave him gifts and money.

269
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,460
To please him,

270
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,510
she even introduced me to that scumbag.

271
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,060
Zhen,

272
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,860
I'm so scared.

273
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,190
Why are people so complicated?

274
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,190
Don't be scared.

275
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,150
I'm here.

276
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,510
But you and my sister already broke up.

277
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,550
Mr. Wang,

278
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,630
you're the nicest person

279
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,700
in my life.

280
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,030
Anna, remember.

281
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,700
No one is nice

282
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,220
to someone forever.

283
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,390
Everyone

284
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,430
has their motives.

285
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,860
Then what's your motive?

286
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,820
Whatever it is,

287
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,940
I'll still choose to trust you.

288
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,150
Mr. Wang,

289
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,630
would you ever lie to me?

290
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:47,510
Maybe I'm lying to you right now.

291
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,100
Liu Ang lied to me too.

292
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:53,580
But I know

293
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,580
you're different from him.

294
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:59,670
You seem like someone
who never gets hurt.

295
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,940
Can I ever be as good person as you?

296
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,430
Quite the opposite.

297
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,310
Don't you think

298
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,220
good people

299
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,310
always end up getting hurt?

300
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,390
Mr. Wang,

301
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,150
you seem to have a lot of secrets.

302
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,190
Can you tell me?

303
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,270
That'll take time.

304
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,580
I will tell you bit by bit.

305
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:35,580
Police! Stop right now!

306
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:37,390
Stop!

307
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:38,820
Stop!

308
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:41,740
Stop now!

309
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,340
Don't run!

310
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:43,270
Move!

311
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,060
Move!

312
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:44,860
Move aside!

313
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,340
Stay put!

314
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:46,580
Stop!

315
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,220
Stop!

316
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,190
Stay there!

317
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:52,150
Stop right there!

318
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,700
Get out of my way!

319
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,980
Stop! Stay where you are!

320
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,550
Stop running! Stop!

321
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:57,670
Out of my way!

322
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,700
- Stop!
- Step aside!

323
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,260
Stop!

324
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,220
Move it! Get out of my way!

325
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:22,540
Mister, I want this and this.

326
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,590
This one and this one?

327
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:24,350
Okay.

328
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,390
I'll prepare them for you.

329
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:25,830
Okay.

330
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:26,870
Don't run!

331
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,590
Move aside!

332
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:28,740
Get lost!

333
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,110
Move!

334
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:30,670
Stop!

335
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,190
Stop!

336
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:32,590
Step aside!

337
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:36,300
Don't move!

338
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:37,940
Put the knife down!

339
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:38,830
Put your gun down!

340
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,020
Or I'll kill her!

341
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:40,940
Put that knife down!

342
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:41,740
Calm down!

343
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,830
I will kill her for real!

344
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:45,350
Don't move!

345
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:46,940
Let her go!

346
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,780
Put your gun down! Don't push me!

347
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,260
Or I'll kill her!

348
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:54,540
I'm not scared. The police will save me.

349
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,540
Put your knife down!

350
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,940
Put down your gun!

351
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,350
I'm really going to kill her.

352
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,500
Put your knife down first.

353
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:00,460
Don't make me do this!

354
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,350
Put the knife down.

355
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,260
Calm down!

356
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,220
Okay!

357
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,120
I'll put it down.

358
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:29,670
Let her go.

359
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:30,500
I'll be your hostage.

360
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,500
Don't come any closer!

361
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,630
Yingsong, be careful!

362
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:42,740
You're Kong Yingsong?

363
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:43,630
Yes.

364
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,940
I'll take you down with me.

365
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,660
(20 Missed Calls)

366
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,500
Oh, shoot!

367
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,430
Geezer Gu,

368
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,540
you scared me.

369
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,670
Did anything happen?

370
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,020
No, nothing.

371
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,830
I thought someone was following me.

372
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:00,390
Okay.

373
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,320
As long as you're okay.

374
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,020
I'm sorry about today.

375
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,110
I promised to pick you up.

376
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:04,980
But I was so exhausted

377
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,980
and overslept.

378
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,540
It's fine.

379
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,700
I'm a grown-up.

380
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,020
You don't have to.

381
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,190
I've been having

382
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,430
bad feelings these days.

383
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:13,590
When you go home,

384
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,220
make sure to go with a classmate

385
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,260
who's using the same route.

386
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:17,780
If there's anything, call the police.

387
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,190
Got it?

388
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:21,190
Have you been having nightmares again?

389
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,110
You act like a crazy person.

390
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,430
Even my sister got scared away.

391
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,390
You better get her back.

392
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,830
Enough with that nonsense.

393
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,690
Still carrying it around?

394
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,390
Of course.

395
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:33,500
I have it with me every day.

396
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,020
Good.

397
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:36,110
Let's go home.
