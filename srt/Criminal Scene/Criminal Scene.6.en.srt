(Time of Death: 3 AM)

20
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:18,380
Captain Gu.

21
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:20,750
It's confirmed

22
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,030
that the knife we found
is the murder weapon.

23
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,710
We also got a fingerprint from it.

24
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,900
The killer tossed it into the drain

25
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:28,620
but with the print remained?

26
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,190
We can only say
it's the killer's bad luck.

27
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,620
The drain was an abandoned one.

28
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:33,620
It's very dry inside.

29
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,030
Did you get a match?

30
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,500
It belongs to Lei Wei, the bar owner.

31
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,140
(Lei Wei)

32
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,750
(Violent Tendencies)
The suspect

33
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,470
thought he got away clean

34
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,780
by tossing the knife down the drain

35
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,320
without realizing there's a fingerprint.

36
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:48,000
(Fanfan)

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,190
(Improper Relation)
Fanfan said

38
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,920
(Lei Wei. Love Rival. Liu Ang)
that Liu Ang and Lei Wei were rivals.

39
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,870
Lei Wei pretended not
to know Liu Ang well.

40
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,380
As of now, he is our biggest suspect.

41
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,620
Something about this still feels off.

42
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:01,590
Captain Gu,

43
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,380
there's a letter at the door.

44
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,340
I brought it in for you.

45
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:22,700
(I've been waiting a long time
for you to catch me. X)

46
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,550
The killer sent this?

47
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,870
He's getting cocky.

48
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,100
Captain Gu.

49
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,550
We got the identity of the girl
who took her life for Liu Ang.

50
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,500
Her name was He Xiao.

51
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,660
She was dating Lei Wei
at the time of her death.

52
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:36,620
Anna!

53
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:38,350
Anna!

54
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,460
You sure this is the place?

55
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:49,670
Yeah.

56
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,550
Xu Dongyang, a big-time businessman,

57
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,500
actually lived here?

58
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:10,790
Coming!

59
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,230
We're from the Public Security Bureau.

60
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,550
We need your cooperation

61
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,380
in an investigation.

62
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:20,670
Come in.

63
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,750
Take a seat.

64
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,260
Did you hurt your leg?

65
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,990
Yeah, I twisted my ankle
a couple of days ago

66
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:40,310
while taking out the trash.

67
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,110
Your place is really clean.

68
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,060
I'm only staying here temporarily.

69
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:55,790
But it's still home

70
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,110
nonetheless.

71
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,550
I keep it tidy

72
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,140
to live comfortable.

73
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,460
Take a seat.

74
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,110
Sit.

75
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,750
We're here to ask

76
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,140
about your girlfriend, Tang Xinxin.

77
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,750
To be precise,

78
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:17,700
ex-girlfriend.

79
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:19,650
What about her?

80
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,500
Is she scamming another guy now?

81
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,490
You two have broken up?

82
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,060
She only dated me

83
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,990
because I was financially suitable.

84
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,430
Once I lost everything,

85
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,990
I was no longer useful to her.

86
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,620
Of course, she left.

87
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,110
When did you break up?

88
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,140
About two months ago,

89
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:40,700
my company

90
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,140
was struggling,

91
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,310
and I had no choice
but to declare bankruptcy.

92
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:51,910
My company declared bankruptcy
during the day.

93
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,580
That night, she called

94
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,550
to break up.

95
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,110
Did you see her

96
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,430
after that?

97
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,260
I did.

98
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:01,310
I looked for her.

99
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,230
I told her

100
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,550
I'd work hard to make a comeback.

101
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,150
I asked her to give me time.

102
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:07,870
But it all ends up

103
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:09,910
with nothing.

104
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,460
Where were you at 3 AM

105
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,140
this morning?

106
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,670
I was asleep.

107
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:18,750
Is no one with you?

108
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,110
Officer,

109
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,500
look at me.

110
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,550
Who would still want

111
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,110
to be with me at 3 AM?

112
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:27,750
Be serious.

113
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,790
At that time,

114
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,730
I was on a video call with my dad.

115
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,460
We talked for

116
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,670
about 40 minutes.

117
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:39,990
Ah, yes.

118
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,060
(Call Duration)

119
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,900
(Call Duration)

120
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:55,460
By the way,

121
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,940
this place is a rental.

122
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,310
My landlord is picky.

123
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,940
So I'm careful with everything I use.

124
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,140
You should put that back where it was.

125
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,260
Aren't you curious

126
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,700
about what happened to Tang Xinxin?

127
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,940
I have no energy to care

128
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,270
about anyone in this state.

129
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,030
What happened to her?

130
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,060
She's dead.

131
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,340
What

132
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:37,910
do you mean?

133
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,630
Are you suspecting me?

134
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,550
Whatever happened to her

135
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,980
has nothing to do with me!

136
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:48,630
What?

137
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,510
She used me like an ATM and dumped me.

138
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,700
And now she's dead!

139
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,580
That's on her! She had it coming!

140
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,030
I'm in my 30s.

141
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,700
I worked so hard to build my company,

142
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,820
and now it's gone.

143
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,630
I don't even have time
to grieve for myself,

144
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,390
and you expect me to grieve

145
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,100
for her?

146
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,150
This is just emotional blackmail!

147
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,630
Please calm down.

148
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,910
We only want your cooperation

149
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:12,820
in investigation.

150
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,060
Losing his company hit him hard.

151
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,190
He has given up on himself.

152
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,430
It's not just despair.

153
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,820
He is filled with resentment

154
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,820
and blames all his misfortunes

155
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,310
on Tang Xinxin.

156
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,670
If he truly believes she was the reason

157
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:38,980
for his company's downfall.

158
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,460
Then he has a strong motive for murder.

159
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,240
Did you notice
he has obsessive tendencies?

160
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,390
You should put that back where it was.

161
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,100
Something about that apartment

162
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:56,980
doesn't feel right.

163
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,220
Lei Wei,

164
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:06,080
we found your fingerprints
on the knife used to kill Liu Ang.

165
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,340
How do you explain that?

166
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,910
Why... Why would I kill him?

167
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,060
Yeah, I did like Fanfan before.

168
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,910
But that was a long time ago.

169
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,670
The bar was packed with friends
who came to support me.

170
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,790
I was toasting drinks.

171
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,220
I didn't have time to deal with them.

172
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,270
Can anyone confirm that?

173
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,510
There are security cameras
in the hallway and rooms.

174
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,100
Everyone I drank with can vouch for me.

175
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,460
Did you send a threatening letter
to the police?

176
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:28,460
What letter?

177
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,630
What?

178
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,630
Am I that crazy

179
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,060
to threaten the cops?

180
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:33,980
Listen here!

181
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,220
If you don't start talking,

182
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,450
be ready for the consequences.

183
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,940
I swear, I didn't do anything.

184
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,150
I'm innocent!

185
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,220
You know He Xiao, right?

186
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,100
Her name sounds familiar.

187
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,030
Wasn't He Xiao

188
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,060
your girlfriend?

189
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,340
What does she have to do with this?

190
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,060
She killed herself over a year ago!

191
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,100
Before she died,

192
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,190
we had already broken up.

193
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:03,100
Her death has nothing to do with me!

194
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,390
At the time when she took her life,

195
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,310
she was dating Liu Ang.

196
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,510
If there's anything,
it was between them, not me!

197
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,980
Relax.

198
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,060
We're only trying
to get the facts straight.

199
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,270
That woman...

200
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,820
When we first got together,

201
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,910
she acted so pure and innocent.

202
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,820
Later, I found out

203
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:30,550
she used to date Liu Ang.

204
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,430
When they were together,

205
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:34,700
she wasn't shy at all.

206
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,910
She even went along
with his video recording.

207
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,740
I even ordered a wedding suit

208
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,910
from K's shop

209
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,340
and was planning to propose.

210
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,060
But then Liu Ang sent me
a video of them.

211
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,820
Then I realized
she had been lying to me all along.

212
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,630
If Liu Ang could send a copy to me,

213
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:55,700
he could send it to anyone.

214
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,150
Tell me, what man could stand knowing

215
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,910
his woman had been with someone doing...

216
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,550
I couldn't take it

217
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,790
so I broke up with her.

218
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:10,940
I didn't expect

219
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,820
she would kill herself

220
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,100
two days later.

221
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,340
What's wrong with the fingerprints?

222
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,820
Normally, fingerprints are left
on surfaces

223
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,790
because of sweat, sebum, and oils.

224
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,310
But when we tested the ones

225
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,460
on the murder weapon,

226
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,580
we also found traces

227
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,910
of adhesive

228
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,510
other than those usual elements.

229
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:35,980
What's that?

230
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,510
The glue from transparent tape.

231
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,030
Before He Xiao died,

232
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,150
did she act differently?

233
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,790
Did she try to contact you?

234
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:06,310
How is she connected to this case?

235
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,460
I know I didn't kill anyone

236
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,390
and I didn't send any letters.

237
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,790
I do hate Liu Ang.

238
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,700
I hated him for ruining my reputation.

239
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,910
But He Xiao

240
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,940
wasn't worth killing for.

241
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,860
There are plenty
of beautiful women out there!

242
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,700
If you want to ask me something,

243
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,860
can't you stick to things
that are related to this case?

244
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,030
He Xiao

245
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,630
was nothing.

246
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,270
Mister.

247
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,390
Yes?

248
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,460
Did a car accident happen nearby?

249
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,630
I didn't hit anyone.

250
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,340
Then did someone hit your car?

251
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,100
Now that rings a bell.

252
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,860
I parked my car here for the past days.

253
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,460
I didn't bother anyone.

254
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,030
Look.

255
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,910
Someone hit my car.

256
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,270
If I catch whoever did this,

257
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,770
I'll make them pay for the damages.

258
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,460
Qian, any new leads?

259
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:22,980
That stack of joss paper

260
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,100
was placed in the victim's mouth
after death.

261
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,150
There are no struggle marks
around the area.

262
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,060
I sent it to forensics for analysis.

263
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,790
No fingerprints were found on it.

264
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:33,790
It was wiped clean.

265
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,060
The suspect's methods were careful.

266
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,460
The crime was premeditated.

267
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,340
The victim had no visible bruising

268
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,630
on her face or neck.

269
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,270
The killer probably didn't suffocate
her with hands.

270
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,190
He might have used a pillow, blanket,

271
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:53,910
or something similar.

272
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:06,910
Ms. Shen,

273
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,940
how's Anna?

274
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,940
She's stable now.

275
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,100
But she wants to talk to you alone.

276
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,550
Me? Alone?

277
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,030
Yes.

278
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:15,910
Okay.

279
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:16,630
Go inside.

280
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:44,860
Xiaotang.

281
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,310
I'm sorry.

282
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,260
I'm sorry.

283
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,110
I'm so sorry.

284
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:09,670
I'm sorry.

285
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,260
What do I do now?

286
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:21,350
What if she never forgives me?

287
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,740
It's all my fault.

288
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,540
I deserve this. I should just die!

289
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,150
That's enough.

290
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,300
Anna. Anna.

291
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,220
Enough. Listen to me.

292
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,070
Everyone has to face

293
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,430
the consequences of their mistakes.

294
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,740
You've tried to kill yourself

295
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,590
and died once.

296
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:40,940
So you've gotten your punishment.

297
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,390
Think of it.

298
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,300
You gave up the one you loved

299
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,500
for Jiang Xiaotang.

300
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,590
That proves

301
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,150
how much you care about her, right?

302
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:53,670
Yes.

303
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,260
That's right.

304
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:58,260
I love Xiaotang too much.

305
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,220
I love her so much.

306
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,980
That's why I gave my boyfriend to her.

307
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,110
But I don't want Liu Ang to hurt her.

308
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,110
I don't want to lose my friend.

309
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,220
What do I do?

310
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,150
That's enough!

311
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,110
Sitting here won't change anything.

312
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:18,910
You have to act.

313
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,700
Only with enough compensation

314
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,390
will the victim suffer less.

315
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:24,980
Right?

316
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,500
What do I do now?

317
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,540
What should I do now?

318
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,020
(Branch Commander's Office)

319
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:47,780
Captain Gu,

320
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,430
you've been watching footage for hours.

321
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,070
How about taking a break?

322
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,590
The DNA test results are in.

323
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,390
It wasn't Lei Wei.

324
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,300
Four, five.

325
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,250
What are you counting?

326
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,670
Jeffrey, one of the bartenders,

327
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,540
said five servers
were working that night.

328
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,220
But there's an extra female server.

329
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,070
Here's the employee list
from that shift.

330
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,110
So, are you saying

331
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,630
one of them is an imposter?

332
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,500
The killer could be a woman?

333
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,350
Possibly.

334
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,020
It could be a man in disguise.

335
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,300
Run a check on all the servers
from that night,

336
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:42,200
especially the one
who stayed close to Liu Ang.

337
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,430
I think I've seen

338
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,460
that ring somewhere before.

339
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,540
This person killed Liu Ang
and framed Lei Wei.

340
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,500
The only connection
between them was He Xiao.

341
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,430
That means our suspect

342
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,590
might also be connected to her.

343
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,700
(K. Tailoring Studio)

344
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:40,980
There you are.

345
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:42,500
Ke Hai, right?

346
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:44,170
Come to the station with us.

347
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,190
I knew this day would come.

348
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,740
But I didn't expect

349
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,110
that this day

350
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,430
would come so soon.

351
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,430
So you knew we were coming.

352
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,460
Your plan

353
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,430
seemed flawless.

354
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,590
But why did you expose
yourself on purpose?

355
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,190
Some people

356
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,590
deserve to die.

357
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:10,980
And some people

358
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,260
are meant to carry

359
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,190
a lifetime of guilt.

360
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,390
This is a gift

361
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,860
from the most important person

362
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,430
in my life.

363
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,390
I wear it

364
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:25,740
so

365
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,190
she can witness everything.

366
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,020
Witnessing everything I've done

367
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,300
is the last gift

368
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:32,830
I give her

369
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,500
while I'm alive.

370
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:38,630
Our investigation shows

371
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,150
that you have an illegitimate daughter.

372
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:42,080
The person you keep mentioning,

373
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,150
is it He Xiao?
