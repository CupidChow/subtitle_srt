1
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:05,150
Yes, yes, the expected arrival time is 20 minutes.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,610
Donor condition is good

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,400
Hello? Hello?

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:10,570
Why isn't electricity working again?

5
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:11,620
This is a bit electric...

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,840
There is no problem with the documents and the donor committed suicide.

7
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,630
Oh my, why did you do that at such a young age?

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,760
So what I'm saying is

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,300
Where did you go, Odak, Odak

10
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:32,640
- Here we go.
- Oh, what a surprise.

11
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,350
hello

12
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,470
What's the status?

13
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,270
I think I need to take it out right now

14
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,020
What is that, a tattoo?

15
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,310
- Is that a tattoo?
- Tattoo

16
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,360
Where did you see it?

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,940
I saw that somewhere too

18
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:47,940
Where did I see it?

19
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,280
I think I've seen this in a history book somewhere .

20
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,740
Silence

21
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:53,280
It was someone's love

22
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,330
The donor who is someone's longing

23
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,450
Today, I will sow flowers of love on this land and leave...

24
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,040
Oh, it's an arm

25
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:05,550
No, what kind of body is that made of iron?

26
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,090
How many knives did you eat?

27
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,300
It's not like I have super powers
or anything.

28
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:11,180
Wow, surprise

29
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,140
Why? Why?

30
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,390
Why? Why? What?

31
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,720
- What? What?
- Ghost

32
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,680
Is there a rat?

33
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,350
Teacher, come out

34
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:20,390
- Don't come out
- Come out

35
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,440
- Don't come out, don't come out
- Come out quickly, come out!

36
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,150
No, spray water, water

37
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,860
Don't hold back, come out quickly

38
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,040
It really doesn't hurt, right?

39
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:09,170
How many times do I have to tell you that it doesn't hurt?

40
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,670
This can't be happening like this

41
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,960
I originally worked overtime too

42
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:14,220
I have to drool and do this

43
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,840
A stranger's heart came into my life

44
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,220
As soon as I got here I took a seat

45
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,850
This is awkward

46
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,100
Wouldn't it be better if it didn't hurt?

47
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,010
Okay

48
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,390
I hope it doesn't hurt

49
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,350
I think it might not be the case,
so I

50
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,940
So you're discharged, okay?

51
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,690
Well, if it doesn't hurt, then you should do it

52
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,280
What's that on your wrist?

53
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,780
Do you have a tattoo?

54
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,160
No, I

55
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,530
Is this a side effect of the surgery
or something?

56
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,490
Didn't you make any bad friends at the hospital
?

57
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,790
Where is my friend

58
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,750
Don't get angry and eat slowly

59
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,710
Look, my heart rate is over 90.

60
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:47,870
No, and

61
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,250
This kind of thing, this kind of thing

62
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,540
Don't buy it, it's expensive and
you don't have money.

63
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,340
Why doesn't Dad have any money? Huh?

64
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,470
If there's anything you want to do
or buy, just tell me.

65
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,010
- I have something I want to do
- Just say it.

66
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,760
- Should I try Taekwondo again?
- No.

67
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,680
Just tell me to talk

68
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,100
No, Taekwondo is absolutely not allowed,
it's dangerous.

69
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,600
The doctor said it was okay to run moderately

70
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,970
What does the doctor know, what does the father know?

71
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,140
What good was a heart transplant if you can't even run ?

72
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,100
If you want to do it right

73
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,690
Go to college and
do pilates or something

74
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,020
- Father
- Father

75
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,440
Just thinking about your heart stopping while you were playing a match

76
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,030
I pee myself even while I'm sleeping

77
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,490
Your mom too

78
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,070
Your mother also had a heart attack

79
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,330
Your grandfather also had a heart attack

80
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,540
If my child goes too

81
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,370
This father follows you

82
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,290
How can I live in this dirty world ?

83
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:38,010
Eternal life, eternal spring, new god descending

84
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:41,510
Eternal Immortal Transcendent Flesh

85
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,100
Eternal life, eternal spring, new god descending

86
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,730
Eternal Immortal Transcendent Flesh

87
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,270
Yes, my lord

88
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:51,730
therefore

89
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,480
The organ isn't a battery or anything

90
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,030
How many of these are there already?

91
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,110
This time the pancreas

92
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:03,450
Anyway, the good thing is that
my father will probably be leaving this time.

93
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:06,370
Anyway

94
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:09,580
I'll get rid of everything before the revival.

95
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,420
Don't try to lower the price

96
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,920
Eternal Immortal Transcendent Flesh

97
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,590
Eternal life, eternal spring, new god descending

98
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,300
Eternal Immortal Transcendent Flesh

99
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,680
Eternal life, eternal spring, new god descending

100
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,550
hungry

101
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,300
Go grill some meat

102
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,680
Eternal Immortal Transcendent Flesh

103
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,810
Eternal life, eternal spring, new god descending

104
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,140
Okay, be modest

105
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,060
Let's spread out to the world

106
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,530
- Father
- No

107
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:42,450
Do you know what it is?

108
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:43,490
Taekwondo is absolutely not allowed

109
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,120
No, that's not it

110
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,200
Did you run during gym class?

111
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,790
I've seen your heart rate go up

112
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:48,910
rendezvous

113
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,250
No, I didn't run

114
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,410
But why are the shoes like that?

115
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,370
rendezvous

116
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,290
Oh boy, really

117
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,960
If you keep doing this, I
might just throw it away.

118
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,960
Over there, father over there today

119
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,420
Because it's a designated driver day

120
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,880
Go in first

121
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,680
On the way, buy a new pair of sturdy shoes and wear them.

122
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,560
If I have money left,
I buy healthy food and eat it with my friends.

123
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,310
Okay, that's it for today.

124
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,980
- Where I have friends
- courtesy, courage, consideration

125
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:12,890
Taekwondo

126
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,060
Thank you for your effort

127
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:17,570
Jungpil was late today, so
he got 50 kicks as a penalty.

128
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:19,780
Taekwondo, brother

129
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,190
Oh,
why is the monthly rent 100,000 won?

130
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,070
I'm going to explain to you

131
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,240
Look at this little bastard, this

132
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,700
Hey, you little punk,
if you do that

133
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,660
Are you asking me to fight or to date?

134
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,910
When my sister was your age, she was like Inma

135
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,660
The 540 degree rotation axis is also spinning

136
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,660
Come out

137
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,960
Are you saying all this to make things better for you ?

138
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,790
Put the center of gravity right here

139
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,090
Looking straight at the target

140
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,430
Hey, Joongpil, is this what you did?

141
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,600
Why? What's going on?

142
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,560
father

143
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,650
A big guy has come into our dojo.

144
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,310
Oh, Taekwondo

145
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:00,230
Hey, grab it, hurry, hurry, hurry

146
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,690
Catch me, hey, catch me

147
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,740
- Sorry
- Oh, come quickly.

148
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,240
- Got it.
- Hey, what the hell is this?

149
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,700
At this point, I've caught it

150
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,740
Slow?

151
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,030
No

152
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,500
Oily thing

153
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,660
Director Song said it's not good for the pancreas...

154
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,660
ah

155
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,420
- Chunhwa-ya
- Yes, father.

156
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,880
Thank you for your hard work during this time .

157
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,090
sorry

158
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,300
no

159
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,760
I hope my father is healthy

160
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,430
The believers are blessed

161
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,220
- If my father lives, all things in the universe...
- Ah

162
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,430
People are really amazing

163
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:42,060
Even if you are lying in a coma with a respirator attached

164
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,770
These ears can hear very well.

165
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,440
When my father was alive

166
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,940
I said everything I could say

167
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:51,490
oh my

168
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,450
You must have heard all this, oh
my god

169
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,030
I'm talking

170
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,740
The dog of the dog fuck in the world
, I

171
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:02,920
By car

172
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,750
From the engine to the parts

173
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,630
It's like it's been replaced with a sports car

174
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,210
Is this what happens when you change one pancreas?

175
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,300
I think I'll change one too

176
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,680
So I think

177
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,720
I guess this is it

178
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,930
Doesn't the donor have a special constitution?

179
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,190
What about the donor?

180
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,650
Did you have any superpowers?

181
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,750
Kid, I told you not to do taekwondo.

182
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:48,040
Why do you keep
wearing a dobok? A dobok?

183
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,590
I wore it because it was comfortable, because it was comfortable

184
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,010
It's good for your heart to wear comfortable clothes

185
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,550
Did the doctor do it? Or didn't he?

186
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,550
Just wear it and never do taekwondo

187
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,050
Don't run, walk slowly

188
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,390
Oh, slowly

189
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,000
Sir, since last week

190
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,550
Did you come and go near our gym ?

191
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,970
What, is it Burberry? A stalker?
Love?

192
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,680
All three are crimes, but this one

193
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,720
Hey, arm

194
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,800
Hey, arm

195
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,430
Arm, arm

196
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,270
My heart is strong

197
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,150
I think I need to get a diagnosis

198
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,650
A middle school girl grabbed something and
a grown man grabbed it

199
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,240
Why does that middle school girl speak like that?

200
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,610
I was raised by my grandfather when I was learning to speak.

201
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,320
You still don't know what your abilities are ?

202
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:03,540
I thought this was the growth plate
opening up

203
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,950
Did you know this was a superpower?

204
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,910
Does your mom know?

205
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,830
I don't have a mom

206
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:09,380
Is your dad there?

207
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,290
I have a father

208
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,210
If you know this fact

209
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,050
After crying for 2 nights and 3 days, I fainted

210
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,510
My father is the one who will cause trouble.

211
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,800
I can never say

212
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,880
Well done

213
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:21,010
The original formula was to keep superpowers a secret.

214
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,180
So, sir, do you
have any secret superpowers?

215
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,740
Oh my, oh my

216
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:52,420
But who was the donor to
give him these abilities?

217
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,250
Did you know you can donate six organs?

218
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,170
I don't know

219
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,300
Heart, lungs, cornea, kidneys, liver, pancreas

220
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,630
You're saying there are four more people besides us ?

221
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,100
Well, if we find the rest of the transplants,
maybe we'll get some clues?

222
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,350
How do I find it?

223
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,520
The 17th
Life Sharing Transplant Sports Competition

224
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,310
It will be held at Seoul Park on the 10th.

225
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,270
The transplant sports competition, held every five years across the country,

226
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:17,780
Transplant families and
players participating in the game, etc.

227
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,990
About 100 people are expected to gather

228
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:22,280
Hwang Jae-won, the president of the transplant association,

229
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,990
Ahead of the full-scale competition...

230
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,750
Jump, jump

231
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,890
Oh, good job,
I had a successful corneal transplant.

232
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,060
You're running while looking at the line properly

233
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,350
Okay, the baton is passed.

234
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,890
1st place, cornea 1st place

235
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:34,980
heart

236
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,230
What are you doing now?

237
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,360
Heart last place

238
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,360
It shows the heart properly

239
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:46,570
Heart 1st place

240
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,420
Nike, oh

241
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,210
I just needed some shoes, really

242
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,840
Have you looked into it?

243
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,800
uh?

244
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,220
Oh, no, no

245
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,630
Hey, take this

246
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,260
Aeg, look it up carefully.

247
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,140
He just looks at his phone all day

248
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,020
Sir, don't you have any friends?

249
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,020
Why do you need friends?

250
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,440
Grab this one

251
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,310
No, just eat it

252
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,730
I had a kidney transplant

253
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:21,820
I'm so healthy

254
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,280
I'm giving this to you because I'm so, so grateful.

255
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:26,660
I like it in the market

256
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,240
thank you

257
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:29,990
What do you have?

258
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,910
If you are feeling unwell

259
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:34,750
This is with prebiotics and probiotics

260
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,710
Clear my stomach

261
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,250
Vitamin Vegetables

262
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:39,540
Ma'am, hold that arm

263
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,040
Arms?

264
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:43,260
Why, why?

265
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:46,180
Opposite arm

266
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,340
Why your arms?

267
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,050
Doesn't it taste like apples?

268
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,260
there is

269
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,020
But if you eat a lot of this, your stomach will hurt

270
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,350
Oh, we have our food too

271
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,350
There's also salad

272
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,190
Salads are
5% cheaper with regular delivery

273
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:00,020
Oh, let me show you here.

274
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,190
Uh, why, why?

275
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:04,610
I just got a heart

276
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:06,320
And I'm good at running too

277
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,110
I've become this strong

278
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:11,620
This man had a lung transplant

279
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:13,410
Show me

280
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,840
What is this, what is this, what is this?

281
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,220
Hey, Nogari

282
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:35,720
What is that?

283
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,520
What skills do you have, ma'am?

284
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,100
Oh, I

285
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,440
no

286
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,610
Has anything changed since you had the surgery?

287
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,490
I just don't know

288
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,610
People say their skin has improved

289
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,160
They all said I got prettier

290
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,330
Oh, really,
what do you think I'm pretty about, really?

291
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,120
Is this a superpower that makes you pretty?

292
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,250
These days, being pretty is a superpower.

293
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:00,330
Not to that extent

294
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,500
no

295
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,500
I came here pretending to buy yogurt.

296
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,710
Men ask for your number a lot.

297
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,630
It reminds me of my first love

298
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:07,590
I said no

299
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:08,720
bon appetite

300
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,720
The lady has a tattoo too, a tattoo

301
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,060
If you have a tattoo

302
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,680
The formula is to have superpowers

303
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,060
I guess you haven't discovered it yet

304
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,190
This guy is
a superpowered Dr. Chuck Chuck.

305
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,100
There's nothing I don't know

306
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,810
Originally, when these people with these abilities gathered together

307
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,320
You will also discover abilities you didn't know you had.

308
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,570
If you look for the rest
, you'll find it yourself.

309
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:28,940
How do I find the rest?

310
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,000
Park Wan-seo

311
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,250
heart transplant

312
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,290
Jindeok Middle School, Grade 3, Class 2

313
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,710
Taekwondo elementary school

314
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,840
From the five-crown champion

315
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,220
Future dream: To marry Do Kyung-soo

316
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,630
Is Do Kyung Soo bulletproof?

317
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,550
It's EXO

318
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,140
Ms. Kim Seon-nyeo, kidney transplant

319
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,060
75 years, rabbit?

320
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:58,970
Are you single?

321
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,940
You still have your first love on your face. What are you doing?

322
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:08,320
Park Ji-sung, lung transplant

323
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,110
- Occupation...
- Stop!

324
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,320
who are you?

325
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:15,490
This is Hwang Gi-dong

326
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:17,910
When you start, you start, when you start, you move

327
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:19,870
Hwang Gi-dong, I received a cornea

328
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:28,210
Mr. Kidong, how did you find us?

329
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,630
ah

330
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:33,090
Everyone has a tattoo, right?

331
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,470
If this comes within a few kilometers radius

332
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:38,430
It's shining brightly

333
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:43,140
I can't explain it because only I can see it

334
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,980
Then what did you do earlier, sir?

335
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:48,150
What,
you're dealing with electromagnetic waves, Wi-Fi, and stuff like that?

336
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:49,900
Something like this?

337
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,280
yes

338
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,370
Five hundred and one more glass

339
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,450
yes

340
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,540
That's great

341
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,500
Mr. Kidong is our superpower captain.

342
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,250
- What is the captain?
- The captain is looking for other people too.

343
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,130
Is it a military regime?

344
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,340
Hey, you said you have to be within a few meters to see it.

345
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,380
I know where you are

346
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:16,180
Then hack like before

347
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,600
- If you look at that movie...
- Hacking is what, a dictatorship?

348
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,810
What happens if you get caught spying on civilians?

349
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:24,230
In addition to violating the Privacy Protection Act and
the Information and Communication Network Act

350
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,350
Leaking personal information and even defamation

351
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,190
You don't know that they're all connected

352
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,980
No, he said he would find it first

353
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,240
So, the method
is not fair, the method is not fair.

354
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,190
Are you doing this because it's annoying?

355
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,200
I'm busy so I won't do that

356
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,530
Sir, you don't have a job.

357
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,740
- Who said that?
- What do you do for a living?

358
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,700
Writer, write a screenplay

359
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:44,700
What are you writing?

360
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,170
- Hero
- Look

361
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,210
It ends next week

362
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:51,000
Oh, you like heroes.

363
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,920
So you know the community there?

364
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,510
Ukki, among us

365
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,550
There's a lot of hero material there.

366
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:59,050
- We like each other.
- Yes.

367
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,510
There are a lot of local Japanese pirates there.

368
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,140
Are you a slob?

369
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,890
You're a communist

370
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,930
somehow

371
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,060
Let's not mix words

372
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,230
'Oh my god' is almost like informal speech, but
how old are you?

373
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,610
- 88
- I'm 87?

374
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,110
- Me quick
- quick what month?

375
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,110
Fast April

376
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,820
April is so fast

377
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,820
Isn't that the national rule?

378
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,450
What is the basis for saying that it is not a national rule?

379
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:18,820
What is the argument that needs to be supported?

380
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:21,580
Oh my, why are you guys like this,
on such a nice day

381
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,700
If you receive new life in one body

382
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,870
We should live like family

383
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,760
mister

384
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,260
We decided to give the chicken a yen bun

385
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:43,850
Oh my, my, Yoranta

386
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,270
What kind of show are you showing me this time?

387
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,930
These poor souls

388
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,650
Would you like to offer up your liver and gallbladder?

389
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,820
It's expensive now
, if that's the case

390
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:56,940
I'll look elsewhere

391
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,490
Pseudo in Korea

392
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:00,950
You know it's overflowing?

393
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,420
There are all kinds of things

394
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,210
I'm out

395
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:04,180
Eternal life, eternal spring, new god descending

396
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:06,810
Heaven and Earth, the Second Coming of the Spirit

397
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:09,600
Happy Resurrection, New God

398
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,690
A busy person has arrived, my lord

399
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,310
If you are good, can you save at least one more poor soul ?

400
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,690
I have to learn from the new god.

401
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,440
Why is it in my ears

402
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:21,360
I heard you came to steal it.

403
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:24,240
I hurt my ear when I was young

404
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,530
I'm sorry you didn't hear me correctly

405
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,200
No, no

406
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,500
My ears can hear very well.

407
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,710
How much does it cost, my daughter?

408
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:39,460
What if I hand over all the foundations?

409
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,970
Oh, still

410
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:45,140
The pharmaceutical company says it won't hand it over.

411
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:48,510
It's a business that my father
started from the beginning.

412
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,270
You are a filial daughter, my daughter

413
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:52,890
Byungchun-ah

414
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:56,810
There has been no filial son or daughter in my family for generations.

415
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,610
Blood is greedy

416
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,070
I called for a 45 head allowance

417
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,900
I'll give you 50 each

418
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,320
If you pass it before the revival meeting

419
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:07,530
My ear hurt

420
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,530
I got hurt because of you

421
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,250
When there was a tea ceremony show at Jeongseon Market

422
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:13,290
You hit it wrong

423
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:14,460
550 thousand won

424
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,830
So you get beaten by me like a dog

425
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,340
I shit my pants

426
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,880
That day, I sold a lot of medicine.

427
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,340
Stop it, bro

428
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,970
A guy who follows a pharmacist around and ends up taking a dump

429
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:29,350
Looks like you really think you're a spirit

430
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,060
Fuck, stop it

431
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,680
This herbal medicine is a cub

432
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:35,440
Stop talking shit, you piece of shit

433
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,230
It was cheap, after all

434
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:41,320
What the fuck

435
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:18,100
Come on, take her out now

436
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,680
Yeah, put it in, put it in, just put it in

437
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,180
5 minutes left for lunch

438
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,730
Everyone must take their positions 5 minutes before

439
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:00,940
You can work at the exact time

440
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:04,150
Accurate time
keeps us safe

441
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,190
Wear a hard hat.

442
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,360
There are still 3 minutes left

443
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:11,030
Users
cannot be forced to work overtime.

444
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,870
Didn't you know that this is a violation of the Labor Standards Act ?

445
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,580
Mr. Seunghoon Lee knows the law so well

446
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,660
Why are you doing this here, prosecutor ?

447
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,670
I'm telling you not to discriminate against contract workers.

448
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,290
Even if he is not a contract worker, he is the president.

449
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,250
If you had kept your break time

450
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:25,210
I know how to keep to business hours .

451
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,800
This foundation is the one that doesn't keep what it should keep.

452
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,470
Ask them to set a date for a revival meeting or something.

453
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:32,140
Safety equipment is lacking for working overtime on fictional days.

454
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,180
If something happens like this,
will the captain come save me?

455
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,890
That leader is a human being who saved me...

456
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,770
A human being who cannot be saved and
will end up in hellfire

457
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:39,980
How dare you
bring up the name of the new father!

458
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:53,870
Why is it like this?

459
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:54,910
Fell from above

460
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:56,410
I see

461
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,370
No, I told you several times to replace it , really.

462
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,580
Are you answering the phone?

463
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:34,740
When are people coming?

464
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,160
Mr. Choi said he would contact me

465
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,110
I told you I saw it

466
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:13,820
Why can't I trust what people say?

467
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,280
It's not that I don't believe it

468
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,370
In medical terms, that's
called sudopsia.

469
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:20,540
When you get excited and dopamine is secreted,

470
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,740
No, no

471
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,080
I wasn't even excited and I saw it properly

472
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,420
How to wake up as soon as possible

473
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,630
Aren't you just looking for meat that you can't even catch ?

474
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:29,290
Hwang Shin-ryeong, that gentleman

475
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,800
He grabbed me by the collar and my white hair suddenly fell out

476
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,760
That tree too...

477
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,550
- What we talked about then?
- Yes?

478
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:37,970
The person who gave the organ

479
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:40,180
Did you say you have a special constitution?

480
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,810
The opinion is that it may be a special constitution.

481
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:44,310
People who have received organ transplants

482
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,020
Isn't there more?

483
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:24,850
One more time

484
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:43,200
Oh, I see the pollen is flying somewhere.

485
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:45,290
Should I stop?

486
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:46,790
Oh, just do it

487
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:48,080
Since I'm doing it

488
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:55,590
It's the weekend. Aren't you going anywhere?

489
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,300
Don't you have any friends?

490
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,590
I have no friends

491
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:00,930
why?

492
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,350
Because of your father?

493
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:06,270
No, that's that too

494
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,390
I took a year off because I was sick, so
I don't have any friends.

495
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:11,810
I know

496
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,860
When you're sick, you don't say you're sick

497
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,900
If you don't get sick, you won't get sick, my friend.

498
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,320
The original superpower's friend is loneliness

499
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,210
- Do you know that?
- I don't know.

500
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:31,960
- Do you know what it is?
- What is it?

501
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,920
The villain is

502
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,960
Among the same superpowered people

503
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:41,220
And why do you attack other superpowered people
?

504
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,840
You want to have all the superpowers by yourself?

505
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:45,640
So we
have to find the villain first.

506
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,600
Before my powers are taken away

507
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,560
- Us?
- Yes, we.

508
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:52,560
Originally, people with superpowers
were friends with other people with superpowers.

509
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:54,270
Rich people hang out with other rich people.

510
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,730
Sir, try this

511
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,280
- Why?
- Try it.

512
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,700
mister

513
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:07,740
If you get caught by the villain, just say something

514
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,620
I told you I'd save our entire team.

515
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,330
Wanseo student!

516
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:17,130
however

517
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,210
How do you recognize this villain?

518
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,630
You'll know when you see it

519
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:23,300
Just looking at it

520
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,470
This kid is a villain

521
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,520
Oh, only you knew

522
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,730
I ate two chicken wings each.

523
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:34,100
Wanseo student, Mr. Jisung

524
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:36,060
Ah, I found it, I found it

525
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,110
I found out what my superpower is

526
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:39,070
Take a look

527
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:40,610
Look, look

528
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,490
Knock knock knock knock knock knock

529
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:58,290
Do I have no superpowers?

530
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,510
Why am I the only one with tattoos?

531
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:02,840
It's plump like a swollen scar

532
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,390
Why do you want superpowers, ma'am ?

533
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:09,930
If you have superpowers,
you can save people and things like that.

534
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:11,140
Like a hero

535
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,180
Not everyone with superpowers becomes a hero.

536
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:14,850
why?

537
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,020
Experience

538
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,270
positiveness

539
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,860
Number of people saved

540
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:24,070
There is a cutoff line for this depending on the level of self-sacrifice.

541
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:25,700
What, any hero?

542
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:28,570
Hey, I
don't really like cut lines

543
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,120
No, is he coming or not? Huh?

544
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,330
What, you found it with that clever hack
?

545
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,370
I don't know, ask when you come

546
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:37,580
If you eat a lot of that, your stomach will hurt.

547
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:39,750
Even if you show up, you'll show up late

548
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:41,340
I'm young too

549
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,630
Leave a message or something

550
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:44,920
uh?

551
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:57,230
I will return your money.

552
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:59,480
돈이 문제가 아니고
이 개새끼야, 어?

553
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,440
How can you hit the jackpot
eleven times in one place, eleven times?

554
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:04,110
I think that machine is broken.
What should I do?

555
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:05,190
Take off your glasses

556
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,450
No, I don't think this is broken

557
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:08,950
It's not that I didn't, but I compensated...

558
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:10,370
You're sitting there talking like you're getting paid
, bro.

559
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:11,450
I see your fingers, this one, this one

560
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:13,580
If you bounce this, you'll hit the jackpot

561
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,290
What are you, Pikachu? Do you create static electricity?

562
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:16,870
I'm not Pikachu, this is

563
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,960
It's a superpower

564
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:24,090
Oh, this is totally funny

565
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:26,880
You should contact our Yonggu hyung .

566
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:29,340
I just sent you a text message right now

567
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,150
That, that, that needs to be pushed

568
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,490
I heard that if you eat a lot of that,
your stomach will hurt

569
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:53,160
I ate five of them

570
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,120
Where did you go?

571
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:56,790
Oh, hey, middle school students aren't allowed in

572
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:57,710
This isn't a PC room

573
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:59,790
I'm originally a high school student, but
I took a year off.

574
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:02,170
I'm a high school student and
I'm not from a PC room, right?

575
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:03,960
Auntie, I don't eat yogurt.
My stomach hurts.

576
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,840
I'm not here to sell yogurt .

577
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,300
I came here to take that young man with me.

578
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,550
So this bachelor

579
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:11,340
I'm telling you, he's not the kind of bachelor you can just take with you !

580
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:13,100
This bachelor
is causing a ruckus in the store...

581
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:15,060
But
how did I contact you if you don't have a cell phone?

582
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,430
hey

583
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,060
There is no toilet paper.

584
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:19,890
there

585
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:29,610
It's far away

586
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:33,490
- Are you a friend?
- No.

587
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:34,620
mister

588
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,080
Send that guy away

589
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,580
My father is a Taekwondo master.

590
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,540
My dad has a criminal record, right?

591
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,500
Didn't you hear a single thing I said earlier ?

592
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:44,590
This guy just
trashed the store

593
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:45,840
This old man is suffering a huge loss...

594
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,010
The person who caused the accident should pay for the damages.

595
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:49,050
We're not even friends

596
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,340
That person has no friends.

597
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,890
You should get a really good scolding, really

598
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,300
Can't use

599
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:56,220
no

600
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:57,850
We're going to eat ribs

601
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:59,890
When you feel like you've been scolded and
become a new person, come here

602
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:00,810
Or go

603
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:01,940
I go my own way

604
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,730
Please don't do that

605
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:06,570
Just let it go, okay?

606
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,030
Oh, I

607
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,570
I'll give you one of these as a service.

608
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,950
Did these gentlemen really
understand what I was saying as shit?

609
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:16,620
I heard you have stomach trouble

610
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,470
Beef ribs? Pork ribs?

611
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:45,860
It's been about 10 minutes since I went in.

612
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,270
How did all four of you get together?

613
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:53,030
It took exactly 4 minutes and 28 seconds, bro.

614
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,130
slowly

615
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:14,930
Tayo

616
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:16,010
Hey, hey, hey, hey

617
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:18,970
Hey, Inma

618
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,730
Ma, call them, call them

619
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:25,690
Huh?

620
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:26,940
Agga is coming?

621
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,110
Save me

622
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,570
I see

623
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,240
Hey, catch me

624
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,000
What is that?

625
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,000
Hey, try to overtake me

626
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:54,630
Oh, that, that, that

627
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,000
What should I do?

628
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:29,920
Step further!

629
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,430
Wanseo student!

630
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:05,540
Run, run, robot

631
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:18,840
oh my god

632
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:28,850
Downswing

633
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,840
Stop! You guys! Stop! You guys!

634
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:08,720
Isn't our tow truck funny?

635
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:10,680
This guy is the furious driver of the tow truck world

636
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:11,770
You today...

637
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:13,650
Sneeze, you, you sneeze

638
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,520
You little shit, sneeze

639
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,280
Take off your glasses and eyebrows!

640
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:32,210
Brother, brother

641
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:34,000
In front, in front, brother

642
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:38,750
Oh, dirty

643
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:52,100
Stop!

644
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,030
There are 4 people

645
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:07,950
I ate well

646
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:10,580
Unlimited refills, this is worth eating

647
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,870
Who made me go through all this trouble?

648
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,370
You don't even calculate, really

649
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:17,880
If someone saw
you, they'd think you did the math.

650
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,550
- 'You' is informal speech?
- It's a pseudo-formal speech?

651
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,050
Stop fighting

652
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:22,340
Friends with super powers

653
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,340
What about friends

654
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,470
Is this person
going to keep hanging out with me?

655
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:29,010
Then you can hack it and find it if you
have the ability.

656
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:32,140
You can't do it so you don't do it?
You can't do it because it's illegal.

657
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,730
A gentleman with such a strong sense of law-abiding spirit

658
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:37,230
Why did you plagiarize someone else's scenario ?

659
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:39,980
Did you hack me?

660
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:41,070
Yeah, I did

661
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:43,070
Because you kept saying 'justice, justice'

662
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,280
I took a peek

663
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,860
What is the author

664
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:47,910
I just sold one scenario

665
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:49,740
I stole something from my friend

666
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:51,370
So you don't have any friends

667
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:08,390
This kid is a famous malicious commenter

668
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,600
How many times have you been sued?

669
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:13,020
A very evil bastard who gives movie ratings without even watching them

670
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,680
No, this is a beggar

671
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:16,810
Did you know that your coin is now cut in half ?

672
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,650
80,000 won left, hey

673
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,690
You have to earn money by sweating to
be fair

674
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:26,400
Your mom who works as a housekeeper in someone else's house
to pay for coins

675
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,490
- Isn't it pitiful?
- Sir, don't do it, okay?

676
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:29,620
If I were you, I would commit suicide

677
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,370
Why are you talking like that?

678
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,290
There are things to say and things not to say.

679
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,250
Suicide?

680
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,500
Go, Mr. Ji Sung, hold on

681
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:43,880
What are you holding back?
Come out, sir.

682
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,090
- Hey, let go.
- Oh, really, why are we like this?

683
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:48,380
We decided to be friends

684
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:49,760
Hey, I played with this because I felt bad for it

685
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,930
Do you think we
're even real friends?

686
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:55,430
Hey, come to work

687
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,080
Why are you guys like this, seriously

688
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,870
If it's going to be like this, let's not meet anymore

689
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:44,060
Why didn't you answer the phone?

690
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:45,360
Where have you been, huh?

691
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,400
Why is this happening again?

692
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,530
Who were you with?

693
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:50,780
Were you with your friends?

694
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:52,870
I don't have any friends

695
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:54,910
What have you been doing alone up until now?

696
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:55,910
Who's your friend, tell me your number

697
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:56,830
I don't have any friends

698
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:59,710
I know what happened to you,
I'm the police station, the hospital.

699
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:01,870
I'll take care of everything, even the funeral!

700
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:04,540
I
searched everything, even the mortuary! I!

701
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:06,040
A child who is not even healthy right now

702
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:07,210
When you hang out with friends and stuff?

703
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,840
Oh, really

704
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,050
I don't have any friends

705
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:12,760
I don't have any friends

706
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:14,970
There's no one

707
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:17,060
They all just hate me

708
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:19,430
I'm just a useless being

709
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,770
If I knew how to live like this

710
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:22,850
I wish I had just died right then

711
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,230
Hey! Why are you dying!

712
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:25,400
Oh, really

713
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,360
I feel suffocated because of my father

714
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:30,900
It's not because my heart hurts

715
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:33,410
I think I'll stop because of my father

716
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,240
Am I a dog?

717
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,910
Why do I put on a dog collar, why?

718
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:42,460
I'm so
frustrated because of my father that I feel like I could die

719
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,670
I don't need a father

720
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:51,840
Wanseoya

721
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:53,970
Wanseo, Wanseo

722
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,220
Don't run

723
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,390
Slip

724
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:25,000
Have a cup of tea and go.

725
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,550
Stop bringing that kind of stuff now.

726
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,300
sorry

727
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:39,640
I heard you had a kidney transplant

728
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,060
I hope it went well

729
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:44,480
Your face looks better

730
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,860
Look how much better your skin has become

731
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,110
Your wife is like a girl

732
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:57,950
You took two human lives.

733
00:43:58,030 --> 00:43:59,370
You have to get better

734
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:00,830
Isn't that right?

735
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,250
I was wrong

736
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:07,880
The rest of my life

737
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:09,460
The rest of my life

738
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:11,380
Doing good things

739
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:14,130
Things my husband couldn't do

740
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:16,930
Save a lot of people

741
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:20,050
I wish the lady
would just kill herself again instead of living.

742
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:23,770
I hope you don't fail this time
and succeed for sure.

743
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:25,770
I'm going to suffocate and die for no reason.

744
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:29,060
Don't make a fool of yourself die like my husband .

745
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:31,480
I wish the lady would die

746
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,580
Let's do this

747
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,290
what...

748
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,040
Let's study this and develop new drugs.

749
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:53,590
What are you talking about...

750
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:55,050
Director Song's retirement

751
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:56,380
About 3 years left?

752
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,430
It's been 3 years and 4 months.

753
00:44:58,510 --> 00:44:59,760
After I retire

754
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:02,390
Do you want to change your grandchildren's diapers?

755
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:04,350
Do you want to be the vice president of a pharmaceutical company?

756
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:06,020
yes?

757
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:08,730
In our country too

758
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:12,020
It's about time the Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded.

759
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:13,440
But still, how...

760
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:17,780
What do you think will happen?

761
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:19,030
Why did you come?

762
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:21,110
Are you really not going to see it?

763
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:22,950
The lady said, "Stop watching."

764
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:25,120
Let's find the villain, sir.

765
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:28,210
We've already found the villain
, so let's stop looking now.

766
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,210
no way

767
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:34,090
Hey, this guy, this guy,
he's not a villain.

768
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:36,050
A bit of a nerd style?

769
00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:38,470
It's not that kid,
it's me that's the villain, I

770
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,430
You know because you've been hurt too

771
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:43,800
If your body is twisted,
your mind will also be twisted

772
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:46,060
Then I don't even want to see those guys who are so talented

773
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:49,230
I hate seeing myself hiding behind those people I
hate and swearing at them.

774
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:50,690
A guy who originally has nothing and
has nothing

775
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:52,230
Being a villain is the formula

776
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:54,860
But you have super powers, don't you?

777
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:57,990
What are you going to do with this?

778
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:02,280
If you're going to be born , be born properly like that kid .

779
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:04,280
What kind of superpower is this? It's incompetence.

780
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:05,990
Is it like this?

781
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,290
I'm
like this because I'm like this

782
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,550
I didn't plagiarize the scenario

783
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:18,170
We were originally going to write together

784
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:19,800
He went out and said he would use something else

785
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:20,720
Oh, okay

786
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:23,510
mister

787
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:26,760
Are you really playing with me because you feel sorry for me?

788
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:28,720
That's canceled

789
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,440
Go to the fairy lady and
apologize to her.

790
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:35,190
Go there and have the old man do it himself.

791
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:37,570
Where is it?

792
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:39,320
Liver transplant, found

793
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:41,070
Team 7 leader

794
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:43,240
These people
aren't even our believers right now.

795
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,620
If we do things like safety and treatment improvement ,

796
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:47,410
I can't finish it until the revival day.

797
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:49,410
When I was there, there was no line
, just 50th and 60th floors.

798
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:50,830
I was just going up, just like that

799
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:51,790
Safety first

800
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:54,080
The new father
spoke directly

801
00:46:54,170 --> 00:46:55,000
therefore

802
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,540
What safety equipment does the new father need to inspect ?

803
00:46:58,170 --> 00:46:59,550
Because everyone doesn't have that faith

804
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:01,090
It's not that I'm doing this because I'm scared

805
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:02,010
Let's eat

806
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:03,050
District Chief

807
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:05,800
There are still 15 minutes left, lunch time.

808
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:08,260
Let's eat something

809
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:09,310
What kind of robots are we?

810
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:10,640
How can I finish this all in one day
?

811
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:11,680
Robot, robot

812
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:12,930
Come and eat

813
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:14,900
If I want to finish this today

814
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:16,730
I have to see someone fall

815
00:47:16,810 --> 00:47:17,730
no way

816
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:20,480
When you come, please bring me a cup of ramen.

817
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:21,690
okay

818
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:22,650
yes

819
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,200
Don't come, don't come

820
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,790
Look, read and chew

821
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:32,660
What else do you do when you come? You'll probably get oxygen or something.

822
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:35,250
Anyway, I have a useless
ability

823
00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:36,670
It's crooked, man.

824
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:39,500
Sorry about that

825
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:41,420
I'll go first

826
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:42,800
Come and meet us

827
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:44,130
why?

828
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,720
Auntie, you want to find superpowers?

829
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:49,680
I'm sorry, student Wanseo

830
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:50,720
I am

831
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:52,890
Not qualified

832
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:54,350
Where is that?

833
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:58,060
We decided to find superpowers together and become heroes, right?

834
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:01,270
Mr. Kidong

835
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:03,490
Did you take a look too?

836
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,740
I'm not qualified

837
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:09,320
Oh, well,
I didn't look at it in that much detail.

838
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:13,040
Use your precious skills for good.

839
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:15,410
Thank you for your help

840
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:19,710
I don't do it either

841
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:21,960
I really hate you, Mr. Lee

842
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,510
In a world where it's hard to make a living

843
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:28,050
What kind of superhero are you and
what are you going to do to help others?

844
00:48:28,970 --> 00:48:29,930
Disbanded as of today

845
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:31,180
The group chat room also exploded

846
00:48:41,310 --> 00:48:42,570
Because I said it was nothing

847
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:43,980
Don't be nervous

848
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:45,240
What are you doing?

849
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,440
Can't you hear the sound?

850
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:47,360
Get out quickly, get out quickly

851
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:48,700
I said it was nothing a little while ago

852
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:50,530
If the district chief
is guarding the place

853
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:52,660
Do you think the district chief will take responsibility if you die ?

854
00:48:53,950 --> 00:48:54,870
Go out, quickly

855
00:48:55,790 --> 00:48:57,160
In two lines, in two lines

856
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:58,120
Slowly, slowly

857
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:11,760
Where do you get this from?

858
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:21,270
Get out quickly!

859
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:25,860
No, are you doing okay? Yes?

860
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:27,530
Oh my, I don't know, me too

861
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:33,870
Mr. Seunghoon Lee?

862
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:34,910
Mr. Lee Seung-hoon

863
00:49:36,290 --> 00:49:37,450
Here, here, here, here

864
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:38,540
Here, here, here

865
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:39,540
Mr. Lee Seung-hoon

866
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:41,080
Please save me, Captain

867
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:45,130
But isn't this the place we came here before?

868
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:47,960
Please save me

869
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:49,050
Mr. Lee Seung-hoon

870
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:51,640
Wear a hard hat, wear a hard hat!

871
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:07,320
Sir, get out of the way

872
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,570
No, ma'am

873
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:49,900
There's someone inside

874
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:51,900
- Mr. Kidong, open the door!
- Just a moment.

875
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:53,320
- Mr. Kido, hurry.
- It's dangerous if you go in...

876
00:50:53,410 --> 00:50:54,570
Oh, open it, okay?

877
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:55,530
Open it

878
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,090
I'm sorry about that time

879
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:19,720
Don't you have anything like water glasses here?

880
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:21,560
I can't see it at all because of the smoke

881
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,100
Hey, turn this song off

882
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:26,560
Mr. Kidong

883
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:27,610
Oh, I do

884
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,200
Oh, I found it

885
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:43,960
I'll give you directions, come in and come back.

886
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,290
Who are you to tell me
to come in?

887
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:48,420
I told you I'd be a human navigator

888
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,750
If you have navigation,
you can go in

889
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,380
Oh, are you crazy? What if we fight?

890
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:55,220
No, I asked him to open the door so
he opened it for me.

891
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:57,010
You asked me to tell you the way
, so I told you.

892
00:51:57,090 --> 00:51:58,510
What more can I do for you, sir?

893
00:51:58,600 --> 00:51:59,720
I'm not asking you to do anything more

894
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:01,260
I'm telling you not to tell me to do this or that.

895
00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:02,390
Don't tell me to do this or that

896
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:04,060
Who is telling me to do this and that now?

897
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:05,310
Where did you put the persimmon, where did you put the pear

898
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:06,390
It's not "Put the persimmon away, put the pear away"

899
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,850
I'm telling you not to tell me to do this or that.

900
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:09,440
I just told you not to tell me to do this or that .

901
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,400
Hey, you fucking two-faced bastards!

902
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:13,360
Whenever we make eye contact,
we start to giggle

903
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,740
쌍으로 지랄 염병들이야
이 미친 새끼들

904
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:18,240
Aren't you going to find it quickly?

905
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,540
Sir, please tell me the way.

906
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:35,840
Oh! Left, left

907
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:36,760
Just a little more

908
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:38,550
Boy, I don't understand what you're saying.

909
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:41,140
No, no, that's right, uh

910
00:52:41,470 --> 00:52:42,810
Go straight, go straight

911
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:43,810
Yeah, there!

912
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:46,560
uh?

913
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:56,900
Oh, Mr. Lee Seung-hoon

914
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:59,200
are you okay?

915
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,200
- This way, this way, this way
- Are you okay? What should I do?

916
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:04,790
Mr. Lee Seung-hoon

917
00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:07,410
Hey, hey, hey
Seunghoon, come to your senses

918
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:35,230
mister

919
00:53:37,570 --> 00:53:38,530
water

920
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:40,110
What, water?

921
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:41,780
Quick, water!

922
00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:42,740
Oh, water, water

923
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:44,660
- Water, water
- water

924
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:45,580
water

925
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:48,500
Oh, what should I do?

926
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:51,000
Water, water

927
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:52,540
oh my god

928
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:55,000
Don't just stay still, do something

929
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,910
What is it, ma'am? Huh?

930
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:42,880
Where? Where to?

931
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:46,930
Stop!

932
00:54:48,010 --> 00:54:48,930
uh?

933
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:50,850
Where is Mr. Kidong?

934
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:55,980
I'm not going anywhere

935
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:57,520
When you ask me to bring you water and ask where I am,

936
00:54:57,610 --> 00:54:58,730
Do you know where I am?

937
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:00,690
There is a water purifier

938
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:02,740
Well, there's a poster of some superhero or something.

939
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:22,550
Then,
sir, you go out first.

940
00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:25,590
Oh my, over there

941
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:28,010
If it's a poster in the water purifier,
I'm not the one, so let's go together

942
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:30,640
Sir,
please take this guy outside.

943
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,020
Okay, okay

944
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:32,930
This way

945
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:37,360
Yeah, yeah

946
00:55:37,730 --> 00:55:38,570
This way

947
00:56:26,030 --> 00:56:27,660
Just a hundred more meters to go

948
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:30,200
There's no gas masks or anything like that at this construction site
?

949
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:32,040
sorry

950
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:35,660
No, but I saw earlier that
there were a lot of things like tanks here.

951
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:37,330
Don't you have anything like an oxygen tank?

952
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Here we go, oxygen tank

953
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:52,970
Not you

954
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,270
My name is Heoyakseon

955
00:58:22,350 --> 00:58:23,900
I had a liver transplant

956
00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:26,150
Curing the underlying disease

957
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:27,230
I said yes or no

958
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:28,530
Due to a simple accident

959
00:58:28,610 --> 00:58:31,360
Fractures, contusions, frozen shoulder, chronic fatigue

960
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:34,910
I can fix things like this , of course.

961
00:58:34,990 --> 00:58:37,200
Hey, please let me know when you need it

962
00:58:38,830 --> 00:58:40,870
Oh, so you're a designated driver too?

963
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,000
My father does it too

964
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,290
I saw it earlier

965
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:46,290
It seems like the teacher takes away things like other people getting hurt.

966
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:47,210
it's okay

967
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:50,090
I'm fine if I drink a glass of water like this

968
00:58:50,550 --> 00:58:51,510
really

969
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:54,970
Teacher, people like
you are truly heroes.

970
00:58:55,050 --> 00:58:56,100
Isn't that right?

971
00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:57,010
clap

972
00:58:57,810 --> 00:58:58,810
Applause

973
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:00,890
- Ma'am
- Yes?

974
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:02,310
In my opinion

975
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:04,480
Madam you are a true hero

976
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:06,520
Please save my life

977
00:59:06,610 --> 00:59:08,480
Thank you very much

978
00:59:18,530 --> 00:59:19,370
what?

979
00:59:19,450 --> 00:59:20,370
- What?
- What what?

980
00:59:20,450 --> 00:59:21,660
I don't know what you're talking about

981
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:23,580
Oh, don't cry, ma'am.

982
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:25,920
You were swearing at each other just now,
why are you crying? It doesn't suit you.

983
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,420
This is scarier

984
00:59:29,630 --> 00:59:31,210
No, actually, I used to

985
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:34,010
I have depression and
intermittent explosive disorder.

986
00:59:34,090 --> 00:59:35,340
I just took some medicine

987
00:59:35,430 --> 00:59:37,680
And then after the surgery, I
got healthy again

988
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:39,640
I thought things were really getting better now

989
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:41,470
I thought swearing was a superpower

990
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:42,560
Oh

991
00:59:42,810 --> 00:59:45,190
Oh, I forgot everything that happened earlier

992
00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:47,150
Shall we each name each other?

993
00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:48,150
Among heroes?

994
00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:49,480
What name are you going to give it, again?

995
00:59:49,570 --> 00:59:51,030
Oh, why, when I watch foreign movies

996
00:59:51,110 --> 00:59:53,070
Each hero
has their own name.

997
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:55,110
What kind of man and woman are you?

998
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:58,240
Then I'm
strong now and I save people

999
00:59:58,320 --> 00:59:59,370
How about saving it?

1000
00:59:59,450 --> 01:00:00,910
Begging in short?

1001
01:00:00,990 --> 01:00:02,040
Are you okay?

1002
01:00:03,370 --> 01:00:04,460
Nine in English

1003
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:05,370
It's me

1004
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:08,130
Because you are an oxygen tank

1005
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:09,630
I'm a tank boy, I'm a tank boy

1006
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:11,550
What are you going to do, ma'am?

1007
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:13,840
Oh, I'm originally a fresh manager

1008
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,840
So I was trying to do fresh girl

1009
01:00:15,930 --> 01:00:17,550
Is it a bit too much to walk?

1010
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:20,510
No, but Fresh is
better than Fresh Woman

1011
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:22,970
Fresh girl is so cute in your mouth,
right?

1012
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:23,890
Just do it

1013
01:00:24,310 --> 01:00:25,350
You don't have to call me

1014
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:30,480
The teacher's
last name is Yakja, Seonja

1015
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:31,400
yes

1016
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:33,030
I guess it'll work if you give it a try

1017
01:00:33,110 --> 01:00:34,490
Hands are healing hands

1018
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,660
Oh, Mr. Kidong's name is Kidong

1019
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:39,870
Bluetooth Man

1020
01:00:39,950 --> 01:00:41,330
That, wifi, that thing

1021
01:00:41,410 --> 01:00:42,870
Oh, good, good

1022
01:00:42,950 --> 01:00:44,000
Hey, begging

1023
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:46,250
Are you really bad at studying?

1024
01:00:46,330 --> 01:00:48,620
My father just told me to stay healthy.

1025
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:50,000
Oh, over there

1026
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:51,750
I am that fact

1027
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:54,380
Well, I have a name in mind.

1028
01:00:54,590 --> 01:00:58,300
Because I heal people and
replenish their stamina.

1029
01:00:58,970 --> 01:01:00,090
Battery Man

1030
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:03,890
Well, since everyone speaks in English,
there is a sense of unity.

1031
01:01:03,970 --> 01:01:06,100
Yeah, good, battery

1032
01:01:06,890 --> 01:01:08,600
Okay, we've all decided on a name today.

1033
01:01:08,690 --> 01:01:09,940
The atmosphere must be like that too

1034
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:11,020
Bluesman

1035
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:13,570
It suits the mood today

1036
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:14,860
Music Cue

1037
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:18,650
This is so cool

1038
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:19,910
No, but sir, sir

1039
01:01:19,990 --> 01:01:21,820
This is really amazing.
Just take a look.

1040
01:01:22,990 --> 01:01:23,830
Action

1041
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:32,340
and!

1042
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:37,130
One more time

1043
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:38,630
stop

1044
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:52,560
Where have you been?

1045
01:01:53,230 --> 01:01:54,150
I met a friend

1046
01:01:55,070 --> 01:01:56,030
You don't have any friends?

1047
01:01:56,110 --> 01:01:57,320
I made a friend

1048
01:01:58,490 --> 01:01:59,400
Can you help me?

1049
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:01,110
What power do you have?

1050
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:04,700
Get out of the way because you'll get hurt

1051
01:02:11,830 --> 01:02:12,830
Did you see it?

1052
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:14,590
Dad, is it still usable, huh?

1053
01:02:14,670 --> 01:02:16,670
- It's useful
- Because it's useful

1054
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,340
If anything happens,
leave it to your father.

1055
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:21,550
- Huh?
- Father

1056
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:24,390
Even if you
become a hunchbacked old woman,

1057
01:02:25,350 --> 01:02:27,560
Just shout 'Dad'

1058
01:02:28,220 --> 01:02:29,810
He showed up like a hero!

1059
01:02:29,890 --> 01:02:31,350
I'll solve it all

1060
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:35,440
If you catch a cold, it's bad for your heart.

1061
01:02:36,270 --> 01:02:38,730
I have to go to the hospital tomorrow, so
I'm going to bed early.

1062
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:41,650
Our new hospital

1063
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:45,320
With the hope that the patients will be healthy and recover quickly

1064
01:02:45,910 --> 01:02:49,410
We are always focusing the capabilities of all medical staff.

1065
01:02:50,450 --> 01:02:52,420
Sorry,
please take the next elevator.

1066
01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:54,330
sorry

1067
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,050
The believer is not burned

1068
01:03:01,970 --> 01:03:03,010
Which department?

1069
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:04,840
Eternal life, eternal spring, new god descends!

1070
01:03:04,930 --> 01:03:08,510
This is Heo Yak-seon, the 7th director of the Saesin Foundation Stage Equipment Facility.

1071
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:09,430
It's an honor

1072
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,480
How long ago did you get startled by an explosion?

1073
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:12,390
Are you hurt?

1074
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:13,440
it's okay

1075
01:03:13,730 --> 01:03:14,560
thank you

1076
01:03:14,650 --> 01:03:16,730
I should be grateful for your faith.

1077
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:21,110
Yes, I will believe harder

1078
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:26,490
Eternal life, eternal spring, new god descending

1079
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:49,180
You got a tattoo?

1080
01:03:49,510 --> 01:03:50,720
This is not a tattoo

1081
01:03:50,810 --> 01:03:52,850
I was lucky enough to receive an organ transplant last time.

1082
01:03:52,930 --> 01:03:54,020
What did you get transplanted?

1083
01:03:55,270 --> 01:03:56,520
I got the liver

1084
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:57,980
Has anything changed since you got the transplant?

1085
01:03:58,650 --> 01:04:01,190
Oh, I hope the surgery went well and you are getting better.

1086
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:02,440
- I'm not tired...
- No, no

1087
01:04:02,530 --> 01:04:03,940
Other than that, what's unique about it?

1088
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:07,110
uh

1089
01:04:07,990 --> 01:04:09,830
I don't know for sure

1090
01:04:11,370 --> 01:04:13,250
I hear people say I look younger

1091
01:04:25,090 --> 01:04:27,050
There's nothing like getting younger

1092
01:04:27,550 --> 01:04:28,470
What was your name?

1093
01:04:29,430 --> 01:04:31,390
It's a weak line

1094
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:33,680
Heoyakseon, 7th division

1095
01:04:34,730 --> 01:04:36,060
Take good care of yourself

1096
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:38,100
See you again

1097
01:04:42,110 --> 01:04:44,940
I wonder who
is preparing for the nursing exam?

1098
01:04:45,030 --> 01:04:46,070
Oh, no

1099
01:04:46,150 --> 01:04:48,030
I'm just doing this for fun

1100
01:04:48,110 --> 01:04:49,950
Hey, that's cool

1101
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:53,910
Oh, sir,
I'm sorry about this. What should I do?

1102
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:55,700
Why do you suddenly want to meet in a place like this?

1103
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:57,250
Should I turn the car around?

1104
01:04:57,330 --> 01:04:58,830
Oh, I'm sorry

1105
01:04:58,920 --> 01:04:59,830
see

1106
01:05:01,170 --> 01:05:02,960
Where is Saesin Pharmaceutical's headquarters?

1107
01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:04,630
Oh, Saesin Pharmaceutical

1108
01:05:04,710 --> 01:05:06,880
I work right next door

1109
01:05:06,970 --> 01:05:08,760
I know the way well

1110
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:10,550
Oh, that's good.

1111
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:13,100
Then
please take care of yourself safely.

1112
01:05:13,180 --> 01:05:14,430
Yes, yes

1113
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:15,930
I had gum

1114
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:17,020
Is it gum?

1115
01:05:18,810 --> 01:05:20,520
Why? Not starting?

1116
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:22,360
Oh, yes

1117
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:24,110
Me, that's it

1118
01:05:24,190 --> 01:05:26,530
A tissue biopsy should be the priority

1119
01:05:26,610 --> 01:05:28,280
Even if it exceeds the lethal dose

1120
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:29,570
Anesthesia doesn't work

1121
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:31,570
Little bird god?

1122
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:33,950
Oh, thank goodness

1123
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:36,410
I am Heo Yak-seon, the 7th director of the Saesin Foundation.

1124
01:05:36,910 --> 01:05:38,250
Oh, little bird god

1125
01:05:38,330 --> 01:05:40,250
But where am I?
I have to go home.

1126
01:05:40,330 --> 01:05:41,670
Oh, right, oh

1127
01:05:42,170 --> 01:05:44,000
Nursing Assistant Core Courses in One Volume

1128
01:05:44,090 --> 01:05:46,010
I've already summarized everything there .

1129
01:05:46,590 --> 01:05:48,550
- Do you have that?
- What kind of anesthesia is it?

1130
01:05:48,630 --> 01:05:49,590
Just like that

1131
01:05:51,930 --> 01:05:53,050
Little New God

1132
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:54,850
Little New God

1133
01:05:54,930 --> 01:05:57,100
Little bird god!

1134
01:05:57,180 --> 01:05:58,180
That mouth

1135
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:00,560
Little New God

1136
01:06:02,230 --> 01:06:04,900
If anesthesia doesn't work,
you have to knock them out.

1137
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:06,900
What are you doing or not doing?

1138
01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:07,820
yes?

1139
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:08,900
Who are you waiting for?

1140
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:10,570
Have you been waiting for me?

1141
01:06:12,570 --> 01:06:15,280
Eternal life, eternal spring, new god descending

1142
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:20,790
Did you plan something fun?

1143
01:06:24,590 --> 01:06:26,880
Long time no see, Heoyakseon 7th Division Leader

1144
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:28,210
It's okay, it's okay

1145
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:29,380
Who said this?

1146
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:32,380
Director Song

1147
01:06:32,470 --> 01:06:33,470
Yes, new father

1148
01:06:33,550 --> 01:06:35,260
If you leave a little bit of liver

1149
01:06:35,350 --> 01:06:37,010
It grows back, right?

1150
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:38,310
Yes, that's right.

1151
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:42,230
Eternal life, eternal spring, new god descending

1152
01:06:43,310 --> 01:06:44,940
Become a true sacrifice

1153
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:46,820
Live forever in me

1154
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,300
Mr. Kim, tie it up

1155
01:07:29,610 --> 01:07:30,570
sorry

1156
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:32,740
It doesn't work with the same species?

1157
01:07:35,030 --> 01:07:36,030
Let's go to surgery

1158
01:07:57,090 --> 01:07:58,100
Director Cho

1159
01:07:58,180 --> 01:07:59,140
Yes, sir

1160
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:02,850
Let's play

1161
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:05,770
Catch them all

1162
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:07,810
Oh, thank you

1163
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:09,190
Oh, slowly

1164
01:08:09,270 --> 01:08:10,230
Slowly

1165
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:12,150
oh my

1166
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:26,290
Madam, here you go

1167
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:27,920
Yes, I'm going

1168
01:08:30,170 --> 01:08:32,300
Oh my, thank you

1169
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:47,560
Is there anything delicious?

1170
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:49,900
Yes, there is, there is, there is

1171
01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:52,070
Why not, probiotics?

1172
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:06,080
Daughter, daughter, daughter, daughter, daughter

1173
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:07,830
Why? Why? Why? Why?
What's going on? Huh?

1174
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:09,250
Is my daughter okay? Are you okay...

1175
01:09:10,170 --> 01:09:11,750
Hey, hey, put this on

1176
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:14,670
Hey, I have one kid

1177
01:09:15,170 --> 01:09:16,420
Who are you?

1178
01:09:16,510 --> 01:09:18,050
- Let's go.
- Where?

1179
01:09:18,130 --> 01:09:19,130
I'll be there soon

1180
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:22,470
Daughter, you're at the end there, huh?

1181
01:09:22,550 --> 01:09:23,680
To the end there

1182
01:09:38,950 --> 01:09:40,030
Oh, my back

1183
01:09:40,820 --> 01:09:43,080
Waist, waist, waist
I didn't do my warm-up exercises.

1184
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:43,990
Ouch, my back

1185
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:47,120
Time, time, time, time

1186
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:48,120
time!

1187
01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:51,170
Oh, really

1188
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:01,720
Go back again

1189
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:29,750
- Fighting!
- Let's go together, okay?

1190
01:10:29,830 --> 01:10:30,790
go

1191
01:10:31,170 --> 01:10:32,000
Hey C

1192
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:45,220
Hang in there, hang in there, hang in there

1193
01:11:05,620 --> 01:11:07,450
Hey, isn't it 540 degrees?

1194
01:11:13,870 --> 01:11:14,750
Oh, Mom

1195
01:11:14,830 --> 01:11:16,590
I ate all the kimchi.
I'll give you the empty container now.

1196
01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:22,970
I told you to shout 'Dad'
if something happens.

1197
01:11:23,050 --> 01:11:24,050
Bring me some water

1198
01:11:24,130 --> 01:11:24,970
- Water?
- With that bag.

1199
01:11:25,050 --> 01:11:25,890
Water, uh

1200
01:11:58,540 --> 01:12:00,170
As I said before

1201
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:02,380
You got the wrong one, sir.

1202
01:12:02,710 --> 01:12:04,260
If you just send it out

1203
01:12:13,270 --> 01:12:14,310
Let's put this down

1204
01:12:14,390 --> 01:12:16,980
What, Dad, are you giving me one seat?

1205
01:12:17,060 --> 01:12:19,650
No need for a seat, just keep it simple

1206
01:12:20,570 --> 01:12:22,150
How many Nobel Prizes are needed?

1207
01:12:25,570 --> 01:12:26,610
you

1208
01:12:26,860 --> 01:12:28,280
I stood in the wrong line.

1209
01:12:29,950 --> 01:12:31,370
Even if an old person becomes young, it's useless

1210
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:34,290
Who do you think will live longer?

1211
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:36,960
Let's check it out

1212
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:48,800
Who are you?

1213
01:12:49,390 --> 01:12:50,550
Where are you now come

1214
01:12:59,310 --> 01:13:00,940
Who are you, you little shit?

1215
01:13:01,150 --> 01:13:02,520
Did you have a drink during the day?

1216
01:13:02,610 --> 01:13:03,940
Why don't you recognize your father?

1217
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:07,490
When my father was young

1218
01:13:07,570 --> 01:13:09,240
Did you say he was handsome or not?

1219
01:13:13,660 --> 01:13:14,580
Aigoo

1220
01:15:15,910 --> 01:15:16,780
no

1221
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:03,750
Nice to meet you, just follow me

1222
01:16:04,210 --> 01:16:05,170
Come up slowly

1223
01:16:05,250 --> 01:16:06,080
Yes, yes

1224
01:16:06,170 --> 01:16:07,460
Just come this way

1225
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:08,790
Okay, Pastor

1226
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:11,760
Be careful on the stairs.
We'll go up little by little.

1227
01:16:12,550 --> 01:16:14,260
- You can go this way too.
- Yes, welcome.

1228
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:17,640
Newcomers, come this way.
This way.

1229
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:19,390
- Welcome
- Come this way

1230
01:16:29,650 --> 01:16:31,070
Where are you?

1231
01:16:31,150 --> 01:16:32,150
My clones?

1232
01:16:32,780 --> 01:16:33,820
I don't know

1233
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:36,280
I need the rest to become a god

1234
01:16:36,570 --> 01:16:37,700
Aren't you scared?

1235
01:16:38,570 --> 01:16:39,780
If there really is a god

1236
01:16:39,870 --> 01:16:41,490
What kind of punishment are you trying to receive?

1237
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:45,910
Are you going to church these days?

1238
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:47,250
dad

1239
01:16:47,330 --> 01:16:50,540
You're not trying to become a god because you won't be forgiven

1240
01:17:00,350 --> 01:17:01,680
Oh, you're smart

1241
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:03,010
It's hidden right below

1242
01:17:05,350 --> 01:17:07,100
Director Cho, it's been a while.

1243
01:17:07,190 --> 01:17:08,230
Who are you?

1244
01:17:08,310 --> 01:17:09,860
Why are you doing this, even though you knew?

1245
01:17:09,940 --> 01:17:11,020
I don't know?

1246
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:16,400
Take it easy,
the boss wants you to be treated with respect

1247
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:21,280
Hey C

1248
01:17:58,820 --> 01:17:59,910
Oh, rat!

1249
01:18:00,990 --> 01:18:02,320
Rat, rat

1250
01:18:02,410 --> 01:18:03,370
I see

1251
01:18:32,690 --> 01:18:33,900
what?

1252
01:18:33,980 --> 01:18:34,980
Did you open it?

1253
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:37,230
You came with me, brother.

1254
01:18:38,230 --> 01:18:39,320
Don't let this go!

1255
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:40,360
Let go!

1256
01:18:41,610 --> 01:18:43,410
Hey, Park Ji-Sung! Park Ji-Sung!

1257
01:18:44,950 --> 01:18:46,240
That dog, that

1258
01:18:46,330 --> 01:18:47,790
Oh, ma'am, ma'am

1259
01:18:48,540 --> 01:18:50,120
Auntie, Auntie, Auntie

1260
01:18:51,250 --> 01:18:52,580
Hey, Mr.

1261
01:19:22,570 --> 01:19:23,570
Eyes are absolutely not allowed

1262
01:19:23,660 --> 01:19:24,950
Absolutely not the eyes!

1263
01:19:25,030 --> 01:19:26,410
Eyes are really bad

1264
01:19:28,370 --> 01:19:31,000
Eyes are absolutely not allowed
. Rather, take off the pepper.

1265
01:19:31,710 --> 01:19:33,370
This guy is really a joke

1266
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:38,250
Corneal This will be done soon, right?

1267
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:39,670
- Yes
- No, I can't see

1268
01:19:39,750 --> 01:19:41,090
No eyes!

1269
01:19:41,170 --> 01:19:42,300
No eyes

1270
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:44,630
Why don't the rest of you do the same?

1271
01:19:45,590 --> 01:19:47,470
- I'm still one person short
- I'm really rich

1272
01:19:47,550 --> 01:19:49,970
- I can give you a lot of money
- It's better to take your time and do it safely.

1273
01:19:50,060 --> 01:19:51,560
- They'll give you a lot of money!
- That sounds good.

1274
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:54,020
How much can I do?

1275
01:19:54,810 --> 01:19:56,060
Is this anesthetized?

1276
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:59,400
Heyak-seon
is noisy even when he's sleeping

1277
01:20:00,110 --> 01:20:00,980
but

1278
01:20:02,150 --> 01:20:03,570
How much did it hurt?

1279
01:20:18,630 --> 01:20:19,670
- No.
- What?

1280
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:21,300
- No matter what, it won't work
- I have to go

1281
01:20:21,380 --> 01:20:23,510
I said no, I said no,
I said absolutely not this time, you!

1282
01:20:25,970 --> 01:20:27,970
Did you think your father wouldn't know that you were doing that without his knowledge ?

1283
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:31,850
Since when did you know?

1284
01:20:31,930 --> 01:20:32,970
Parents

1285
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:35,350
Just smelling the farts of a little kid

1286
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:37,150
Parents are the ones who know what their child is worried about.

1287
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:39,270
You've been in the hospital for three years

1288
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:40,770
So I can't meet my friends

1289
01:20:42,190 --> 01:20:44,360
Since I got better, I made some friends.

1290
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:47,070
Those friends of all people

1291
01:20:49,910 --> 01:20:51,280
I got caught by the bullies

1292
01:20:54,620 --> 01:20:56,580
Even if I buy new shoes and wear them every day

1293
01:20:56,660 --> 01:20:59,170
Every day
, I come in as trash

1294
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:01,960
Oh my, my weak daughter

1295
01:21:02,050 --> 01:21:04,050
Our daughter is also weak

1296
01:21:04,130 --> 01:21:06,880
I wondered why I wanted to learn Taekwondo.

1297
01:21:07,550 --> 01:21:08,720
Because I don't want to be right

1298
01:21:09,050 --> 01:21:10,300
Because I don't want to be right

1299
01:21:10,390 --> 01:21:12,310
He said he took care of his own body because the bullies were harassing him.

1300
01:21:12,390 --> 01:21:15,730
- Father
- That's what I'm saying, then

1301
01:21:16,230 --> 01:21:18,100
- Actually
- What if I get hurt again?

1302
01:21:18,190 --> 01:21:19,940
My friends
are being held by bullies right now.

1303
01:21:20,020 --> 01:21:22,820
My heart is pounding with excitement

1304
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:24,780
We are like family

1305
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:26,690
I have to go save him

1306
01:21:26,780 --> 01:21:29,360
No, no

1307
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:34,490
Hide right behind your father

1308
01:21:34,580 --> 01:21:35,540
These little bastards

1309
01:21:35,620 --> 01:21:37,410
Did you see them last time? The guys in black suits?

1310
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:39,420
Numbers are just age

1311
01:21:40,170 --> 01:21:41,040
Should I play another song?

1312
01:21:41,130 --> 01:21:43,590
My father still
gets goosebumps when he hears this song

1313
01:21:43,670 --> 01:21:45,170
Even then, I just listened to this song and went out

1314
01:21:45,260 --> 01:21:47,170
We didn't win, it was Barcelona

1315
01:21:47,260 --> 01:21:48,630
What is your father's nickname?

1316
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:50,430
- Taekwon V
- Taekwon V!

1317
01:21:50,510 --> 01:21:53,300
A one -hit,
fatal roundhouse kick full of justice

1318
01:21:57,520 --> 01:21:58,480
huh?

1319
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:04,440
why?

1320
01:22:05,230 --> 01:22:07,190
Wake up, not 'why'

1321
01:22:07,650 --> 01:22:09,030
Why, where are you, ma'am?

1322
01:22:10,660 --> 01:22:12,030
I think we've been kidnapped

1323
01:22:13,950 --> 01:22:14,950
Let's go out first

1324
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:22,750
Where is the bathroom?

1325
01:22:22,830 --> 01:22:24,590
No, no,
not there, no

1326
01:22:30,010 --> 01:22:31,130
Are you okay?

1327
01:22:31,550 --> 01:22:33,430
Hey, this is fun, it's amazing

1328
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:36,560
Have you never seen WiFi with your own eyes?

1329
01:22:39,180 --> 01:22:40,730
Is it because there's only one side?

1330
01:22:41,270 --> 01:22:42,900
The focus goes back and forth a bit.

1331
01:22:42,980 --> 01:22:43,860
sorry

1332
01:22:43,940 --> 01:22:45,320
I woke up suddenly

1333
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:46,610
Because of the wind rushing in

1334
01:22:47,030 --> 01:22:49,150
That guy
left a cornea in his eye

1335
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:50,530
It's a little awkward

1336
01:22:50,610 --> 01:22:52,280
He won't see all this stuff either

1337
01:22:52,660 --> 01:22:53,620
I also do this

1338
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:57,040
Because the damage was severe during extraction

1339
01:22:57,790 --> 01:23:00,000
Recovery is impossible with modern medicine

1340
01:23:13,970 --> 01:23:14,840
who is this?

1341
01:23:14,930 --> 01:23:15,800
it's me

1342
01:23:16,430 --> 01:23:17,640
Battery Man

1343
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:19,060
Sir, please fix me

1344
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:20,600
Sir, you can fix people.

1345
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:23,270
The battery is dead

1346
01:23:23,350 --> 01:23:25,440
If you drink water, you will recover.

1347
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:26,650
Drink some water and fix me

1348
01:23:26,730 --> 01:23:28,820
I brought you water last time too.

1349
01:23:29,980 --> 01:23:33,400
No, I'm just too scared

1350
01:23:35,110 --> 01:23:37,490
No, shit, how can I live

1351
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:40,620
You can be blind twice

1352
01:23:53,220 --> 01:23:54,970
Eternal life, eternal spring, new god descending

1353
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:58,470
To all the saints who have come here

1354
01:23:58,550 --> 01:24:00,520
Welcome to the new believers

1355
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:02,310
Now according to his word

1356
01:24:02,390 --> 01:24:03,850
As per his promise

1357
01:24:03,940 --> 01:24:06,310
Come back with a new body that will never die

1358
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:08,440
Save us from the fires of hell

1359
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:11,150
He came down in person to punish the unbelievers.

1360
01:24:11,230 --> 01:24:12,490
King of kings, God of gods

1361
01:24:12,570 --> 01:24:14,450
Let us welcome our new father, Seo Young-chun

1362
01:24:14,530 --> 01:24:16,610
- Overhead
- Let's all shout together

1363
01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:18,410
- New Father
- Father

1364
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:35,130
What is it? What is it?

1365
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:39,140
- Who are you?
- I don't know.

1366
01:24:55,150 --> 01:24:56,950
Eternal life, eternal spring, new god descending

1367
01:24:57,030 --> 01:24:59,070
Immortal transcendent flesh of the eternal moon

1368
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:01,370
On the day I promised

1369
01:25:01,450 --> 01:25:04,580
I said I would return to you as a young man.

1370
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:07,040
Those who believe in me and serve me

1371
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:09,250
Be my people

1372
01:25:39,660 --> 01:25:42,330
Eternal life, eternal spring, new god descending

1373
01:25:42,410 --> 01:25:44,330
The unstoppable giant of rock

1374
01:25:45,370 --> 01:25:47,410
On the day I promised

1375
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:49,960
I will show my strength by breaking rocks.

1376
01:25:50,210 --> 01:25:51,960
Those who believe in me and serve me

1377
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:54,800
Be my people!

1378
01:26:14,940 --> 01:26:16,030
what's this

1379
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:21,450
What is this, wait a minute

1380
01:27:01,860 --> 01:27:03,030
Thank you!

1381
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:04,370
Thank you!

1382
01:27:04,990 --> 01:27:06,030
New father!

1383
01:27:38,940 --> 01:27:40,190
That's ridiculous

1384
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:45,240
father

1385
01:27:45,450 --> 01:27:47,780
Eternal life, eternal spring, new god descending

1386
01:27:48,990 --> 01:27:50,870
All diseases are cured and the lion is revived

1387
01:27:51,410 --> 01:27:52,580
Can walk

1388
01:27:52,660 --> 01:27:53,960
Heal the sick

1389
01:27:55,750 --> 01:27:57,000
I will raise the dead

1390
01:27:58,210 --> 01:27:59,710
Can walk

1391
01:28:04,130 --> 01:28:05,010
thank you

1392
01:28:05,090 --> 01:28:06,760
Thank you, sir

1393
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:07,850
father

1394
01:28:09,060 --> 01:28:10,100
He who believes in me!

1395
01:28:12,770 --> 01:28:14,270
Be my people

1396
01:28:19,860 --> 01:28:21,360
I believe it!

1397
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:30,330
New arrival!

1398
01:28:41,210 --> 01:28:42,760
Oh, why are there so many entrances?

1399
01:28:44,010 --> 01:28:44,970
Is a celebrity here?

1400
01:29:03,860 --> 01:29:05,240
Oh my, this is surprising!

1401
01:29:08,950 --> 01:29:10,030
It's a surprise

1402
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:12,660
Oh, I told you not to run

1403
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:16,330
wow

1404
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:25,340
Eternal life, eternal spring, new god descending

1405
01:29:25,550 --> 01:29:27,680
I will return as a complete god.

1406
01:29:28,550 --> 01:29:30,600
Praise with all your might!

1407
01:29:55,370 --> 01:29:56,450
Are you finished?

1408
01:29:56,830 --> 01:29:57,790
Who are you, oppa?

1409
01:29:57,870 --> 01:29:59,040
You look pretty

1410
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:01,830
Mr. Park Jong-min

1411
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:04,800
Oh my, the hero of Barcelona

1412
01:30:05,380 --> 01:30:07,720
I also fought a lot when I was young.

1413
01:30:08,420 --> 01:30:09,340
Nice to meet you

1414
01:30:17,020 --> 01:30:18,890
Ow, woo, woo

1415
01:30:19,980 --> 01:30:21,600
Oh, sir

1416
01:30:41,420 --> 01:30:42,380
You were sick

1417
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:46,380
How did you raise your child at home
?

1418
01:30:46,460 --> 01:30:47,630
Are you kicking an adult?

1419
01:30:47,710 --> 01:30:48,590
Sorry...

1420
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:52,890
But are you doing that to me now?

1421
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:56,140
Oh, you're a bully, huh?

1422
01:30:57,060 --> 01:30:59,520
Where do adults keep calling each other 'you, you'?

1423
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:01,810
You little bastard,
don't you have a dad at home?

1424
01:31:01,890 --> 01:31:03,310
Not at home, of course

1425
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:05,770
My father was born in 1905.

1426
01:31:05,860 --> 01:31:07,400
Did my brother take my friends?

1427
01:31:09,570 --> 01:31:11,740
Actually, my daughter did that

1428
01:31:11,820 --> 01:31:13,860
- Daughter?
- She's been converting recently.

1429
01:31:13,950 --> 01:31:14,950
Anyway, it's kind of like that

1430
01:31:15,990 --> 01:31:16,910
now

1431
01:31:17,450 --> 01:31:20,120
Now that we've finished introducing our families,
let's get to the main point.

1432
01:31:22,040 --> 01:31:23,000
Wanseoya

1433
01:31:24,130 --> 01:31:25,460
Let me use your heart

1434
01:31:25,540 --> 01:31:27,090
Is this kid crazy, Mr. Lee?

1435
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:30,920
It's me!

1436
01:31:44,060 --> 01:31:46,270
Are you okay with being me?

1437
01:31:46,360 --> 01:31:48,400
I was going to pick you up anyway

1438
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:50,360
Welcome, but how did you get out?

1439
01:31:50,440 --> 01:31:52,450
That must be your father, right?

1440
01:31:52,530 --> 01:31:53,360
- Hello
- Oh, yes, Taekwondo

1441
01:31:53,450 --> 01:31:55,990
Yeah, it's our last goodbye,
so I should at least say hello.

1442
01:31:56,070 --> 01:31:59,620
My name is Fresh Girl

1443
01:31:59,700 --> 01:32:01,080
This is Tank Boy

1444
01:32:01,160 --> 01:32:02,410
- Stop it.
- Hey!

1445
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:03,750
- How good is it?
- That's right.

1446
01:32:03,830 --> 01:32:06,380
Are you feeling secure with such a wonderful daughter ?

1447
01:32:06,460 --> 01:32:07,290
Oh no

1448
01:32:07,380 --> 01:32:10,500
I worry a lot because he is weak and has no railroad.

1449
01:32:10,590 --> 01:32:12,920
How does Tank Girl
have children?

1450
01:32:13,010 --> 01:32:14,380
- Fresh girl
- Tank, yes

1451
01:32:14,470 --> 01:32:15,380
Ms. Kim Seon-nyeo

1452
01:32:17,050 --> 01:32:18,890
- Let me say something.
- Who are you?

1453
01:32:18,970 --> 01:32:21,930
I
believe in the new life of the eternal spring and the new dawn of life...

1454
01:32:22,020 --> 01:32:22,850
mister!

1455
01:32:23,430 --> 01:32:24,520
That guy seems like a villain

1456
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:25,560
I have a tattoo

1457
01:32:27,060 --> 01:32:29,110
But why is that person an older brother
and I an older man?

1458
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:30,570
You're handsome

1459
01:32:32,900 --> 01:32:34,990
Oh, sir, a little bit

1460
01:32:35,070 --> 01:32:36,450
A style that seems like it needs to be taken care of?

1461
01:32:38,530 --> 01:32:41,330
When an adult is talking
, do you keep interrupting them out of manners?

1462
01:32:41,410 --> 01:32:42,660
Huh? This?

1463
01:32:43,540 --> 01:32:45,750
Where are Mr. Kidong and Mr. Heoyakseon?

1464
01:32:48,540 --> 01:32:49,710
I ate it

1465
01:32:50,630 --> 01:32:51,670
This little bastard

1466
01:32:51,750 --> 01:32:52,920
Ma'am, just a moment

1467
01:32:53,630 --> 01:32:56,010
Hey, hey, hey

1468
01:33:07,230 --> 01:33:08,150
You're not dead, are you?

1469
01:34:22,510 --> 01:34:23,430
What should I do, ah, what should I do?

1470
01:34:23,510 --> 01:34:25,470
- Water! Hey, let go, let go, let go
- What should I do?

1471
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:27,810
Hey, hurry up!
Hey, here it comes, here it comes

1472
01:34:28,810 --> 01:34:29,730
Park Ji-sung

1473
01:34:30,390 --> 01:34:31,400
Lung transplant

1474
01:34:31,480 --> 01:34:32,610
Oh my, what's your job?

1475
01:34:32,690 --> 01:34:35,440
The moon is full of autumn

1476
01:34:42,620 --> 01:34:43,950
He's not dead, is he?

1477
01:34:44,700 --> 01:34:46,120
But what did you just say?

1478
01:34:47,700 --> 01:34:50,160
It's good manners to reveal your initial state before using your ultimate skill.

1479
01:34:52,250 --> 01:34:54,750
Hey, this bed is so dirty I can't live

1480
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:58,260
What did you say 'Wolha' earlier, you? Huh?

1481
01:35:01,340 --> 01:35:02,300
What is Wolha?

1482
01:35:12,850 --> 01:35:14,360
- What is it?
- Mom, Mom

1483
01:35:14,440 --> 01:35:15,860
What is it, what is it

1484
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:20,110
please

1485
01:35:21,700 --> 01:35:22,860
Cordyceps sinensis

1486
01:35:22,950 --> 01:35:23,780
candle!

1487
01:35:31,830 --> 01:35:32,710
see

1488
01:35:33,170 --> 01:35:35,790
Our Kim Seon-nyeo is here

1489
01:35:54,310 --> 01:35:56,440
Oh, man, there was this method.

1490
01:35:57,230 --> 01:35:58,770
If only our Kim Seon-nyeo was on my side

1491
01:35:58,860 --> 01:36:01,490
You didn't have to go through all this trouble

1492
01:36:01,570 --> 01:36:02,490
Help me just once

1493
01:36:03,110 --> 01:36:05,450
It's not like they're transferring their abilities to me.

1494
01:36:05,530 --> 01:36:07,120
Don't come, go away, go away

1495
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:08,490
When you move and lose your ability

1496
01:36:08,580 --> 01:36:10,240
I'll suck it all in

1497
01:36:10,830 --> 01:36:12,620
It's so clean, you don't even see any blood

1498
01:36:12,710 --> 01:36:14,000
No, just

1499
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:15,620
Should I buy a yogurt company?

1500
01:36:25,930 --> 01:36:27,850
Give me my eyes!

1501
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:31,270
Ah, Director Song, this guy

1502
01:36:31,350 --> 01:36:32,350
My cornea feels itchy...

1503
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:02,210
Eternal life, eternal spring, new god descending

1504
01:37:02,300 --> 01:37:04,470
Become a true treasure

1505
01:37:04,550 --> 01:37:06,220
Live forever in me

1506
01:37:06,300 --> 01:37:07,800
Why are you doing this?

1507
01:37:08,930 --> 01:37:10,800
I can't achieve it in my life

1508
01:37:10,890 --> 01:37:13,060
I had two things on my mind

1509
01:37:13,810 --> 01:37:15,140
One is youth

1510
01:37:17,810 --> 01:37:20,730
You have to ask, 'What is one?'
to continue the conversation.

1511
01:37:22,730 --> 01:37:23,570
One is Young...

1512
01:37:23,650 --> 01:37:25,570
I'm sure you'll be happy, I guess

1513
01:37:26,150 --> 01:37:27,990
We need a visible god

1514
01:37:28,570 --> 01:37:30,070
I will become a god and save mankind.

1515
01:37:30,160 --> 01:37:32,240
Isn't that what you're trying to say
, right now? Huh?

1516
01:37:32,330 --> 01:37:34,580
I wonder where you went to some kind of cult school.

1517
01:37:34,660 --> 01:37:37,370
If you write lines like that these days,
your ratings will be terrorized.

1518
01:37:37,460 --> 01:37:39,790
You have a knack for getting on people's nerves.

1519
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:42,000
- He's a famous troll in this neighborhood.
- This kid.

1520
01:37:42,090 --> 01:37:43,170
New Father

1521
01:37:43,460 --> 01:37:45,010
Oh, yeah, Heoyakseon

1522
01:37:46,340 --> 01:37:47,800
Was it all fake?

1523
01:37:48,590 --> 01:37:50,840
Was everything you showed me
fake?

1524
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:53,220
I abandoned my brothers and family

1525
01:37:53,310 --> 01:37:55,850
My property that I gave away while driving for someone all night

1526
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:58,060
My life that I gave

1527
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:02,020
Did you all get fooled and do useless things?

1528
01:38:02,440 --> 01:38:03,270
huh

1529
01:38:04,110 --> 01:38:06,280
So if you really want to see God

1530
01:38:06,360 --> 01:38:08,820
Offer those wretched bodies to me

1531
01:38:11,490 --> 01:38:14,160
Give me my eyes, this chewy

1532
01:38:18,290 --> 01:38:19,670
Hey, go to the temple, go to the temple

1533
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:20,960
Hey, why are you throwing that away?

1534
01:38:22,630 --> 01:38:23,460
Hey, here we go

1535
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:40,350
wow!

1536
01:38:40,980 --> 01:38:42,270
It's up, it's up

1537
01:39:27,650 --> 01:39:29,070
Should I dye this?

1538
01:39:29,150 --> 01:39:29,990
Don't do it

1539
01:39:54,590 --> 01:39:57,720
I confess that I will dedicate everything to the new father.

1540
01:39:57,800 --> 01:39:59,140
My body, parents, and property

1541
01:39:59,220 --> 01:40:01,140
I'll give it my all!

1542
01:40:01,230 --> 01:40:03,350
You have to sacrifice everything to be
saved...

1543
01:40:17,120 --> 01:40:18,280
Oh, what should I do?

1544
01:40:20,290 --> 01:40:21,120
what

1545
01:40:52,360 --> 01:40:53,820
New Father, New Father

1546
01:40:53,900 --> 01:40:55,900
New father!

1547
01:40:56,280 --> 01:40:58,660
I will give my life for my new father

1548
01:40:58,740 --> 01:40:59,950
Oh, this won't do

1549
01:41:00,030 --> 01:41:01,080
What is it?

1550
01:41:01,160 --> 01:41:02,160
If this turns on here

1551
01:41:02,240 --> 01:41:04,080
If the fuel tank catches fire, we all die.

1552
01:41:27,850 --> 01:41:29,650
Wait a minute, wait a minute

1553
01:41:29,730 --> 01:41:30,940
Don't do it, don't push it

1554
01:41:31,020 --> 01:41:31,940
Let me breathe!

1555
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:35,360
Teddy bear

1556
01:41:42,330 --> 01:41:44,490
Are you going to kill all the people up there
?

1557
01:41:45,370 --> 01:41:47,660
Are you going to kill all the people who believed in you and followed you
?

1558
01:41:47,750 --> 01:41:49,420
Believer, just make a new one

1559
01:41:50,330 --> 01:41:52,340
I have a concept of the god of death

1560
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:03,100
This is what you guys are like

1561
01:42:25,490 --> 01:42:27,830
Eternal life, eternal spring, new god descending

1562
01:42:27,910 --> 01:42:31,330
Become a part of me and enjoy eternal life.

1563
01:42:33,380 --> 01:42:35,500
Miss Kim Seon-nyeo, hand it over quickly

1564
01:42:39,010 --> 01:42:40,630
Otherwise you'll all die

1565
01:42:42,680 --> 01:42:43,600
Come to your senses

1566
01:42:44,680 --> 01:42:45,930
Hey, open your eyes.

1567
01:42:46,010 --> 01:42:47,100
Come to your senses

1568
01:42:47,680 --> 01:42:49,480
Hey, Park Wan-seo! Hey!

1569
01:42:58,030 --> 01:43:00,530
Get behind me, you son of a bitch!

1570
01:43:07,870 --> 01:43:08,700
no

1571
01:43:57,130 --> 01:43:58,710
no

1572
01:44:34,710 --> 01:44:36,370
Baby, why are you coming towards me?

1573
01:44:36,460 --> 01:44:37,380
Where are you coming from

1574
01:45:41,190 --> 01:45:42,020
It's me!

1575
01:45:42,110 --> 01:45:43,110
Hey, you

1576
01:45:47,110 --> 01:45:48,410
Now we have seen

1577
01:45:48,490 --> 01:45:50,200
You're back with a new body

1578
01:45:50,280 --> 01:45:51,870
I confess right now

1579
01:45:56,450 --> 01:45:57,660
Sir, how do I turn that off?

1580
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:00,040
I don't know

1581
01:46:00,710 --> 01:46:01,960
What if I don't know?

1582
01:46:02,920 --> 01:46:05,170
That
needs to be dispersed by something like a lightning rod.

1583
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:07,050
Because I'm not a technician

1584
01:46:08,260 --> 01:46:09,130
sorry

1585
01:46:10,720 --> 01:46:11,970
Try pushing it to me

1586
01:46:14,350 --> 01:46:15,390
What should I do?

1587
01:46:16,390 --> 01:46:17,680
I don't know either

1588
01:46:17,770 --> 01:46:19,020
I have to try something

1589
01:46:38,120 --> 01:46:39,080
hey

1590
01:46:39,870 --> 01:46:41,170
If you succeed, you will be recognized as the same age

1591
01:46:41,250 --> 01:46:42,960
If you succeed, you're my brother

1592
01:47:33,800 --> 01:47:34,720
What is this?

1593
01:47:37,010 --> 01:47:37,850
what

1594
01:48:28,360 --> 01:48:29,820
Hey, if you're done, bring me the tattoo now.

1595
01:48:30,610 --> 01:48:31,690
Hey, hyung, dude

1596
01:48:33,030 --> 01:48:33,860
oh my

1597
01:48:35,410 --> 01:48:37,490
Hey, stop it and catch it

1598
01:48:37,570 --> 01:48:38,580
Just a moment

1599
01:48:38,660 --> 01:48:39,490
Just give it to me

1600
01:48:39,580 --> 01:48:40,990
The soup is really something

1601
01:48:44,040 --> 01:48:45,540
- Huh?
- Got it.

1602
01:49:05,310 --> 01:49:07,230
Why do you guys want to win?

1603
01:49:07,810 --> 01:49:08,770
If you want me to give it to you, then give it to me

1604
01:49:08,860 --> 01:49:10,610
If you have to die, you should die.
People like you

1605
01:49:10,690 --> 01:49:11,570
stop!

1606
01:49:11,650 --> 01:49:12,610
It's me!

1607
01:49:12,690 --> 01:49:14,190
Hand! Hand!

1608
01:49:14,530 --> 01:49:15,570
It doesn't fall off

1609
01:49:20,950 --> 01:49:22,990
dad!

1610
01:49:30,250 --> 01:49:31,130
Our baby

1611
01:49:31,210 --> 01:49:32,090
Oh, my daughter

1612
01:49:32,210 --> 01:49:34,130
Why is my daughter
so naughty?

1613
01:49:34,210 --> 01:49:35,510
Did you fall?

1614
01:49:35,590 --> 01:49:36,880
Who hit you?

1615
01:49:36,970 --> 01:49:39,340
Oh my, who hit our weak daughter
?

1616
01:49:39,430 --> 01:49:40,600
I'm sorry, Dad.

1617
01:49:40,680 --> 01:49:43,350
Dad
said he was sorry and that he would come home early...

1618
01:49:43,430 --> 01:49:45,480
Dad, Dad, I'm really sorry

1619
01:49:46,060 --> 01:49:48,480
I'm so sorry, my daughter, Dad.

1620
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:49,900
I'm sorry, Dad.

1621
01:49:49,980 --> 01:49:53,190
Oh, I'm sorry Dad couldn't do it.

1622
01:49:54,690 --> 01:49:55,990
Are you okay, my daughter?

1623
01:49:56,860 --> 01:49:58,990
A young, blue-eyed bastard, really

1624
01:49:59,910 --> 01:50:00,870
Ooh!

1625
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:14,050
What is that?

1626
01:50:36,860 --> 01:50:37,940
The weak line

1627
01:50:39,320 --> 01:50:41,570
Would you like to try being a cult leader?

1628
01:50:51,750 --> 01:50:53,380
I will be a nurse.

1629
01:51:38,710 --> 01:51:40,590
Hey, shit

1630
01:51:48,930 --> 01:51:50,640
Oh, hey, I'll get the car out.

1631
01:51:50,730 --> 01:51:51,770
I'll get the car, wait

1632
01:51:55,230 --> 01:51:56,400
Oh, what should I do!

1633
01:51:58,230 --> 01:51:59,070
why?

1634
01:51:59,150 --> 01:52:01,400
What should I do? The yogurt must have gone bad.

1635
01:52:02,700 --> 01:52:04,570
I'm going to deliver at night

1636
01:52:05,200 --> 01:52:07,330
From Vietnamese spring rolls to diet lunch boxes

1637
01:52:07,410 --> 01:52:09,370
I ordered a lot, what should I do?

1638
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,160
Was the parking lot this way, this way?

1639
01:52:14,620 --> 01:52:15,540
Bluesman

1640
01:52:15,920 --> 01:52:17,340
Bluetooth Man

1641
01:52:17,420 --> 01:52:18,540
No, that's right

1642
01:52:19,550 --> 01:52:21,760
We have that too

1643
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:24,340
Would you like to listen to a song while you wait ?

1644
01:52:25,220 --> 01:52:26,220
What should I play?

1645
01:52:26,680 --> 01:52:27,600
No, I'll play it

1646
01:52:27,680 --> 01:52:28,810
Hey, turn that on

1647
01:52:29,220 --> 01:52:30,180
I hate that

1648
01:52:30,970 --> 01:52:31,930
Do you know what it is?

1649
01:52:32,310 --> 01:52:33,230
ah

1650
01:52:33,980 --> 01:52:34,810
Battery Brother

1651
01:52:34,890 --> 01:52:35,810
yes

1652
01:52:35,900 --> 01:52:38,610
Can I have this, this, please?

1653
01:52:38,690 --> 01:52:41,150
No,
I'll fix it after I get to the convenience store and drink some water.

1654
01:52:41,230 --> 01:52:43,780
I left my car keys behind, I left my car keys behind

1655
01:52:44,280 --> 01:52:45,780
Hey, here it is, uh

1656
01:52:45,860 --> 01:52:47,070
Okay, okay, okay

1657
01:52:47,820 --> 01:52:49,490
While we were taking our car out

1658
01:52:49,580 --> 01:52:50,830
Should I name it?

1659
01:52:51,160 --> 01:52:52,660
I built it last time

1660
01:52:52,750 --> 01:52:54,290
No, each of them has a name

1661
01:52:54,370 --> 01:52:56,000
Our group doesn't have a name

1662
01:52:56,080 --> 01:52:58,960
Hey, if you watch foreign movies,
when people with superpowers get together

1663
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:00,630
Let's start with the name

1664
01:53:00,710 --> 01:53:02,130
Sister, just do it

1665
01:53:02,550 --> 01:53:03,840
Then should I do it in English or Korean?

1666
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:05,340
Sister, just do it yourself

1667
01:53:05,430 --> 01:53:07,510
Actually,
I'm pretty good at naming things.

1668
01:53:07,590 --> 01:53:09,140
No, I'll just build it

1669
01:53:09,760 --> 01:53:12,970
Batteryman, you worked hard, so
charge it.

1670
01:53:13,060 --> 01:53:14,230
Oh, then

1671
01:53:15,850 --> 01:53:18,480
There's something about this friendly feeling that I like

1672
01:53:19,150 --> 01:53:20,860
As if greeting...

1673
01:53:20,940 --> 01:53:22,980
Yeah, I just happened to think of a suitable name.

1674
01:53:23,070 --> 01:53:25,030
Oh! There are five of us.

1675
01:53:25,400 --> 01:53:28,240
When five people greet each other,that's in English

1676
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:29,370
I know that

1677
01:53:29,820 --> 01:53:30,830
What is that...

1678
01:53:31,740 --> 01:53:32,580
mister

1679
01:53:32,660 --> 01:53:33,540
Try this

1680
01:53:34,450 --> 01:53:35,290
ah!
