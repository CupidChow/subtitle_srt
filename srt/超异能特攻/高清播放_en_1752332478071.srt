1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This is new.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:07,870
Yes, ETA 20 minutes, donor is in good condition, hello.

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:08,680
Hello.

4
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:28,870
The documents are fine, the donor committed suicide, oh, why would this happen when you are young.

5
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:30,170
Where is the wrong answer in my words?

6
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:37,500
Gone, wrong, wrong, here it comes, hello, the status seems to be taken off now.

7
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,020
What? It's a tattoo.

8
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,520
Arguing is still quarreling.

9
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,450
Where.

10
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:53,170
I saw it. I saw it somewhere too. I think I saw it in a 40,000-year history book somewhere. Murning is someone's love, someone's.

11
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:54,960
Missing donors.

12
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,640
Today the flower of love is abandoned on this land.

13
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:15,440
Ah, it's an iron plate. No, what body is an iron plate? It's made of a few knives. It's a super power or something. It scared me. What's wrong, mouse.

14
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,160
Yes, come out.

15
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,320
I like you, go out.

16
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,660
It really doesn’t hurt, right?

17
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:06,820
in.

18
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,260
I said this several times because it hurt.

19
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:09,750
2 days.

20
00:03:55,751 --> 00:03:57,865
If not, it would be Obyte.

21
00:03:57,865 --> 00:04:04,410
I should have been drooling over this, but the pilot version entered the hearts of others and gained a firm foothold once it arrived here.

22
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,767
This is very embarrassing.

23
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:06,785
As long as it doesn't hurt.

24
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:21,630
Isn’t it?

25
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:21,970
All right.

26
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:25,690
It would be nice if it didn't hurt, but it might not, so.

27
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,720
That's why I was discharged from the hospital.

28
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,220
Mom, if it doesn't hurt.

29
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,030
Of course, Mom.

30
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:34,940
What is this, a tattoo.

31
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:39,870
No, I think it was a side effect of the surgery or just bad friends in the hospital.

32
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:46,740
You are not in a relationship, don't get angry just because of where your girlfriend is. Eat slowly, your heart rate is over 90.

33
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,010
Like this.

34
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:51,600
In fact, I don’t even have enough money to pay for it now.

35
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,350
Why don’t you have money? Just tell me what you want to do or buy.

36
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:56,200
Want to do.

37
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:56,870
I have a thing.

38
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,720
Just tell me, do you want to try Taekwondo again?

39
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,240
You can't just talk about Taekwondo without practicing it. It's absolutely not possible. It's very dangerous.

40
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,050
The doctor said you can run properly.

41
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,030
Ah, what does the doctor know.

42
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,410
If dad didn't know, the heart wouldn't come.

43
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:09,760
If you want to do it when you do it, you can go to that university and do Pilates or something like that.

44
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:24,940
Dad, the thought of your heart stopping during the game makes me feel sad. You even move your clothes and mushrooms when you sleep. Now mom is also going to eat the heart's meal, and your grandpa is also going to learn the words of the cross.

45
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,070
You should do it, come out, my dad.

46
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:32,340
How can there be someone as beautiful as you in the world?

47
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,950
Yes, gods.

48
00:04:48,950 --> 00:05:06,680
So we have made batteries for all kinds of organs. This is the next one. This time it is the pancreas. Anyway, fortunately, it seems that my father is going to pass away this time. Anyway, you have been revived.

49
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,690
before.

50
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:12,780
I'll give you everything, not to mention the price.

51
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,190
You grill the meat.

52
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:34,980
Go out into the world in rhythm.

53
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,400
Father.

54
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:40,770
Can't.

55
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,450
You know what it is, WTF absolutely.

56
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:42,820
Can't.

57
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,120
No, it's not like that.

58
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,430
It’s time for physical education class.

59
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,660
I've seen it happen if my heart rate goes up.

60
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,030
No, it wasn't me who steamed them, but the shoes.

61
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,400
Why are you so casual, really, always?

62
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,040
In this case, this can be thrown away directly.

63
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:10,600
Today is designated driver day at my dad’s place, so I went in first, bought some sturdy shoes in that color, and spent money and food healthily with my friends, and that’s all for today.

64
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,300
Where is that friend.

65
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:19,450
Okay, it's hard work, Jin Pil did fat today, so he is doing the Taekwondo style with fifty reverse kicks, ouch.

66
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:22,940
If not, why is the monthly rent of 100,000 won empty? Let me explain.

67
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:41,400
Don't I want to give it to you? Don't make me do it. If a savage kicks a child like that, does that mean you want to fight or date? Yes, sister. When you are old, the 20540° rotation axis is also shaking. Go to sleep and come out to have a look. This is all for your own good. Put your center of gravity in the right place and determine your goal.

68
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,450
Recently you.

69
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,430
Why ask me.

70
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,060
What's going on.

71
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:56,400
Dad, there’s a growing guy coming to our dojo.

72
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,430
Sorry, caught me.

73
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:06,280
What is the answer? Winning or losing is more important.

74
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:11,630
uh-huh.

75
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,860
Greasy food is not good for the pancreas.

76
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,280
Isn’t it very prosperous?

77
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:28,300
Xiaona, why has dad been sick and suffered so much during this period?

78
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,380
sorry.

79
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:34,920
Father sightseeing is now cordially blessed and father buys a solid flavor.

80
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,360
People are amazing.

81
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,400
Respirator.

82
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:50,750
Even lying in a coma, this ear heard clearly all the things I should not have said when my father was alive, ouch.

83
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:57,880
Didn't you hear it all, oh my god, I mean all the sons of bitches in the world, me.

84
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:10,460
Judging from the car, from the engine to the parts, it has become a sports car.
This video is shared by Weibo: Tacit0924 URL: https://link3.cc/tacit0924

85
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,330
Me too, I'm afraid I won't do it.

86
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:22,060
So, I think it's the donor's special physique.

87
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:26,420
Isn't it, he said he has the donation code superpower.

88
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,800
It’s not okay for children to learn Taekwondo. Why do they always have to wear uniforms? Uniforms.

89
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,440
I wear it because it’s comfortable. I wear it because it’s comfortable. The doctor said my heart is in good condition.

90
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,420
As long as there is, Taekwondo is definitely not a good idea, don't run, be gentle.

91
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,300
Walk lightly.

92
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:37,560
Uncle has been walking around our gym since the beginning of last week, it's Barbary Stock's love, all three of them.

93
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,840
This is a crime.

94
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,320
Selling this?

95
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:50,050
Heart, three long three or four, it seems like a diagnosis needs to be issued, female.

96
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,780
The student grabbed it slightly and took it.

97
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,670
They all spoke in the tone of the female high school students in the second grade.

98
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,540
What’s wrong with you?

99
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,640
Because I grew up in my grandfather's hands when I was learning to speak.

100
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,570
You don't know how capable you are yet, do you?

101
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:03,450
No, I thought it was the growth plates fiery open.

102
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:04,960
Do you think this is a conversion station?

103
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:05,760
Mom knows.

104
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:06,470
Mom is not here.

105
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:08,950
Is dad here?

106
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,750
I have a father.

107
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:15,900
If you knew this fact, you would cry for three days and two nights and faint, but I won’t. I will.

108
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,030
It is absolutely not allowed to be said in our school.

109
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:21,050
You did a great job, it turns out super powers are secretly known, here is the formula.

110
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,740
So the uncle’s secret superpower is ugly.

111
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,760
But who is the donor and how could he have such ability?

112
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,030
Don't you know you can make six chess pieces now?

113
00:12:56,030 --> 00:13:02,990
Heart, sun, cornea, heart, liver, pancreas, duck, horse and four people if you find the remaining transplant recipients.

114
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,250
Would there be any clues?

115
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:24,180
How to find it will be held at Seoyang Park on the 10th. There are hundreds of contestants participating in the annual non-citizen temperature dialogue with family members nationwide, and Hwang Jae-won announced that he officially participated in the competition.

116
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,980
Hi talk to power.

117
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,180
Can't channel, even the cookies stationed there have become.

118
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,140
Aunt is real.

119
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,440
What are you doing there.

120
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,430
Are you like this?

121
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:57,720
I really need a pair of shoes.

122
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,450
Have you looked for it?

123
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:02,120
Ouch.

124
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:03,920
No, no?

125
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,560
Take it, oops.

126
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,400
Could you please look for that one?

127
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,930
This guy spends 10,000 yuan on his phone every day. I guess he has no friends.

128
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,160
Why is it necessary?

129
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,130
Please eat one of these.

130
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:16,630
no.

131
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:26,570
Just eat it, I had a kidney transplant and became very healthy, thank you very much, so give your gut.

132
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,700
fine thanks.

133
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,140
Is there anything, maybe Zhang.

134
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:37,630
If it's bad, this is what the prebiotics and probiotics do together, sweeping the tummy clean of vitamins.

135
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,890
The one from Vegetable Auntie.

136
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:41,780
Arms, arms.

137
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:46,360
Even if you sell it the wrong way.

138
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,560
What's wrong with your arm?

139
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,250
Is there any apple flavor?

140
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:58,740
Ah, but if I eat too much of this, I'll have a stomachache. And our food, including salad, would be cheaper if the salad was delivered regularly.

141
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,180
Let me show you here, oh, why.

142
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:12,490
After my heart surgery, I can pray well now and my strength has become so great. This uncle underwent a transplant.

143
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:13,540
show me.

144
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:33,580
The child's younger brother.

145
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,470
What is the ability of auntie?

146
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,590
Ah, I didn't, I had surgery.

147
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:44,430
Nothing has changed, I just.

148
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:54,290
Although I'm not sure, people say that my skin has improved and I've become more beautiful. Really, what's so good about me?

149
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:54,900
real.

150
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,310
Do you have a super power to become beautiful?

151
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,390
Being pretty is also a superpower these days.

152
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,220
It has come to this point.

153
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,880
No, no, no.

154
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,360
Recently I pretended to buy Yakult and asked for a lot of numbers, which are men’s first loves.

155
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,160
I remember now.

156
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,920
I've said no, please take your time.

157
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:18,030
Auntie also has tattoos, and having tattoos means having super powers, that’s the formula, but you may not have discovered it yet.

158
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:21,140
This uncle is Dr. Chuck, a person with super powers, but you don’t know.

159
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:27,630
Originally, if people with special abilities gather together, unknown abilities will come out. If you find the remaining ones, you will discover them yourself.

160
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,260
How to find the rest.

161
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:52,490
In the third year of Jindeok Middle School, Do Kyung-soo, who completed a heart transplant, married Do Kyung-soo, the future hope of the five-time champion of the elementary school Taekwondo class.

162
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:53,700
Is it bulletproof?

163
00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:02,120
If Jin Shan also had a kidney transplant in 1975, Rabbit is unmarried, and there is still first love on her face, what?

164
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,900
Park Ji-sung attended the meeting.

165
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:10,830
Profession?

166
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:14,140
Who are you?

167
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:19,630
My name is Huang Jidong. During the maneuver, I also received Huang Jidong's cornea.

168
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,960
Mr. Mobile said how we found it.

169
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:38,230
Ah, everyone has a tattoo, right? If it comes within a radius of a few kilometers, it will glow, but this.

170
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:40,470
Because only I can see it, eventually.

171
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,040
It can't be explained.

172
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,610
So uncle just now.

173
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:48,320
One is different from the electromagnetic wave WIFI.

174
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:49,480
is that so?

175
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,080
Another drink for 500.

176
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:07,700
Great, Mr. Mobile is our superpowered captain, and the captain is still looking for someone else.

177
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,980
It is a military regime.

178
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,470
No, within a few meters.

179
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:14,310
Doesn’t it say that you have to be there to see it? I wonder where it is.

180
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:17,510
That's just like before, hacker in that movie.

181
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:21,800
It looks like a dictatorship if civilian audits are discovered.

182
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,410
Violation of the Privacy Protection Act, violation of the Information and Communications Act, and leakage of personal information.

183
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:27,920
You don't know that even reputational damage will follow.

184
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,970
No, you were the one who said you wanted to find it first.

185
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:35,170
The method is not just because it is good and because it is busy.

186
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:36,620
Yeah, you don't have a job.

187
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,590
Who said what China is.

188
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,540
The writer is the script.

189
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:44,460
I can't use it.

190
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:53,340
Look at Heroes, it's over next week, you like Heroes, then you know the community there.

191
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,890
Return to where we are.

192
00:19:54,890 --> 00:20:02,890
I heard that you became a hero. It turns out that we like each other very much. There are many indigenous foreign language high schools among us. Please do me a favor.

193
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:06,530
It turns out to be a poem. No wonder it asked us to stop talking.

194
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:18,640
It is close to plain language. What year were you born? I was born in 1987. What is the fast belt of Apple's clothes? Isn't it soup? What is the basis of curvature? According to.

195
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:24,550
The argument to be faced is that if new life is received from a body on a truly good day.

196
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,160
Like family now.

197
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:38,040
Decided to print more uncle stickers.

198
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,180
Didn't you do it?

199
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:45,060
Hi Yolanta, what's your show this time?

200
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:51,000
Zhu She took the liver and gallbladder of the poor souls and filled it with it.

201
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,660
It’s very expensive now.

202
00:20:53,660 --> 00:21:00,690
Sometimes, when that happens, I will go to other places to ask. You know, there are many cults in South Korea.

203
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:57,760
You are so annoying, get out.

204
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,860
Yes, I have.

205
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:04,370
Yansheng Yongchun carefully congratulated the gods of heaven and earth and resurrected Jerry.

206
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:06,840
Congratulations, God of the World.

207
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,590
A busy man has arrived.

208
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:12,070
God, why would it be pitiful to do it?

209
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:15,750
Can making a movie save more lives?

210
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,820
Learn carefully.

211
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:21,740
How did my chance come about? I heard about it.

212
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:26,540
I injured my ears when I was a child, so I can't hear clearly.

213
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:31,520
No, no, my ears can hear it clearly.

214
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:39,350
How much money would it cost if my daughter handed over the foundation to me?

215
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:52,340
But I will not hand over the pharmaceutical company to you. I am very proud of it. This is the business my father has been doing since the beginning. I am not a filial daughter. This is Bingjun.

216
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:59,160
There has been no filial sons and daughters in our family from generation to generation, and our blood is greedy.

217
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:06,710
I called 45 Shinto head allowances, I'll call you fifty, tell Owl.

218
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:13,590
Don't flip over because you're injured and you hit the wrong way when doing the Zhaler show at Jeongseon Market.

219
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,790
With.

220
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,220
\550,000 so.

221
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:22,270
I beat you like a dog, including your pants. You know you took a lot of medicine that day.

222
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,510
Follow the decimal places of the big brother.

223
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:29,380
It seems that both shit and geography think he is a real god.

224
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:36,900
Don't talk about Shiva. In order to build this Lezang line, he said the same thing. If you were asked to say that, you would have cleaned up a meal.

225
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,660
I think he is.

226
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,120
There are five minutes left for lunch.

227
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,580
Five minutes ago each.

228
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:40,360
Only when the position is correct can we work at the right time, and the right time can protect our safety. Please use it safely. There are 3 minutes left. Users cannot force the time to work. Now you see that this violates the Labor Standards Act. Mr. Li Xiuxun knows the law so well. When he was a judge and prosecutor, why did he do such a thing here? Don't discriminate me because I am a contract worker. Even if I am not a contract worker, even if I am the president, as long as I abide by the rest time, I will abide by the working hours. This is my practice. The one who does not abide by what should be abided is this consortium. Is it the year of revival or something? Let me set a date and add work on empty days. There are insufficient safety equipment. If this goes on and an accident occurs, will the team leader save you? The leader can't even save you, and he sent you to hell. Rolling around, you dare to look at the birdman in your mouth.

229
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,700
It's like this, no, change that one.

230
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,850
Let me do it.

231
00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:01,820
I've said it several times, and he really answered the phone.

232
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,980
Hahaha.

233
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:27,980
OMG.

234
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,620
people.

235
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,460
When will you come?

236
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:46,480
oh.

237
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,010
Because I saw it.

238
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:13,940
Why collect people’s words?

239
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,450
It’s not that I don’t believe it.

240
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:18,670
This is the true use of medicine, countless times, let me do it.

241
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,610
As he was doing it, Dao Bo became excited.

242
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:23,910
If the people secrete, there is no door, it is very clear.

243
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:28,120
Why don’t you just kick the dog instead of catching it when you get up?

244
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:39,980
Mr. Huang Xinling captured the scene very well. There was not a single person with gray hair. Was the person who endured him at that time a special committee member?

245
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:42,370
Special physique, yes.

246
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:46,590
There should be people who have received comments.

247
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:45,020
Ah, it seems that it is pollen flying, let’s stop here.

248
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:47,940
Just do it, now that you have done it.

249
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:57,740
You don't go anywhere on weekends and you don't have any friends.

250
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,410
I have no friends.

251
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,550
But I.

252
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,910
I will only love you.

253
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:03,720
Not me.

254
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:09,140
That was also the case. I took a year off due to illness, so I had no friends.

255
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,960
You know, when it hurts, it doesn’t hurt, but when it doesn’t hurt, you’re afraid of the pain.

256
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,580
Kiss ancient songs.

257
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:20,460
It turns out that super-powered people are lonely friends.

258
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,660
mmm hmm.

259
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:30,180
Did you know that?

260
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,510
What you think it is, is what it is.

261
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,900
The villains are in the same superpowered group.

262
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:40,610
Then attack other super-powered people.

263
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:42,770
Why should I have all the super powers by myself?

264
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:54,480
So we have to find the villain first. Before our abilities were taken away, that’s how we were. People with super powers make friends with people with super powers, and rich people get along with rich people.

265
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:59,060
Uncle, why don't you try it?

266
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:10,300
Uncle, if you are caught by dad, just tell me, because I will give you everything in our team.

267
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,520
But what about this villain?

268
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,090
Let’s find out.

269
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:23,100
You can tell at one glance, you can tell at one glance.

270
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:32,040
This kid is a villain, even though he is not, but he knew it and ate two chicken wings.

271
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:40,220
Junshan, I found it, I found it, what my superpower is, look.

272
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,280
Du Gu.

273
00:30:55,900 --> 00:31:03,060
Do I have no super powers? Why am I the only one with a tattoo that's round like plankton?

274
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,750
Why did the aunt go to Churong Station?

275
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,080
The superpower you want.

276
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:10,900
If you have, you can save people, just like a hero.

277
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:13,070
Just having super powers doesn't make you a hero.

278
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,520
Why?

279
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,080
Experience value positivity.

280
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:25,160
There are scoring lines based on the number of people saved and the degree of self-sacrifice, and there are heroes and so on.

281
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,020
I don't really like the score line.

282
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,620
It's fruit, child, what is he, not coming?

283
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,820
Well, that amazing hacker.

284
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:37,570
He said he found it, but he didn't know. When I came to ask him, he said that he had a stomachache because he ate too much.

285
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:42,280
Even if they show up, it’s very late and they’re very young, so they can leave their message via text message.

286
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,520
I will return your money.

287
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:05,960
Damn it, how could Percy appear 11 times in the same position for a week in a row? It seems like the machine is broken. What should I do? Take off my glasses.

288
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,400
This one seems broken.

289
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,350
Not knowing.

290
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:17,030
I just sit here and say is this the sound that is compensated? See this finger this this this is splashing out, so the exploding curtain you are what Pikachu ah static electricity.

291
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,760
I didn't make Pikachu.

292
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:29,440
No, this is an offer, oops, it's totally Oufei color, you should contact our big brother Longku, because the text message happened to be sent now.

293
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,180
I gotta push that one.

294
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,420
Although there were five stops, where did they go?

295
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:55,420
That middle school student can’t come in, alas.

296
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,340
Isn’t this an Internet cafe?

297
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,570
I was originally a high school student.

298
00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:00,030
It’s me, who took a year off and became a high school student.

299
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:03,880
To go out, not to the Internet cafe, auntie, I have a stomachache if I don’t eat yogurt.

300
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:07,960
I'm not here to sell Yakult, I want to take that young man with me.

301
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:18,750
So this young man is not a young man who can just take it away, he opened a store on this young man, there is no Jewish law, have I been raised, that toilet paper.

302
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,040
No.

303
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,620
Far away, not friends.

304
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:37,440
Uncle, let that uncle go, my father is a Taekwondo coach.

305
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:54,810
My father is a criminal with a criminal record. You didn't listen to anything I said just now. This uncle just made a mess of the store. This uncle can only suffer losses. He should be a person, not a friend, but he has no friends. He should be severely punished and cannot be used.

306
00:33:54,810 --> 00:34:00,410
Because we were going to eat spare ribs and we were scolded. If you want to start a new life, come here, otherwise leave.

307
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:01,720
I go my own way.

308
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:13,480
Come on, just let me go and I'll do you a service, gentlemen.

309
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:17,400
I said a word, which was understood by the way, but I had bowel problems.

310
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:38,600
Beef brisket pork chop.

311
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,580
Went in, about 10 minutes?

312
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,650
Okay, how come there are four people?

313
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:48,480
Are all of you here?

314
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:53,780
It took exactly 4 minutes and 28 seconds.

315
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,500
Please tell dad for me.

316
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:48,120
Now let’s go beyond what.

317
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:54,550
in.

318
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:27,980
Go ahead.

319
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:28,440
brother.

320
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:00,770
fine.

321
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:08,440
I eat well, unlimited.

322
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:20,210
The defendant is in a good position because of you. The dog suffered, but it didn't count. After a long time, people knew that it was you who counted the consequences. You are using a plain language, which is similar to a respectful title.

323
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:22,690
Look at the Shaoz, friends at Chorong Station.

324
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:26,160
What did my friend say about this person? Do we have to stay together forever?

325
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,830
Then you have the ability to hack in and find it, because you can't, don't you?

326
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:40,000
Because it is illegal, so I don't do it, so why do you, a law-abiding gentleman, plagiarize other people's scripts? Are you blackmailing me?

327
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,050
That's how it's done.

328
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:44,960
I took a look at it because it was so neatly organized.

329
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:51,600
Wait a minute, today and selling a script was also thanks to my friends, so there are no friends.

330
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:53,410
Wow.

331
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:19,260
The world of children has been sued several times by famous malicious commenters. Without even watching it, the movie rating Terra is not a vicious guy. Do you know that your coin is now cut in half? There are 80,000 left.

332
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,920
You have to sweat to make money.

333
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:30,320
Isn't it pitiful that this guy who justly became the value of a coin in someone else's murder case? If it were me, I would commit suicide.

334
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,910
Did you say that?

335
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:37,480
There are things I want to say, but there are things I can’t say, and the answer is suicide.

336
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:39,710
Let's go.

337
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:40,930
Zhishengxi

338
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:44,540
I can’t bear it any longer.

339
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:48,270
Really, what happened between us? Didn’t we agree to report it? Hey, this is nothing.

340
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:56,580
I played it out of pity, I thought you really became my friend, hey, come here.

341
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,400
It's called a wedding, if that's what you really want, let's meet now.

342
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:46,850
Why didn’t you answer the phone? Where did you go? What happened?

343
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,260
Who are you with?

344
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,430
Are you with your friends?

345
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:51,590
I have no friends.

346
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:53,540
What a person has done up to this time.

347
00:41:53,540 --> 00:42:07,440
Who are the friends, give me the number, no friends, you know what's going on, I am a resident doctor, all in the hospital, until Yinghan City, I took them all off, I tore off all the Yuhan City, and I am also a child of achievement now when I play with friends.

348
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,450
real.

349
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:09,960
I am a friend.

350
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:19,740
No, no friends, no one, I just want to accept that I don’t need to exist in the future, that’s it.

351
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:20,360
He did.

352
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:23,070
The wine died just like that at that moment.

353
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:24,650
I knew it was you.

354
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:37,960
Why did I die? The real tree heard it at the moment, not because my heart hurt, but because my father seemed to be stopping. I am a dog, why should I be a lucky charm.

355
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:45,180
I had a fight and was so depressed that I didn't tell anyone in advance.

356
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:56,520
It’s over, it’s over, it’s over, don’t run anymore, you will slip.

357
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:24,820
Have a cup of tea before you go.

358
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:32,490
Now don't take that stuff anymore.

359
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:35,850
sorry.

360
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:43,840
I heard you had a kidney transplant, and it seems like everything is healed, and your face has gotten better.

361
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:47,520
The skin has improved.

362
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:51,060
You see, the Master’s wife looks like a young girl.

363
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:59,610
You took two lives, that's great.

364
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:01,620
You deserve to lose, don't you.

365
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:17,310
If you do something wrong, spend the rest of your life doing good things. Your husband's clone can't do that, so you saved many people, auntie.

366
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:23,860
Don't live, hope you can commit suicide again, hope you don't fail this time, you must succeed.

367
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:25,720
I was so angry for no reason that I almost died.

368
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:29,260
Don’t start a fire and let people like my husband die.

369
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:31,350
I hope the ajumma dies.

370
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,050
Let's do it.

371
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:50,360
What did you research?

372
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:56,080
In order to develop new drugs, Dean Song has three years left before retirement.

373
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,300
Three years and four months.

374
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:02,650
After retirement, will the grandchildren go to poop?

375
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:05,540
Because of your weak health, Vice President, do you want to do it?

376
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:05,800
Yes.

377
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:12,030
It is time for our country to win the Nobel Prize in Music.

378
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:13,600
So what to do.

379
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:17,510
What do you think will happen.

380
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:18,670
Why are you here.

381
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,010
Really no one will watch it.

382
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:23,420
Stop looking, auntie.

383
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:25,910
This is the focus of the villain, the uncle is the villain.

384
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:28,400
You've found it, don't look for it anymore, now.

385
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:34,980
Oh, this uncle is not evil, he is a little bit.

386
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:38,090
Not that Holman-style guy, that's me.

387
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:39,540
I am a villain.

388
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,570
You will only know the pain if you have experienced it.

389
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:43,650
If the body is twisted, the mind will also be twisted.

390
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:52,300
Well, I don’t want to see those self-righteous guys hiding behind those guys who don’t want to be seen and cursing at others. I also don’t want to see those guys who are capable and have nothing being bullied.

391
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:55,320
This is the formula, but doesn’t the uncle have super powers?

392
00:45:56,300 --> 00:46:04,320
We should use this kind of thing to look at it. If the baby is born, it will be like that child, and it will be born very well. What kind of superpower is this? Do you have this ability?

393
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:05,770
It is 100000000.

394
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:08,020
This is who I am, so I live this way.

395
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:20,780
I didn't plagiarize the script. We were supposed to write it together. But I wrote it somewhere else.

396
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:26,600
The uncle really played with me because I felt sorry for him.

397
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:33,200
That sentence was cancelled, and I went to say sorry to Fairy Aunt.

398
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,020
Do it, go there, uncle does it himself.

399
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:37,030
There. There.

400
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:39,090
He said he found a simple one.

401
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:41,390
Actual blind man now.

402
00:46:41,390 --> 00:47:01,870
These people are not our believers. They are in a safe paradise and will do all this before the day of revival. When I was there, there was no Lord. I had just reached the 50th floor and the 60th floor. It was completely the best. Refresh Dad said it himself. So what stable equipment is needed in the place where Refresh Dad observes? It’s because there is no trust, so there are many people who are afraid. It’s not like that.

403
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:05,860
Let’s eat. The district chief has 15 minutes left. It’s lunch time.

404
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:09,310
Let’s eat something first, we are not robots at all.

405
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:16,550
How can this robot eat only one day today? Come on, finally one ramen fell today.

406
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:17,920
Check it out when you come.

407
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,290
Get me a cup of noodles, got it.

408
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:36,580
Oh, if you don't come, don't you want to know how to work? What's the point of coming? You'll lose all your oxygen. You don't have any ideas and no ability. You'll be crooked.

409
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:42,470
Sorry, I have to go first. Come back after we meet.

410
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:46,420
What's wrong? Look for Auntie's super powers.

411
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:48,580
I'm sorry, you didn't miss it very much.

412
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:53,020
I am not qualified to be a complete student. There is no such thing as that.

413
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:57,460
Didn't we decide to find super powers together and become heroes?

414
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:03,300
Mr. Zhuzi, I have seen it too, right?

415
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:05,610
I'm not unqualified.

416
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:09,960
I didn't look that closely.

417
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:15,180
This is a precious ability, please use it well. I owe you a lot of favors during this period.

418
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:19,440
Me too, I don’t do it.

419
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:21,900
Damn it, I ate it.

420
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,860
A world where even living is difficult.

421
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:31,680
What super hairstyle? I’m here too. What can I do? The chat group that was disbanded today also exploded.

422
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,180
I was nervous because nothing was happening.

423
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:47,150
Stop it, I'm doing it, I can't hear any sound, go in, quickly.

424
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:48,580
It used to be no big deal.

425
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:55,350
If the regional head sticks to his post, it seems that the regional head over there will become a teacher. Go out, two periods.

426
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:58,600
Use two lines slowly, slowly, slowly.

427
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:12,040
Where is this.

428
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,980
That's right.

429
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,750
A year has passed.

430
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:28,280
Yes.

431
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:45,720
But I just came here, no.

432
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:52,380
I have no idea.

433
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:48,200
But no, inside.

434
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,470
There are people there, too, in the valley.

435
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:51,990
If not, it can't be opened.

436
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:54,960
Wait, ah, open, got it, open.

437
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:07,820
At that time.

438
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:11,080
sorry.

439
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:22,570
There's no such thing as a water mirror here, because the smoke makes it impossible to see?

440
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:24,320
Hey, turn this song off.

441
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:26,600
Mr. Mobile.

442
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,500
Be a child.

443
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:41,520
Oh, the car is coming.

444
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,530
I'll wait for you.

445
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:44,130
After you come in.

446
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:50,960
What do you say? Let me in and I'll give you the directions if you have one.

447
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,360
Either go in or don't.

448
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:59,300
Open the door, run over to open the door for you, ask you to show the way, you show the way, what else can I do, I don’t ask you to do anything, it’s like this.

449
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:07,150
Don't point fingers, don't point fingers, point fingers, point fingers at who is doing what, where is doing what, what should be done.

450
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:09,430
I mean don't point fingers, don't dictate.

451
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:15,930
Don't point fingers, boys, as soon as they look at each other, they will snap and put the buds in, soldiers.

452
00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:18,560
No, these assholes come sit down and come in.

453
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:24,100
Uncle's way.

454
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:26,500
Please tell me.

455
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:42,040
Put a little bit on the left, no, right, go straight.

456
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:42,690
straight.

457
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:44,320
Yeah, there.

458
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:01,100
Today's center.

459
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:08,000
Come to Li Sugen's house and cheer up.

460
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:18,920
OMG.

461
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:37,160
Uncle.

462
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,040
What water faster?

463
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:45,580
What are you doing?

464
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:55,620
Don't just stand there, even if you don't know.

465
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:56,840
Listen to the sound.

466
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:29,300
Aunt.

467
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:30,940
What?

468
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:52,000
Where is the pillar.

469
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:59,260
Where am I going, no, if you're going to get me some water, you're going to ask me where I am, do you know where I am?

470
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,470
Wearing a water purifier, what a superhero.

471
00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:04,080
What to do, catcher.

472
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:22,430
In that case, uncle.

473
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:24,010
Did you go out and see what it was?

474
00:55:24,010 --> 00:55:27,860
Just like the water purifier bus, I'll go with Honey.

475
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:33,220
The child is now caught outside here, please, I somehow.

476
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:42,800
Ah, go to hell, thank you.

477
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:27,430
Just walk another 10 meters.

478
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:30,140
This is where construction happens, like a gas mask.

479
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:32,220
No, sorry.

480
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:37,580
But I just saw there are a lot of tank-like things here, like oxygen tanks.

481
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:40,120
Nothing, here it comes, canister.

482
00:56:51,870 --> 00:56:52,760
Not you.

483
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:30,950
here.

484
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:35,330
no.

485
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:57,120
Put your head on my shoulder.

486
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,830
Squeeze me.

487
00:58:01,830 --> 00:58:02,490
I'm.

488
00:58:02,490 --> 00:58:04,440
Too tight, too tight

489
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:07,250
that.

490
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:13,470
You love me too.

491
00:58:13,470 --> 00:58:16,010
Your lips come next.

492
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:18,560
To my dear.

493
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:35,580
My name is Xu Ruoshan. I received a liver transplant. Existing underlying diseases can be cured or not. I can cure fractures, bruises, and chronic fatigue in the shoulders caused by simple accidents.

494
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:37,050
A must when needed.

495
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:38,520
Please tell me.

496
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:42,190
Ah, the uncles are designated drivers, and so is my dad.

497
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:46,320
Just now, I saw that the teacher seemed to have taken away something that someone else had just damaged.

498
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:50,390
That's okay, I just need a glass of water.

499
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:56,780
It doesn't matter, people like teachers are really heroes, aren't they.

500
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:57,260
applaud.

501
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:09,180
Ma’am, I think you are a true hero and I sincerely thank you for saving my life.

502
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:27,480
I don't know what you are talking about. Stop crying, auntie. You scolded that bastard, why are you crying? It's inappropriate, and it makes you even more scared.

503
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:29,300
Ah, actually I used to.

504
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:39,620
Because of depression, I was controlled by anger, took medicine, had surgery, became healthy, and am really much better now.

505
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:41,300
Green baths are a superpower.

506
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:42,610
I thought it was his younger brother.

507
00:59:42,610 --> 00:59:55,000
I forgot what happened just now. We have to name them one by one. What names should we give to the hair? Also, why is it that when we watch foreign movies, the heroes all have the same name, something like "The Distance of Man".

508
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,870
Now that I am very strong, how about saving people?

509
00:59:59,870 --> 01:00:02,180
It's called begging, you don't mind, do you?

510
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:08,630
In English, Uncle Nine Nine Girl is an oxygen tank, so he is a tank boy.

511
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:11,680
Tank boy, but what are you going to do?

512
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:17,660
Ah, I was originally Hulash’s agent, so I wanted to be Hulash’s, but is Jiehang a bit like that?

513
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:22,540
No, but Mr. Hurry likes the mouth of Hurrish Street better than Mr. Hurry's woman.

514
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:25,310
Yeah, if you don't call me.

515
01:00:25,310 --> 01:00:28,730
Because I can, the teacher's name is.

516
01:00:28,730 --> 01:00:34,160
Since he is the grandson of a weak man, he can just be the weak hand.

517
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,680
Hands are medicine hands.

518
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:39,640
Mr. Zhuzi's name is Zhuzi, so he is a Bluetooth person.

519
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:41,380
That wifi one.

520
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:42,460
Oh, okay, okay.

521
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:45,720
Oh, Chinese is not the focus of your study.

522
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:49,340
My father said to stay healthy. Ugh.

523
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:59,630
Well, I actually thought about that name, but because I changed the person and added strength, I missed it.

524
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:01,440
They all speak English.

525
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:04,460
Because we did it, there was also a sense of unity.

526
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:14,440
Very good, that’s neat, right? We have already chosen the names for today, and the atmosphere is like this too. Bruzmann fits the mood of today.

527
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,420
The music prompts are amazing.

528
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:23,320
But uncle, this one is really amazing, just watch it once, the action.

529
01:01:36,190 --> 01:01:36,500
Do it again.

530
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:49,980
yes.

531
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:52,940
where have you been.

532
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:54,500
Meeting friends.

533
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:56,050
If you don't have any friends.

534
01:01:56,050 --> 01:02:00,040
I have a friend, help me, you.

535
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:01,450
What power.

536
01:02:01,450 --> 01:02:02,500
Wait a moment.

537
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:06,280
Because it's Darcy.

538
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:07,800
Get out of the way.

539
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:14,420
See, if you have a dad, just do it.

540
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:15,510
It's still usable.

541
01:02:15,510 --> 01:02:16,870
Because it can be used.

542
01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:39,120
Leave everything to Dad. Dad, even if you become a pauper, as long as you call Dad, he will appear like a hero and help you solve everything. If you have a cold and your heart is not in good condition, tomorrow is the day to go to the hospital, so go back early.

543
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:40,360
us.

544
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:41,500
The new neurological language.

545
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:44,460
I wish all patients good health and a speedy recovery.

546
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:48,440
No matter what time it is, focus on watching whatever movie you want now.

547
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:49,270
Yes, I have.

548
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:50,310
sorry.

549
01:02:50,310 --> 01:02:52,600
Use A for the next elevator.

550
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,160
sorry.

551
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:54,680
Related.

552
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:56,480
Through the procedure.

553
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:57,760
A life of fighting against illness.

554
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:59,300
The church burned down.

555
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:02,600
Which department is it?

556
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:08,500
Yongshengying Village New Xinjiang Adult World God War Stage Director Facility No. 7000000000000 Xu Ruoxian.

557
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:12,220
The explosion shortly before Guangrong's death must have frightened him.

558
01:03:12,220 --> 01:03:14,710
No injuries, nothing's wrong.

559
01:03:14,710 --> 01:03:17,440
Thank you for your trust.

560
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:18,930
You should thank me, yes.

561
01:03:18,930 --> 01:03:21,160
I will try harder to believe in you.

562
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:26,640
The new god of eternal life and eternal spring.

563
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:27,780
Coming.

564
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:48,980
Door god, this one.

565
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:53,080
Door god, no, last time, fortunately it was organ ritual.

566
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:54,360
received.

567
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:56,000
I received Khan.

568
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,850
Has anything changed since I had my transplant? Surgery.

569
01:03:58,850 --> 01:04:01,700
I don’t know if I’m better now. I’ve become healthier and not as tired anymore.

570
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:03,940
Not that, not like that, but somewhere special.

571
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:10,280
Uh, I'm not sure.

572
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:13,980
I heard you looked younger.

573
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:28,890
Getting younger, nothing to go to, name.

574
01:04:28,890 --> 01:04:29,880
I have no idea.

575
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:31,840
I am Xu Ruoxian.

576
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:37,250
Weakness Line Seven Operation The body is managed very well.

577
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:38,860
Let's watch it again.

578
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:42,470
Who is where.

579
01:04:42,470 --> 01:04:43,050
Nurse.

580
01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:44,790
Are you preparing for the exam?

581
01:04:44,790 --> 01:04:47,110
No, I just do it for fun.

582
01:04:47,110 --> 01:04:48,080
I am watching.

583
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:53,280
Ah, great, this proxy driver, sorry, what should I do?

584
01:04:53,280 --> 01:05:19,570
Suddenly we meet in a place like this, okay, do you want to change buses, oh, sorry, where is the headquarters of Refresh Pharmaceutical, I work next to Refresh Pharmaceutical, I am familiar with the road, ah, great, then I'll leave it to you safely, I have gum, gum.

585
01:05:19,570 --> 01:05:21,380
Don't start.

586
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:36,780
Ah, yes, first of all, we need to do a tissue examination, but if the dose exceeds the lethal dose, we can’t use anesthesia because she is a mistress. Ah, we also have Zhao Shixin storing 70000000000000, which is a bit fake.

587
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:46,140
Ah, longevity yourself, where, where, where, should go home, yes, ah, but, in a book-ending card urine, is the core library, where the request is done very well.

588
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:49,020
That one missed, that's it.

589
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:58,520
Little we are popular little worldly wisdom little worldly wisdom little worldly wisdom.

590
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:01,720
The Stray family.

591
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:05,330
If not, let him pass out.

592
01:06:05,330 --> 01:06:07,140
Let me do something.

593
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:08,440
you.

594
01:06:09,270 --> 01:06:09,780
Wait a moment.

595
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:15,810
Yongshengying Village is renewed in the river.

596
01:06:15,810 --> 01:06:18,220
You are very interesting.

597
01:06:18,220 --> 01:06:21,120
You planned it.

598
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,440
Long time no see.

599
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:25,350
Xu Ruochun.

600
01:06:25,350 --> 01:06:29,640
Operation seven doesn’t matter, it doesn’t matter, who said that.

601
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:31,860
Dean Song has six.

602
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:32,410
Look.

603
01:06:32,410 --> 01:06:33,520
The liver has a bit.

604
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:37,120
If you keep it, it will grow again, right?

605
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:38,500
Yes, that's right.

606
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:39,810
Handsome all his life.

607
01:06:39,810 --> 01:06:46,380
Shichen Gann has become real wealth, an image within me.

608
01:07:02,270 --> 01:07:02,300
Well.

609
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:11,260
pigment.

610
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:32,640
Sorry if it's the same elusiveness.

611
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:33,780
That's OK.

612
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:37,640
Have surgery.

613
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:39,160
bring it on.

614
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:59,800
Zhao Shiqing is your boss.

615
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:03,440
Meditation therapy.

616
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:04,590
When you are in deep trouble.

617
01:08:04,590 --> 01:08:06,320
Catch him back.

618
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:10,580
Just gently and gently.

619
01:08:24,820 --> 01:08:28,010
Auntie is here.

620
01:08:28,010 --> 01:08:29,380
I'm leaving.

621
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:32,180
Oops, high.

622
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:34,460
Thanks.

623
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:40,130
Wow.

624
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:47,480
There is delicious food.

625
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:52,160
Yes, yes, yes, you must be lonely, I'm from the Free Creatures team.

626
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:06,530
What's wrong, what's wrong?

627
01:09:06,530 --> 01:09:17,380
It's okay, it's okay, hey, hey, I don't like that, who are you? Go with your pet.

628
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:20,040
Here you go, leaving right away, daughter.

629
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:24,600
Keep going to the end, keep going to the end.

630
01:09:38,820 --> 01:09:40,630
Ah, waist, waist.

631
01:09:40,630 --> 01:09:47,140
Ah, I can't do warm-up exercises, yesterday it was really, ah, light.

632
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:48,200
Take off.

633
01:09:53,530 --> 01:09:53,680
oh.

634
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,000
One more day.

635
01:10:25,170 --> 01:10:25,230
Wow.

636
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:32,460
Come on, watch it all in one go.

637
01:11:02,620 --> 01:11:05,200
Yeah 540.

638
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:07,780
Did you call me more?

639
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:18,560
Mom must have finished eating all her kimchi. I’ll get you an empty bucket now.

640
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:23,120
Aren't you in the same position as dad?

641
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:26,800
If you need anything, please bring me some water.

642
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:33,100
Wow, haha.

643
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:04,500
I just said, you have arrested the wrong person, sir, just let me out first.

644
01:12:12,860 --> 01:12:14,250
This is George H.W. Bush.

645
01:12:14,250 --> 01:12:17,030
Could Dad have come earlier?

646
01:12:17,030 --> 01:12:22,050
No need for a position, just a few simple Nobel Prizes will do.

647
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:34,460
Your dance is written wrong, you deserve to be beaten by the old man, who will live longer.

648
01:12:34,460 --> 01:12:37,680
Same, please confirm.

649
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:48,590
Who are you?

650
01:12:49,350 --> 01:12:50,120
Where is it, come now.

651
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:01,100
Who are you, brat.

652
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:08,920
It's a magic trick. Why can't you recognize your dad? Did your dad say he was a handsome man when he was young?

653
01:13:13,650 --> 01:13:13,830
Um.

654
01:16:08,220 --> 01:16:13,980
Be careful with the stairs, we will go up slowly, go this way too.

655
01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:32,500
I don't know where my clone is.

656
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:33,710
Father.

657
01:16:33,710 --> 01:16:36,420
Only with me can one become a god.

658
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:42,460
Aren't you afraid? If there really is a God, what kind of punishment do you want to receive?

659
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:46,230
Do you go to church here.

660
01:16:46,230 --> 01:16:47,590
Dad will forgive you.

661
01:16:47,590 --> 01:16:50,980
I know I can't do it, so I don't want to be a god.

662
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:03,020
Ah, the head is fine, right down there.

663
01:17:03,020 --> 01:17:04,420
I hid myself.

664
01:17:05,380 --> 01:17:09,850
Director Zhao, long time no see. Who are you? I clearly know why this is happening.

665
01:17:09,850 --> 01:17:10,860
I have no idea.

666
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:16,210
Be gentle, the boss will serve you seriously.

667
01:17:20,940 --> 01:17:21,030
Hey, she.

668
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:27,640
Oh my god huh?

669
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:53,420
That's too much.

670
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:01,620
oops.

671
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:37,640
What, you, did it? Didn’t you come here with me, brother?
This video is shared by Weibo: Tacit0924 URL: https://link3.cc/tacit0924

672
01:18:37,740 --> 01:18:43,780
He got Iktau Mactau.

673
01:19:22,020 --> 01:19:30,540
You absolutely, absolutely can't, you absolutely, absolutely can't, your eyes really absolutely can't heal me.

674
01:19:30,540 --> 01:19:33,920
Go ahead, so that mom will be really serious.

675
01:19:36,950 --> 01:19:38,250
Isn't the cornea also very fast?

676
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:44,310
The rest of the children came along.

677
01:19:44,310 --> 01:19:53,480
Do it, why is there one more person, it is better to leave time safely, how much money.

678
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:53,950
I guess so.

679
01:19:53,950 --> 01:19:55,130
Boy, this is it.

680
01:19:55,130 --> 01:20:05,180
You have to cooperate. Dogs in a weak state will also make a lot of noise when they sleep. How painful that must be.

681
01:20:14,540 --> 01:20:14,700
I think.

682
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:24,030
No, no matter what it is, no, I have to go, no, no, absolutely not this time, no.

683
01:20:24,030 --> 01:20:27,820
I thought your father didn't know that he was like this.

684
01:20:30,140 --> 01:20:32,030
When did the parents first know?

685
01:20:32,030 --> 01:20:39,770
As long as you smell the scent of Tashi's little butt, you know what's wrong with him. This is what parents are like. You said you have been living in a hospital for three years?

686
01:20:39,770 --> 01:20:40,530
Pro 9° nailing.

687
01:20:40,530 --> 01:20:42,060
We met, so the body is a little bit.

688
01:20:42,060 --> 01:20:46,740
Because it was me, I made a friend, but that friend.

689
01:20:46,740 --> 01:20:49,400
Those things are just that.

690
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:51,920
Because there is nothing to read.

691
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:57,220
Wear shoes every day, even if they are real.

692
01:20:57,220 --> 01:20:58,090
Hundreds of miles.

693
01:20:58,090 --> 01:20:58,950
about.

694
01:20:58,950 --> 01:21:00,100
Come in.

695
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:09,880
Air conditioning our daughter chestnut is also a bit like our daughter why to learn Taekwondo, but said so, because don't want to eat, so don't want to eat, so a group of people.

696
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:11,470
So your own body.

697
01:21:11,470 --> 01:21:16,480
You beat it until it's a mess, but in the end, it's actually torn down.

698
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:17,770
Now dead.

699
01:21:17,770 --> 01:21:20,800
My friends were caught by the blood rashes.

700
01:21:22,850 --> 01:21:25,490
We have a relationship that's completely like family, so I...

701
01:21:25,490 --> 01:21:26,010
We have to rescue him.

702
01:21:26,790 --> 01:21:27,820
Can.

703
01:21:32,700 --> 01:21:34,750
Hiding tightly behind Dad.

704
01:21:34,750 --> 01:21:35,600
That's it.

705
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:39,660
Last time just like the sword, the numbers for the guys in suits were just ages, eh.

706
01:21:39,660 --> 01:21:40,640
Do you want to listen to other songs?

707
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:53,520
Dad said that even now, he gets excited when he hears this song. He won the championship with this song, didn’t he? I immediately remembered what Dad’s nickname was, Taekwondo V, Taekwondo V, the Li Ge who is united by justice.

708
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,330
Why, why yoga.

709
01:22:04,330 --> 01:22:07,630
No, cheer up, auntie.

710
01:22:07,630 --> 01:22:09,280
Why is this place.

711
01:22:10,220 --> 01:22:11,910
Kidnap us.

712
01:22:11,910 --> 01:22:16,560
I think I've been cheated, let me get out first.

713
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:23,180
Where are the restrooms.

714
01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:25,080
No, it's not.

715
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:31,390
Are you okay, kid?

716
01:22:31,390 --> 01:22:36,640
It's very interesting and amazing, I've never seen it with your eyes using wifi.

717
01:22:39,150 --> 01:22:42,680
Maybe because it was only one side, the bocas were a bit back and forth.

718
01:22:42,980 --> 01:22:46,250
Sorry, I woke up suddenly and rushed over.

719
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:52,440
That friend had a cornea left behind and was feeling a little uncomfortable. Could he have seen these as well?

720
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:53,680
Will do this too.

721
01:22:54,700 --> 01:23:00,740
The damage caused during the removal process is severe and it is impossible to recover using modern medicine.

722
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:04,980
Yeah, that's it.

723
01:23:07,270 --> 01:23:07,330
Hmm.

724
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:22,390
It's me. If you miss it, please help me fix it. Oh, it can really be fixed. The battery is dead.

725
01:23:22,390 --> 01:23:24,370
Drinking water can help you recover.

726
01:23:24,370 --> 01:23:28,740
Drink some water and help me fix it. Didn’t I get you some water last time?

727
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:33,800
You know, sold.

728
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:36,900
How to do it.

729
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:39,590
There are two philosophies in life.

730
01:23:39,590 --> 01:23:40,660
OK.

731
01:23:52,740 --> 01:23:54,800
The god of eternal life and eternal spring, Jiangling II.

732
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,400
Saints present.

733
01:23:56,400 --> 01:24:17,470
Welcome all the careful people. Now, according to his words and his promise, he has returned with a new body that will never die to save us from falling into the fire of hell. Looking at the unbelievers, among the kings who have descended in the body, among the kings of poets, we three, Xu Yingchun, let's shout together handsomely.

734
01:24:17,470 --> 01:24:19,180
I see.

735
01:24:37,420 --> 01:24:39,000
There are two, I don't know.

736
01:24:54,800 --> 01:25:09,660
The rest of my life will be filled with new thoughts in the spring, and eternal destruction and transcendence will also be me. On the promised day, I will return in a young body in front of you. Those who believe in me and serve me will become my 100 cities.

737
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:16,430
ah.

738
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:18,640
Um.

739
01:25:39,140 --> 01:25:42,590
Yongsheng Yongchun Xinjiang adults.

740
01:25:42,590 --> 01:25:44,320
Bourguignes.

741
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:45,180
color.

742
01:25:45,180 --> 01:25:54,910
I will break the rocks of the promised day, showing strength, trust in me, those who serve me, my Merthon.

743
01:25:54,910 --> 01:25:56,860
put up.

744
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:21,360
this.

745
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:23,280
The person to be.

746
01:27:45,820 --> 01:27:51,860
Jin Jingchun's latest arrival eliminates all diseases and awakens the lion.

747
01:27:52,140 --> 01:27:54,360
Attach the carrots.

748
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:55,630
And then died.

749
01:27:55,630 --> 01:27:57,220
If the ruler is saved.

750
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:43,630
Ah, why are there so many entrances?

751
01:28:43,630 --> 01:28:45,400
Are the artists here?

752
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:05,030
Right

753
01:29:05,030 --> 01:29:07,640
It scared me.

754
01:29:08,420 --> 01:29:10,560
I'm going to be scared.

755
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:10,990
in.

756
01:29:10,990 --> 01:29:13,120
Don't run.

757
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:13,980
yes.

758
01:29:22,340 --> 01:29:30,400
Director Lian Sheng has become a complete god in the latest room, and is back, full of praise for the petals.

759
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:31,380
You know.

760
01:29:54,860 --> 01:29:56,550
So you are a complete kid.

761
01:29:56,550 --> 01:29:58,230
Brother, who are you?

762
01:29:58,230 --> 01:30:09,120
You are so handsome, Park Jong-min, oh, this is Barcelona's hero, I used to fight when I was a kid, nice to meet you.

763
01:30:16,420 --> 01:30:19,860
I am.

764
01:30:19,860 --> 01:30:21,580
oh.

765
01:30:22,820 --> 01:30:23,110
Ah.

766
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:43,260
Oh my god, didn't you see it.

767
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:47,590
How do you homeschool your kids, for adults.

768
01:30:47,590 --> 01:31:01,540
I'm sorry for kicking you, but it's like this for me now, you're a while, always telling adults that you're this guy's way, and the same goes for the dad at home.

769
01:31:01,540 --> 01:31:06,190
No, not at home, of course my father was born in nineteen hundred and five.

770
01:31:06,190 --> 01:31:07,840
My brothers are my friends.

771
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:09,020
They took it away.

772
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:25,570
Actually, it was my daughter who said it. She modified it a bit here. Anyway, that’s it. Let’s go to bed. Now that we have introduced our respective families, let’s get to the point. Finished primary school, let me write about your heart.

773
01:31:25,570 --> 01:31:27,580
Is the kid crazy?

774
01:31:43,460 --> 01:31:45,120
It doesn't matter who it is.

775
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:46,570
I'll go pick you up even if you don't tell me.

776
01:31:46,570 --> 01:31:50,100
I wanted to cover it up, it came out very well, but how did it come out?

777
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:51,760
It looks like dad.

778
01:31:52,420 --> 01:31:53,580
Hello, hello.

779
01:31:53,580 --> 01:31:56,600
This is the last farewell, no greetings.

780
01:31:56,600 --> 01:32:01,030
Only if you reach this level can you be called a girl, here she is a tomboy.

781
01:32:01,030 --> 01:32:02,260
How much you have done.

782
01:32:02,260 --> 01:32:06,120
That’s great. I feel at ease having such an outstanding daughter.

783
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:12,460
No children, so no railways, very weak, very worried, how could the Tank Girl have children.

784
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:13,780
Presigen.

785
01:32:13,780 --> 01:32:14,770
Jin Shannv.

786
01:32:14,770 --> 01:32:15,100
seed.

787
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:17,070
Let me say something too.

788
01:32:17,070 --> 01:32:23,000
Who are you? I am Yongsheng Yongchun Xin Xinjiang for me.

789
01:32:23,370 --> 01:32:25,320
The brother looks like a villain and has tattoos.

790
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:28,850
But why is that person the older brother and I am the uncle?

791
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:31,010
Aren’t you very handsome?

792
01:32:31,010 --> 01:32:33,220
Ah, it's here, uncle.

793
01:32:33,220 --> 01:32:36,520
Like a star who needs to be taken care of.

794
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:41,180
Person B is speaking, but not politely.

795
01:32:41,180 --> 01:32:46,000
Grab the rope and take out the rope, where Mr. Mobile and Mr. Weak Line are.

796
01:32:48,140 --> 01:32:49,810
Did I eat?

797
01:32:49,810 --> 01:32:53,140
Don't make me do it too much, wait a minute.

798
01:33:07,300 --> 01:33:07,860
Not dead yet.

799
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:27,980
Google, here we go again, here we go.

800
01:34:28,340 --> 01:34:32,650
Park Ji-sung's useless style.

801
01:34:32,650 --> 01:34:34,380
Your occupation is.

802
01:34:42,650 --> 01:34:43,680
He can't be dead.

803
01:34:44,710 --> 01:34:46,000
But what was just said.

804
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:50,710
It turns out that before writing the ultimate move, light up the herbivorous first.

805
01:34:50,710 --> 01:34:51,720
That's politeness.

806
01:34:52,380 --> 01:34:57,970
The hour hand is too dirty and can’t survive. What did you just say?

807
01:34:57,970 --> 01:34:58,960
Did you do it?

808
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:02,900
What is Mera?

809
01:35:08,250 --> 01:35:08,340
Haha.

810
01:35:18,900 --> 01:35:22,220
What do you mean, guys?

811
01:35:22,220 --> 01:35:23,460
Winter insect.

812
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:33,010
Let's see, we.

813
01:35:33,010 --> 01:35:36,380
Kim Sun Nyeo is here.

814
01:35:54,660 --> 01:35:55,950
Hey, there is a way.

815
01:35:55,950 --> 01:35:57,230
Our Jin Shannv 10000.

816
01:35:57,230 --> 01:35:59,440
It would be so troublesome if you were on my side.

817
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:01,460
You don't have to do it.

818
01:36:01,460 --> 01:36:02,710
Please help me just once.

819
01:36:02,710 --> 01:36:05,220
Their abilities transfer to me.

820
01:36:05,220 --> 01:36:06,680
That's not 1°.

821
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:08,550
Lost the ability after transfer.

822
01:36:08,550 --> 01:36:11,530
Then I will keep sucking your blood.

823
01:36:11,530 --> 01:36:13,870
Don’t do it, it’s very clean.

824
01:36:13,870 --> 01:36:15,040
No, just.

825
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:16,220
Yakult.

826
01:36:16,220 --> 01:36:18,560
Let me buy you a company.

827
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:26,800
My eyes.

828
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:28,740
do the laundry.

829
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:32,780
Really love yourself, cornea focused.

830
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:07,000
Eternal and eternal new God, may you become the true sacrifice and live forever in me.

831
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,200
My life.

832
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:13,300
There are two kinds of burdens in one’s heart that cannot be achieved.

833
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:14,920
That one is young.

834
01:37:17,740 --> 01:37:18,740
What is one?

835
01:37:18,740 --> 01:37:20,430
Only by asking can you get on with the big things.

836
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:24,060
One should probably take some pictures.

837
01:37:24,060 --> 01:37:37,180
Whether you see it or not, you need a visible God. I want to become a God and make mankind a plateau. Isn’t that what you want to say? Now, it seems like I have attended some cult school somewhere. If I write such lines recently, I will be attacked by terrorist attacks in the ratings.

838
01:37:37,180 --> 01:37:41,990
You have a great talent for capturing people's feelings. He is famous in this village.

839
01:37:41,990 --> 01:37:43,400
If the person who left the message is malicious, I will replace him.

840
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:45,200
Dad: Yes, weak and kind.

841
01:37:45,880 --> 01:37:47,630
Are they all fake?

842
01:37:47,630 --> 01:37:51,140
Is everything you showed me fake?

843
01:37:51,140 --> 01:37:57,920
Brother, abandoned my family, and all night, it was my property that Tel drove.

844
01:37:57,920 --> 01:37:59,180
The large pillar color presented.

845
01:37:59,180 --> 01:38:02,450
Have you all been deceived and done useless things?

846
01:38:02,450 --> 01:38:03,950
So seriously.

847
01:38:03,950 --> 01:38:12,970
If you want to see God, give me those humble bodies, my eyes, and my age.

848
01:38:12,970 --> 01:38:13,980
Your mouth.

849
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:42,060
It’s coming out. It’s coming out.

850
01:39:26,940 --> 01:39:28,940
This needs to be dyed.

851
01:39:28,940 --> 01:39:30,140
I think it should be possible.

852
01:40:59,820 --> 01:41:04,660
What is it? If you open this here, it will open, and then you will see that I have grown up.

853
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:32,240
What to do, but don't believe it.

854
01:41:41,860 --> 01:41:44,550
Are you going to kill everyone up there?

855
01:41:44,550 --> 01:41:47,620
Would you kill everyone who believed in you?

856
01:41:47,620 --> 01:41:53,180
Albumin can be redone, my concept is death.

857
01:41:53,180 --> 01:41:54,420
It’s God.

858
01:42:01,300 --> 01:42:03,060
These Japanese guys.

859
01:42:03,060 --> 01:42:04,460
That's right.

860
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:31,480
Eternal life in Yongchun New Xinjiang, may you become a part of me and enjoy eternal life.

861
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:35,920
Kim Sunnyeo, hurry up.

862
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:37,440
Leave it to me.

863
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:40,390
Otherwise, give all of you to me.

864
01:42:42,620 --> 01:42:47,380
And, yeah, shoot the eyes, that's your style.

865
01:42:57,480 --> 01:42:59,760
Go search for me.

866
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:02,040
Fucking Rome.

867
01:45:56,100 --> 01:45:58,210
Uncle, how do I do that?

868
01:45:58,210 --> 01:45:58,740
Turn it off.

869
01:45:58,740 --> 01:46:00,590
I'm not sure.

870
01:46:00,590 --> 01:46:02,180
What should I do then.

871
01:46:02,440 --> 01:46:09,620
I need to use that symmetry thing to scatter, but I'm not a techie right now, so sorry.

872
01:46:09,620 --> 01:46:10,700
for me.

873
01:46:10,700 --> 01:46:12,520
Tell me something.

874
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,230
What should I do?

875
01:46:16,230 --> 01:46:19,360
I don’t know either, I’ll have to wait and see.

876
01:46:39,340 --> 01:46:43,900
If successful, we are the same age. If successful, we are the older brother.

877
01:48:04,060 --> 01:48:07,300
Well, we.

878
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:31,210
Hey, bring Dyson's tattoo, now bro.

879
01:48:31,210 --> 01:48:32,480
And Aishi.

880
01:48:35,470 --> 01:48:37,180
Hey, stop talking and catch him.

881
01:48:37,710 --> 01:48:40,300
Give it to me first, what?

882
01:48:44,220 --> 01:48:46,540
Discovered.

883
01:49:04,720 --> 01:49:08,590
Why do you want to win? If it's mine, let me die.

884
01:49:08,590 --> 01:49:11,300
Should be dead, someone like me saying that?

885
01:49:11,300 --> 01:49:15,270
I do this, I don’t do this.

886
01:49:15,270 --> 01:49:17,540
The sound that followed.

887
01:49:29,740 --> 01:49:34,050
Becoming so stubborn.

888
01:49:34,050 --> 01:49:40,340
I fell down, and there were our seniors in the women's alley.

889
01:49:46,040 --> 01:49:47,810
It's at my house.

890
01:49:47,810 --> 01:49:50,600
Sorry, Dad is a girl dad again.

891
01:49:56,400 --> 01:50:01,420
Don't you have a kid who is still wet behind the ears?

892
01:50:36,300 --> 01:50:37,810
Ali am sunny.

893
01:50:37,810 --> 01:50:39,320
Your test.

894
01:50:39,320 --> 01:50:42,340
I don't want to give it a try.

895
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:53,840
I want to be a nurse.

896
01:51:38,820 --> 01:51:39,980
Hey sir.

897
01:51:43,140 --> 01:51:54,840
Come with me, I'll get the ticket, oops.

898
01:51:58,420 --> 01:52:00,550
What to do, Yakult.

899
01:52:00,550 --> 01:52:00,850
Both.

900
01:52:00,850 --> 01:52:02,970
It must be broken, ah, me.

901
01:52:02,970 --> 01:52:09,320
In order to deliver takeout at night, and that Vietnamese meal started to lose weight, and I had to order darts.

902
01:52:09,320 --> 01:52:10,930
But what to do if you do it.

903
01:52:10,930 --> 01:52:13,850
Is this the parking lot?

904
01:52:13,850 --> 01:52:15,220
Bluesman.

905
01:52:15,220 --> 01:52:17,610
Not Bluetooth Man.

906
01:52:17,610 --> 01:52:25,120
So ours is there too, listen to a song while I wait.

907
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:32,740
I can't tell you, no, I'll hit it, you put that one, I don't like it, you know what it is, ah, now.

908
01:52:32,740 --> 01:52:33,420
Badrin.

909
01:52:33,420 --> 01:52:36,580
Honey, can I get this done in a minute?

910
01:52:36,580 --> 01:52:41,100
If you come out of the convenience store while walking, I will drink mineral water to fix it for you.

911
01:52:41,100 --> 01:52:46,200
Put your car keys there, put your car keys there.

912
01:52:46,200 --> 01:52:49,930
How can we call each other by our names when we are learning to drive?

913
01:52:49,930 --> 01:52:52,510
I'm gonna lose, I gave them that, no, to each their own.

914
01:52:52,510 --> 01:53:00,460
Although we have a name, we don’t have a group name. If you watch foreign movies, when people with super powers get together, the first name they give is Kidman.

915
01:53:00,460 --> 01:53:02,220
Sister, get up, that's it.

916
01:53:02,220 --> 01:53:03,870
Then say it in English, in Korean.

917
01:53:03,870 --> 01:53:07,760
Sister, you can choose the name yourself. Actually, I can come up with a better name.

918
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:12,510
No, let me build it, because it will be hard if it falls.

919
01:53:12,510 --> 01:53:13,980
Please charge.

920
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:19,720
I like this friendly feeling, like a greeting.

921
01:53:19,720 --> 01:53:21,170
It's just right now.

922
01:53:21,170 --> 01:53:23,040
A name flashed by.

923
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:26,960
Ah, because there are five of us, so five people say hello.

924
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:34,460
If you do it in English, I know that, I know what it is, uncle like this.

925
01:53:34,460 --> 01:53:35,980
You try it.

926
01:55:08,820 --> 01:55:13,980
We can go for a walk together.

927
01:55:16,420 --> 01:55:21,440
We just want a badge.

928
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:39,560
All that is said, let me give Orecca the love we're giving our family to our home.

929
01:55:59,780 --> 01:56:02,200
All my sisters were with me.

930
01:56:11,020 --> 01:56:42,320
Being alive is a joy and we will only share all the deals this world has to offer and I hope my hands are on our future goals and we know we won't give you our golden rule of what you will do, what you will not do and what you will not do, it's ours.

931
01:57:47,300 --> 01:57:50,600
I'm going to put a hole in your knee.

932
01:58:11,680 --> 01:58:13,980
Now you will only see me.
