1
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,150
Yes, yes, the expected arrival time is 20 minutes.

2
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,610
Donor condition is good

3
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,400
Hello? Hello?

4
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:45,570
Why isn't electricity working again?

5
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,620
This is a bit electric...

6
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,840
There is no problem with the documents and the donor committed suicide.

7
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,630
Oh my, why did you do that at such a young age?

8
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,760
So what I'm saying is

9
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,300
Where did you go, Odak, Odak

10
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,640
- Here we go.
- Oh, what a surprise.

11
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:09,350
hello

12
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,470
What's the status?

13
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,270
I think I need to take it out right now

14
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,020
What is that, a tattoo?

15
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,310
- Is that a tattoo?
- Tattoo

16
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,360
Where did you see it?

17
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,940
I saw that somewhere too

18
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:22,940
Where did I see it?

19
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,280
I think I've seen this in a history book somewhere .

20
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,740
Silence

21
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:28,280
It was someone's love

22
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:30,330
The donor who is someone's longing

23
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:32,450
Today, I will sow flowers of love on this land and leave...

24
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,040
Oh, it's an arm

25
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:40,550
No, what kind of body is that made of iron?

26
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,090
How many knives did you eat?

27
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,300
It's not like I have super powers
or anything.

28
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:46,180
Wow, surprise

29
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,140
Why? Why?

30
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,390
Why? Why? What?

31
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:49,720
- What? What?
- Ghost

32
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,680
Is there a rat?

33
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,350
Teacher, come out

34
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,390
- Don't come out
- Come out

35
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,440
- Don't come out, don't come out
- Come out quickly, come out!

36
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,150
No, spray water, water

37
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,860
Don't hold back, come out quickly

38
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,040
It really doesn't hurt, right?

39
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,170
How many times do I have to tell you that it doesn't hurt?

40
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,670
This can't be happening like this

41
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,960
I originally worked overtime too

42
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,220
I have to drool and do this

43
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,840
A stranger's heart came into my life

44
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,220
As soon as I got here I took a seat

45
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,850
This is awkward

46
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,100
Wouldn't it be better if it didn't hurt?

47
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,010
Okay

48
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,390
I hope it doesn't hurt

49
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,350
I think it might not be the case,
so I

50
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,940
So you're discharged, okay?

51
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,690
Well, if it doesn't hurt, then you should do it

52
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,280
What's that on your wrist?

53
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,780
Do you have a tattoo?

54
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,160
No, I

55
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,530
Is this a side effect of the surgery
or something?

56
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,490
Didn't you make any bad friends at the hospital
?

57
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,790
Where is my friend

58
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,750
Don't get angry and eat slowly

59
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,710
Look, my heart rate is over 90.

60
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:22,870
No, and

61
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,250
This kind of thing, this kind of thing

62
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,540
Don't buy it, it's expensive and
you don't have money.

63
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,340
Why doesn't Dad have any money? Huh?

64
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,470
If there's anything you want to do
or buy, just tell me.

65
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,010
- I have something I want to do
- Just say it.

66
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,760
- Should I try Taekwondo again?
- No.

67
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,680
Just tell me to talk

68
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,100
No, Taekwondo is absolutely not allowed,
it's dangerous.

69
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,600
The doctor said it was okay to run moderately

70
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,970
What does the doctor know, what does the father know?

71
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,140
What good was a heart transplant if you can't even run ?

72
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,100
If you want to do it right

73
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,690
Go to college and
do pilates or something

74
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,020
- Father
- Father

75
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,440
Just thinking about your heart stopping while you were playing a match

76
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,030
I pee myself even while I'm sleeping

77
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:53,490
Your mom too

78
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,070
Your mother also had a heart attack

79
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,330
Your grandfather also had a heart attack

80
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,540
If my child goes too

81
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,370
This father follows you

82
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,290
How can I live in this dirty world ?

83
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:13,010
Eternal life, eternal spring, new god descending

84
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,510
Eternal Immortal Transcendent Flesh

85
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,100
Eternal life, eternal spring, new god descending

86
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,730
Eternal Immortal Transcendent Flesh

87
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:25,270
Yes, my lord

88
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:26,730
therefore

89
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,480
The organ isn't a battery or anything

90
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,030
How many of these are there already?

91
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,110
This time the pancreas

92
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,450
Anyway, the good thing is that
my father will probably be leaving this time.

93
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:41,370
Anyway

94
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,580
I'll get rid of everything before the revival.

95
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,420
Don't try to lower the price

96
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,920
Eternal Immortal Transcendent Flesh

97
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,590
Eternal life, eternal spring, new god descending

98
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,300
Eternal Immortal Transcendent Flesh

99
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,680
Eternal life, eternal spring, new god descending

100
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,550
hungry

101
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,300
Go grill some meat

102
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,680
Eternal Immortal Transcendent Flesh

103
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,810
Eternal life, eternal spring, new god descending

104
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,140
Okay, be modest

105
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,060
Let's spread out to the world

106
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,530
- Father
- No

107
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,450
Do you know what it is?

108
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:18,490
Taekwondo is absolutely not allowed

109
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,120
No, that's not it

110
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:21,200
Did you run during gym class?

111
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,790
I've seen your heart rate go up

112
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:23,910
rendezvous

113
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,250
No, I didn't run

114
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,410
But why are the shoes like that?

115
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,370
rendezvous

116
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,290
Oh boy, really

117
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,960
If you keep doing this, I
might just throw it away.

118
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,960
Over there, father over there today

119
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,420
Because it's a designated driver day

120
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,880
Go in first

121
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,680
On the way, buy a new pair of sturdy shoes and wear them.

122
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,560
If I have money left,
I buy healthy food and eat it with my friends.

123
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,310
Okay, that's it for today.

124
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,980
- Where I have friends
- courtesy, courage, consideration

125
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:47,890
Taekwondo

126
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,060
Thank you for your effort

127
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:52,570
Jungpil was late today, so
he got 50 kicks as a penalty.

128
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:54,780
Taekwondo, brother

129
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,190
Oh,
why is the monthly rent 100,000 won?

130
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,070
I'm going to explain to you

131
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,240
Look at this little bastard, this

132
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,700
Hey, you little punk,
if you do that

133
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,660
Are you asking me to fight or to date?

134
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,910
When my sister was your age, she was like Inma

135
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,660
The 540 degree rotation axis is also spinning

136
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,660
Come out

137
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,960
Are you saying all this to make things better for you ?

138
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,790
Put the center of gravity right here

139
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,090
Looking straight at the target

140
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,430
Hey, Joongpil, is this what you did?

141
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,600
Why? What's going on?

142
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,560
father

143
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,650
A big guy has come into our dojo.

144
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,310
Oh, Taekwondo

145
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,230
Hey, grab it, hurry, hurry, hurry

146
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,690
Catch me, hey, catch me

147
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,740
- Sorry
- Oh, come quickly.

148
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,240
- Got it.
- Hey, what the hell is this?

149
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,700
At this point, I've caught it

150
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,740
Slow?

151
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,030
No

152
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,500
Oily thing

153
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,660
Director Song said it's not good for the pancreas...

154
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,660
ah

155
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,420
- Chunhwa-ya
- Yes, father.

156
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,880
Thank you for your hard work during this time .

157
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,090
sorry

158
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,300
no

159
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,760
I hope my father is healthy

160
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,430
The believers are blessed

161
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,220
- If my father lives, all things in the universe...
- Ah

162
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,430
People are really amazing

163
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:17,060
Even if you are lying in a coma with a respirator attached

164
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,770
These ears can hear very well.

165
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,440
When my father was alive

166
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,940
I said everything I could say

167
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:26,490
oh my

168
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:28,450
You must have heard all this, oh
my god

169
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,030
I'm talking

170
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,740
The dog of the dog fuck in the world
, I

171
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,920
By car

172
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,750
From the engine to the parts

173
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,630
It's like it's been replaced with a sports car

174
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,210
Is this what happens when you change one pancreas?

175
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,300
I think I'll change one too

176
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,680
So I think

177
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,720
I guess this is it

178
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,930
Doesn't the donor have a special constitution?

179
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,190
What about the donor?

180
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,650
Did you have any superpowers?

181
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,750
Kid, I told you not to do taekwondo.

182
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:23,040
Why do you keep
wearing a dobok? A dobok?

183
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,590
I wore it because it was comfortable, because it was comfortable

184
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,010
It's good for your heart to wear comfortable clothes

185
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,550
Did the doctor do it? Or didn't he?

186
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,550
Just wear it and never do taekwondo

187
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,050
Don't run, walk slowly

188
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,390
Oh, slowly

189
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,000
Sir, since last week

190
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,550
Did you come and go near our gym ?

191
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,970
What, is it Burberry? A stalker?
Love?

192
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,680
All three are crimes, but this one

193
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,720
Hey, arm

194
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,800
Hey, arm

195
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,430
Arm, arm

196
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,270
My heart is strong

197
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,150
I think I need to get a diagnosis

198
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,650
A middle school girl grabbed something and
a grown man grabbed it

199
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:30,240
Why does that middle school girl speak like that?

200
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,610
I was raised by my grandfather when I was learning to speak.

201
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,320
You still don't know what your abilities are ?

202
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:38,540
I thought this was the growth plate
opening up

203
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,950
Did you know this was a superpower?

204
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:40,910
Does your mom know?

205
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,830
I don't have a mom

206
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,380
Is your dad there?

207
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,290
I have a father

208
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,210
If you know this fact

209
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,050
After crying for 2 nights and 3 days, I fainted

210
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,510
My father is the one who will cause trouble.

211
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,800
I can never say

212
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,880
Well done

213
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:56,010
The original formula was to keep superpowers a secret.

214
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,180
So, sir, do you
have any secret superpowers?

215
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,740
Oh my, oh my

216
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:27,420
But who was the donor to
give him these abilities?

217
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,250
Did you know you can donate six organs?

218
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,170
I don't know

219
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,300
Heart, lungs, cornea, kidneys, liver, pancreas

220
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,630
You're saying there are four more people besides us ?

221
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,100
Well, if we find the rest of the transplants,
maybe we'll get some clues?

222
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,350
How do I find it?

223
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:42,520
The 17th
Life Sharing Transplant Sports Competition

224
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,310
It will be held at Seoul Park on the 10th.

225
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:49,270
The transplant sports competition, held every five years across the country,

226
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:52,780
Transplant families and
players participating in the game, etc.

227
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,990
About 100 people are expected to gather

228
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,280
Hwang Jae-won, the president of the transplant association,

229
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,990
Ahead of the full-scale competition...

230
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,750
Jump, jump

231
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,890
Oh, good job,
I had a successful corneal transplant.

232
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,060
You're running while looking at the line properly

233
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,350
Okay, the baton is passed.

234
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:07,890
1st place, cornea 1st place

235
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:09,980
heart

236
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,230
What are you doing now?

237
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,360
Heart last place

238
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,360
It shows the heart properly

239
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:21,570
Heart 1st place

240
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,420
Nike, oh

241
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,210
I just needed some shoes, really

242
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,840
Have you looked into it?

243
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,800
uh?

244
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,220
Oh, no, no

245
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,630
Hey, take this

246
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,260
Aeg, look it up carefully.

247
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:45,140
He just looks at his phone all day

248
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:47,020
Sir, don't you have any friends?

249
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,020
Why do you need friends?

250
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,440
Grab this one

251
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,310
No, just eat it

252
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,730
I had a kidney transplant

253
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,820
I'm so healthy

254
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,280
I'm giving this to you because I'm so, so grateful.

255
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:01,660
I like it in the market

256
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,240
thank you

257
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,990
What do you have?

258
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,910
If you are feeling unwell

259
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:09,750
This is with prebiotics and probiotics

260
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,710
Clear my stomach

261
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,250
Vitamin Vegetables

262
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:14,540
Ma'am, hold that arm

263
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,040
Arms?

264
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,260
Why, why?

265
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,180
Opposite arm

266
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,340
Why your arms?

267
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,050
Doesn't it taste like apples?

268
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,260
there is

269
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:29,020
But if you eat a lot of this, your stomach will hurt

270
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,350
Oh, we have our food too

271
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:31,350
There's also salad

272
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,190
Salads are
5% cheaper with regular delivery

273
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:35,020
Oh, let me show you here.

274
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,190
Uh, why, why?

275
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:39,610
I just got a heart

276
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:41,320
And I'm good at running too

277
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,110
I've become this strong

278
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:46,620
This man had a lung transplant

279
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:48,410
Show me

280
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,840
What is this, what is this, what is this?

281
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,220
Hey, Nogari

282
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:10,720
What is that?

283
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,520
What skills do you have, ma'am?

284
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,100
Oh, I

285
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,440
no

286
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,610
Has anything changed since you had the surgery?

287
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,490
I just don't know

288
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:23,610
People say their skin has improved

289
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,160
They all said I got prettier

290
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,330
Oh, really,
what do you think I'm pretty about, really?

291
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,120
Is this a superpower that makes you pretty?

292
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,250
These days, being pretty is a superpower.

293
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:35,330
Not to that extent

294
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,500
no

295
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,500
I came here pretending to buy yogurt.

296
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,710
Men ask for your number a lot.

297
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,630
It reminds me of my first love

298
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:42,590
I said no

299
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:43,720
bon appetite

300
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,720
The lady has a tattoo too, a tattoo

301
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,060
If you have a tattoo

302
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,680
The formula is to have superpowers

303
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,060
I guess you haven't discovered it yet

304
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,190
This guy is
a superpowered Dr. Chuck Chuck.

305
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,100
There's nothing I don't know

306
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,810
Originally, when these people with these abilities gathered together

307
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,320
You will also discover abilities you didn't know you had.

308
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,570
If you look for the rest
, you'll find it yourself.

309
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:03,940
How do I find the rest?

310
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:16,000
Park Wan-seo

311
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,250
heart transplant

312
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,290
Jindeok Middle School, Grade 3, Class 2

313
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,710
Taekwondo elementary school

314
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,840
From the five-crown champion

315
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,220
Future dream: To marry Do Kyung-soo

316
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,630
Is Do Kyung Soo bulletproof?

317
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,550
It's EXO

318
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,140
Ms. Kim Seon-nyeo, kidney transplant

319
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,060
75 years, rabbit?

320
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:33,970
Are you single?

321
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,940
You still have your first love on your face. What are you doing?

322
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:43,320
Park Ji-sung, lung transplant

323
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,110
- Occupation...
- Stop!

324
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,320
who are you?

325
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:50,490
This is Hwang Gi-dong

326
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,910
When you start, you start, when you start, you move

327
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,870
Hwang Gi-dong, I received a cornea

328
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:03,210
Mr. Kidong, how did you find us?

329
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:04,630
ah

330
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:08,090
Everyone has a tattoo, right?

331
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,470
If this comes within a few kilometers radius

332
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:13,430
It's shining brightly

333
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:18,140
I can't explain it because only I can see it

334
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,980
Then what did you do earlier, sir?

335
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:23,150
What,
you're dealing with electromagnetic waves, Wi-Fi, and stuff like that?

336
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,900
Something like this?

337
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,280
yes

338
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,370
Five hundred and one more glass

339
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,450
yes

340
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,540
That's great

341
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,500
Mr. Kidong is our superpower captain.

342
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,250
- What is the captain?
- The captain is looking for other people too.

343
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,130
Is it a military regime?

344
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,340
Hey, you said you have to be within a few meters to see it.

345
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,380
I know where you are

346
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,180
Then hack like before

347
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,600
- If you look at that movie...
- Hacking is what, a dictatorship?

348
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,810
What happens if you get caught spying on civilians?

349
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:59,230
In addition to violating the Privacy Protection Act and
the Information and Communication Network Act

350
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,350
Leaking personal information and even defamation

351
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,190
You don't know that they're all connected

352
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,980
No, he said he would find it first

353
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,240
So, the method
is not fair, the method is not fair.

354
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,190
Are you doing this because it's annoying?

355
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,200
I'm busy so I won't do that

356
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,530
Sir, you don't have a job.

357
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,740
- Who said that?
- What do you do for a living?

358
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,700
Writer, write a screenplay

359
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:19,700
What are you writing?

360
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,170
- Hero
- Look

361
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,210
It ends next week

362
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,000
Oh, you like heroes.

363
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,920
So you know the community there?

364
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,510
Ukki, among us

365
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,550
There's a lot of hero material there.

366
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,050
- We like each other.
- Yes.

367
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,510
There are a lot of local Japanese pirates there.

368
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,140
Are you a slob?

369
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,890
You're a communist

370
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:40,930
somehow

371
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,060
Let's not mix words

372
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,230
'Oh my god' is almost like informal speech, but
how old are you?

373
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,610
- 88
- I'm 87?

374
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:47,110
- Me quick
- quick what month?

375
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,110
Fast April

376
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,820
April is so fast

377
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,820
Isn't that the national rule?

378
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,450
What is the basis for saying that it is not a national rule?

379
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:53,820
What is the argument that needs to be supported?

380
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,580
Oh my, why are you guys like this,
on such a nice day

381
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,700
If you receive new life in one body

382
00:20:58,790 --> 00:20:59,870
We should live like family

383
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,760
mister

384
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,260
We decided to give the chicken a yen bun

385
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:18,850
Oh my, my, Yoranta

386
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:21,270
What kind of show are you showing me this time?

387
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,930
These poor souls

388
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,650
Would you like to offer up your liver and gallbladder?

389
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,820
It's expensive now
, if that's the case

390
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:31,940
I'll look elsewhere

391
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,490
Pseudo in Korea

392
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:35,950
You know it's overflowing?

393
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,420
There are all kinds of things

394
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,210
I'm out

395
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:39,180
Eternal life, eternal spring, new god descending

396
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:41,810
Heaven and Earth, the Second Coming of the Spirit

397
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:44,600
Happy Resurrection, New God

398
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,690
A busy person has arrived, my lord

399
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,310
If you are good, can you save at least one more poor soul ?

400
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,690
I have to learn from the new god.

401
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:54,440
Why is it in my ears

402
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:56,360
I heard you came to steal it.

403
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:59,240
I hurt my ear when I was young

404
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:01,530
I'm sorry you didn't hear me correctly

405
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,200
No, no

406
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,500
My ears can hear very well.

407
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,710
How much does it cost, my daughter?

408
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:14,460
What if I hand over all the foundations?

409
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,970
Oh, still

410
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:20,140
The pharmaceutical company says it won't hand it over.

411
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,510
It's a business that my father
started from the beginning.

412
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,270
You are a filial daughter, my daughter

413
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:27,890
Byungchun-ah

414
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:31,810
There has been no filial son or daughter in my family for generations.

415
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,610
Blood is greedy

416
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:38,070
I called for a 45 head allowance

417
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,900
I'll give you 50 each

418
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,320
If you pass it before the revival meeting

419
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:42,530
My ear hurt

420
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,530
I got hurt because of you

421
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,250
When there was a tea ceremony show at Jeongseon Market

422
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:48,290
You hit it wrong

423
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:49,460
550 thousand won

424
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:52,830
So you get beaten by me like a dog

425
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,340
I shit my pants

426
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,880
That day, I sold a lot of medicine.

427
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,340
Stop it, bro

428
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:01,970
A guy who follows a pharmacist around and ends up taking a dump

429
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:04,350
Looks like you really think you're a spirit

430
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,060
Fuck, stop it

431
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,680
This herbal medicine is a cub

432
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:10,440
Stop talking shit, you piece of shit

433
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,230
It was cheap, after all

434
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:16,320
What the fuck

435
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:53,100
Come on, take her out now

436
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,680
Yeah, put it in, put it in, just put it in

437
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,180
5 minutes left for lunch

438
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,730
Everyone must take their positions 5 minutes before

439
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:35,940
You can work at the exact time

440
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:39,150
Accurate time
keeps us safe

441
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:40,190
Wear a hard hat.

442
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,360
There are still 3 minutes left

443
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:46,030
Users
cannot be forced to work overtime.

444
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:49,870
Didn't you know that this is a violation of the Labor Standards Act ?

445
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,580
Mr. Seunghoon Lee knows the law so well

446
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,660
Why are you doing this here, prosecutor ?

447
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,670
I'm telling you not to discriminate against contract workers.

448
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,290
Even if he is not a contract worker, he is the president.

449
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,250
If you had kept your break time

450
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:00,210
I know how to keep to business hours .

451
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,800
This foundation is the one that doesn't keep what it should keep.

452
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,470
Ask them to set a date for a revival meeting or something.

453
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:07,140
Safety equipment is lacking for working overtime on fictional days.

454
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,180
If something happens like this,
will the captain come save me?

455
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,890
That leader is a human being who saved me...

456
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,770
A human being who cannot be saved and
will end up in hellfire

457
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:14,980
How dare you
bring up the name of the new father!

458
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:28,870
Why is it like this?

459
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:29,910
Fell from above

460
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:31,410
I see

461
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,370
No, I told you several times to replace it , really.

462
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,580
Are you answering the phone?

463
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:09,740
When are people coming?

464
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,160
Mr. Choi said he would contact me

465
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,110
I told you I saw it

466
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:48,820
Why can't I trust what people say?

467
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,280
It's not that I don't believe it

468
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,370
In medical terms, that's
called sudopsia.

469
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:55,540
When you get excited and dopamine is secreted,

470
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,740
No, no

471
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,080
I wasn't even excited and I saw it properly

472
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,420
How to wake up as soon as possible

473
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,630
Aren't you just looking for meat that you can't even catch ?

474
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:04,290
Hwang Shin-ryeong, that gentleman

475
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,800
He grabbed me by the collar and my white hair suddenly fell out

476
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,760
That tree too...

477
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:11,550
- What we talked about then?
- Yes?

478
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,970
The person who gave the organ

479
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:15,180
Did you say you have a special constitution?

480
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,810
The opinion is that it may be a special constitution.

481
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:19,310
People who have received organ transplants

482
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:22,020
Isn't there more?

483
00:28:58,850 --> 00:28:59,850
One more time

484
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:18,200
Oh, I see the pollen is flying somewhere.

485
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:20,290
Should I stop?

486
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:21,790
Oh, just do it

487
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:23,080
Since I'm doing it

488
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:30,590
It's the weekend. Aren't you going anywhere?

489
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,300
Don't you have any friends?

490
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,590
I have no friends

491
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:35,930
why?

492
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,350
Because of your father?

493
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,270
No, that's that too

494
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,390
I took a year off because I was sick, so
I don't have any friends.

495
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:46,810
I know

496
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,860
When you're sick, you don't say you're sick

497
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,900
If you don't get sick, you won't get sick, my friend.

498
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,320
The original superpower's friend is loneliness

499
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,210
- Do you know that?
- I don't know.

500
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:06,960
- Do you know what it is?
- What is it?

501
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,920
The villain is

502
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,960
Among the same superpowered people

503
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:16,220
And why do you attack other superpowered people
?

504
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,840
You want to have all the superpowers by yourself?

505
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:20,640
So we
have to find the villain first.

506
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,600
Before my powers are taken away

507
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,560
- Us?
- Yes, we.

508
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:27,560
Originally, people with superpowers
were friends with other people with superpowers.

509
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:29,270
Rich people hang out with other rich people.

510
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,730
Sir, try this

511
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,280
- Why?
- Try it.

512
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:40,700
mister

513
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:42,740
If you get caught by the villain, just say something

514
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,620
I told you I'd save our entire team.

515
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,330
Wanseo student!

516
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:52,130
however

517
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,210
How do you recognize this villain?

518
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,630
You'll know when you see it

519
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:58,300
Just looking at it

520
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,470
This kid is a villain

521
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,520
Oh, only you knew

522
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,730
I ate two chicken wings each.

523
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:09,100
Wanseo student, Mr. Jisung

524
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:11,060
Ah, I found it, I found it

525
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,110
I found out what my superpower is

526
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,070
Take a look

527
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:15,610
Look, look

528
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,490
Knock knock knock knock knock knock

529
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:33,290
Do I have no superpowers?

530
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,510
Why am I the only one with tattoos?

531
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:37,840
It's plump like a swollen scar

532
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,390
Why do you want superpowers, ma'am ?

533
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:44,930
If you have superpowers,
you can save people and things like that.

534
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:46,140
Like a hero

535
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,180
Not everyone with superpowers becomes a hero.

536
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:49,850
why?

537
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,020
Experience

538
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,270
positiveness

539
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,860
Number of people saved

540
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:59,070
There is a cutoff line for this depending on the level of self-sacrifice.

541
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,700
What, any hero?

542
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:03,570
Hey, I
don't really like cut lines

543
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,120
No, is he coming or not? Huh?

544
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:08,330
What, you found it with that clever hack
?

545
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,370
I don't know, ask when you come

546
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,580
If you eat a lot of that, your stomach will hurt.

547
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,750
Even if you show up, you'll show up late

548
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:16,340
I'm young too

549
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,630
Leave a message or something

550
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:19,920
uh?

551
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,230
I will return your money.

552
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:34,480
돈이 문제가 아니고
이 개새끼야, 어?

553
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,440
How can you hit the jackpot
eleven times in one place, eleven times?

554
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:39,110
I think that machine is broken.
What should I do?

555
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,190
Take off your glasses

556
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,450
No, I don't think this is broken

557
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:43,950
It's not that I didn't, but I compensated...

558
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:45,370
You're sitting there talking like you're getting paid
, bro.

559
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:46,450
I see your fingers, this one, this one

560
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:48,580
If you bounce this, you'll hit the jackpot

561
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,290
What are you, Pikachu? Do you create static electricity?

562
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:51,870
I'm not Pikachu, this is

563
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,960
It's a superpower

564
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,090
Oh, this is totally funny

565
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,880
You should contact our Yonggu hyung .

566
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:04,340
I just sent you a text message right now

567
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,150
That, that, that needs to be pushed

568
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,490
I heard that if you eat a lot of that,
your stomach will hurt

569
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:28,160
I ate five of them

570
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,120
Where did you go?

571
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:31,790
Oh, hey, middle school students aren't allowed in

572
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:32,710
This isn't a PC room

573
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:34,790
I'm originally a high school student, but
I took a year off.

574
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:37,170
I'm a high school student and
I'm not from a PC room, right?

575
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,960
Auntie, I don't eat yogurt.
My stomach hurts.

576
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:41,840
I'm not here to sell yogurt .

577
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,300
I came here to take that young man with me.

578
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,550
So this bachelor

579
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:46,340
I'm telling you, he's not the kind of bachelor you can just take with you !

580
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:48,100
This bachelor
is causing a ruckus in the store...

581
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:50,060
But
how did I contact you if you don't have a cell phone?

582
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,430
hey

583
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,060
There is no toilet paper.

584
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:54,890
there

585
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:04,610
It's far away

586
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:08,490
- Are you a friend?
- No.

587
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:09,620
mister

588
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,080
Send that guy away

589
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,580
My father is a Taekwondo master.

590
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,540
My dad has a criminal record, right?

591
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,500
Didn't you hear a single thing I said earlier ?

592
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:19,590
This guy just
trashed the store

593
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:20,840
This old man is suffering a huge loss...

594
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,010
The person who caused the accident should pay for the damages.

595
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:24,050
We're not even friends

596
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:26,340
That person has no friends.

597
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:28,890
You should get a really good scolding, really

598
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,300
Can't use

599
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:31,220
no

600
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:32,850
We're going to eat ribs

601
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:34,890
When you feel like you've been scolded and
become a new person, come here

602
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:35,810
Or go

603
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:36,940
I go my own way

604
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,730
Please don't do that

605
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:41,570
Just let it go, okay?

606
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,030
Oh, I

607
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,570
I'll give you one of these as a service.

608
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,950
Did these gentlemen really
understand what I was saying as shit?

609
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:51,620
I heard you have stomach trouble

610
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,470
Beef ribs? Pork ribs?

611
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:20,860
It's been about 10 minutes since I went in.

612
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,270
How did all four of you get together?

613
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:28,030
It took exactly 4 minutes and 28 seconds, bro.

614
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:45,130
slowly

615
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:49,930
Tayo

616
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:51,010
Hey, hey, hey, hey

617
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:53,970
Hey, Inma

618
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,730
Ma, call them, call them

619
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:00,690
Huh?

620
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:01,940
Agga is coming?

621
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,110
Save me

622
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,570
I see

623
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,240
Hey, catch me

624
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,000
What is that?

625
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,000
Hey, try to overtake me

626
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:29,630
Oh, that, that, that

627
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,000
What should I do?

628
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:04,920
Step further!

629
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,430
Wanseo student!

630
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:40,540
Run, run, robot

631
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:53,840
oh my god

632
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:03,850
Downswing

633
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,840
Stop! You guys! Stop! You guys!

634
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:43,720
Isn't our tow truck funny?

635
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:45,680
This guy is the furious driver of the tow truck world

636
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:46,770
You today...

637
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:48,650
Sneeze, you, you sneeze

638
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,520
You little shit, sneeze

639
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:53,280
Take off your glasses and eyebrows!

640
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:07,210
Brother, brother

641
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:09,000
In front, in front, brother

642
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:13,750
Oh, dirty

643
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:27,100
Stop!

644
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,030
There are 4 people

645
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:42,950
I ate well

646
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,580
Unlimited refills, this is worth eating

647
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,870
Who made me go through all this trouble?

648
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,370
You don't even calculate, really

649
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:52,880
If someone saw
you, they'd think you did the math.

650
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,550
- 'You' is informal speech?
- It's a pseudo-formal speech?

651
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:56,050
Stop fighting

652
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:57,340
Friends with super powers

653
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,340
What about friends

654
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:01,470
Is this person
going to keep hanging out with me?

655
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:04,010
Then you can hack it and find it if you
have the ability.

656
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:07,140
You can't do it so you don't do it?
You can't do it because it's illegal.

657
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:09,730
A gentleman with such a strong sense of law-abiding spirit

658
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:12,230
Why did you plagiarize someone else's scenario ?

659
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:14,980
Did you hack me?

660
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:16,070
Yeah, I did

661
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:18,070
Because you kept saying 'justice, justice'

662
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,280
I took a peek

663
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,860
What is the author

664
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,910
I just sold one scenario

665
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,740
I stole something from my friend

666
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:26,370
So you don't have any friends

667
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:43,390
This kid is a famous malicious commenter

668
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,600
How many times have you been sued?

669
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,020
A very evil bastard who gives movie ratings without even watching them

670
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,680
No, this is a beggar

671
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:51,810
Did you know that your coin is now cut in half ?

672
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,650
80,000 won left, hey

673
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,690
You have to earn money by sweating to
be fair

674
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:01,400
Your mom who works as a housekeeper in someone else's house
to pay for coins

675
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:03,490
- Isn't it pitiful?
- Sir, don't do it, okay?

676
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:04,620
If I were you, I would commit suicide

677
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,370
Why are you talking like that?

678
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,290
There are things to say and things not to say.

679
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,250
Suicide?

680
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,500
Go, Mr. Ji Sung, hold on

681
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:18,880
What are you holding back?
Come out, sir.

682
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,090
- Hey, let go.
- Oh, really, why are we like this?

683
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:23,380
We decided to be friends

684
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:24,760
Hey, I played with this because I felt bad for it

685
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,930
Do you think we
're even real friends?

686
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:30,430
Hey, come to work

687
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,080
Why are you guys like this, seriously

688
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,870
If it's going to be like this, let's not meet anymore

689
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:19,060
Why didn't you answer the phone?

690
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:20,360
Where have you been, huh?

691
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,400
Why is this happening again?

692
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,530
Who were you with?

693
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:25,780
Were you with your friends?

694
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:27,870
I don't have any friends

695
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:29,910
What have you been doing alone up until now?

696
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:30,910
Who's your friend, tell me your number

697
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:31,830
I don't have any friends

698
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:34,710
I know what happened to you,
I'm the police station, the hospital.

699
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:36,870
I'll take care of everything, even the funeral!

700
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:39,540
I
searched everything, even the mortuary! I!

701
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:41,040
A child who is not even healthy right now

702
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:42,210
When you hang out with friends and stuff?

703
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:43,840
Oh, really

704
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,050
I don't have any friends

705
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:47,760
I don't have any friends

706
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:49,970
There's no one

707
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:52,060
They all just hate me

708
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:54,430
I'm just a useless being

709
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,770
If I knew how to live like this

710
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:57,850
I wish I had just died right then

711
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,230
Hey! Why are you dying!

712
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:00,400
Oh, really

713
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,360
I feel suffocated because of my father

714
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:05,900
It's not because my heart hurts

715
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:08,410
I think I'll stop because of my father

716
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:10,240
Am I a dog?

717
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,910
Why do I put on a dog collar, why?

718
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:17,460
I'm so
frustrated because of my father that I feel like I could die

719
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,670
I don't need a father

720
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:26,840
Wanseoya

721
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:28,970
Wanseo, Wanseo

722
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:30,220
Don't run

723
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:31,390
Slip

724
00:43:58,330 --> 00:44:00,000
Have a cup of tea and go.

725
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,550
Stop bringing that kind of stuff now.

726
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:11,300
sorry

727
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:14,640
I heard you had a kidney transplant

728
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,060
I hope it went well

729
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:19,480
Your face looks better

730
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,860
Look how much better your skin has become

731
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,110
Your wife is like a girl

732
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:32,950
You took two human lives.

733
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:34,370
You have to get better

734
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:35,830
Isn't that right?

735
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,250
I was wrong

736
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:42,880
The rest of my life

737
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:44,460
The rest of my life

738
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:46,380
Doing good things

739
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:49,130
Things my husband couldn't do

740
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:51,930
Save a lot of people

741
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:55,050
I wish the lady
would just kill herself again instead of living.

742
00:44:56,050 --> 00:44:58,770
I hope you don't fail this time
and succeed for sure.

743
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:00,770
I'm going to suffocate and die for no reason.

744
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:04,060
Don't make a fool of yourself die like my husband .

745
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:06,480
I wish the lady would die

746
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:22,580
Let's do this

747
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:24,290
what...

748
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,040
Let's study this and develop new drugs.

749
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:28,590
What are you talking about...

750
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:30,050
Director Song's retirement

751
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:31,380
About 3 years left?

752
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,430
It's been 3 years and 4 months.

753
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:34,760
After I retire

754
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:37,390
Do you want to change your grandchildren's diapers?

755
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:39,350
Do you want to be the vice president of a pharmaceutical company?

756
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:41,020
yes?

757
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,730
In our country too

758
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:47,020
It's about time the Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded.

759
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:48,440
But still, how...

760
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:52,780
What do you think will happen?

761
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:54,030
Why did you come?

762
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:56,110
Are you really not going to see it?

763
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:57,950
The lady said, "Stop watching."

764
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:00,120
Let's find the villain, sir.

765
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:03,210
We've already found the villain
, so let's stop looking now.

766
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,210
no way

767
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:09,090
Hey, this guy, this guy,
he's not a villain.

768
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:11,050
A bit of a nerd style?

769
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:13,470
It's not that kid,
it's me that's the villain, I

770
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:16,430
You know because you've been hurt too

771
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:18,800
If your body is twisted,
your mind will also be twisted

772
00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:21,060
Then I don't even want to see those guys who are so talented

773
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:24,230
I hate seeing myself hiding behind those people I
hate and swearing at them.

774
00:46:24,430 --> 00:46:25,690
A guy who originally has nothing and
has nothing

775
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:27,230
Being a villain is the formula

776
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:29,860
But you have super powers, don't you?

777
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:32,990
What are you going to do with this?

778
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:37,280
If you're going to be born , be born properly like that kid .

779
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,280
What kind of superpower is this? It's incompetence.

780
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:40,990
Is it like this?

781
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:43,290
I'm
like this because I'm like this

782
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,550
I didn't plagiarize the scenario

783
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:53,170
We were originally going to write together

784
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:54,800
He went out and said he would use something else

785
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:55,720
Oh, okay

786
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,510
mister

787
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:01,760
Are you really playing with me because you feel sorry for me?

788
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:03,720
That's canceled

789
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,440
Go to the fairy lady and
apologize to her.

790
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:10,190
Go there and have the old man do it himself.

791
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:12,570
Where is it?

792
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:14,320
Liver transplant, found

793
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:16,070
Team 7 leader

794
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:18,240
These people
aren't even our believers right now.

795
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,620
If we do things like safety and treatment improvement ,

796
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:22,410
I can't finish it until the revival day.

797
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:24,410
When I was there, there was no line
, just 50th and 60th floors.

798
00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:25,830
I was just going up, just like that

799
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:26,790
Safety first

800
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:29,080
The new father
spoke directly

801
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:30,000
therefore

802
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,540
What safety equipment does the new father need to inspect ?

803
00:47:33,170 --> 00:47:34,550
Because everyone doesn't have that faith

804
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:36,090
It's not that I'm doing this because I'm scared

805
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:37,010
Let's eat

806
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:38,050
District Chief

807
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:40,800
There are still 15 minutes left, lunch time.

808
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:43,260
Let's eat something

809
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:44,310
What kind of robots are we?

810
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:45,640
How can I finish this all in one day
?

811
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:46,680
Robot, robot

812
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:47,930
Come and eat

813
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,900
If I want to finish this today

814
00:47:50,310 --> 00:47:51,730
I have to see someone fall

815
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:52,730
no way

816
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,480
When you come, please bring me a cup of ramen.

817
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:56,690
okay

818
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:57,650
yes

819
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,200
Don't come, don't come

820
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:05,790
Look, read and chew

821
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:07,660
What else do you do when you come? You'll probably get oxygen or something.

822
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:10,250
Anyway, I have a useless
ability

823
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:11,670
It's crooked, man.

824
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:14,500
Sorry about that

825
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:16,420
I'll go first

826
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:17,800
Come and meet us

827
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:19,130
why?

828
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,720
Auntie, you want to find superpowers?

829
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,680
I'm sorry, student Wanseo

830
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:25,720
I am

831
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:27,890
Not qualified

832
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:29,350
Where is that?

833
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:33,060
We decided to find superpowers together and become heroes, right?

834
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:36,270
Mr. Kidong

835
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:38,490
Did you take a look too?

836
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,740
I'm not qualified

837
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:44,320
Oh, well,
I didn't look at it in that much detail.

838
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:48,040
Use your precious skills for good.

839
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,410
Thank you for your help

840
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:54,710
I don't do it either

841
00:48:55,710 --> 00:48:56,960
I really hate you, Mr. Lee

842
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,510
In a world where it's hard to make a living

843
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:03,050
What kind of superhero are you and
what are you going to do to help others?

844
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:04,930
Disbanded as of today

845
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:06,180
The group chat room also exploded

846
00:49:16,310 --> 00:49:17,570
Because I said it was nothing

847
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:18,980
Don't be nervous

848
00:49:19,070 --> 00:49:20,240
What are you doing?

849
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,440
Can't you hear the sound?

850
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:22,360
Get out quickly, get out quickly

851
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:23,700
I said it was nothing a little while ago

852
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:25,530
If the district chief
is guarding the place

853
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:27,660
Do you think the district chief will take responsibility if you die ?

854
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:29,870
Go out, quickly

855
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:32,160
In two lines, in two lines

856
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:33,120
Slowly, slowly

857
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:46,760
Where do you get this from?

858
00:49:55,350 --> 00:49:56,270
Get out quickly!

859
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:00,860
No, are you doing okay? Yes?

860
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:02,530
Oh my, I don't know, me too

861
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:08,870
Mr. Seunghoon Lee?

862
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:09,910
Mr. Lee Seung-hoon

863
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:12,450
Here, here, here, here

864
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:13,540
Here, here, here

865
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:14,540
Mr. Lee Seung-hoon

866
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:16,080
Please save me, Captain

867
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:20,130
But isn't this the place we came here before?

868
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:22,960
Please save me

869
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:24,050
Mr. Lee Seung-hoon

870
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:26,640
Wear a hard hat, wear a hard hat!

871
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:42,320
Sir, get out of the way

872
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:22,570
No, ma'am

873
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,900
There's someone inside

874
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:26,900
- Mr. Kidong, open the door!
- Just a moment.

875
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:28,320
- Mr. Kido, hurry.
- It's dangerous if you go in...

876
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:29,570
Oh, open it, okay?

877
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:30,530
Open it

878
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:43,090
I'm sorry about that time

879
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:54,720
Don't you have anything like water glasses here?

880
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:56,560
I can't see it at all because of the smoke

881
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,100
Hey, turn this song off

882
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:01,560
Mr. Kidong

883
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:02,610
Oh, I do

884
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,200
Oh, I found it

885
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:18,960
I'll give you directions, come in and come back.

886
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,290
Who are you to tell me
to come in?

887
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,420
I told you I'd be a human navigator

888
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,750
If you have navigation,
you can go in

889
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,380
Oh, are you crazy? What if we fight?

890
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:30,220
No, I asked him to open the door so
he opened it for me.

891
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:32,010
You asked me to tell you the way
, so I told you.

892
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:33,510
What more can I do for you, sir?

893
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:34,720
I'm not asking you to do anything more

894
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,260
I'm telling you not to tell me to do this or that.

895
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:37,390
Don't tell me to do this or that

896
00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:39,060
Who is telling me to do this and that now?

897
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:40,310
Where did you put the persimmon, where did you put the pear

898
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:41,390
It's not "Put the persimmon away, put the pear away"

899
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:42,850
I'm telling you not to tell me to do this or that.

900
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:44,440
I just told you not to tell me to do this or that .

901
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,400
Hey, you fucking two-faced bastards!

902
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,360
Whenever we make eye contact,
we start to giggle

903
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,740
쌍으로 지랄 염병들이야
이 미친 새끼들

904
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:53,240
Aren't you going to find it quickly?

905
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,540
Sir, please tell me the way.

906
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:10,840
Oh! Left, left

907
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:11,760
Just a little more

908
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:13,550
Boy, I don't understand what you're saying.

909
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:16,140
No, no, that's right, uh

910
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:17,810
Go straight, go straight

911
00:53:17,890 --> 00:53:18,810
Yeah, there!

912
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:21,560
uh?

913
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:31,900
Oh, Mr. Lee Seung-hoon

914
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:34,200
are you okay?

915
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,200
- This way, this way, this way
- Are you okay? What should I do?

916
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:39,790
Mr. Lee Seung-hoon

917
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:42,410
Hey, hey, hey
Seunghoon, come to your senses

918
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,230
mister

919
00:54:12,570 --> 00:54:13,530
water

920
00:54:14,030 --> 00:54:15,110
What, water?

921
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:16,780
Quick, water!

922
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:17,740
Oh, water, water

923
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:19,660
- Water, water
- water

924
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:20,580
water

925
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:23,500
Oh, what should I do?

926
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:26,000
Water, water

927
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:27,540
oh my god

928
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:30,000
Don't just stay still, do something

929
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,910
What is it, ma'am? Huh?

930
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:17,880
Where? Where to?

931
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:21,930
Stop!

932
00:55:23,010 --> 00:55:23,930
uh?

933
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:25,850
Where is Mr. Kidong?

934
00:55:29,350 --> 00:55:30,980
I'm not going anywhere

935
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:32,520
When you ask me to bring you water and ask where I am,

936
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:33,730
Do you know where I am?

937
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:35,690
There is a water purifier

938
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:37,740
Well, there's a poster of some superhero or something.

939
00:55:55,630 --> 00:55:57,550
Then,
sir, you go out first.

940
00:55:59,470 --> 00:56:00,590
Oh my, over there

941
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:03,010
If it's a poster in the water purifier,
I'm not the one, so let's go together

942
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:05,640
Sir,
please take this guy outside.

943
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,020
Okay, okay

944
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:07,930
This way

945
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:12,360
Yeah, yeah

946
00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:13,570
This way

947
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:02,660
Just a hundred more meters to go

948
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:05,200
There's no gas masks or anything like that at this construction site
?

949
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,040
sorry

950
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:10,660
No, but I saw earlier that
there were a lot of things like tanks here.

951
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:12,330
Don't you have anything like an oxygen tank?

952
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Here we go, oxygen tank

953
00:57:26,850 --> 00:57:27,970
Not you

954
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:57,270
My name is Heoyakseon

955
00:58:57,350 --> 00:58:58,900
I had a liver transplant

956
00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:01,150
Curing the underlying disease

957
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:02,230
I said yes or no

958
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:03,530
Due to a simple accident

959
00:59:03,610 --> 00:59:06,360
Fractures, contusions, frozen shoulder, chronic fatigue

960
00:59:06,450 --> 00:59:09,910
I can fix things like this , of course.

961
00:59:09,990 --> 00:59:12,200
Hey, please let me know when you need it

962
00:59:13,830 --> 00:59:15,870
Oh, so you're a designated driver too?

963
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,000
My father does it too

964
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:18,290
I saw it earlier

965
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:21,290
It seems like the teacher takes away things like other people getting hurt.

966
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:22,210
it's okay

967
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:25,090
I'm fine if I drink a glass of water like this

968
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:26,510
really

969
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:29,970
Teacher, people like
you are truly heroes.

970
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:31,100
Isn't that right?

971
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:32,010
clap

972
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:33,810
Applause

973
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:35,890
- Ma'am
- Yes?

974
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:37,310
In my opinion

975
00:59:37,390 --> 00:59:39,480
Madam you are a true hero

976
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:41,520
Please save my life

977
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:43,480
Thank you very much

978
00:59:53,530 --> 00:59:54,370
what?

979
00:59:54,450 --> 00:59:55,370
- What?
- What what?

980
00:59:55,450 --> 00:59:56,660
I don't know what you're talking about

981
00:59:56,750 --> 00:59:58,580
Oh, don't cry, ma'am.

982
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:00,920
You were swearing at each other just now,
why are you crying? It doesn't suit you.

983
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,420
This is scarier

984
01:00:04,630 --> 01:00:06,210
No, actually, I used to

985
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:09,010
I have depression and
intermittent explosive disorder.

986
01:00:09,090 --> 01:00:10,340
I just took some medicine

987
01:00:10,430 --> 01:00:12,680
And then after the surgery, I
got healthy again

988
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:14,640
I thought things were really getting better now

989
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:16,470
I thought swearing was a superpower

990
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:17,560
Oh

991
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:20,190
Oh, I forgot everything that happened earlier

992
01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:22,150
Shall we each name each other?

993
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:23,150
Among heroes?

994
01:00:23,230 --> 01:00:24,480
What name are you going to give it, again?

995
01:00:24,570 --> 01:00:26,030
Oh, why, when I watch foreign movies

996
01:00:26,110 --> 01:00:28,070
Each hero
has their own name.

997
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:30,110
What kind of man and woman are you?

998
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:33,240
Then I'm
strong now and I save people

999
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:34,370
How about saving it?

1000
01:00:34,450 --> 01:00:35,910
Begging in short?

1001
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:37,040
Are you okay?

1002
01:00:38,370 --> 01:00:39,460
Nine in English

1003
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:40,370
It's me

1004
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:43,130
Because you are an oxygen tank

1005
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:44,630
I'm a tank boy, I'm a tank boy

1006
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:46,550
What are you going to do, ma'am?

1007
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:48,840
Oh, I'm originally a fresh manager

1008
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:50,840
So I was trying to do fresh girl

1009
01:00:50,930 --> 01:00:52,550
Is it a bit too much to walk?

1010
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:55,510
No, but Fresh is
better than Fresh Woman

1011
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:57,970
Fresh girl is so cute in your mouth,
right?

1012
01:00:58,060 --> 01:00:58,890
Just do it

1013
01:00:59,310 --> 01:01:00,350
You don't have to call me

1014
01:01:03,150 --> 01:01:05,480
The teacher's
last name is Yakja, Seonja

1015
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:06,400
yes

1016
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:08,030
I guess it'll work if you give it a try

1017
01:01:08,110 --> 01:01:09,490
Hands are healing hands

1018
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,660
Oh, Mr. Kidong's name is Kidong

1019
01:01:13,950 --> 01:01:14,870
Bluetooth Man

1020
01:01:14,950 --> 01:01:16,330
That, wifi, that thing

1021
01:01:16,410 --> 01:01:17,870
Oh, good, good

1022
01:01:17,950 --> 01:01:19,000
Hey, begging

1023
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:21,250
Are you really bad at studying?

1024
01:01:21,330 --> 01:01:23,620
My father just told me to stay healthy.

1025
01:01:23,710 --> 01:01:25,000
Oh, over there

1026
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:26,750
I am that fact

1027
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:29,380
Well, I have a name in mind.

1028
01:01:29,590 --> 01:01:33,300
Because I heal people and
replenish their stamina.

1029
01:01:33,970 --> 01:01:35,090
Battery Man

1030
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,890
Well, since everyone speaks in English,
there is a sense of unity.

1031
01:01:38,970 --> 01:01:41,100
Yeah, good, battery

1032
01:01:41,890 --> 01:01:43,600
Okay, we've all decided on a name today.

1033
01:01:43,690 --> 01:01:44,940
The atmosphere must be like that too

1034
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:46,020
Bluesman

1035
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:48,570
It suits the mood today

1036
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:49,860
Music Cue

1037
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:53,650
This is so cool

1038
01:01:53,740 --> 01:01:54,910
No, but sir, sir

1039
01:01:54,990 --> 01:01:56,820
This is really amazing.
Just take a look.

1040
01:01:57,990 --> 01:01:58,830
Action

1041
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:07,340
and!

1042
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:12,130
One more time

1043
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:13,630
stop

1044
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:27,560
Where have you been?

1045
01:02:28,230 --> 01:02:29,150
I met a friend

1046
01:02:30,070 --> 01:02:31,030
You don't have any friends?

1047
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:32,320
I made a friend

1048
01:02:33,490 --> 01:02:34,400
Can you help me?

1049
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:36,110
What power do you have?

1050
01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:39,700
Get out of the way because you'll get hurt

1051
01:02:46,830 --> 01:02:47,830
Did you see it?

1052
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,590
Dad, is it still usable, huh?

1053
01:02:49,670 --> 01:02:51,670
- It's useful
- Because it's useful

1054
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:55,340
If anything happens,
leave it to your father.

1055
01:02:55,420 --> 01:02:56,550
- Huh?
- Father

1056
01:02:56,630 --> 01:02:59,390
Even if you
become a hunchbacked old woman,

1057
01:03:00,350 --> 01:03:02,560
Just shout 'Dad'

1058
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:04,810
He showed up like a hero!

1059
01:03:04,890 --> 01:03:06,350
I'll solve it all

1060
01:03:09,110 --> 01:03:10,440
If you catch a cold, it's bad for your heart.

1061
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:13,730
I have to go to the hospital tomorrow, so
I'm going to bed early.

1062
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:16,650
Our new hospital

1063
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:20,320
With the hope that the patients will be healthy and recover quickly

1064
01:03:20,910 --> 01:03:24,410
We are always focusing the capabilities of all medical staff.

1065
01:03:25,450 --> 01:03:27,420
Sorry,
please take the next elevator.

1066
01:03:28,370 --> 01:03:29,330
sorry

1067
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:34,050
The believer is not burned

1068
01:03:36,970 --> 01:03:38,010
Which department?

1069
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:39,840
Eternal life, eternal spring, new god descends!

1070
01:03:39,930 --> 01:03:43,510
This is Heo Yak-seon, the 7th director of the Saesin Foundation Stage Equipment Facility.

1071
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:44,430
It's an honor

1072
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,480
How long ago did you get startled by an explosion?

1073
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:47,390
Are you hurt?

1074
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:48,440
it's okay

1075
01:03:48,730 --> 01:03:49,560
thank you

1076
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:51,730
I should be grateful for your faith.

1077
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:56,110
Yes, I will believe harder

1078
01:03:58,820 --> 01:04:01,490
Eternal life, eternal spring, new god descending

1079
01:04:23,140 --> 01:04:24,180
You got a tattoo?

1080
01:04:24,510 --> 01:04:25,720
This is not a tattoo

1081
01:04:25,810 --> 01:04:27,850
I was lucky enough to receive an organ transplant last time.

1082
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:29,020
What did you get transplanted?

1083
01:04:30,270 --> 01:04:31,520
I got the liver

1084
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:32,980
Has anything changed since you got the transplant?

1085
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:36,190
Oh, I hope the surgery went well and you are getting better.

1086
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:37,440
- I'm not tired...
- No, no

1087
01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:38,940
Other than that, what's unique about it?

1088
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:42,110
uh

1089
01:04:42,990 --> 01:04:44,830
I don't know for sure

1090
01:04:46,370 --> 01:04:48,250
I hear people say I look younger

1091
01:05:00,090 --> 01:05:02,050
There's nothing like getting younger

1092
01:05:02,550 --> 01:05:03,470
What was your name?

1093
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:06,390
It's a weak line

1094
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:08,680
Heoyakseon, 7th division

1095
01:05:09,730 --> 01:05:11,060
Take good care of yourself

1096
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:13,100
See you again

1097
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:19,940
I wonder who
is preparing for the nursing exam?

1098
01:05:20,030 --> 01:05:21,070
Oh, no

1099
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:23,030
I'm just doing this for fun

1100
01:05:23,110 --> 01:05:24,950
Hey, that's cool

1101
01:05:25,620 --> 01:05:28,910
Oh, sir,
I'm sorry about this. What should I do?

1102
01:05:28,990 --> 01:05:30,700
Why do you suddenly want to meet in a place like this?

1103
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:32,250
Should I turn the car around?

1104
01:05:32,330 --> 01:05:33,830
Oh, I'm sorry

1105
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:34,830
see

1106
01:05:36,170 --> 01:05:37,960
Where is Saesin Pharmaceutical's headquarters?

1107
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:39,630
Oh, Saesin Pharmaceutical

1108
01:05:39,710 --> 01:05:41,880
I work right next door

1109
01:05:41,970 --> 01:05:43,760
I know the way well

1110
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:45,550
Oh, that's good.

1111
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:48,100
Then
please take care of yourself safely.

1112
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:49,430
Yes, yes

1113
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:50,930
I had gum

1114
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:52,020
Is it gum?

1115
01:05:53,810 --> 01:05:55,520
Why? Not starting?

1116
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:57,360
Oh, yes

1117
01:05:57,900 --> 01:05:59,110
Me, that's it

1118
01:05:59,190 --> 01:06:01,530
A tissue biopsy should be the priority

1119
01:06:01,610 --> 01:06:03,280
Even if it exceeds the lethal dose

1120
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:04,570
Anesthesia doesn't work

1121
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:06,570
Little bird god?

1122
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:08,950
Oh, thank goodness

1123
01:06:09,030 --> 01:06:11,410
I am Heo Yak-seon, the 7th director of the Saesin Foundation.

1124
01:06:11,910 --> 01:06:13,250
Oh, little bird god

1125
01:06:13,330 --> 01:06:15,250
But where am I?
I have to go home.

1126
01:06:15,330 --> 01:06:16,670
Oh, right, oh

1127
01:06:17,170 --> 01:06:19,000
Nursing Assistant Core Courses in One Volume

1128
01:06:19,090 --> 01:06:21,010
I've already summarized everything there .

1129
01:06:21,590 --> 01:06:23,550
- Do you have that?
- What kind of anesthesia is it?

1130
01:06:23,630 --> 01:06:24,590
Just like that

1131
01:06:26,930 --> 01:06:28,050
Little New God

1132
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:29,850
Little New God

1133
01:06:29,930 --> 01:06:32,100
Little bird god!

1134
01:06:32,180 --> 01:06:33,180
That mouth

1135
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:35,560
Little New God

1136
01:06:37,230 --> 01:06:39,900
If anesthesia doesn't work,
you have to knock them out.

1137
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:41,900
What are you doing or not doing?

1138
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:42,820
yes?

1139
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:43,900
Who are you waiting for?

1140
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:45,570
Have you been waiting for me?

1141
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:50,280
Eternal life, eternal spring, new god descending

1142
01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:55,790
Did you plan something fun?

1143
01:06:59,590 --> 01:07:01,880
Long time no see, Heoyakseon 7th Division Leader

1144
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,210
It's okay, it's okay

1145
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:04,380
Who said this?

1146
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:07,380
Director Song

1147
01:07:07,470 --> 01:07:08,470
Yes, new father

1148
01:07:08,550 --> 01:07:10,260
If you leave a little bit of liver

1149
01:07:10,350 --> 01:07:12,010
It grows back, right?

1150
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:13,310
Yes, that's right.

1151
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:17,230
Eternal life, eternal spring, new god descending

1152
01:07:18,310 --> 01:07:19,940
Become a true sacrifice

1153
01:07:20,020 --> 01:07:21,820
Live forever in me

1154
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,300
Mr. Kim, tie it up

1155
01:08:04,610 --> 01:08:05,570
sorry

1156
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:07,740
It doesn't work with the same species?

1157
01:08:10,030 --> 01:08:11,030
Let's go to surgery

1158
01:08:32,090 --> 01:08:33,100
Director Cho

1159
01:08:33,180 --> 01:08:34,140
Yes, sir

1160
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:37,850
Let's play

1161
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:40,770
Catch them all

1162
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:42,810
Oh, thank you

1163
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:44,190
Oh, slowly

1164
01:08:44,270 --> 01:08:45,230
Slowly

1165
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:47,150
oh my

1166
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:01,290
Madam, here you go

1167
01:09:01,750 --> 01:09:02,920
Yes, I'm going

1168
01:09:05,170 --> 01:09:07,300
Oh my, thank you

1169
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:22,560
Is there anything delicious?

1170
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:24,900
Yes, there is, there is, there is

1171
01:09:24,980 --> 01:09:27,070
Why not, probiotics?

1172
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:41,080
Daughter, daughter, daughter, daughter, daughter

1173
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:42,830
Why? Why? Why? Why?
What's going on? Huh?

1174
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:44,250
Is my daughter okay? Are you okay...

1175
01:09:45,170 --> 01:09:46,750
Hey, hey, put this on

1176
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:49,670
Hey, I have one kid

1177
01:09:50,170 --> 01:09:51,420
Who are you?

1178
01:09:51,510 --> 01:09:53,050
- Let's go.
- Where?

1179
01:09:53,130 --> 01:09:54,130
I'll be there soon

1180
01:09:54,220 --> 01:09:57,470
Daughter, you're at the end there, huh?

1181
01:09:57,550 --> 01:09:58,680
To the end there

1182
01:10:13,950 --> 01:10:15,030
Oh, my back

1183
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:18,080
Waist, waist, waist
I didn't do my warm-up exercises.

1184
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:18,990
Ouch, my back

1185
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:22,120
Time, time, time, time

1186
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:23,120
time!

1187
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:26,170
Oh, really

1188
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:36,720
Go back again

1189
01:11:03,250 --> 01:11:04,750
- Fighting!
- Let's go together, okay?

1190
01:11:04,830 --> 01:11:05,790
go

1191
01:11:06,170 --> 01:11:07,000
Hey C

1192
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:20,220
Hang in there, hang in there, hang in there

1193
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:42,450
Hey, isn't it 540 degrees?

1194
01:11:48,870 --> 01:11:49,750
Oh, Mom

1195
01:11:49,830 --> 01:11:51,590
I ate all the kimchi.
I'll give you the empty container now.

1196
01:11:56,220 --> 01:11:57,970
I told you to shout 'Dad'
if something happens.

1197
01:11:58,050 --> 01:11:59,050
Bring me some water

1198
01:11:59,130 --> 01:11:59,970
- Water?
- With that bag.

1199
01:12:00,050 --> 01:12:00,890
Water, uh

1200
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:35,170
As I said before

1201
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:37,380
You got the wrong one, sir.

1202
01:12:37,710 --> 01:12:39,260
If you just send it out

1203
01:12:48,270 --> 01:12:49,310
Let's put this down

1204
01:12:49,390 --> 01:12:51,980
What, Dad, are you giving me one seat?

1205
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:54,650
No need for a seat, just keep it simple

1206
01:12:55,570 --> 01:12:57,150
How many Nobel Prizes are needed?

1207
01:13:00,570 --> 01:13:01,610
you

1208
01:13:01,860 --> 01:13:03,280
I stood in the wrong line.

1209
01:13:04,950 --> 01:13:06,370
Even if an old person becomes young, it's useless

1210
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:09,290
Who do you think will live longer?

1211
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:11,960
Let's check it out

1212
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:23,800
Who are you?

1213
01:13:24,390 --> 01:13:25,550
Where are you now come

1214
01:13:34,310 --> 01:13:35,940
Who are you, you little shit?

1215
01:13:36,150 --> 01:13:37,520
Did you have a drink during the day?

1216
01:13:37,610 --> 01:13:38,940
Why don't you recognize your father?

1217
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:42,490
When my father was young

1218
01:13:42,570 --> 01:13:44,240
Did you say he was handsome or not?

1219
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:49,580
Aigoo

1220
01:15:50,910 --> 01:15:51,780
no

1221
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:38,750
Nice to meet you, just follow me

1222
01:16:39,210 --> 01:16:40,170
Come up slowly

1223
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:41,080
Yes, yes

1224
01:16:41,170 --> 01:16:42,460
Just come this way

1225
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:43,790
Okay, Pastor

1226
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:46,760
Be careful on the stairs.
We'll go up little by little.

1227
01:16:47,550 --> 01:16:49,260
- You can go this way too.
- Yes, welcome.

1228
01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:52,640
Newcomers, come this way.
This way.

1229
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:54,390
- Welcome
- Come this way

1230
01:17:04,650 --> 01:17:06,070
Where are you?

1231
01:17:06,150 --> 01:17:07,150
My clones?

1232
01:17:07,780 --> 01:17:08,820
I don't know

1233
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:11,280
I need the rest to become a god

1234
01:17:11,570 --> 01:17:12,700
Aren't you scared?

1235
01:17:13,570 --> 01:17:14,780
If there really is a god

1236
01:17:14,870 --> 01:17:16,490
What kind of punishment are you trying to receive?

1237
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:20,910
Are you going to church these days?

1238
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:22,250
dad

1239
01:17:22,330 --> 01:17:25,540
You're not trying to become a god because you won't be forgiven

1240
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:36,680
Oh, you're smart

1241
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:38,010
It's hidden right below

1242
01:17:40,350 --> 01:17:42,100
Director Cho, it's been a while.

1243
01:17:42,190 --> 01:17:43,230
Who are you?

1244
01:17:43,310 --> 01:17:44,860
Why are you doing this, even though you knew?

1245
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:46,020
I don't know?

1246
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:51,400
Take it easy,
the boss wants you to be treated with respect

1247
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:56,280
Hey C

1248
01:18:33,820 --> 01:18:34,910
Oh, rat!

1249
01:18:35,990 --> 01:18:37,320
Rat, rat

1250
01:18:37,410 --> 01:18:38,370
I see

1251
01:19:07,690 --> 01:19:08,900
what?

1252
01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:09,980
Did you open it?

1253
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:12,230
You came with me, brother.

1254
01:19:13,230 --> 01:19:14,320
Don't let this go!

1255
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:15,360
Let go!

1256
01:19:16,610 --> 01:19:18,410
Hey, Park Ji-Sung! Park Ji-Sung!

1257
01:19:19,950 --> 01:19:21,240
That dog, that

1258
01:19:21,330 --> 01:19:22,790
Oh, ma'am, ma'am

1259
01:19:23,540 --> 01:19:25,120
Auntie, Auntie, Auntie

1260
01:19:26,250 --> 01:19:27,580
Hey, Mr.

1261
01:19:57,570 --> 01:19:58,570
Eyes are absolutely not allowed

1262
01:19:58,660 --> 01:19:59,950
Absolutely not the eyes!

1263
01:20:00,030 --> 01:20:01,410
Eyes are really bad

1264
01:20:03,370 --> 01:20:06,000
Eyes are absolutely not allowed
. Rather, take off the pepper.

1265
01:20:06,710 --> 01:20:08,370
This guy is really a joke

1266
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:13,250
Corneal This will be done soon, right?

1267
01:20:13,340 --> 01:20:14,670
- Yes
- No, I can't see

1268
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:16,090
No eyes!

1269
01:20:16,170 --> 01:20:17,300
No eyes

1270
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:19,630
Why don't the rest of you do the same?

1271
01:20:20,590 --> 01:20:22,470
- I'm still one person short
- I'm really rich

1272
01:20:22,550 --> 01:20:24,970
- I can give you a lot of money
- It's better to take your time and do it safely.

1273
01:20:25,060 --> 01:20:26,560
- They'll give you a lot of money!
- That sounds good.

1274
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:29,020
How much can I do?

1275
01:20:29,810 --> 01:20:31,060
Is this anesthetized?

1276
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:34,400
Heyak-seon
is noisy even when he's sleeping

1277
01:20:35,110 --> 01:20:35,980
but

1278
01:20:37,150 --> 01:20:38,570
How much did it hurt?

1279
01:20:53,630 --> 01:20:54,670
- No.
- What?

1280
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:56,300
- No matter what, it won't work
- I have to go

1281
01:20:56,380 --> 01:20:58,510
I said no, I said no,
I said absolutely not this time, you!

1282
01:21:00,970 --> 01:21:02,970
Did you think your father wouldn't know that you were doing that without his knowledge ?

1283
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:06,850
Since when did you know?

1284
01:21:06,930 --> 01:21:07,970
Parents

1285
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:10,350
Just smelling the farts of a little kid

1286
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:12,150
Parents are the ones who know what their child is worried about.

1287
01:21:12,980 --> 01:21:14,270
You've been in the hospital for three years

1288
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:15,770
So I can't meet my friends

1289
01:21:17,190 --> 01:21:19,360
Since I got better, I made some friends.

1290
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:22,070
Those friends of all people

1291
01:21:24,910 --> 01:21:26,280
I got caught by the bullies

1292
01:21:29,620 --> 01:21:31,580
Even if I buy new shoes and wear them every day

1293
01:21:31,660 --> 01:21:34,170
Every day
, I come in as trash

1294
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:36,960
Oh my, my weak daughter

1295
01:21:37,050 --> 01:21:39,050
Our daughter is also weak

1296
01:21:39,130 --> 01:21:41,880
I wondered why I wanted to learn Taekwondo.

1297
01:21:42,550 --> 01:21:43,720
Because I don't want to be right

1298
01:21:44,050 --> 01:21:45,300
Because I don't want to be right

1299
01:21:45,390 --> 01:21:47,310
He said he took care of his own body because the bullies were harassing him.

1300
01:21:47,390 --> 01:21:50,730
- Father
- That's what I'm saying, then

1301
01:21:51,230 --> 01:21:53,100
- Actually
- What if I get hurt again?

1302
01:21:53,190 --> 01:21:54,940
My friends
are being held by bullies right now.

1303
01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:57,820
My heart is pounding with excitement

1304
01:21:57,900 --> 01:21:59,780
We are like family

1305
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,690
I have to go save him

1306
01:22:01,780 --> 01:22:04,360
No, no

1307
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:09,490
Hide right behind your father

1308
01:22:09,580 --> 01:22:10,540
These little bastards

1309
01:22:10,620 --> 01:22:12,410
Did you see them last time? The guys in black suits?

1310
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:14,420
Numbers are just age

1311
01:22:15,170 --> 01:22:16,040
Should I play another song?

1312
01:22:16,130 --> 01:22:18,590
My father still
gets goosebumps when he hears this song

1313
01:22:18,670 --> 01:22:20,170
Even then, I just listened to this song and went out

1314
01:22:20,260 --> 01:22:22,170
We didn't win, it was Barcelona

1315
01:22:22,260 --> 01:22:23,630
What is your father's nickname?

1316
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:25,430
- Taekwon V
- Taekwon V!

1317
01:22:25,510 --> 01:22:28,300
A one -hit,
fatal roundhouse kick full of justice

1318
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:33,480
huh?

1319
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:39,440
why?

1320
01:22:40,230 --> 01:22:42,190
Wake up, not 'why'

1321
01:22:42,650 --> 01:22:44,030
Why, where are you, ma'am?

1322
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:47,030
I think we've been kidnapped

1323
01:22:48,950 --> 01:22:49,950
Let's go out first

1324
01:22:56,420 --> 01:22:57,750
Where is the bathroom?

1325
01:22:57,830 --> 01:22:59,590
No, no,
not there, no

1326
01:23:05,010 --> 01:23:06,130
Are you okay?

1327
01:23:06,550 --> 01:23:08,430
Hey, this is fun, it's amazing

1328
01:23:09,140 --> 01:23:11,560
Have you never seen WiFi with your own eyes?

1329
01:23:14,180 --> 01:23:15,730
Is it because there's only one side?

1330
01:23:16,270 --> 01:23:17,900
The focus goes back and forth a bit.

1331
01:23:17,980 --> 01:23:18,860
sorry

1332
01:23:18,940 --> 01:23:20,320
I woke up suddenly

1333
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:21,610
Because of the wind rushing in

1334
01:23:22,030 --> 01:23:24,150
That guy
left a cornea in his eye

1335
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:25,530
It's a little awkward

1336
01:23:25,610 --> 01:23:27,280
He won't see all this stuff either

1337
01:23:27,660 --> 01:23:28,620
I also do this

1338
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:32,040
Because the damage was severe during extraction

1339
01:23:32,790 --> 01:23:35,000
Recovery is impossible with modern medicine

1340
01:23:48,970 --> 01:23:49,840
who is this?

1341
01:23:49,930 --> 01:23:50,800
it's me

1342
01:23:51,430 --> 01:23:52,640
Battery Man

1343
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:54,060
Sir, please fix me

1344
01:23:54,140 --> 01:23:55,600
Sir, you can fix people.

1345
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:58,270
The battery is dead

1346
01:23:58,350 --> 01:24:00,440
If you drink water, you will recover.

1347
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:01,650
Drink some water and fix me

1348
01:24:01,730 --> 01:24:03,820
I brought you water last time too.

1349
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:08,400
No, I'm just too scared

1350
01:24:10,110 --> 01:24:12,490
No, shit, how can I live

1351
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:15,620
You can be blind twice

1352
01:24:28,220 --> 01:24:29,970
Eternal life, eternal spring, new god descending

1353
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:33,470
To all the saints who have come here

1354
01:24:33,550 --> 01:24:35,520
Welcome to the new believers

1355
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:37,310
Now according to his word

1356
01:24:37,390 --> 01:24:38,850
As per his promise

1357
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:41,310
Come back with a new body that will never die

1358
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:43,440
Save us from the fires of hell

1359
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:46,150
He came down in person to punish the unbelievers.

1360
01:24:46,230 --> 01:24:47,490
King of kings, God of gods

1361
01:24:47,570 --> 01:24:49,450
Let us welcome our new father, Seo Young-chun

1362
01:24:49,530 --> 01:24:51,610
- Overhead
- Let's all shout together

1363
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:53,410
- New Father
- Father

1364
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:10,130
What is it? What is it?

1365
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:14,140
- Who are you?
- I don't know.

1366
01:25:30,150 --> 01:25:31,950
Eternal life, eternal spring, new god descending

1367
01:25:32,030 --> 01:25:34,070
Immortal transcendent flesh of the eternal moon

1368
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:36,370
On the day I promised

1369
01:25:36,450 --> 01:25:39,580
I said I would return to you as a young man.

1370
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:42,040
Those who believe in me and serve me

1371
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:44,250
Be my people

1372
01:26:14,660 --> 01:26:17,330
Eternal life, eternal spring, new god descending

1373
01:26:17,410 --> 01:26:19,330
The unstoppable giant of rock

1374
01:26:20,370 --> 01:26:22,410
On the day I promised

1375
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:24,960
I will show my strength by breaking rocks.

1376
01:26:25,210 --> 01:26:26,960
Those who believe in me and serve me

1377
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:29,800
Be my people!

1378
01:26:49,940 --> 01:26:51,030
what's this

1379
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:56,450
What is this, wait a minute

1380
01:27:36,860 --> 01:27:38,030
Thank you!

1381
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:39,370
Thank you!

1382
01:27:39,990 --> 01:27:41,030
New father!

1383
01:28:13,940 --> 01:28:15,190
That's ridiculous

1384
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:20,240
father

1385
01:28:20,450 --> 01:28:22,780
Eternal life, eternal spring, new god descending

1386
01:28:23,990 --> 01:28:25,870
All diseases are cured and the lion is revived

1387
01:28:26,410 --> 01:28:27,580
Can walk

1388
01:28:27,660 --> 01:28:28,960
Heal the sick

1389
01:28:30,750 --> 01:28:32,000
I will raise the dead

1390
01:28:33,210 --> 01:28:34,710
Can walk

1391
01:28:39,130 --> 01:28:40,010
thank you

1392
01:28:40,090 --> 01:28:41,760
Thank you, sir

1393
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:42,850
father

1394
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:45,100
He who believes in me!

1395
01:28:47,770 --> 01:28:49,270
Be my people

1396
01:28:54,860 --> 01:28:56,360
I believe it!

1397
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:05,330
New arrival!

1398
01:29:16,210 --> 01:29:17,760
Oh, why are there so many entrances?

1399
01:29:19,010 --> 01:29:19,970
Is a celebrity here?

1400
01:29:38,860 --> 01:29:40,240
Oh my, this is surprising!

1401
01:29:43,950 --> 01:29:45,030
It's a surprise

1402
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:47,660
Oh, I told you not to run

1403
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:51,330
wow

1404
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:00,340
Eternal life, eternal spring, new god descending

1405
01:30:00,550 --> 01:30:02,680
I will return as a complete god.

1406
01:30:03,550 --> 01:30:05,600
Praise with all your might!

1407
01:30:30,370 --> 01:30:31,450
Are you finished?

1408
01:30:31,830 --> 01:30:32,790
Who are you, oppa?

1409
01:30:32,870 --> 01:30:34,040
You look pretty

1410
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:36,830
Mr. Park Jong-min

1411
01:30:36,920 --> 01:30:39,800
Oh my, the hero of Barcelona

1412
01:30:40,380 --> 01:30:42,720
I also fought a lot when I was young.

1413
01:30:43,420 --> 01:30:44,340
Nice to meet you

1414
01:30:52,020 --> 01:30:53,890
Ow, woo, woo

1415
01:30:54,980 --> 01:30:56,600
Oh, sir

1416
01:31:16,420 --> 01:31:17,380
You were sick

1417
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:21,380
How did you raise your child at home
?

1418
01:31:21,460 --> 01:31:22,630
Are you kicking an adult?

1419
01:31:22,710 --> 01:31:23,590
Sorry...

1420
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:27,890
But are you doing that to me now?

1421
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:31,140
Oh, you're a bully, huh?

1422
01:31:32,060 --> 01:31:34,520
Where do adults keep calling each other 'you, you'?

1423
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:36,810
You little bastard,
don't you have a dad at home?

1424
01:31:36,890 --> 01:31:38,310
Not at home, of course

1425
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:40,770
My father was born in 1905.

1426
01:31:40,860 --> 01:31:42,400
Did my brother take my friends?

1427
01:31:44,570 --> 01:31:46,740
Actually, my daughter did that

1428
01:31:46,820 --> 01:31:48,860
- Daughter?
- She's been converting recently.

1429
01:31:48,950 --> 01:31:49,950
Anyway, it's kind of like that

1430
01:31:50,990 --> 01:31:51,910
now

1431
01:31:52,450 --> 01:31:55,120
Now that we've finished introducing our families,
let's get to the main point.

1432
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:58,000
Wanseoya

1433
01:31:59,130 --> 01:32:00,460
Let me use your heart

1434
01:32:00,540 --> 01:32:02,090
Is this kid crazy, Mr. Lee?

1435
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:05,920
It's me!

1436
01:32:19,060 --> 01:32:21,270
Are you okay with being me?

1437
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:23,400
I was going to pick you up anyway

1438
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:25,360
Welcome, but how did you get out?

1439
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:27,450
That must be your father, right?

1440
01:32:27,530 --> 01:32:28,360
- Hello
- Oh, yes, Taekwondo

1441
01:32:28,450 --> 01:32:30,990
Yeah, it's our last goodbye,
so I should at least say hello.

1442
01:32:31,070 --> 01:32:34,620
My name is Fresh Girl

1443
01:32:34,700 --> 01:32:36,080
This is Tank Boy

1444
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:37,410
- Stop it.
- Hey!

1445
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:38,750
- How good is it?
- That's right.

1446
01:32:38,830 --> 01:32:41,380
Are you feeling secure with such a wonderful daughter ?

1447
01:32:41,460 --> 01:32:42,290
Oh no

1448
01:32:42,380 --> 01:32:45,500
I worry a lot because he is weak and has no railroad.

1449
01:32:45,590 --> 01:32:47,920
How does Tank Girl
have children?

1450
01:32:48,010 --> 01:32:49,380
- Fresh girl
- Tank, yes

1451
01:32:49,470 --> 01:32:50,380
Ms. Kim Seon-nyeo

1452
01:32:52,050 --> 01:32:53,890
- Let me say something.
- Who are you?

1453
01:32:53,970 --> 01:32:56,930
I
believe in the new life of the eternal spring and the new dawn of life...

1454
01:32:57,020 --> 01:32:57,850
mister!

1455
01:32:58,430 --> 01:32:59,520
That guy seems like a villain

1456
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:00,560
I have a tattoo

1457
01:33:02,060 --> 01:33:04,110
But why is that person an older brother
and I an older man?

1458
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:05,570
You're handsome

1459
01:33:07,900 --> 01:33:09,990
Oh, sir, a little bit

1460
01:33:10,070 --> 01:33:11,450
A style that seems like it needs to be taken care of?

1461
01:33:13,530 --> 01:33:16,330
When an adult is talking
, do you keep interrupting them out of manners?

1462
01:33:16,410 --> 01:33:17,660
Huh? This?

1463
01:33:18,540 --> 01:33:20,750
Where are Mr. Kidong and Mr. Heoyakseon?

1464
01:33:23,540 --> 01:33:24,710
I ate it

1465
01:33:25,630 --> 01:33:26,670
This little bastard

1466
01:33:26,750 --> 01:33:27,920
Ma'am, just a moment

1467
01:33:28,630 --> 01:33:31,010
Hey, hey, hey

1468
01:33:42,230 --> 01:33:43,150
You're not dead, are you?

1469
01:34:57,510 --> 01:34:58,430
What should I do, ah, what should I do?

1470
01:34:58,510 --> 01:35:00,470
- Water! Hey, let go, let go, let go
- What should I do?

1471
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:02,810
Hey, hurry up!
Hey, here it comes, here it comes

1472
01:35:03,810 --> 01:35:04,730
Park Ji-sung

1473
01:35:05,390 --> 01:35:06,400
Lung transplant

1474
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:07,610
Oh my, what's your job?

1475
01:35:07,690 --> 01:35:10,440
The moon is full of autumn

1476
01:35:17,620 --> 01:35:18,950
He's not dead, is he?

1477
01:35:19,700 --> 01:35:21,120
But what did you just say?

1478
01:35:22,700 --> 01:35:25,160
It's good manners to reveal your initial state before using your ultimate skill.

1479
01:35:27,250 --> 01:35:29,750
Hey, this bed is so dirty I can't live

1480
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:33,260
What did you say 'Wolha' earlier, you? Huh?

1481
01:35:36,340 --> 01:35:37,300
What is Wolha?

1482
01:35:47,850 --> 01:35:49,360
- What is it?
- Mom, Mom

1483
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:50,860
What is it, what is it

1484
01:35:54,280 --> 01:35:55,110
please

1485
01:35:56,700 --> 01:35:57,860
Cordyceps sinensis

1486
01:35:57,950 --> 01:35:58,780
candle!

1487
01:36:06,830 --> 01:36:07,710
see

1488
01:36:08,170 --> 01:36:10,790
Our Kim Seon-nyeo is here

1489
01:36:29,310 --> 01:36:31,440
Oh, man, there was this method.

1490
01:36:32,230 --> 01:36:33,770
If only our Kim Seon-nyeo was on my side

1491
01:36:33,860 --> 01:36:36,490
You didn't have to go through all this trouble

1492
01:36:36,570 --> 01:36:37,490
Help me just once

1493
01:36:38,110 --> 01:36:40,450
It's not like they're transferring their abilities to me.

1494
01:36:40,530 --> 01:36:42,120
Don't come, go away, go away

1495
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:43,490
When you move and lose your ability

1496
01:36:43,580 --> 01:36:45,240
I'll suck it all in

1497
01:36:45,830 --> 01:36:47,620
It's so clean, you don't even see any blood

1498
01:36:47,710 --> 01:36:49,000
No, just

1499
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:50,620
Should I buy a yogurt company?

1500
01:37:00,930 --> 01:37:02,850
Give me my eyes!

1501
01:37:04,760 --> 01:37:06,270
Ah, Director Song, this guy

1502
01:37:06,350 --> 01:37:07,350
My cornea feels itchy...

1503
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:37,210
Eternal life, eternal spring, new god descending

1504
01:37:37,300 --> 01:37:39,470
Become a true treasure

1505
01:37:39,550 --> 01:37:41,220
Live forever in me

1506
01:37:41,300 --> 01:37:42,800
Why are you doing this?

1507
01:37:43,930 --> 01:37:45,800
I can't achieve it in my life

1508
01:37:45,890 --> 01:37:48,060
I had two things on my mind

1509
01:37:48,810 --> 01:37:50,140
One is youth

1510
01:37:52,810 --> 01:37:55,730
You have to ask, 'What is one?'
to continue the conversation.

1511
01:37:57,730 --> 01:37:58,570
One is Young...

1512
01:37:58,650 --> 01:38:00,570
I'm sure you'll be happy, I guess

1513
01:38:01,150 --> 01:38:02,990
We need a visible god

1514
01:38:03,570 --> 01:38:05,070
I will become a god and save mankind.

1515
01:38:05,160 --> 01:38:07,240
Isn't that what you're trying to say
, right now? Huh?

1516
01:38:07,330 --> 01:38:09,580
I wonder where you went to some kind of cult school.

1517
01:38:09,660 --> 01:38:12,370
If you write lines like that these days,
your ratings will be terrorized.

1518
01:38:12,460 --> 01:38:14,790
You have a knack for getting on people's nerves.

1519
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:17,000
- He's a famous troll in this neighborhood.
- This kid.

1520
01:38:17,090 --> 01:38:18,170
New Father

1521
01:38:18,460 --> 01:38:20,010
Oh, yeah, Heoyakseon

1522
01:38:21,340 --> 01:38:22,800
Was it all fake?

1523
01:38:23,590 --> 01:38:25,840
Was everything you showed me
fake?

1524
01:38:26,600 --> 01:38:28,220
I abandoned my brothers and family

1525
01:38:28,310 --> 01:38:30,850
My property that I gave away while driving for someone all night

1526
01:38:31,560 --> 01:38:33,060
My life that I gave

1527
01:38:34,600 --> 01:38:37,020
Did you all get fooled and do useless things?

1528
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:38,270
huh

1529
01:38:39,110 --> 01:38:41,280
So if you really want to see God

1530
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:43,820
Offer those wretched bodies to me

1531
01:38:46,490 --> 01:38:49,160
Give me my eyes, this chewy

1532
01:38:53,290 --> 01:38:54,670
Hey, go to the temple, go to the temple

1533
01:38:54,750 --> 01:38:55,960
Hey, why are you throwing that away?

1534
01:38:57,630 --> 01:38:58,460
Hey, here we go

1535
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:15,350
wow!

1536
01:39:15,980 --> 01:39:17,270
It's up, it's up

1537
01:40:02,650 --> 01:40:04,070
Should I dye this?

1538
01:40:04,150 --> 01:40:04,990
Don't do it

1539
01:40:29,590 --> 01:40:32,720
I confess that I will dedicate everything to the new father.

1540
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:34,140
My body, parents, and property

1541
01:40:34,220 --> 01:40:36,140
I'll give it my all!

1542
01:40:36,230 --> 01:40:38,350
You have to sacrifice everything to be
saved...

1543
01:40:52,120 --> 01:40:53,280
Oh, what should I do?

1544
01:40:55,290 --> 01:40:56,120
what

1545
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:28,820
New Father, New Father

1546
01:41:28,900 --> 01:41:30,900
New father!

1547
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:33,660
I will give my life for my new father

1548
01:41:33,740 --> 01:41:34,950
Oh, this won't do

1549
01:41:35,030 --> 01:41:36,080
What is it?

1550
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:37,160
If this turns on here

1551
01:41:37,240 --> 01:41:39,080
If the fuel tank catches fire, we all die.

1552
01:42:02,850 --> 01:42:04,650
Wait a minute, wait a minute

1553
01:42:04,730 --> 01:42:05,940
Don't do it, don't push it

1554
01:42:06,020 --> 01:42:06,940
Let me breathe!

1555
01:42:09,480 --> 01:42:10,360
Teddy bear

1556
01:42:17,330 --> 01:42:19,490
Are you going to kill all the people up there
?

1557
01:42:20,370 --> 01:42:22,660
Are you going to kill all the people who believed in you and followed you
?

1558
01:42:22,750 --> 01:42:24,420
Believer, just make a new one

1559
01:42:25,330 --> 01:42:27,340
I have a concept of the god of death

1560
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:38,100
This is what you guys are like

1561
01:43:00,490 --> 01:43:02,830
Eternal life, eternal spring, new god descending

1562
01:43:02,910 --> 01:43:06,330
Become a part of me and enjoy eternal life.

1563
01:43:08,380 --> 01:43:10,500
Miss Kim Seon-nyeo, hand it over quickly

1564
01:43:14,010 --> 01:43:15,630
Otherwise you'll all die

1565
01:43:17,680 --> 01:43:18,600
Come to your senses

1566
01:43:19,680 --> 01:43:20,930
Hey, open your eyes.

1567
01:43:21,010 --> 01:43:22,100
Come to your senses

1568
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:24,480
Hey, Park Wan-seo! Hey!

1569
01:43:33,030 --> 01:43:35,530
Get behind me, you son of a bitch!

1570
01:43:42,870 --> 01:43:43,700
no

1571
01:44:32,130 --> 01:44:33,710
no

1572
01:45:09,710 --> 01:45:11,370
Baby, why are you coming towards me?

1573
01:45:11,460 --> 01:45:12,380
Where are you coming from

1574
01:46:16,190 --> 01:46:17,020
It's me!

1575
01:46:17,110 --> 01:46:18,110
Hey, you

1576
01:46:22,110 --> 01:46:23,410
Now we have seen

1577
01:46:23,490 --> 01:46:25,200
You're back with a new body

1578
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:26,870
I confess right now

1579
01:46:31,450 --> 01:46:32,660
Sir, how do I turn that off?

1580
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:35,040
I don't know

1581
01:46:35,710 --> 01:46:36,960
What if I don't know?

1582
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:40,170
That
needs to be dispersed by something like a lightning rod.

1583
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:42,050
Because I'm not a technician

1584
01:46:43,260 --> 01:46:44,130
sorry

1585
01:46:45,720 --> 01:46:46,970
Try pushing it to me

1586
01:46:49,350 --> 01:46:50,390
What should I do?

1587
01:46:51,390 --> 01:46:52,680
I don't know either

1588
01:46:52,770 --> 01:46:54,020
I have to try something

1589
01:47:13,120 --> 01:47:14,080
hey

1590
01:47:14,870 --> 01:47:16,170
If you succeed, you will be recognized as the same age

1591
01:47:16,250 --> 01:47:17,960
If you succeed, you're my brother

1592
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:09,720
What is this?

1593
01:48:12,010 --> 01:48:12,850
what

1594
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:04,820
Hey, if you're done, bring me the tattoo now.

1595
01:49:05,610 --> 01:49:06,690
Hey, hyung, dude

1596
01:49:08,030 --> 01:49:08,860
oh my

1597
01:49:10,410 --> 01:49:12,490
Hey, stop it and catch it

1598
01:49:12,570 --> 01:49:13,580
Just a moment

1599
01:49:13,660 --> 01:49:14,490
Just give it to me

1600
01:49:14,580 --> 01:49:15,990
The soup is really something

1601
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:20,540
- Huh?
- Got it.

1602
01:49:40,310 --> 01:49:42,230
Why do you guys want to win?

1603
01:49:42,810 --> 01:49:43,770
If you want me to give it to you, then give it to me

1604
01:49:43,860 --> 01:49:45,610
If you have to die, you should die.
People like you

1605
01:49:45,690 --> 01:49:46,570
stop!

1606
01:49:46,650 --> 01:49:47,610
It's me!

1607
01:49:47,690 --> 01:49:49,190
Hand! Hand!

1608
01:49:49,530 --> 01:49:50,570
It doesn't fall off

1609
01:49:55,950 --> 01:49:57,990
dad!

1610
01:50:05,250 --> 01:50:06,130
Our baby

1611
01:50:06,210 --> 01:50:07,090
Oh, my daughter

1612
01:50:07,210 --> 01:50:09,130
Why is my daughter
so naughty?

1613
01:50:09,210 --> 01:50:10,510
Did you fall?

1614
01:50:10,590 --> 01:50:11,880
Who hit you?

1615
01:50:11,970 --> 01:50:14,340
Oh my, who hit our weak daughter
?

1616
01:50:14,430 --> 01:50:15,600
I'm sorry, Dad.

1617
01:50:15,680 --> 01:50:18,350
Dad
said he was sorry and that he would come home early...

1618
01:50:18,430 --> 01:50:20,480
Dad, Dad, I'm really sorry

1619
01:50:21,060 --> 01:50:23,480
I'm so sorry, my daughter, Dad.

1620
01:50:23,560 --> 01:50:24,900
I'm sorry, Dad.

1621
01:50:24,980 --> 01:50:28,190
Oh, I'm sorry Dad couldn't do it.

1622
01:50:29,690 --> 01:50:30,990
Are you okay, my daughter?

1623
01:50:31,860 --> 01:50:33,990
A young, blue-eyed bastard, really

1624
01:50:34,910 --> 01:50:35,870
Ooh!

1625
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:49,050
What is that?

1626
01:51:11,860 --> 01:51:12,940
The weak line

1627
01:51:14,320 --> 01:51:16,570
Would you like to try being a cult leader?

1628
01:51:26,750 --> 01:51:28,380
I will be a nurse.

1629
01:52:13,710 --> 01:52:15,590
Hey, shit

1630
01:52:23,930 --> 01:52:25,640
Oh, hey, I'll get the car out.

1631
01:52:25,730 --> 01:52:26,770
I'll get the car, wait

1632
01:52:30,230 --> 01:52:31,400
Oh, what should I do!

1633
01:52:33,230 --> 01:52:34,070
why?

1634
01:52:34,150 --> 01:52:36,400
What should I do? The yogurt must have gone bad.

1635
01:52:37,700 --> 01:52:39,570
I'm going to deliver at night

1636
01:52:40,200 --> 01:52:42,330
From Vietnamese spring rolls to diet lunch boxes

1637
01:52:42,410 --> 01:52:44,370
I ordered a lot, what should I do?

1638
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,160
Was the parking lot this way, this way?

1639
01:52:49,620 --> 01:52:50,540
Bluesman

1640
01:52:50,920 --> 01:52:52,340
Bluetooth Man

1641
01:52:52,420 --> 01:52:53,540
No, that's right

1642
01:52:54,550 --> 01:52:56,760
We have that too

1643
01:52:56,840 --> 01:52:59,340
Would you like to listen to a song while you wait ?

1644
01:53:00,220 --> 01:53:01,220
What should I play?

1645
01:53:01,680 --> 01:53:02,600
No, I'll play it

1646
01:53:02,680 --> 01:53:03,810
Hey, turn that on

1647
01:53:04,220 --> 01:53:05,180
I hate that

1648
01:53:05,970 --> 01:53:06,930
Do you know what it is?

1649
01:53:07,310 --> 01:53:08,230
ah

1650
01:53:08,980 --> 01:53:09,810
Battery Brother

1651
01:53:09,890 --> 01:53:10,810
yes

1652
01:53:10,900 --> 01:53:13,610
Can I have this, this, please?

1653
01:53:13,690 --> 01:53:16,150
No,
I'll fix it after I get to the convenience store and drink some water.

1654
01:53:16,230 --> 01:53:18,780
I left my car keys behind, I left my car keys behind

1655
01:53:19,280 --> 01:53:20,780
Hey, here it is, uh

1656
01:53:20,860 --> 01:53:22,070
Okay, okay, okay

1657
01:53:22,820 --> 01:53:24,490
While we were taking our car out

1658
01:53:24,580 --> 01:53:25,830
Should I name it?

1659
01:53:26,160 --> 01:53:27,660
I built it last time

1660
01:53:27,750 --> 01:53:29,290
No, each of them has a name

1661
01:53:29,370 --> 01:53:31,000
Our group doesn't have a name

1662
01:53:31,080 --> 01:53:33,960
Hey, if you watch foreign movies,
when people with superpowers get together

1663
01:53:34,040 --> 01:53:35,630
Let's start with the name

1664
01:53:35,710 --> 01:53:37,130
Sister, just do it

1665
01:53:37,550 --> 01:53:38,840
Then should I do it in English or Korean?

1666
01:53:38,920 --> 01:53:40,340
Sister, just do it yourself

1667
01:53:40,430 --> 01:53:42,510
Actually,
I'm pretty good at naming things.

1668
01:53:42,590 --> 01:53:44,140
No, I'll just build it

1669
01:53:44,760 --> 01:53:47,970
Batteryman, you worked hard, so
charge it.

1670
01:53:48,060 --> 01:53:49,230
Oh, then

1671
01:53:50,850 --> 01:53:53,480
There's something about this friendly feeling that I like

1672
01:53:54,150 --> 01:53:55,860
As if greeting...

1673
01:53:55,940 --> 01:53:57,980
Yeah, I just happened to think of a suitable name.

1674
01:53:58,070 --> 01:54:00,030
Oh! There are five of us.

1675
01:54:00,400 --> 01:54:03,240
When five people greet each other,that's in English

1676
01:54:03,320 --> 01:54:04,370
I know that

1677
01:54:04,820 --> 01:54:05,830
What is that...

1678
01:54:06,740 --> 01:54:07,580
mister

1679
01:54:07,660 --> 01:54:08,540
Try this

1680
01:54:09,450 --> 01:54:10,290
ah!
