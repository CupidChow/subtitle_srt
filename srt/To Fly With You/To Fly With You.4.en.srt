=Episode 4=

3
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:42,839
That newbie Shen Zhengyi

4
00:01:42,839 --> 00:01:43,839
is haunting around Coach Xiao again.

5
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,319
She doesn't even know how to turn.

6
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:46,319
I don't know how she got in.

7
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,720
It must be through some improper ways.

8
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,160
Why would we care about her?

9
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,319
She's dragging us.

10
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,199
Coach Xiao,

11
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,519
why did Coach Zhuang suddenly agree

12
00:02:01,559 --> 00:02:02,559
to let me into the Wind Chaser?

13
00:02:03,279 --> 00:02:03,959
‍She hasn't seen

14
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,040
how I make through the curves.

15
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,279
I think she's the same as me.

16
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,600
She has seen your possibilities.

17
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,960
Thank you, Coach Xiao.

18
00:02:15,559 --> 00:02:16,479
Without you,

19
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,399
I might not

20
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:20,039
keep on skating.

21
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,919
Never mind.

22
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:25,759
‍You just have to work hard

23
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,960
and don't let everyone down.

24
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:28,440
Remember

25
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,039
what Coach Zhuang said.

26
00:02:30,679 --> 00:02:31,800
You're still on trial.

27
00:02:33,399 --> 00:02:34,119
Fighting!

28
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,960
‍I will try my best.

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,759
Let's go.

30
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,240
Don't you think

31
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:48,559
Zhuang Yue went too far?

32
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,199
I can't believe she asked
you to train the new members

33
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,240
and canceled my special training.

34
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,199
I think she's

35
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,479
taking it personally.

36
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:55,520
I agreed to do so.

37
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,720
I want to train the
new members because...

38
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,720
‍What shall I do if you go
train the new members?

39
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,679
You promised me.

40
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,759
You said after the new coach came,

41
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,160
nothing would be affected,

42
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,399
and my special training
would not be affected.

43
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:07,479
So what now?

44
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,399
Well, you just calm down.

45
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,199
Let me finish.

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I want to train the new members

47
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:12,720
because I think

48
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,960
I need to get to know them.

49
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,479
Especially this Shen Zhengyi.

50
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:17,720
Why are you so interested in

51
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,679
this Shen Zhengyi?

52
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,559
Luo Xiaoyi,

53
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,279
have you ever thought

54
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,479
if Liu Sisi's retired,

55
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:22,960
who will replace her to assist you?

56
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:27,399
That Shen Zhengyi doesn't deserve it.

57
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,880
I think at this stage,

58
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:30,160
she is the most appropriate.

59
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,479
I don't like her.

60
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,639
Even if Liu Sisi's retired,

61
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,160
I believe there will be someone

62
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,000
who is more suitable
than her to assist me.

63
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:42,320
Besides,

64
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:43,240
I don't want to

65
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:44,720
follow Zhuang Yue's training.

66
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,720
Okay.

67
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:48,039
Then let me ask you.

68
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,880
Who's your biggest rival right now?

69
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,399
Zhuang Yue has trained Eunkyung Choi.

70
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:55,240
Who else

71
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,440
would know Eunkyung Choi
better than her?

72
00:03:57,119 --> 00:03:57,960
So what would upset you

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,240
to follow her training?

74
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:06,160
Alright.

75
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,000
If you believe in her so much,

76
00:04:08,679 --> 00:04:09,639
I'll just practice with her.

77
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,160
I'd like to see what

78
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,000
she is capable of.

79
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,199
But,

80
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,759
I have a condition.

81
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:16,239
Say it.

82
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,679
Our special training
cannot be canceled.

83
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,279
I'll figure it out.

84
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,600
Xiao Han, fighting!

85
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:41,200
My brother won again. Amazing!

86
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,440
Brother, you are amazing!

87
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,480
Of course!

88
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,320
I am the one who will
be the world champion.

89
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,119
Xiaoyi.

90
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,720
Xiaofeng.

91
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,519
One more time!

92
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:51,519
I didn't skate well.

93
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,040
Brother, when I grow up,

94
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:54,239
I also want to be the world champion.

95
00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:55,040
Okay.

96
00:04:55,359 --> 00:04:56,440
But when you can join the contest,

97
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,959
Xiao Han and I

98
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:58,959
must have retired.

99
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,519
Right.

100
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,079
When we both retire,

101
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,079
we'll be your coach

102
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:03,279
and teach you to be a world champion.

103
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:04,399
Great!

104
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,480
You promise!

105
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:06,959
Of course.

106
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:07,959
So you grow up quickly.

107

00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:23,920
Nice.

120
00:06:24,119 --> 00:06:24,760
Come, come.

121
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:26,160
I am telling you,

122
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,359
if no one tells,

123
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,480
others would not believe

124
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,399
you're new partners.

125
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,440
No.

126
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,640
It's Beisheng who has great abilities.

127
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:32,920
I'm comfortable partnering with him.

128
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:33,679
No, no.

129
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,160
Your ability to make
immediate response is good.

130
00:06:35,239 --> 00:06:36,399
That's why we work together so smooth.

131
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:37,399
Alright, alright.

132
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:37,959
You two

133
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,880
don't flatter each other.

134
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,440
Here, look, have a review.

135
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:42,920
Focus on the throw jump.

136
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,839
When you jumped,

137
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,880
there was still hesitation,

138
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,600
not decisive enough.

139
00:06:47,679 --> 00:06:48,440
You still need to be more cooperative.

140
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:49,760
Then,

141
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,239
when we practice the throw jump later,

142
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:51,959
I'll count,

143
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,320
and then we try to
synchronize the movement.

144
00:06:54,119 --> 00:06:54,519
Got it.

145
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,679
And this part,

146
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,920
well, I think

147
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,440
we can make it a little more difficult,

148
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,160
to change from Triple with Double

149
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,359
to Triple with Triple.

150
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,440
I think we can make it.

151
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,480
As long as you are okay,

152
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,399
I have no problem.

153
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,440
OK.

154
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,839
Both of you

155
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,679
have great skills,

156
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,440
and you two

157
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,320
are cooperating quite well.

158
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,640
For the following games,

159
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,160
I have to

160
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:18,959
make new plans for you.

161
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:19,839
After all, it's your

162
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,440
first performance after partnering,

163
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,040
and it should be taken seriously.

164
00:07:22,799 --> 00:07:23,440
Ma,

165
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,200
how about we

166
00:07:25,239 --> 00:07:26,760
practice one more hour every day?

167
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,079
What do you think?

168
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:29,279
I am telling you,

169
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,559
for when to practice more

170
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:31,600
and when not to,

171
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,239
I have a clear plan in mind.

172
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,160
Don't want to mess with me.

173
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,720
Haste makes waste.

174
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:35,239
Do you understand?

175
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,040
Coach Ma,

176
00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:38,000
actually, I want to practice more, too.

177
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,399
You two...

178
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,519
Just do it.

179
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:44,600
I am off work now.

180
00:07:45,239 --> 00:07:45,760
You don't watch us?

181
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,519
No.

182
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,399
Quite good, nice!

183
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:49,279
Come on. Do it again.

184
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:56,720
I am not complimenting,

185
00:07:57,359 --> 00:07:58,519
but you were really quick back there.

186
00:07:58,959 --> 00:07:59,480
Ma did it

187
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:00,559
for your sake;

188
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:01,119
otherwise we cannot

189
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:01,959
practice more this time.

190
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,239
I, as your new partner,

191
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,399
didn't disappoint you, right?

192
00:08:06,559 --> 00:08:07,239
But speaking of it,

193
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,760
your previous partner, Liu Fei,

194
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:09,880
I've seen the competition videos of

195
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,959
you two.

196
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,679
You made a good team with her.

197
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:14,279
Why did she suddenly quit?

198
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:17,480
For personal reasons, maybe.

199
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,200
What a pity!

200
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,559
I heard she likes you, right?

201
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,880
Yeah, she confessed her love to me.

202
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,440
Actually, Liu Fei

203
00:08:28,119 --> 00:08:29,239
is a great partner.

204
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,399
I also cherish the friendship with her.

205
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,599
But my principle is that

206
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,119
I don't fall in love with my partner.

207
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,239
I don't want

208
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,679
the relationship between
partners becomes so complicated.

209
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,679
You are right.

210
00:08:41,239 --> 00:08:42,239
We should separate the relationship

211
00:08:42,359 --> 00:08:43,159
between partners and personal affairs.

212
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,799
Romantic relationship blurs boundaries,

213
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,080
and it will affect the professionalism
of players.

214
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,679
Actually, I've said no

215
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:48,640
to my partner before, too.

216
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,320
I think

217
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,599
it's good to make this thing clear.

218
00:08:50,719 --> 00:08:51,159
You should not have too much

219
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,119
psychological burden.

220
00:08:52,359 --> 00:08:53,080
I can understand.

221
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:55,400
We are in the same camp.

222
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:56,719
Let's practice.

223
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,640
OK.

224
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:58,679
Wait.

225
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:00,320
I'll play the music.

226
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:04,030
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team
of Lingbei University)

227
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:11,280
Get down at the curve.

228
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:12,919
The last ten seconds.

229
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,119
Hang in there.

230
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:20,479
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

231
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,719
OK, get some rest.

232
00:09:29,119 --> 00:09:30,119
End of training.

233
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,840
Then let's call it a day.

234
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:32,719
Dismiss.

235
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,200
Thank you, Coach.

236
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:41,320
Hey.

237
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:45,799
Coach Xiao,

238
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:47,320
is there anything more

239
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,960
to practice for me today?

240
00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:50,080
Don't go for speed yet.

241
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,599
Get details right first.

242
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:53,000
Like today when you did the squat,

243
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,840
you should lower your
shoulders a little bit more.

244
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,479
Don't be lazy.

245
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,559
Okay.

246
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,760
Haunting around Coach Xiao
even in break time,

247
00:09:59,119 --> 00:10:00,440
isn't that a waste of your time?

248
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:08,960
So tired.

249
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:12,080
Leader,

250
00:10:13,599 --> 00:10:14,640
I'm too tired today.

251
00:10:14,719 --> 00:10:16,039
I really can't help you with your work.

252
00:10:16,359 --> 00:10:17,280
You don't have to work today.

253
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,479
Here is what you want.

254
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,400
A childhood photo of Shao Beisheng?

255
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,479
What a handsome guy!

256
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,359
He's been so handsome in his whole life.

257
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,280
What are you laughing at?

258
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,080
Nothing, nothing.

259
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:39,919
Leader,

260
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:41,400
I'm not afraid of being tired,

261
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,000
so I'll take care of the work today.

262
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,080
I've said it. You don't
have to work today.

263
00:10:45,359 --> 00:10:45,960
You just need to

264
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:46,840
pass me the water next to me.

265
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:47,679
Really?

266
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,479
That easy?

267
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,239
Yes.

268
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,479
When have I ever lied to you?

269
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,760
Go change your shoes.

270
00:10:52,599 --> 00:10:53,280
OK.

271
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:54,320
Shen Zhengyi,

272
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,599
let's go.

273
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,760
Thank you, Coach Xiao.

274
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm leaving now.

275
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,119
Coach Xiao,

276
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:01,200
I'm not very good at basics,

277
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:02,760
so can I practice a little more?

278
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,000
Okay.

279
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,080
Thank you, Coach.

280
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,840
Then I'll leave. Fighting!

281
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,239
Another one asking for extra training.

282
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,359
These new members are so diligent.

283
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,599
Good work!

284
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,719
I'll teach you a bit.

285
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,960
Didn't you hear the
coach blow his whistle?

286
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,440
The training is over.

287
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:55,320
I want to practice a little more.

288
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,440
There's no one left.

289
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,440
I don't know why you still practice.

290
00:12:00,359 --> 00:12:00,880
Sorry.

291
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,760
I won't practice anymore.

292
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:03,799
I'm leaving now.

293
00:12:04,119 --> 00:12:04,799
Where are you going?

294
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:06,039
Don't you want to practice more?

295
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,559
After practicing on ice,
we'll practice off the ice.

296
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:09,359
What are you doing?

297
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,479
Why don't you let Fang Nan practice?

298
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:12,919
Coach Xiao agreed to let

299
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:14,039
her practice more just now.

300
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,799
Don't mention Coach Xiao all the time.

301
00:12:16,239 --> 00:12:16,760
Do you really think

302
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,719
he and you newbies

303
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:18,640
are on the same side?

304
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,039
Now, it is Luo Xiaoyi's

305
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:20,880
training time.

306
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,000
Would you please know it clearly?

307
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:24,679
Anyway,

308
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,880
you can't practice here.

309
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,599
Why can't we practice here?

310
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,080
Newbies have to practice, too.

311
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,239
It's okay. I'll practice with you.

312
00:12:31,479 --> 00:12:32,559
I said no practice.

313
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:33,880
Looks like newbies

314
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,280
don't know the rules.

315
00:12:35,719 --> 00:12:37,479
No matter how hard you practice,
you won't get any results.

316
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:39,000
There is no such rule.

317
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,400
Coach Xiao never said so.

318
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,640
Why are you the only ones
who can practice?

319
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,400
I warned you.

320
00:12:42,479 --> 00:12:43,159
Don't mention Coach Xiao anymore.

321
00:12:43,359 --> 00:12:44,080
Don't you newbies

322
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,000
know the rules?

323
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,440
Stop.

324
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,200
Stop, stop.

325
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,200
Alright, alright.

326
00:12:51,239 --> 00:12:52,440
What happened?

327
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,280
Attention!

328
00:13:16,119 --> 00:13:19,080
You are so energetic

329
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,679
that you have to do something, right?

330
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,799
The College Student Ice League
is about to start.

331
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,320
Now that you're so energetic

332
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,880
and vigorous,

333
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,400
let's train more.

334
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:35,919
Coach Zhuang,

335
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:36,760
maybe we should

336
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,719
talk about the extra training.

337
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:38,960
It's settled.

338
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,239
From now on, all members

339
00:13:41,599 --> 00:13:43,320
have one hour more training every day.

340
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,479
Dismiss.

341
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,400
All of us have to train more now.

342
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:40,960
Are you satisfied?

343
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:44,320
Liu Sisi,

344
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,359
it is not like what you thought.

345
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,599
I...

346
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,960
It's none of your business.

347
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,239
Leave it alone.

348
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,440
No, I just want to explain...

349
00:14:53,719 --> 00:14:55,440
Seeing what Coach Zhuang
was like back there,

350
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,520
she was...

351
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,599
Shut up.

352
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:00,520
Every day after 4:30 pm,

353
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,440
it's exclusive training time

354
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:02,640
of Luo Xiaoyi.

355
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,919
It was specially arranged
for her by Coach Xiao.

356
00:15:05,359 --> 00:15:06,760
You are a newbie who
doesn't know the rules.

357
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,359
What were you trying to do over there?

358
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:10,280
This Skating Rink
belongs to Wind Chaser.

359
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:11,440
It's not for her alone.

360
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:12,640
It's because in Wind Chaser,

361
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:13,840
only Luo Xiaoyi

362
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,039
can win the gold medal.

363
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,559
If you take up her time

364
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:17,679
and affect her training,

365
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,880
can you afford the consequence?

366
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,080
Or do you think

367
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,919
you can get some gold medals

368
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:25,880
with your

369
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,159
bad curve skills?

370
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:29,719
I don't know if I can

371
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:30,640
get the gold medal.

372
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,640
But

373
00:15:31,719 --> 00:15:32,919
you're not even willing to

374
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,039
train one hour more,

375
00:15:34,119 --> 00:15:35,320
and I can be sure that you
cannot get the gold medal.

376
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,320
What did you say?

377
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:39,239
Zhengyi.

378
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,440
Well, what do you want?

379
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,599
Bow down

380
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,559
and apologize to
everyone right now,

381
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,599
or you go out like this.

382
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,080
Zhengyi.

383
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,520
Shen Zhengyi,

384
00:16:22,599 --> 00:16:23,960
is the blower in Short
Track Team broken?

385
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,039
You didn't even blow your hair dry

386
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,960
and change your clothes.

387
00:16:40,719 --> 00:16:41,559
Put this on.

388
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:42,799
Is there anyone in your team

389
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,359
bullied you?

390
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,080
No.

391
00:16:51,239 --> 00:16:52,080
Put it on.

392
00:16:53,359 --> 00:16:53,760
The cold wind blows.

393
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,760
What if you catch a cold?

394
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,520
So be it.

395
00:16:58,119 --> 00:16:58,919
With such a fierce temper,

396
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,080
you will definitely offend others.

397
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,199
If you get bullied,

398
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,599
just say my name.

399
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,719
I, Shao Beisheng, am

400
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,000
famous in Wind Chaser.

401
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,719
Even those who are
in the Short Track Team

402
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:11,839
would pay some respect,

403
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,800
including coaches.

404
00:17:16,479 --> 00:17:18,000
Look at you!

405
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,239
OK, then. Go back and
change your clothes.

406
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:24,160
Don't catch a cold.

407
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,839
You take it. I don't need it.

408
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:29,719
Give it back to me after
you change your clothes.

409
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,800
And remember to consider that thing.

410
00:17:34,239 --> 00:17:35,439
Don't even think about it.

411
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:38,959
Go back.

412
00:17:51,199 --> 00:17:51,880
Such a cold day!

413
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:53,400
Alright, alright, I'll do it.

414
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:53,880
You sit here.

415
00:17:53,959 --> 00:17:54,479
Here, here.

416
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,119
The wind is so strong.

417
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:55,920
Be good.

418
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,920
It's okay.

419
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,439
You just sit here.

420
00:18:02,439 --> 00:18:03,959
I'm not blaming you,

421
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:05,000
but in such a cold day,

422
00:18:05,199 --> 00:18:06,760
you just ran out.

423
00:18:07,239 --> 00:18:08,280
I couldn't even see you when

424
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:09,280
I was chasing you with the clothes.

425
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,640
You cannot do it like this.

426
00:18:11,439 --> 00:18:13,000
I lost my temper back then.

427
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:14,479
Even if you're angry,

428
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,359
you still should take care of

429
00:18:15,439 --> 00:18:16,160
your body.

430
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,359
Do you feel

431
00:18:18,439 --> 00:18:19,439
uncomfortable anywhere?

432
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:22,400
Then drink some hot water.

433
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,680
I have to return the clothes

434
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,199
to Shao Beisheng.

435
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,719
You were wrong about

436
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,640
Shao Beisheng.

437
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:37,520
You treated him so bad,

438
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,520
but once you are in trouble,

439
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:39,640
he always stands up for you.

440
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,800
I'd say

441
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:42,760
he has

442
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,439
a noble character.

443
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,760
You are exaggerating.

444
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,079
He is not a bad guy,

445
00:18:52,239 --> 00:18:53,199
but he's a narcissist.

446
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:55,599
If you have his looks

447
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:56,520
and status in the figure skating team,

448
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,560
won't you be a narcissist?

449
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,000
Alright, alright.

450
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,920
I won't talk about him.

451
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,599
Your Shao Beisheng

452
00:19:01,719 --> 00:19:02,439
is so great.

453
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:10,719
Zhengyi,

454
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:13,400
I think we'd better not conflict with

455
00:19:13,479 --> 00:19:14,199
Liu Sisi and the others anymore.

456
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,199
Endurance can earn a temporary peace.

457
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,560
I'm not complimenting,

458
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,680
but in such a cold day,

459
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,800
even an iron man can't
endure without a jacket.

460
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,199
How is it?

461
00:19:42,439 --> 00:19:43,160
My new coat.

462
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,160
Is it good?

463
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,359
How is it?

464
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,599
Turn around.

465
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,640
It's so warm.

466
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,680
Then lend it to me.

467
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,359
I just bought it online.

468
00:19:57,439 --> 00:19:58,199
I haven't worn it myself.

469
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,520
This is really nice.

470
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,479
Good taste.

471
00:20:01,719 --> 00:20:02,520
Of course.

472
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:03,959
It's a good brand.

473
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:06,000
I am a good guy

474
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,000
to lend it to you for a few days.

475
00:20:07,199 --> 00:20:07,760
Thank you.

476
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,599
You just recovered a few days ago.

477
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:12,040
Now you caught a cold again.

478
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,280
Health is essential in
doing everything well.

479
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,880
You can't rely on your strong body

480
00:20:17,959 --> 00:20:18,959
and do silly things.

481
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:20,079
I suggest,

482
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,319
after graduation,

483
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,760
you should go directly to the
neighborhood council.

484
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,239
I guarantee that you can
make a great achievement there.

485
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,680
It's possible.

486
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,880
Once those aunties see me,

487
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,239
such a handsome boy,

488
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,680
they would be

489
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,719
eager to recommend girls to me.

490
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,119
Wait.

491
00:20:39,479 --> 00:20:40,599
I saw you this morning

492
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,680
wearing a coat.

493
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:44,119
I gave it to Shen Zhengyi.

494
00:20:44,479 --> 00:20:45,680
I guess so.

495
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,920
You treated her bad,

496
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:50,599
while giving her coat.

497
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,119
Aren't you naive?

498
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:53,640
You haven't even finished
elementary school, right?

499
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,640
Nonsense.

500
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,680
That's the noble character called

501
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,839
taking pleasure in helping others.

502
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:01,880
Today,

503
00:21:02,439 --> 00:21:03,839
is there anything happened
in the Short Track Team?

504
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,640
Shen Zhengyi has caused the trouble,

505
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:10,040
and put everyone in extra training.

506
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:11,400
I guess the senior players

507
00:21:11,439 --> 00:21:12,479
gave vent to their anger on her.

508
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,400
She is so silly.

509
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:18,199
I need you to keep an eye on her.

510
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:21,199
Don't you think

511
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:23,800
you're paying too much attention to her?

512
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,920
I'm just looking for a breakthrough

513
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:28,880
to cooperate with her.

514
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,400
OK.

515
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,560
That's the end of the conversation.

516
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:34,520
I need to sleep.

517
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,260
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team
of Lingbei University)

518
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:47,479
Yesterday, Shen Zhengyi

519
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,599
laughed at us.

520
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:49,920
With her bad skills,

521
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,439
not to mention the
College Student Ice League,

522
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,959
I don't think she can
make it in Wind Chaser.

523
00:21:53,719 --> 00:21:54,359
Well, look at

524
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,280
how hard she worked

525
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,079
yesterday.

526
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,199
What if she really gets in?

527
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,599
No way.

528
00:22:00,479 --> 00:22:01,680
I thought I can take part in

529
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,119
this College Student Ice League.

530
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:04,880
It's getting so complicated now.

531
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:06,479
So annoying.

532
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:07,400
Right.

533
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,160
I thought our Coach Xiao

534
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:09,959
can take the place

535
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,800
of chief coach.

536
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:11,880
Right.

537
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,040
If it were Coach Xiao,

538
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,119
could he do that to us?

539
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:15,319
Any lateness will be
punished by running.

540
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,959
I got a cramp in my leg by running.

541
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:21,920
If Zhuang Yue cannot make
any improvement to the team,

542
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,880
she cannot stay here any longer.

543
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,439
As long as we don't cooperate,

544
00:22:26,199 --> 00:22:27,280
sooner or later she will have to quit.

545
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:29,839
What do you want to do?

546
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,439
What kind of shoes is she wearing?

547
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,400
Did she buy them from

548
00:22:41,479 --> 00:22:42,520
a flea market?

549
00:22:46,439 --> 00:22:47,640
Don't care about them.

550
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:55,119
Come over here.

551
00:22:55,199 --> 00:22:56,000
I have something to say.

552
00:22:58,359 --> 00:22:59,000
You two, be quick.

553
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:01,359
Today,

554
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:03,199
senior and new members
will train together.

555
00:23:03,479 --> 00:23:04,439
Let's get familiar with each other.

556
00:23:05,199 --> 00:23:06,160
It will be the same.

557
00:23:06,239 --> 00:23:07,560
We warm up on the ice

558
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,479
one by one.

559
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:10,359
Luo Xiaoyi, you take the lead

560
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,199
and control the speed.

561
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:12,800
Shen Zhengyi,

562
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:13,920
you'll be the last one.

563
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,839
Don't speed up.

564
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,400
No speed up?

565
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:20,599
Don't forget

566
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,199
you're not skating alone.

567
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:24,839
Senior and new members
will skate together.

568
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,719
With so many people,

569
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:28,000
the speed difference is huge,

570
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:28,800
and it'll be dangerous if you speed up.

571
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,000
You have to learn to slow down first,

572
00:23:31,439 --> 00:23:33,000
and then to get used to
the professional rink and team.

573
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:34,160
Understand?

574
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:37,640
Alright, Luo Xiaoyi, start.

575
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:01,880
Shen Zhengyi,

576
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,520
well done. Keep going.

577
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:21,000
Lousy cat, are you
strolling in the market?

578
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:22,839
Don't get in my way.

579
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,040
Pay attention to the spacing.

580
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,599
Shen Zhengyi, what are you doing?

581
00:24:57,439 --> 00:24:58,280
What are you doing?

582
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,199
Shen Zhengyi, Luo Xiaoyi,

583
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:02,199
stop, both of you.

584
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,719
Can't you hear me?

585
00:26:01,239 --> 00:26:02,479
What were you thinking back there?

586
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,719
Were you fighting

587
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:04,839
in the team?

588
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,239
Just a training session.

589
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,400
Being so hard?

590
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,000
So many people hurting in one time.

591
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:12,239
Do you think I'm not busy enough?

592
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,040
Liu Sisi, Luo Xiaoyi,

593
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,920
you two are senior players,

594
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,839
still fooling around with the newbies.

595
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,359
She tried to compete with me.

596
00:26:18,479 --> 00:26:19,239
What can I do?

597
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,040
She can't control her
own speed at curves,

598
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:22,160
and even wanted to overtake me.

599
00:26:22,439 --> 00:26:23,479
She got everybody in trouble.

600
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,880
Dr. Liu, I'm sorry.

601
00:26:26,959 --> 00:26:27,839
Sorry to trouble you.

602
00:26:28,199 --> 00:26:28,839
It's okay.

603
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,719
Shen Zhengyi,

604
00:26:32,719 --> 00:26:34,119
from now on, you cannot go on the ice.

605
00:26:34,959 --> 00:26:36,000
Everyone else, take a day off today.

606
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:40,680
Coach Zhuang, Coach Zhuang,

607
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,520
Zhengyi's time on the ice is limited.

608
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,640
Are you being too harsh?

609
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:45,079
Didn't you see

610
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,079
how dangerous she is?

611
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:48,400
Who will be responsible
for what happens next?

612
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:49,920
If she can't realize

613
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:50,560
her own problem,

614
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,599
she cannot get on the ice again.

615
00:26:52,479 --> 00:26:53,599
I will be responsible for any
more problems with her.

616
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:54,800
Coach Zhuang,

617
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:56,719
I don't think it is fair.

618
00:26:57,359 --> 00:26:58,160
I do have a responsibility,

619
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,119
but it's not

620
00:26:59,199 --> 00:27:00,239
all my fault.

621
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:01,400
They did it wrong too.

622
00:27:01,479 --> 00:27:02,560
Why am I the only one being punished?

623
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,160
Because you didn't follow the order

624
00:27:04,199 --> 00:27:04,680
to skate and follow others,

625
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,119
causing a team accident.

626
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,719
Then they're to blame, too.

627
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,040
If she hadn't come...

628
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:10,760
If you hadn't overtaken
us on the inner track,

629
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,599
how could we get hurt?

630
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:12,959
You have the nerve...

631
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,199
Enough! What are you doing?

632
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,040
Luo Xiaoyi, Liu Sisi, Shen Zhengyi.

633
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,119
You'll have to clean the off-ice
training room this week as a penalty.

634
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,560
No one is allowed to help.

635
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,239
That's it.

636
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,040
Dismiss.

637
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:46,040
Dinner, dinner.

638
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,599
What took you so long?

639
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,439
I'm starving to death.

640
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:50,959
It's not my fault.

641
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,319
Today in the Skating Rink,

642
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,280
there was a riot again.

643
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:55,880
It's good that I can make it

644
00:27:56,479 --> 00:27:57,199
to the canteen on time.

645
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,119
What happened in the Skating Rink?

646
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:00,319
What happened in the Skating Rink?

647
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,040
It's all because of

648
00:28:02,959 --> 00:28:03,560
the one you are worrying about
all the time,

649
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,400
Shen Zhengyi.

650
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:06,640
She is so troublesome.

651
00:28:06,959 --> 00:28:08,040
She's only in the team for a few days,

652
00:28:08,199 --> 00:28:09,160
creating a tremendous uproar like this.

653
00:28:10,199 --> 00:28:11,040
During the warm-up today,

654
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,800
she just fell straight out

655
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,959
by speeding up.

656
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:14,959
Have dinner first.

657
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,040
Wait.

658
00:28:16,719 --> 00:28:17,479
Did she hurt?

659
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:18,959
No.

660
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,400
Here, eat.

661
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,239
Then what happened to her?

662
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:30,560
She cannot get on the ice as a penalty.

663
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,119
And she has to clean the
equipment training room.

664
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,479
That's a big training room,

665
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:38,160
with so many equipment.

666
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,760
She would be exhausted.

667
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,160
When?

668
00:28:45,079 --> 00:28:45,760
Now.

669
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,280
Stop.

670
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:50,199
Why?

671
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:50,920
Here's my chance.

672
00:28:50,959 --> 00:28:51,680
I haven't had enough.

673
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:52,880
I'm starving.

674
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:55,959
It went too far.

675
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,680
Liu Sisi and Luo Xiaoyi,

676
00:28:58,079 --> 00:28:59,000
they ran away so fast.

677
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,040
Such a big training room,

678
00:29:00,199 --> 00:29:00,680
when can you

679
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,599
finish cleaning?

680
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,199
It's okay.

681
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,479
Well, you clean that chair.

682
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,079
I clean this one.

683
00:29:05,239 --> 00:29:06,199
Quick.

684
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,400
Hi, it is not available...

685
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,630
(Off-ice Training Room of Wind Chaser)

686
00:29:23,199 --> 00:29:24,119
Bro,

687
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:26,520
do it!

688
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,280
Okay.

689
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:30,119
What is happening?

690
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:32,000
I don't know.

691
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,760
Shao Beisheng,

692
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:35,800
I was unlucky to know you.

693
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:39,160
Shao Beisheng asked so many

694
00:29:39,239 --> 00:29:40,520
Figure Skating members to help.

695
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,800
They're so handsome.

696
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,119
I didn't expect you to be so kind.

697
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,520
So,

698
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,560
I'd be a great partner.

699
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,040
What did you say?

700
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,440
Can I help you with that?

701
00:29:57,439 --> 00:29:58,520
Raise your feet.

702
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,640
Well, my name is Zhu Lele.

703
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,160
Wang Jun.

704
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:07,959
What?

705
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,560
Bro,

706
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:11,640
the cleaning work this week,

707
00:30:11,719 --> 00:30:12,479
I'm counting on you.

708
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,199
Go for it!

709
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:14,760
Go for it!

710
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,199
Is... Is that appropriate?

711
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:17,680
Yes, rest assured.

712
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:19,560
Well, thank you all.

713
00:30:19,719 --> 00:30:20,560
If you are tired,

714
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,560
just take some rest.

715
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:22,880
Lele and I can do it.

716
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:25,760
It's our duty to help the family of

717
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,719
our Figure Skating Team, right?

718
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:29,119
Yes, it's our duty.

719
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,239
Family?

720
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,520
What family?

721
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,479
Girlfriend.

722
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,400
Girlfriend?

723
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,680
Girlfriend?

724
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,079
Beisheng, don't lie to us anymore.

725
00:30:37,199 --> 00:30:38,079
We won't believe even you lie.

726
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:38,959
Right.

727
00:30:39,239 --> 00:30:40,119
Who has ever seen Beisheng

728
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:41,560
do so much for a girl?

729
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,040
No, I...

730
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,640
We'll find a place

731
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,359
to discuss it.

732
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:45,359
Wait.

733
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,920
We are dragged here to work as drudge,

734
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:51,439
and have to see you show off affection.

735
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,520
Affection?

736
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:53,680
Really?

737
00:30:55,239 --> 00:30:56,560
You ask them.

738
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,680
Let go of me.

739
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,560
Alright, alright.

740
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,680
What are you doing?

741
00:31:03,199 --> 00:31:04,280
If I didn't say you are my girlfriend,

742
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:05,239
will they help me?

743
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:06,800
I appreciate them coming,

744
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,040
but you can't lie.

745
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:08,959
Nonsense.

746
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:11,199
Do you want to get on the ice?

747
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,319
I heard

748
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:15,520
you cannot get on the ice as a penalty.

749
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:17,280
But,

750
00:31:18,199 --> 00:31:18,880
I have an idea

751
00:31:18,959 --> 00:31:19,839
to let you get on the ice.

752
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,800
You won't have much to lose,

753
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,280
and I can also solve my problems.

754
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:23,160
How is it?

755
00:31:27,199 --> 00:31:27,719
Think about it.

756
00:31:28,479 --> 00:31:29,000
Firstly,

757
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:30,280
there's not much time
left this semester, right?

758
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,959
Secondly, I heard if someone

759
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:33,959
has no record
in the qualification contest,

760
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:35,280
she'll be

761
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,199
kicked out of the Wind Chaser.

762
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:39,160
Don't threaten me. I'm telling you

763
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:41,079
I have many ways to get on the ice.

764
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:43,560
Social skating rink, right?

765
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,280
There are lots of differences
between social skating rink

766
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:48,959
and professional tracks,

767
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,599
and there are so many people there.

768
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,000
You cannot practice well.

769
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,520
Then tell me how you can
let me get on the ice?

770
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:07,400
Sign it.

771
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,000
(Contract)

772
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,160
One, never fall in love
with Shao Beisheng.

773
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,560
Two, no unauthorized disclosure of

774
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,640
the contractual relationship
between two parties.

775
00:32:19,239 --> 00:32:20,199
Well, it doesn't mention

776
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:21,239
how to help me get on the ice.

777
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:22,160
As long as you agree,

778
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,119
I'll add it now.

779
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,199
Come here.

780
00:32:41,479 --> 00:32:42,599
Come here.

781
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,160
I'm wrong.

782
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:13,920
I...

783
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:14,920
I don't want to hear you explain.

784
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:16,439
I just want to ask you a question.

785
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,319
Are you and Shao Beisheng
in a relationship or not?

786
00:33:21,719 --> 00:33:22,599
Two, no unauthorized disclosure of

787
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,839
the contractual relationship
between two parties.

788
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,599
Say it.

789
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,439
Yes.

790
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:34,400
Oh my god!

791
00:33:34,719 --> 00:33:35,760
How did you do that?

792
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,640
You are not angry?

793
00:33:44,719 --> 00:33:45,959
Why will I be angry?

794
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,119
I'm just mad at

795
00:33:47,199 --> 00:33:48,199
why didn't you tell me earlier?

796
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,839
If you told me earlier,

797
00:33:50,199 --> 00:33:50,800
I didn't have to

798
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,800
work so hard for Qu Zhi

799
00:33:51,959 --> 00:33:52,400
such a long time

800
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,760
just for one photo?

801
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,760
What photo?

802
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,199
It's a long story.

803
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,839
Anyway,

804
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,880
if you hadn't kept it
from me for so long,

805
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:04,839
I...

806
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,760
I don't have to do

807
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:08,239
so much hard work.

808
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,600
So, to make up for it,

809
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,080
you have to tell me

810
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:14,959
every new update about

811
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:15,679
Shao Beisheng.

812
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:16,879
In this way,

813
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,280
I can make my Lingbei New Style column

814
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,760
much better.

815
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:24,439
I'll try my best.

816
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,320
That's good.

817
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,520
Oh.

818
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,159
This shampoo.

819
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,000
Since

820
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,280
I said it is the shampoo that

821
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,399
Shao Beisheng used

822
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,560
on the school forum,

823
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:36,959
it is sold out right away.

824
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:37,760
I asked someone

825
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,760
to grab you one in the supermarket.

826
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,800
No, no, no.

827
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,639
So many girls

828
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:44,520
want to have one.

829
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:45,639
Why don't you want it?

830
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,360
Alright, alright.

831
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,679
Don't be shy.

832
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,639
We are friends.

833
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,840
If you want to thank me,

834
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,959
why don't you just teach me

835
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,280
the secrets

836
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,120
on how to get Shao Beisheng?

837
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,280
In this way, maybe

838
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:02,120
I can get my Mr. Right.

839
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,320
Don't you have anything to tell me?

840
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,520
No.

841
00:35:20,479 --> 00:35:21,040
Why did you frame

842
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:21,879
Shen Zhengyi?

843
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,320
I didn't.

844
00:35:24,879 --> 00:35:26,120
It was clear that Liu Sisi and

845
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:27,639
Shen Zhengyi have troubles.

846
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:33,800
You think I don't know anything,

847
00:35:33,919 --> 00:35:34,600
right?

848
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,600
Liu Sisi and the others

849
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:36,399
listen to you.

850
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:38,879
How many times do I have to tell you?

851
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,959
Shen Zhengyi can assist

852
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:40,919
you in the future.

853
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,959
Now you let her off the ice.

854
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:42,600
Do you know how serious

855
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:43,639
this penalty is?

856
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,479
I said

857
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,719
I really don't like

858
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,439
Shen Zhengyi.

859
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,639
She's not professional at all,

860
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:49,560
just a hothead.

861
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,719
And because of her,

862
00:35:51,879 --> 00:35:53,360
my special training is gone.

863
00:35:56,239 --> 00:35:57,000
Even without her,

864
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,199
your special training may
also be difficult to maintain.

865
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,479
You mean Coach Zhuang...

866
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,120
Alright.

867
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,399
You go home.

868
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:07,959
Wait.

869
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,080
Don't frame Shen Zhengyi anymore.

870
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:12,479
Understand?

871
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,360
OK.

872
00:36:30,919 --> 00:36:31,520
It's me, Shao Beisheng.

873
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,399
What?

874
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,239
Buy me breakfast and

875
00:36:34,479 --> 00:36:36,159
meet me downstairs
in the boys' dorm at 7 o'clock.

876
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:36,800
No.

877
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,919
That's what a girlfriend would do.

878
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,439
You're crazy.

879
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,800
I'll take you to the rink on Saturday.

880
00:36:56,639 --> 00:36:57,959
What do you want to eat?

881
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:58,760
Kung Pao Chicken.

882
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,919
Just one last time.

883
00:37:01,399 --> 00:37:01,800
Beisheng,

884
00:37:01,959 --> 00:37:02,800
let's go, to the canteen.

885
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,080
Let's go!

886
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:04,919
I...

887
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:07,760
I don't need it.

888
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:08,600
Why?

889
00:37:08,879 --> 00:37:09,439
Breakfast.

890
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,760
My girlfriend brought me breakfast.

891
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,479
Wow, someone delivers breakfast for you.

892
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,120
What are you doing?

893
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,320
Why are you so late today?

894
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,600
7 o'clock, isn't it?

895
00:37:22,959 --> 00:37:23,800
I am not late.

896
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,239
Be here at 6:30

897
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,560

898
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,479
Be here at 6:30.

Yes.

911

No way.

00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,040
Why does Shao Beisheng like her?

943
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:53,959
So common.

00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:54,959

945
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:55,879
She has some abilities.

946
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:56,919
I heard that Shao Beisheng

947
00:39:57,159 --> 00:39:57,959
asked all the men in Figure Skating Team

948
00:39:58,199 --> 00:39:59,199
to sweep the floor for them.

949
00:39:59,360 --> 00:39:59,879
Really?

950
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,040
What?

951
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,719
What did you say?

952
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:04,679
Nothing, nothing.

953
00:40:04,919 --> 00:40:05,439
It's okay.

954
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,639
Why are you so timid?

955
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,000
I'm not timid.

956
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:10,399
They have mouths.

957
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,639
They can say what they want.

958
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:12,879
Right?

959
00:40:12,959 --> 00:40:14,080
You're angry about everything now.

960
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,280
Calm down.

961
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:16,520
Shen Zhengyi,

962
00:40:20,479 --> 00:40:21,399
I want to talk to you.

963
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,560
Then I'll go in first.

964
00:40:32,879 --> 00:40:34,239
Beisheng and I

965
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,639
have been partners for years.

966
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:37,199
In addition to class time,

967
00:40:37,439 --> 00:40:38,439
we've spent most of our daytime

968
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,600
training together.

969
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,639
But I've never seen you before.

970
00:40:42,439 --> 00:40:43,120
When did you meet

971
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:43,919
him?

972
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:47,439
We met when ice skating.

973
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,360
So when did you

974
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,639
get together?

975
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,879
Just a couple of days ago.

976
00:40:53,439 --> 00:40:54,159
A couple of days ago?

977
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:55,800
You've just been together
for a couple of days.

978
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,520
No, I mean...

979
00:40:57,879 --> 00:40:58,800
we celebrated the 100-day

980
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:01,520
anniversary a couple of days ago.

981
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,959

982
00:41:07,919 --> 00:41:08,479
You...

983
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,800
I told you to wait in the dorm.

984
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:11,719
What are you doing here?

985
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,439
It's not good, not good.

986
00:41:13,959 --> 00:41:15,560
Since you have been together

987
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,239
for so long,

988
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,800
why did you make it public now?

989
00:41:18,199 --> 00:41:19,000
You know,

990
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:20,879
I don't want

991
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,840
love relationship affects my training.

992
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,959
We didn't want to make it public,

993
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:26,600
but we were forced to.

994
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,679
Sorry.

995
00:41:30,399 --> 00:41:31,800
I'm interrupting your relationship.

996
00:41:39,399 --> 00:41:40,439
What are you doing?

997
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,439
Look at that poor girl.

998
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,800
You should make it clear to her.

999
00:41:43,879 --> 00:41:44,399
If you cannot do so,

1000
00:41:44,479 --> 00:41:45,560
just try it.

1001
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,959
I don't like her.

1002
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,239
If I give her hope,

1003
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,959
it would be the cruelest.

1004
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:51,719
You don't say.

1005
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:53,879
I am late.

1006
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,879
Straight your left leg.

1007
00:42:14,919 --> 00:42:15,919

Coach Zhuang,

1019
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:13,280
I have to go to the bathroom.

1020
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:14,879
Just go.

1021
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:15,760
Thank you.

1022
00:44:29,479 --> 00:44:30,000
Why are you

1023
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:30,959
being so sneaky here?

1024
00:44:34,399 --> 00:44:35,719
Does it have anything to do with you?

1025
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:36,879
I am not complimenting but

1026
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,040
why are you so

1027
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,080
noisy?

1028
00:44:39,879 --> 00:44:41,320
I'm nosy?

1029
00:44:41,479 --> 00:44:42,679
This is where I train.

1030
00:44:42,919 --> 00:44:43,639
Besides, I am different

1031
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:44,320
from who I was before.

1032
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:45,479
I don't have to be obedient

1033

00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,080
