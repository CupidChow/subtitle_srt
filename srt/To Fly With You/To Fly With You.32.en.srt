Coach Xiao,

4
00:01:39,919 --> 00:01:40,599
are you willing

5
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,599
to fight together with us?

6
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,000
Coach Xiao,

7
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,760
the kids in Wind Chaser need you.

(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team of
Lingbei University)

9
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,760
Then I will tell you

10
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:08,600
exactly.

11
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,919
Ever since you came to Wind Chaser,

12
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:10,720
you have messed

13
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,919
all my training plans up.

14
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,520
Now I don't want to practice anymore.

15
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,440
That's what you wanted, right?

16
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,600
Why are you coming for me

17
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,600
hypocritically?

18
00:02:17,839 --> 00:02:18,399
(I cannot let Xiaoyi)

19
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:19,800
(leave Wind Chaser like this.)

20
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:26,919
(Who is she? So fast.)

21
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,440
- Who is she?
- So amazing.

22
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,080
Have you seen it?

23
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,039
Who's skating with Zhengyi here?

24
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,119
Why does she skate so fast?

25
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,479
She is skating on the
outer track of Zhengyi,

26
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,559
but she doesn't lose any speed.

27
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:44,960
That's amazing.

28
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,679
So amazing!

29
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,240
Who is she?

30
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,240
Why is she so awesome?

31
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,800
So fast.

32
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,479
This way, this way.

33
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:53,479
- Hurry up.
- This way.

34
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,080
- So amazing!
- She's awesome.

35
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,360
(Her curve skills are impeccable.)

36
00:03:01,679 --> 00:03:02,800
(Who is she actually?)

37
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:04,399
Is she Eunkyung Choi?

38
00:03:04,679 --> 00:03:05,240
No way.

39
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,279
Eunkyung Choi is not that fast.

40
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:07,360
That way, that way.

41
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,639
Zhengyi, Zhengyi.

42
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,479
Zhengyi, who is she?

43
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,240
Who is she?

44
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,520
(Wang Meng, Chinese short track skater)
(Winning multiple World Championships)

45
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,960
Wang Meng.

46
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:47,119
- Wang Meng.
- It's Wang Meng.

47
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,279
- Prepare.
- 3, 2, 1.

48

- Cheese.
- Cheese.

49
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:00,479
Okay.

50
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:01,759
Okay.

51
00:04:01,839 --> 00:04:02,559
One...

52
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:03,240
One more please.

53
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:03,800
You've taken over a hundred pictures.

54
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:04,240
Whose phone is it?

55
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,240
Alright, I'll say a few words.

56
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:05,839
Whose phone is it?

57
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,360
Okay, alright.

58
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,240
There's plenty of time
for taking pictures.

59
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,080
Wind Chaser

60
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,839
has encountered some
difficulties recently.

61
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,839
Our spirit is not so high.

62
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,559
So I invited

63
00:04:17,679 --> 00:04:18,399
Teacher Wang Meng here

64
00:04:18,679 --> 00:04:20,079
to cheer you up.

65
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,880
I think I don't need to introduce you

66
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:22,959
how awesome Teacher Wang Meng is.

67
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:24,119
Right.

68
00:04:24,239 --> 00:04:24,760
We know it clearly.

69
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,799
She won four gold medals of Short Track
Speed Skating at the Winter Olympics.

70
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,920
She is here today

71
00:04:30,359 --> 00:04:31,799
not just to cheer you up,

72
00:04:32,679 --> 00:04:33,839
but also to volunteer

73
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,239
to be our special coach.

74
00:04:38,799 --> 00:04:39,359
Alright.

75
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:40,559
Let's welcome

76
00:04:40,799 --> 00:04:41,799
Teacher Wang Meng to say something.

77
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,799
- Great.
- Great.

78
00:04:46,239 --> 00:04:47,799
I was invited by Coach Zhuang

79
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,559
to come here today all of a sudden.

80
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,200
I haven't prepared anything

81
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:50,799
for you for the first meeting.

82
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:51,559
Sorry about that.

83
00:04:51,799 --> 00:04:53,079
Teacher, don't be sorry.

84
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:53,799
Your visit today

85
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:54,359
is the most surprised

86
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:56,119
gift for us, right?

87
00:04:56,119 --> 00:04:56,839
- Right.
- Right.

88
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:57,640
Thank you.

89
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,799
Actually Shen Zhengyi,

90
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,920
I saw your skating just now.

91
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,200
It was good.

92
00:05:01,559 --> 00:05:03,160
It's difficult for you

93
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:04,480
to stand up to all that pressure

94
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,440
for the first international competition.

95
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,559
Thank you, Teacher Wang Meng.

96
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,880
Today,

97
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,880
actually I've heard that

98
00:05:09,119 --> 00:05:10,440
our Wind Chaser Short Track Team

99
00:05:10,679 --> 00:05:13,440
is encountering a crisis.

100
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:15,119
Everyone is under pressure.

101
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,320
Actually I've

102
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,359
experienced the crisis,

103
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,239
and the setbacks as well.

104
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:20,920
So I know what you're feeling.

105
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:22,799
I think sometimes

106
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,440
the crisis is also a challenge.

107
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,799
We have to be confident.

108
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,679
When we overcome the difficulty,

109
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,040
we can improve ourselves

110
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:29,799
to a new level.

111
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:30,880
I'll accompany

112
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,359
you in getting over this crisis.

113
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,079
Are you confident to do so?

114
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:34,920
- Yes!
- Yes!

115
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,359
Okay.

(Off-ice Training Room)

118
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,040
Why hasn't Coach Zhuang come yet?

119
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,799
Maybe we don't have training today?

120
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,239
Coach Xiao.

121
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,279
Coach Xiao.

122
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:12,679
What's up?
Don't you know me?

123
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,480
- Coach Xiao.
- Coach Xiao.

124
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:17,600
We all miss you so much.

125
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,239
Coach Xiao, you're back.

126
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,559
Where have you been?

127
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,559
Alright, assemble.

128
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:31,920
Today our plan is...

129
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,239
Coach Xiao!

130
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,040
All of us

131
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:36,279
want to ask you

132
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,839
to change the training plan.

133
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:40,399
Say it.

134
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:42,519
The Asian Cup is coming soon.

135
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,959
We all think that

136
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:44,920
the most important thing is

137
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,040
to help Zhengyi

138
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,279
win the gold medal of Asian Cup.

139
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,480
So we want to

140
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,799
have a special training
together with Zhengyi.

141
00:06:51,799 --> 00:06:52,920
Have a special training
together with Zhengyi?

142
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:54,920
How shall we do it?

143
00:06:55,679 --> 00:06:56,959
Isn't Eunkyung Choi skating alone?

144
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,239
But in the contest,

145
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,519
there is not only herself.

146
00:07:00,239 --> 00:07:01,279
Right now, we can start

147
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:02,720
simulating the contest,

148
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:03,720
and figuring out

149
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:04,720
a solution for Zhengyi

150
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:05,839
based on it.

151
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,959
Get Zhengyi ready for the contest.

152
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,839
And we can all be the opponents

153
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,600
of Zhengyi.

154
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,399
Three of us

155
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:13,959
can have a relay of 500m,

156
00:07:14,239 --> 00:07:15,399
to compete with Zhengyi in 1500m.

157
00:07:16,359 --> 00:07:17,920
Although we

158
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,040
are maybe far behind

159
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,720
Eunkyung Choi in skills.

160
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,279
But two heads are

161
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,279
better than one.

162
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:24,799
So I think the relay of 500m

163
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:25,600
of three of us

164
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,720
should also be

165
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,239
close to

166
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:28,000
the level of a master.

167
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,720
Nice idea.

168
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,519
I'll optimize this idea
as soon as possible.

169
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:36,040
You warm up first, okay?

170
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,160
Start training!

171
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:39,480
- Yes.
- Yes.

172
00:07:41,679 --> 00:07:42,320
Let's go.

173
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,040
Stretch yourselves out,

174
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,480

00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:06,399
Zhou Luhan and Zheng Rui.

179
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,079
Shen Zhengyi.

180
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,720
You catch up on the curve.

181
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,799
The 1500m race

182
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,720
has a steady start.

183
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,720
Players usually don't speed up.

184
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,799
So, Shen Zhengyi,

you can follow others in

187
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:19,720
But you have to follow closely.

When Wang Fang relays Zheng Rui,

189
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,679
Shen Zhengyi should transcend them.

190
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:30,160
Wang Fang, Dong Jiaying,

191
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:30,959
you two should make every effort

192

But this is the most critical moment.

00:09:04,119 --> 00:09:04,919
Because Eunkyung Choi

211

You see,

231
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,919
this is the training video for today.

232
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,880
We're all helping Zhengyi
to make a breakthrough.

233
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:13,799
I think this method

234
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,760
is effective.

235
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,559

236
00:10:20,239 --> 00:10:21,320
I'm afraid that it will not work

239
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,239
If Shen Zhengyi

240
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,679
competes alone,

241
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,239
I'm afraid that

242
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,000
she would be exhausted by
Eunkyung Choi in the halfway,

243
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,159

If he makes it,

324
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,000
then you will fail.

00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:19,599
What happened?

346
00:16:20,599 --> 00:16:21,719
I guess he practiced too much

347
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,719
because of too much stress.

348
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,599
Fine.

349
00:16:24,719 --> 00:16:25,479
I'll see him tomorrow.

350
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:26,479
Don't do that.

351
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,080
He just strained his muscle.
It is no big deal.

352
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,119
He'll be fine after
taking a few days off.

353
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,119
I just wanted to give you a heads-up.

354
00:16:31,479 --> 00:16:32,479
Don't give too much stress

355
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:33,200
to yourself.

356
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,599
Moreover, it's not appropriate for you

357
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:35,320
to see him at this moment.

358
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:36,599
The whole Flyer team

359
00:16:36,719 --> 00:16:37,719
is treating you like the enemy now.

360
00:16:39,119 --> 00:16:40,080
I know about Li Mi.

361
00:16:40,239 --> 00:16:41,080
He's not that kind of person.

362
00:16:41,359 --> 00:16:42,080
You know about him.

363
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,119
I also know about Flyer.

364
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:44,320
Let me tell you.

365
00:16:44,479 --> 00:16:45,200
They're busy to study

366
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,320
your technical moves.

367
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,119
Do you believe it?

368
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:49,000
Be good.

369
00:16:49,479 --> 00:16:50,119
Don't practice anymore.

370
00:16:50,599 --> 00:16:51,440
Go back and take some rest.

371
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:52,479
Bye bye.

372
00:16:52,599 --> 00:16:53,359
Bye bye.

373

(This opportunity)

374
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:27,239
(was yours for sure.)

375
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:28,839
(Shao Beisheng had done the Triple Axel)

376
00:17:28,959 --> 00:17:29,719
(and Quadruple)

377
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:30,479
(just after switching the event.)

378
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,199
(You work harder than he does)

379
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:32,319
(or you're more talented than he is?)

380
00:17:32,479 --> 00:17:33,479
(You even helped him train!)

381
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,359
Did you finish practicing?

(Tai He Engineering University)
(Flyer Ice Sports Team)

383
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,560
You're hobbling.

384
00:17:45,479 --> 00:17:46,319
Why are you here?

385
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,359
I heard someone

386
00:17:47,479 --> 00:17:48,839
got hurt by practicing too much.

387
00:17:49,199 --> 00:17:50,079
So I'm here to visit him.

388
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,119
You shall be careful.

389
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,719
Don't get yourself really hurt.

390
00:17:53,959 --> 00:17:54,479
Then I'll

391
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:55,920
win easily in the Asian Cup.

392
00:17:57,599 --> 00:17:58,680
Where did you hurt?

393
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,599
What?

394
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:01,959
Everyone is striving for

395

this opportunity.

396

You still have time to care about me.

397

Do you think

398
00:18:06,479 --> 00:18:07,479
you are certain to win?

399
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,160

400
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:11,479
Go back.

401
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,479
I won't give you

402

(a lot of attention from skating fans.)

you'll do whatever

you usually practice.

416

(Why do I say so?)

455
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,160
(Because he switched the event
from Pairs Skating)

(to Single Skating.)

(even in the warm-up stage.)

462
00:21:07,439 --> 00:21:08,319
(I believe it will put)

463
00:21:08,439 --> 00:21:09,400
(a great pressure on other players)

464
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,280

(suddenly hit each other.)

00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,880
(I wonder how he is now.)

478
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,920
(Is it going to affect)

479
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:44,959
(his following performance?)

480
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,280
Get up.

481
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,560
Alright, just press here.

482
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,319
Thank you.

483
00:22:13,439 --> 00:22:13,959
I'm fine, I'm fine.

484
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,760
How do you feel like?

485
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:16,640
Are you dizzy?

486
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,520
Do you want to vomit?

487
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,040
Nothing, I feel good.

488
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:22,040
Doctor Liu.

489
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,160
Can he continue to skate?

490
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,439
Now although it seems

491
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,400
to be a skin trauma,

492
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:27,560
I advise Ma to

493
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,319
send him to hospital

494
00:22:28,439 --> 00:22:29,560
to have a CT scan of the brain.

495
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,920
There's no need to go to the hospital.

496
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:33,880
And I'm about to...

497
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,640
Hurry up!

498
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:36,040
Why are you all around here?

499
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,160
What are you doing here? Just go!

500
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,439
The ambulance has already arrived.
Hurry up!

501
00:22:38,479 --> 00:22:39,199
Go to the hospital. Let's go!

502
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,160
I will not go to the hospital.

503
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,199
The competition is about to start.

504
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,560
It's almost my turn. There's no time.

505
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,199
You are so badly hurt.
How can you compete?

506
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,079
You don't want to live?

507
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:46,040
Right, Beisheng.

508
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:46,760
You still have to go to the hospital.

509
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,400
Go to the hospital to check
if you hurt yourself.

510
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,439
Right.

511
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,959
So I will not attend the contest,
right?

512
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,640
I said that I'm fine.

513
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,760
Now I have stopped the bleeding.

514
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,400
Why can't I compete?

515
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,319
What kind of injury did you have?

516
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,400
You have had a head injury.

517
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,560
What do you think of this competition?

518
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,319
This is Figure Skating.

519
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,800
You thought you'd go on for a walk

520
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,439
and that's it?

521
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,560
You may feel dizzy when

522
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,439
you have done the Quadruple.

523
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,800
Who's responsible if you hit the ice?

524
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,520
I am responsible.

525
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,199
I am responsible for it, okay?

526
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,680
I know about

527
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,920
my body clearly.

528
00:23:12,439 --> 00:23:14,199
I can finish the whole show.

529
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:20,160
Alright, I promise you.

530
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:21,439
After I attend the contest,
I'll go to the hospital.

531
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,040
Why are you so stubborn?

532
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,160
You have plenty of
opportunities for contests afterwards.

533
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,199
Do you have to compete today?

534
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,439
The most important thing is your health,

535
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,560
rather than today's contest.
Do you understand?

536
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,760
What are you thinking, Ma?

537
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,319
What do you mean by today's contest
is not the most important thing?

538
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,439
I've been practicing for so long,

539
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,160
and I have had all the injuries.

540
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,280
Aren't they all for today?

541
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,400
I suffered the serious injury

542
00:23:42,439 --> 00:23:43,160
before.

543
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,439
We all made it through as well.

544
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,920
I missed an opportunity,

545
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,439
and I don't want to miss another one.

546
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,280
Give me the change for
the last 2 min 40 sec,

547
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,640
okay?

548
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,760
Let him skate.

549
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,079
But Shao Beisheng, you promise me that

550
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,040
if you feel uncomfortable,

551
00:24:25,959 --> 00:24:27,439
you must stop immediately.

552
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,439
Understand?

553
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:43,880
Take the skating shoes.

554
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:21,560
(Then next,)

555
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,640
(everyone,)

556
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,560
(let's check out)

557
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,680
(Li Mi 268.62)
(Li Mi's score.)

558
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,160
(Alright, we have the scores now.)

559
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,439
(268.62.)

560
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,680
(Currently, his score is)

561
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,280
(much higher than that of second place.)

562
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,040
(He's almost secured)

563
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,079
(the championship.)

564
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,439
(So the last player)

565
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,280
(who will be on the rink)

566
00:26:39,439 --> 00:26:41,040
(is Shao Beisheng who got injured)

567
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,319
(in warm-up stage.)

568
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,319
(We all know)

569
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,640
(he will perform with an injury.)

570
00:26:44,959 --> 00:26:45,880
(What performance)

571
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,560
(will he have?)

572
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,959
(Let's look forward to it.)

573
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,880
Shao Beisheng, fighting!

574
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:54,160
Beisheng, fighting!

575
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:59,719
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

576
00:27:20,199 --> 00:27:21,520
(Shao Beisheng,
after he got on the rink,)

577
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,880
(let's see how his moves)

578
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,520
(will be.)

579
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,280
(This player...)

580
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,920
(I think his artistic expressiveness)

581
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:27,439
(has always been very strong.)

582
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,920
(And the quality of pushing off the ice)

583
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,439
(has been the best among)

584
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,959
(all Single Skating
players today.)

585
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,079
(After a few glides,)

586
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:10,920
(Shao Beisheng)

587
00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:12,800
(will perform his first difficult move.)

588
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:13,800
(Let's see.)

589
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:24,959
(Nice! This is)

590
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:26,400
(Quadruple Toe Loop Jump.)

591
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,280
(Very perfect.)

592
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,040
(A perfect air posture.)

593
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,520
(A clean and nice landing.)

594
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,319
(A beautiful arc.)

595
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,560
(Cool! Beisheng.)

596
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:34,640
Nice.

597
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,439
(This Quadruple Toe Loop Jump)

598
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,680
(can be regarded as)

599
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,880
(an excellent)

600
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:41,520
(gliding technique.)

601
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,560
(It not only helped improve)

602
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,520
(his gliding speed,)

603
00:28:43,719 --> 00:28:45,239
(but also increased
the height of jumping,)

604
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,439
(the time on air,)

605
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,760
(and the distance of landing.)

606
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,199
(The whole moves look)

607
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:50,359
(so smooth.)

608
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,280
(Then next,)

609
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:51,920
(let's see)

610
00:28:51,959 --> 00:28:53,160
(how Shao Beisheng's other)

611
00:28:53,199 --> 00:28:53,920
(difficult moves)

612
00:28:53,959 --> 00:28:54,680
(will be.)

613
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,800
(This spinning move)

614
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,959
(seems out of control.)

615
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,520
(This is impossible for...)

616
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,400
Shao Beisheng.

617
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,079
It's okay.

618
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:02,800
(high-level players.)

619
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,640
(Objectively speaking,)

620
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,520
(for Shao Beisheng,)

621
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,319
(the injury he had
before the competition)

622
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,560
(has affected)

623
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,520
(his performance)

624
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,760
(a lot.)

625
00:29:09,439 --> 00:29:11,079
- Shao Beisheng.
- Fighting!

626
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,760
- Shao Beisheng.
- Fighting!

627
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,920
(Can he complete the)

628
00:29:14,959 --> 00:29:16,079
(following performance?)

629
00:29:16,439 --> 00:29:17,760
(The current status of Shao Beisheng)

630
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,319
(has indeed)

631
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,000
(made me)

632
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:20,719
(and the audience)

633
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,079
(very nervous.)

634
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,040
(We can see him working very hard)

635
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,040
(to adjust)

636
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,760
(and find his own pace.)

637
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,000
(Fighting, Beisheng.)

638
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,040
Fighting!

639
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,400
(Director,)

640
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,760
(I just want to keep proving)

641
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,800
(my value on the skating.)

642
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,239
(With only a Triple Axel,)

643
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,400
(it doesn't mean)

644
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,040
(you will be eligible
for single skating.)

645
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,280
(What if I guarantee for him?)

646
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,560
You want to keep practicing,

647
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,959
or you are afraid and don't
practice anymore.

648
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,959
I'm not afraid.

649
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,160
(I have told you that)

650
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,160
(whatever decision you make,)

651
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,160
(I'm here for you.)

652
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,800
Li Mi has done the Quadruple.

653
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,160
I'm too far behind him.

654
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,160
Do you give up?

655
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:01,880
I'm telling you that

656
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,880
there is no such word

657
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,160
in my dictionary.

658
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,719
I will not surrender.

659
00:30:05,719 --> 00:30:07,079
I will not give up.

660
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,199
It's really important to me.

661
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,520
Beisheng.

662
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,520
You're a good skater,

663
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,800
but I have made my decision.

664
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:13,680
Sorry.

665
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:14,920
Good luck.

666
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:15,959
(I think Shao Beisheng)

667
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:16,920
(is better retired.)

668
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:18,199
(He can retire with glory.)

669
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:18,880
(Isn't it good?)

670
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,560
(Shao Beisheng.)

671
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,719
(I'm afraid you're going
to be at the bottom.)

672
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:24,640
(Do you really think)

673
00:30:24,719 --> 00:30:25,520
(you're Prince Sheng?)

674
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,719
(He'll lose anyway.)

675
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,000
(Maybe we shall ask someone to)

676
00:30:28,199 --> 00:30:28,959
(talk him out of it.)

677
00:30:30,239 --> 00:30:30,760
I have to do

678
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,959
high-quality Triple Axel

679
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:32,680
and Quadruple,

680
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,719
and defeat Curry's student

681
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:35,439
in the Asian Cup.

682
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:36,760
Make him regret.

683
00:30:39,479 --> 00:30:40,000
What can Short Track Speed Skating

684
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,479
help with Figure Skating?

685
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,760
You said before

686
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:45,520
if I can use the

687
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,560
accelerated speed of
Short Track Speed Skating,

688
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,920
I can definitely jump higher

689
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,599
and farther.

690
00:30:59,239 --> 00:30:59,920
(I think)

691
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:00,760
(it might be really)

692
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,920
(my way to make a breakthrough.)

693
00:31:20,439 --> 00:31:22,079
(Triple Toe Loop Jump.)

694
00:31:22,439 --> 00:31:24,239
(Oh, my goodness. It's incredible.)

695
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,560
(It's so incredible.)

696
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:27,079
(Shao Beisheng has done)

697
00:31:27,199 --> 00:31:28,479
(Quadruple Toe Loop Jump)

698
00:31:28,719 --> 00:31:30,239
(followed by Triple Toe Loop Jump.)

699
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,000
(And he has)

700
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:33,079
(done)

701
00:31:33,479 --> 00:31:33,920
(such a difficult jump)

702
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,000
(with an injury.)

703
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,199
(He is indeed an)

704
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:37,760
(admirable player.)

705
00:31:38,199 --> 00:31:39,119
(So far, it is the)

706
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:39,880
(most perfect jump)

707
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,760
(in the whole competition.)

708
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,359
(Looks like Li Mi's
strong rival tonight)

709
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:45,280
(has appeared.)

710
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,040
(And friends who are
familiar with Shao Beisheng)

711
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:47,560
(should know)

712
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,160
(he has made)

713
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,920
(a really great progress.)

714
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,239
(A male athlete)

715
00:31:51,239 --> 00:31:53,239
(can be so successful)

716
00:31:53,239 --> 00:31:54,560
(after switching from
Pairs Skating to Single Skating.)

717
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,959
(It's really amazing!)

718
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:07,359
Nice.

719
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,040
Great.

720
00:32:42,439 --> 00:32:43,880
(Alright, the results have come out.)

721
00:32:44,199 --> 00:32:44,959
(His total score is)

722
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,119
(270.39.)

723
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:48,439
(So Shao Beisheng)

724
00:32:48,439 --> 00:32:49,520
(has won the championship
of the competition)

725
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,439
(by two scores.)

726
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:52,719
(Let's congratulate Shao Beisheng)

727
00:32:52,719 --> 00:32:53,920
(again!)

728
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:54,959
(Congratulations.)

729
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,160
(This is indeed a)

730
00:32:56,239 --> 00:32:59,079
(gold medal with a special meaning.)

731
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:25,839
Beisheng.

732
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,800
My son is very good.

733
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:51,079
Awesome.

734
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,330
(Lingbei First People's Hospital)

735
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,719
Okay, are you ready?

736
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:02,000
Once more.

737
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:08,719
Let's start!

738
00:34:10,919 --> 00:34:12,520
Congratulations to the

739
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:14,280
Men's Single Skating champion

740
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:15,520
of the Asian Cup,

741
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,239
Shao Beisheng from Wind Chaser.

742
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,520
Hello.

743
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:21,520
Hello.

744
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:22,919
Congratulations!

745
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,520
Thank you.

746
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,840
Thank you very much.

747
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,520
It's okay.

748
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:27,239
I have often watched you skate.

749
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:28,280
You really did a great job.

750
00:34:28,479 --> 00:34:29,159
I didn't think you

751
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,199
skated so well even with an injury.

752
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:31,080
You are so talented.

753
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:31,760
Thank you.

754
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:32,560
Fighting.

755
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:33,760
Make sure that you keep going.

756
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,399
Thank you.

757
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:35,479
After joining the national team,

758
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,520
I will definitely keep trying

759
00:34:36,919 --> 00:34:37,719
and win honor for the country.

760
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:38,800
Thank you everyone.

761
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:44,760
Okay.

762
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,320
Once more.

763
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,560
Come on.

764
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,439
Only the sixth time.

765
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,520
Once more.

766
00:34:49,959 --> 00:34:51,040
Why don't we just stop?

767
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,760
You have ruined these flowers.

768
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:53,800
These are fake. Come on.

769
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:55,080
The doctor suggested you

770
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,080
to take a rest.

771
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,040
Don't play.

772
00:34:57,959 --> 00:34:58,439
I'm okay.

773
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,719
I'm not dizzy anymore.

774
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,239
And didn't the doctor say that

775
00:35:01,959 --> 00:35:04,239
the checking report is fine.

776
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,320
Once more.

777
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,600
Okay?

778
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,320
I'm angry.

779
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:15,000
Why are you angry?

780
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,600
You don't listen to me anymore.

781
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,280
Alright.

782
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,000
Then, I don't see the medal.

783
00:35:21,479 --> 00:35:21,840
I see you.

784
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Is it okay to see you?

785
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,959
Just have a smile.

786
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,760
Have a smile.

787
00:35:31,479 --> 00:35:33,080
I have won the champion of Asian Cup,

788
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:34,040
but you don't even smile.

789
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:35,199
Be happy.

790
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:38,040
How can I be happy?

791
00:35:38,479 --> 00:35:39,520
I was scared to death.

792
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,399
Can you not...?

793
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,239
Yes.

794
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,000
I know this competition

795
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,239
is very important for you.

796
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,000
But you need to understand

797
00:35:51,439 --> 00:35:52,600
no matter what medals

798
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:53,320
or competitions are,

799
00:35:53,439 --> 00:35:54,000
they are

800
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,239
not as important as your safety for me.

801
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,399
I see.

802
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,760
One more time, the last time.

803
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,439
Come on.

804
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,600
Please come in.

805
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,800
I'll go and find out

806
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,520
why Coach Zhuang has not come yet.

807
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:31,800
You guys talk.

808
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:34,479
Thank you.

809
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:43,520
You won the champion

810
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:45,040
and joined the national team.

811
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:47,000
Congratulations!

812
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,679
Thank you.

813
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,320
Are you okay?

814
00:36:58,479 --> 00:36:59,159
It's okay.

815
00:36:59,959 --> 00:37:00,679
Just the skin trauma.

816
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,800
I'll be fine soon.

817
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:04,719
You can skate like this with an injury.

818
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,840
I'm convinced that I lost to you.

819
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:11,159
As you lost,

820
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,239
you just admit it.

821
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,520
Alright, you can win the championship
next time.

822
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,520
What's the point?

823
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,239
I have won so many championships
these two years,

824
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:23,560
but I lost to you

825
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:25,679
in the most important competition.

826
00:37:29,239 --> 00:37:29,919
Shao Beisheng.

827
00:37:30,479 --> 00:37:31,560
Actually, I'm kind of jealous of you.

828
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,239
Why...

829
00:37:34,479 --> 00:37:35,239
Why have you always made
your dreams come true

830
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,719
since you were a kid?

831
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,959
‍Of course not.

832
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,080
I wanted to make an achievement

833
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:43,439
in Pairs Skating before,

834
00:37:43,959 --> 00:37:44,760
I ended up hurting my hand.

835
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,840
After switching the event,

836
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,399
I want to train with

837
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,040
Curry in Russia desperately,

838
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,439
but I didn't get picked.

839
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:57,080
We all have setbacks.

840
00:37:58,479 --> 00:37:59,239
But if

841
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,520
I was depressed back then,

842
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,679
today I cannot

843
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,520
get the opportunity

844
00:38:03,919 --> 00:38:05,520
of getting into national team from you.

845
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:06,919
Right?

846
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Are you trying to comfort me?

847
00:38:11,399 --> 00:38:12,760
This is called provocation.

848
00:38:13,399 --> 00:38:14,520
Do you know provocation?

849
00:38:16,439 --> 00:38:17,040
We athletes

850
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:18,679
are making progress by

851
00:38:18,959 --> 00:38:19,719
competing, right?

852
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:22,719
I have taken it from you today.

853
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:24,520
Tomorrow you'll take it

854
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,520
from me by your strength.

855
00:38:27,479 --> 00:38:28,199
On the skating rink,

856
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,280
it's fine that you can treat me as

857
00:38:30,399 --> 00:38:31,239
an enemy.

858
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,399
But you have to remember,

859
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,719
we are brothers off the rink.

860
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:44,000
Fatty Shao.

861
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:46,439
Then you'll wait for me

862
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,280
in national team.

863
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Don't keep me waiting too long.

864
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,800
Running Nose Li.

865
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,800
(Lingbei University)

866
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,000
Have you remembered
this Wishing Fountain?

867
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,800
Yes. I threw the coins
for a long time that day.

868
00:39:16,959 --> 00:39:17,800
Even with the last one,

869
00:39:17,959 --> 00:39:18,719
I cannot hit it.

870
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:20,320
Attention!

871
00:39:24,439 --> 00:39:25,000
You guess what it is?

872
00:39:25,479 --> 00:39:26,080
What is it?

873
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,080
A handful of coins.

874
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:30,520
I'm telling you.

875
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,439
You are definitely going to hit it.

876
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,040
Don't you remember

877
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:34,520
it is a Wishing Fountain of love?

878
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,760
So what?

879
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,239
As long as it can make wishes come true,

880
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,280
it is a good fountain.

881
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,679
You did excellent in

882
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:41,280
last qualification contest.

883
00:39:41,399 --> 00:39:42,399
I think the fountain has its credit.

884
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,280
Look.

885
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:45,959
Here I go.

886
00:39:52,479 --> 00:39:53,600
Just one hit. See?

887
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,320
So,

888
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,239
our Zhengyi

889
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,080
cam win the gold medal,

890
00:39:57,399 --> 00:39:58,479
and sweep away all obstacles

891
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,520
in the Asian Cup.

892
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,080
I think that

893
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:02,600
it has nothing

894
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,760
with this fountain.

895
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,760
Maybe the Victory Cake

896
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,239
works better.

897
00:40:06,959 --> 00:40:07,600
The Victory Cake?

898
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,760
I have

899
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,000
a Victory Cake as well.

900
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,439
Come on.

901
00:40:16,919 --> 00:40:17,439
What other things

902
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,000
have you prepared?

903
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:18,719
Let me take a look.

904
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,679
And this...

905
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,679
a love hug

906
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,000
devoted by Shao Beisheng,

907
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,000
and exclusive to Shen Zhengyi.

908
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,439
This Wishing Fountain and Victory Cake

909
00:40:31,479 --> 00:40:32,360
are blessings.

910
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,239
What's this?

911
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:36,600
I, Shao Beisheng,

912
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,120
am a Single Skating

913
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:38,919
champion.

914
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,280
I give you a warm hug.

915
00:40:41,399 --> 00:40:43,000
Isn't it worth more luck
than these two?

916
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,719
Come on.

917
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:46,760
Thank you.

918
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,080
I'm looking forward to your performance
on the next week's competition.

919
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,159
2 min 31 sec.

920
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,320
Shen Zhengyi,

921
00:41:02,879 --> 00:41:04,399
your best result so far.

922
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,639
But Eunkyung Choi's best result

923
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,120
is 2 min 27 sec.

924
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:09,679
There's a four-second difference

925
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,560
between your best result and hers.

926
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:12,679
But some person is a competitive player

927
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,679
who can perform better on the race,

928
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,520
and someone is a training player

929
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,080
whose competition performance is

930
00:41:17,239 --> 00:41:18,439
worse than that in training.

931
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,840
How about Eunkyung Choi?

932
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:21,600
What kind of player is she?

933
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,080
Eunkyung Choi has very good

934
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:24,919
psychological quality,

935
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:27,439
and she has been performing steadily
in the contests.

936
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:36,879
Luo Xiaoyi.

937
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,199
Xiaoyi.

938
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,719
If I cooperate with Zhengyi,

939
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,719
will our odds of winning

940
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,320
be increased?

941
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,560
I'll put all of resources

942
00:41:57,719 --> 00:41:59,159
onto you.

943
00:41:59,439 --> 00:42:00,080
I will let Yu Bingling

944
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:01,080
assist you.

945
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,120
Thank you for your kindness.

946
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,679
But I think Flyer is not

947
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,360
