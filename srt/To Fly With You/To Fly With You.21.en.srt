=Episode 21=

3
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:38,760
Everyone. Everyone.

4
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:39,959
She'll be here in a second.

5
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:41,040
Please,

6
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,400
it all depends on today.

7
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,199
Do me a favor.

8
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,080
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

9
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:46,400
Come on. Let's hurry up.

10
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:48,800
Speed up, everyone.

11
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,440
Put that away.

12
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,559
Hurry up.

13
00:01:51,559 --> 00:01:52,559
Why is this flower on the ground?

14
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:54,879
Well... Well...

15
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:55,879
Balloon! Balloon!

16
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,360
I'll take this.

17
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:59,160
So who will Shao Beisheng confess to?

18
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,199
Shen Zhengyi?

19
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:01,720
I heard that they broke up.

20
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:03,199
Then who would he confess to?

21
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,080
None of my business.

22
00:02:04,199 --> 00:02:05,199
We will know once she gets here.

23
00:02:15,399 --> 00:02:16,639
Calling Wang Jun. Calling Wang Jun.

24
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:17,759
How's the lighting there?

25
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,720
It's been ready for a while.

26
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,960
You can count on me.

27
00:02:21,279 --> 00:02:22,080
Love is like a streak of light.

28
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:23,080
I...

29
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,039
I am not complaining,

30
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,080
but aren't these balloons

31
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:32,600
too tacky?

32
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,600
What?

33
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,399
Don't try to copy me

34
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,199
when you confess.

35
00:02:39,399 --> 00:02:40,080
To be honest,

36
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,440
are you super nervous now?

37
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,320
Your heartbeat reaches 180.

38
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:44,839
Am I that timid?

39
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:47,880
Alright.

40
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,399
Everything is ready.

41
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,960
We can just wait for
the coming of Shen Zhengyi.

42
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:52,960
Wait.

43
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:54,399
I brought you

44
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:55,520
lots of people.

45
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,160
Come here, come here.

46
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,160
Come, hurry up.

47
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,759
- Go, go, go!
- Hurry up.

48
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:02,720
Lead everyone inside.

49
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,399
Okay!

50
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,639
Go, go, go, hurry up.

51
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,839
We are all here.

52
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,039
Fighting!

53
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:07,960
What are you doing?

54
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,080
Don't you need some men to

55
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,240
cheer you up when you confess?

56
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,440
Thanks, bro.

57
00:03:18,839 --> 00:03:19,440
Time is up.

58
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,080
Everyone, action!

59
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:22,759
Let's go!

60
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:40,720
Here she comes.

61
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,279
Turn it on.

62
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,900
♪How many stars are there at night♪

63
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,280
♪My lover is smiling♪

64
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,080
(Be my girlfriend!)
Well, wait.

65
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,960
Don't come close.

66
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:16,160
I... I'm afraid I'd be nervous
when I am watching you.

67
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,399
Let me say it first.

68
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,600
Don't be timid.

69
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:23,720
My friends said girls

70
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,160
all like ritual things.

71
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,079
This... this is my first time
to confess to someone.

72
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:29,720
I don't know

73
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:32,600
if this is good.

74
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,040
But I still tried very hard

75
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,359
to prepare these for you.

76
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:38,839
So...

77
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,800
♪Please close your eyes
and hear me whisper♪

78
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,940
♪I miss you and I like you♪

79
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:47,230
‍♪Cleaner than water and
stronger than wine♪

80
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,200
It's like a fantasy.

81
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,600
I'm going to cry.

82
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,160
If you like me,

83
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,760
can you be my girlfriend?

84
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:08,200
Be together, be together, be together.

85
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,040
I'll do you a favor.

86
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:15,359
Be together, be together.

87
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,160
I do.

88
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,160
Why is Xiao Qing here?

89
00:05:32,359 --> 00:05:32,839
Xiao...

90
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,920
Hug, hug, hug.

91
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,920
It's wrong.

92
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:37,600
Withdraw.

93
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:39,519
Terrible, something is wrong.

94
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,559
Hug! Hug!

95
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:41,959
Xiao...

96
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:48,480
No mistake!

97
00:05:50,679 --> 00:05:51,720
Where is Shen Zhengyi?

98
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:52,600
Well, at such critical moment,

99
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,399
where is she?

100
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,160
This is a huge mistake.

101
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,480
Coach Xiao,

102
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:08,119
what are we doing here

103
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:09,160
if we don't train?

104
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,119
Didn't you ask me why

105
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,880
you cannot improve

106
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,839
your record in 1500m race?

107
00:06:14,119 --> 00:06:15,000
Actually, 1500m

108
00:06:15,119 --> 00:06:16,079
is like this long run.

109
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:17,600
You should pay attention
to the average pace

110
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,480
and rhythm.

111
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,480
You have to know

112
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,480
when you should speed up,

113
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,600
when you should follow,

114
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:22,600
when you should sprint,

115
00:06:23,359 --> 00:06:24,760
and how to drain the opponent's energy.

116
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,880
If players on the court

117
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,359
can't analyze their own strengths

118
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:29,000
and weakness,

119
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:30,519
they can be easy to get confused
by the opponents.

120
00:06:33,119 --> 00:06:33,880
Luo Xiaoyi.

121
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,480
The way for a player

122
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,600
to get to know yourself

123
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,880
is by comparison,

124
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,239
so you can draw the
most correct conclusion.

125
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,480
From today on,

126
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,839
you two train together.

127
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,399
Okay.

128
00:06:57,119 --> 00:06:58,160
It's the same to train alone

129
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,079
or train with another one person.

130
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,480
Xiaoyi, thank you

131
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:05,279
for accepting me to train with you.

132
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,480
Okay.

133
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:08,480
Hurry to warm up.

134
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:09,959
Okay.

135
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:20,239
Xiao Qing.

136
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:22,720
Xiao Qing.

137
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,880
Xiao Qing, can you just let me explain?

138
00:07:29,359 --> 00:07:30,079
Xiao Qing.

139
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,359
Xiao Qing, can you just give me

140
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,519
a chance to explain?

141
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,640
What else do you want to explain?

142
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:42,359
I'm sorry.

143
00:07:43,239 --> 00:07:44,000
I am really, really

144
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:44,880
sorry.

145
00:07:46,359 --> 00:07:46,760
I didn't expect

146
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,000
that you would come in at that moment.

147
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:48,640
I...

148
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,600
I... I didn't blame you.

149
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,760
I mean, it was my fault.

150
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,760
I... I was too nervous.

151
00:07:52,119 --> 00:07:52,839
And all the lights in the Skating Rink

152
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:53,640
were off.

153
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:55,119
I just saw a figure

154
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,119
and I thought it was her.

155
00:07:57,359 --> 00:07:57,760
She told me that

156
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:58,480
she'll be at the rink
for extra training.

157
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,600
And I confirmed

158
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,079
by phone in advanced.

159
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:00,640
So who is the person

160
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,359
you want to confess to?

161
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,239
Shen Zhengyi?

162
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:09,640
Right.

163
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,760
Then why did you tell her

164
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,160
you have a crush on someone

165
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,119
and cancel the contract with her?

166
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,119
I wanted to give her a surprise.

167
00:08:24,239 --> 00:08:25,119
So I wanted to make

168
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:25,959
a small misunderstanding first

169
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,119
and then confess to her in public.

170
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:32,080
But I really didn't expect that

171
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,239
this would happen.

172
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:33,880
I didn't know

173
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,960
you would pop in.

174
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,880
There were so many people just now,

175
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,479
so I didn't explain it to you.

176
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,880
I was afraid you would be...

177
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,719
I see.

178
00:08:45,479 --> 00:08:46,239
Very embarrassed.

179
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,840
Xiao Qing.

180
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,080
Oh no.

181
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,359
Zhengyi has not come back yet.

182
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:20,159
Did she know about it?

183
00:09:21,119 --> 00:09:22,599
Qu Zhi didn't answer my calls,

184
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,760
so did Zhengyi.

185
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,640
What shall I do?

186
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,719
Princess Lele,

187
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,119
your popsicles are here.

188
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:31,880
Zhengyi.

189
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,760
Your popsicles are here.

190
00:09:34,479 --> 00:09:35,080
You'd never guess

191
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:36,080
who trained with me today.

192
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,000
Are you okay?

193
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,599
What? What's wrong?

194
00:09:40,119 --> 00:09:41,000
Nothing.

195
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,520
What's wrong?

196
00:09:43,599 --> 00:09:43,960
Did you hide

197
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,080
anything from me?

198
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,239
Tell me.

199
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,640
Forget it. I'll tell you.

200
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,960
You will find out anyway.

201
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:54,080
Sis,

202
00:09:54,479 --> 00:09:55,359
remember,

203
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,119
there are no obstacles in life
that we cannot overcome,

204
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,359
you will always have
my shoulder to lean on.

205
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,479
Okay?

206
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:04,159
What's wrong with you?

207
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:07,239
Shao Beisheng

208
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,559
just confessed his love to Xiao Qing.

209
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:07,479
(Why not me?)

210
00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:09,719
(Why did you do this to me?)

211
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:11,080
(Why did you make me)

212
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:12,640
(the laughingstock of everyone?)

213
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,400
(My phone is out of power,)

214
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,080
(so I just saw your message.)

215
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,320
(It's complicated for Shao Beisheng.)

216
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,080
(Let them figure it out themselves.)

217
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:31,359
(Let's stay out of this.)

218
00:12:06,599 --> 00:12:07,840
(Why didn't you answer my call?)

219
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,280
(At sleep already?)

220
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,760
(Say something.)

221
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:29,440
(Why didn't you come to the rink today?)

222
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,080
(Where did you go?)

223
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,320
(Reply me when you saw this.)

224
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,320
(I need to talk to you.)

225
00:13:02,359 --> 00:13:02,880
(Sorry!)

226
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,840
(The subscriber you dialed
is powered off.)

227
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:41,919
Xiao Qing.

228
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,080
Xiao Qing.

229
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,440
Open the door, Xiao Qing.

230
00:13:58,799 --> 00:13:59,559
Xiao Qing.

231
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:02,320
I'll use the key if you don't open it.

232
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:09,039
What's wrong, brother?

233
00:14:12,599 --> 00:14:13,320
Are you okay?

234
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:14,719
What could possibly happen to me?

235
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,080
Then what about...?

236
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,080
They just fell out,

237
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,320
and I forgot to pack them up.

238
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:22,840
I'll go clean up.

239
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:25,320
I'll do it.

240
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:26,520
You go inside and get some rest.

241
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,080
Thank you, brother.

242
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,280
Are you really okay?

243
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:30,919
I'm really okay.

244
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,400
You go take some rest.

245
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,080
Shao Beisheng.

246
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,320
Why didn't you reply to my messages?

247
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,080
Come here.

248
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:58,919
Explain it to me.

249
00:15:01,599 --> 00:15:03,520
There's something I want to tell you.

250
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,440
I've wanted to say it long before.

251
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,039
Say it.

252
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,320
Shao Beisheng, I like you.

253
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:13,400
I know I'm a slow-type.

254
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:14,719
But now,

255
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:15,400
I still don't know

256
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,320
when I fell in love

257
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,200
with you.

258
00:15:17,599 --> 00:15:18,919
But now I know for sure

259
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,200
that I like you.

260
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:24,559
Shen Zhengyi.

261
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,200
What are you doing now?

262
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:26,960
Do you know that

263
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,520
I am already

264
00:15:27,599 --> 00:15:28,559
Xiao Qing's boyfriend?

265
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,559
I thought

266
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:30,599
you would bless us

267
00:15:30,719 --> 00:15:31,599
and be happy for us.

268
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:32,679
But what are you doing now?

269
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:35,080
Are you stealing your
best friend's boyfriend?

270
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,760
I am not.

271
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:38,599
If I knew you would be

272
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:39,679
so evil,

273
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:41,280
I should have kept my distance.

274
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,320
No, Shao Beisheng.

275
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,799
No.

276
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:56,760
Lele, what happened?

277
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:58,880
Zhengyi,

278
00:15:59,039 --> 00:15:59,799
my grandmother got ill,

279
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
and she's very sick now.

280
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:02,119
I have to go back and check on her.

281
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:03,280
I cannot accompany you.

282
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,039
I'm sorry.

283
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,000
I'm fine. I'm fine.

284
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:05,760
Hurry to go back.

285
00:16:06,359 --> 00:16:06,919
Don't worry.

286
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,919
Your grandma will be fine.

287
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,119
Just leave.

288
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,000
I'll help you ask for a leave.

289
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,000
Okay.

290
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:12,919
Be careful.

291
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,000
Be safe.

292
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:15,000
Okay.

293
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,479
(Shen Zhengyi,)

294
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,520
(the most important thing right now)

295
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,359
(is to practice 1500m well,)

296
00:16:29,719 --> 00:16:30,840
(so you should keep distance)

297
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,239
(from Shao Beisheng.)

298
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:52,760
It's 6:19!

299
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:54,239
Qu Zhi, why didn't you wake me up?

300
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:58,039
I did.

301
00:16:59,039 --> 00:16:59,760
You just ignored me.

302
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:00,799
Well, I ignored me...

303
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:02,280
Can't you just keep waking me?

304
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,439
How did I know

305
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,160
if you were too busy worrying last night

306
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:08,920
or wanted to lie down

307
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,040
rather than facing the reality?

308
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:14,760
Where's Li Mi?

309
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,680
After that screw-up yesterday,

310
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,760
he's gone.

311
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,680
He gave me that bad advice,

312
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,040
and he just left.

313
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,640
He didn't tell you to make a mistake.

314
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,040
Did you tell Zhu Lele?

315
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,040
I had something to do with this mess.

316
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,119
If I tell her,

317
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,239
she might break...

318
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,040
mock me, okay?

319
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,040
Do I need to

320
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:34,920
clear this up for you?

321
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:35,520
Alright, alright.

322
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:37,160
You don't have to say it for me.

323
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,680
I'll tell her myself.

324
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:39,640
No.

325
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:45,680
Just let me rinse my mouth first.

326
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,439
Hello, Qu Zhi.

327
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,920
Hello, Lele.

328
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,119
Well, I have something

329
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,040
to tell you.

330
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,640
I can't be with you today.

331
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,760
My grandmother got ill,

332
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:12,800
and I have to go back.

333
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:15,040
Is it serious?

334
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,119
Yes.

335
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,760
I have to go now.

336
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,760
Wait till I get back.

337
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,640
Okay, okay, okay.

338
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,640
Be careful on the road.

339
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,160
Your grandma will be fine.

340
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,640
Shao Beisheng.

341
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:40,680
Xiao Qing.

342
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:41,920
You...

343
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,040
Are you from your dorm?

344
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,920
How's Shen Zhengyi?

345
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,640
She didn't even respond to
my WeChat messages yesterday.

346
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,680
Yesterday I went home.

347
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,119
I'm sorry.

348
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,760
Yesterday it was really my fault

349
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,920
to involve you.

350
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,640
I'm going to find Shen Zhengyi now.

351
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:57,520
Later, I'll

352
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,239
explain everything

353
00:18:58,359 --> 00:18:59,400
to everyone.

354
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,239
Shao Beisheng.

355
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:09,280
Shao Beisheng.

356
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,040
There is something
I would like to ask you.

357
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:11,920
What is it?

358
00:19:12,239 --> 00:19:13,119
Can I finish this

359
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,400
screw-up off myself?

360
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,040
What do you mean?

361
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:18,640
I want to save face, too.

362
00:19:19,439 --> 00:19:20,400
If this thing goes out,

363
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,880
it's going to be awkward for everyone.

364
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,280
I wonder if you could
give me a few days more,

365
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,800
and let me see how to tell everyone.

366
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:25,920
Fine.

367
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:27,760
But can we get this straight

368
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,920
between the three of us?

369
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,280
Because I don't want
Zhengyi to misunderstand.

370
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:30,760
What if she...?

371
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:32,000
Zhengyi.

372
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,640
Zhengyi.

373
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:34,760
I need to talk to you.

374
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,400
I have training to do.

375
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,239
Excuse me.

376
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,040
You talk.

377
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,040
Shen Zhengyi, Shen Zhengyi!

378
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:45,920
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team of
Lingbei University)

379
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:53,119
Didn't you hear about it?

380
00:19:54,479 --> 00:19:55,280
Yesterday,

381
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:56,359
Shao Beisheng from Figure Skating team

382
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,640
confessed to Xiao Qing
at the Skating Rink.

383
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,479
Didn't I post the video
to the chat group?

384
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:03,239
Didn't you see?

385
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:05,479
You sent a dozen of it.

386
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:06,760
Who could miss it?

387
00:20:07,479 --> 00:20:08,239
Isn't Shao Beisheng's girlfriend

388
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:09,280
Shen Zhengyi?

389
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,079
You really know nothing.

390
00:20:11,239 --> 00:20:12,239
Well, you...

391
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,119
What are you doing?

392
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:16,239
Warm up.

393
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:24,199
Zhengyi.

394
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:26,880
Coach Xiao.

395
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,280
You're about to train

396
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:30,079
with Xiaoyi.

397
00:20:30,199 --> 00:20:31,280
Her training's intensity is much higher.

398
00:20:31,479 --> 00:20:32,119
You have to keep up.

399
00:20:33,239 --> 00:20:34,000
Got it.

400
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:36,400
If you want to do well in Ling Yun Cup,

401
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,880
you need to prepare for the game
with nothing else on your mind.

402
00:20:38,199 --> 00:20:38,880
Understand?

403
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:41,119
Don't worry.

404
00:20:42,239 --> 00:20:43,079
Good luck.

405
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:50,479
Hurry.

406
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,479
You're back early today.

407
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:11,119
Since I promised to do

408
00:21:11,239 --> 00:21:12,359
simultaneous entry,

409
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:13,719
the amount of training I do every day

410
00:21:13,959 --> 00:21:14,760
has been doubled.

411
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,239
So tired.

412
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:19,119
As long as you can adapt it.

413
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:37,760
Right.

414
00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:39,359
I have to check my homework, too.

415
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:41,640
I may have typos in it.

416
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,680
Zhengyi,

417
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,400
this morning Shao Beisheng and I

418
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,319
came for you,

419
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,520
just because we were trying
to explain it to you.

420
00:22:25,239 --> 00:22:26,280
You don't have to explain to me

421
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:27,839
about you and him.

422
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:30,560
You can't say so.

423
00:22:34,239 --> 00:22:35,079
After all, others don't know

424
00:22:35,239 --> 00:22:36,239
about your agreement,

425
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,520
and don't know you two

426
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:38,760
broke up either.

427
00:22:40,239 --> 00:22:41,560
He confessed his love to me.

428
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,319
People will definitely
talk behind your back.

429
00:22:47,239 --> 00:22:48,199
In fact, Shao Beisheng

430
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:49,719
still cares about you.

431
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,079
You are

432
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:55,079
more than just a friend to him.

433
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:04,760
But now we are

434
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,079
just friends.

435
00:23:07,239 --> 00:23:07,839
Don't worry.

436
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,520
I will definitely keep

437
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,400
distance from him,

438
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,040
and I won't let others misunderstand.

439
00:23:12,719 --> 00:23:13,800
I didn't mean anything else.

440
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:15,800
It's okay.

441
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,760
You go on with your homework.

442
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,839
Shen Zhengyi.

443
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,719
Shen Zhengyi, listen to me.

444
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,800
Xiao Qing and I are really not...

445
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,000
I don't care about

446
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:21,959
the thing between you and her.

447
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,199
Also,

448
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:24,479
don't bother me

449
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,359
anymore.

450
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:28,560
Shen Zhengyi.

451
00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:05,800
(Why wouldn't you)

452
00:25:05,959 --> 00:25:07,359
(listen to me?)

453
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,040
(Delete contacts of Shao Beisheng.)

454
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,280
What is going on in there?

455
00:26:06,239 --> 00:26:07,400
Why do you think she's back

456
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,319
in the middle of the night?

457
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,520
You go inside and ask her.

458
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:14,839
Zhengyi.

459
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,520
Zhengyi, where are you going?

460
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:22,199
I'll drop something and be right back.

461
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,880
Why did she throw away the dolls?

462
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:33,839
Aren't they

463
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,280
the dolls that were got the other day

464
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:37,239
when she went out to buy ice creams?

465
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,280
She loves them very much, doesn't she?

466
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:39,839
Why did she throw them away?

467
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,359
Didn't.

468
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:48,839
You didn't throw them away?

469
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:50,359
Good, good.

470
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,479
Zhengyi,

471
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:54,000
why are your eyes red?

472
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,319
Nothing.

473
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,199
Is there anything wrong with you?

474
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:57,319
You need to talk to mom and dad.

475
00:26:57,719 --> 00:26:58,359
Right, is there anything

476
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,199
you want to tell us?

477
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,040
No.

478
00:27:00,239 --> 00:27:01,319
I just came back to get my stuff.

479
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,319
I... I will go to sleep.

480
00:27:02,479 --> 00:27:03,319
You go to bed, too.

481
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:04,839
Let me help you.

482
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:05,400
Don't bother.

483
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,520
I'll go to bed soon.

484
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,479
Good night.

485
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,640
Do you think

486
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:41,839
she's in a relationship?

487
00:27:42,719 --> 00:27:43,479
That's impossible.

488
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,079
Absolutely impossible.

489
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:47,319
Why is it impossible?

490
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:49,319
The reason why a girl at her age

491
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,359
is so emotional

492
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:53,079
is either arguing with boyfriend,

493
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:55,079
or breaking up with boyfriend.

494
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,199
My Yiyi

495
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,479
won't fall in love with someone.

496
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,760
All Yiyi has in her mind

497
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:03,079
is skating.

498
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:04,400
Besides,

499
00:28:04,719 --> 00:28:05,280
she has

500
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,000
me, such

501
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:07,800
an excellent dad,

502
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:09,479
to be with her.

503
00:28:10,239 --> 00:28:10,959
I don't think

504
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:12,400
she can fall in love

505
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,640
with other boys.

506
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:15,040
Quiet!

507
00:28:16,239 --> 00:28:17,199
Why didn't I realize

508
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:18,319
you are so narcissistic?

509
00:28:18,479 --> 00:28:19,599
Boasting yourself in different ways.

510
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,719
So narcissistic!

511
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,199
I was just trying to take the edge off

512
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:25,040
our nerves.

513
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,599
I think maybe

514
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:32,640
her training didn't go well.

515
00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:34,760
You mean there is
something on the team?

516
00:28:35,479 --> 00:28:36,800
I'm just saying.

517
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:38,359
I'm so nervous about this.

518
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,800
Don't give me your nonsense.

519
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:41,079
I'm just afraid that Yiyi

520
00:28:41,239 --> 00:28:42,959
would follow the same path as I.

521

Darling, don't worry.

523
00:28:46,239 --> 00:28:47,280
Zhengyi definitely would not

524
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:48,520
make the same mistakes you made.

525
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,560
Think about it.

526
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,719
Now no matter for the competition

527
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:52,599
or training,

528
00:28:53,239 --> 00:28:54,239
the protection

529
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:55,479
is way better than

530
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,880
what you used to have.

531
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,280

537
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:14,959
Right, we can leave together.

stop!

558

What happened?

559
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,400
Look at your calves.

560
00:30:33,479 --> 00:30:34,199
They're as hard as rocks.

561
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,160
What if you get hurt?

562
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,400
Come down.

563
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,439
I'll give you a relaxing massage.

564
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,160
I know you're anxious to
improve your performance.

565
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,800
But you can't train too much.

566
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,000
My record

567
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:01,199
stays at 2m 45s.

568
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,000
I cannot improve it anyway.

569
00:31:05,479 --> 00:31:06,160
You're not just

570
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,319
suffering from
a lack of muscle strength

571
00:31:07,439 --> 00:31:08,319
and endurance.

572
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:09,400
There is another reason.

573
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,680
Half of the tracks are curves.

574
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,119
Now, your curve skills

575
00:31:12,199 --> 00:31:13,319
are greatly improved,

576
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,560
but it's still your weakness.

577
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:15,599
Isn't it?

578
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,560
Then what should I do?

579
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:22,959
We've already known the problem,

580
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:24,000
so we will do targeted training.

581
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,839
Don't worry. Take your time.

582
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:26,920
You will get the improvement.

I need to ask you something.

602
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,560
I heard you confessed
your love to Xiao Qing.

603
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,560
It was a mistake.

604
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:44,119
It was all my fault.

605
00:32:45,479 --> 00:32:46,199
I confessed...

606
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,920
I confessed to a wrong person.

607
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,479
Actually I wasn't

608
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,479
planning to confess to Xiao Qing.

609
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,280
The person I wanted to confess
to is Shen Zhengyi.

610
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,920
What did you say?

611
00:32:55,479 --> 00:32:56,199
I feel so sorry to Xiao Qing.

612
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,040
I hurt her.

613

But I can guarantee you that

614
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,640
I've never

615
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,000
cheated on anyone's feelings.

616

Shao Beisheng,

619

"from beginning to end".

623

627
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,560
you stood up for your sister.

628
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:19,760
But how can you say

629
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,040
anything about me and Shen Zhengyi?

630
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:22,760
You are an outsider.

631
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,280
How can you make the judgment?

632
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,199
I've already told you.

633
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:26,439
It was a mistake, just a mistake.

634
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,479
A mistake?

635
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:29,280

729
00:38:51,159 --> 00:38:51,840

751
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,159
I got slapped in the face.

752
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:33,840
So you have to listen to

my explanation.

754
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,520
I have nothing to say to you.

756

The one I wanted to confess to

757
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:48,159
is also you.

758
00:40:58,959 --> 00:41:00,040
Are you out of your mind?

759
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:02,719
Do you know

760
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,959
what you are saying?

761
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,520
I...

762
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:13,840
I...

763
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:17,959
Xiao Qing.

764
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,639
Come with me.

765
00:41:21,959 --> 00:41:22,959
Let go of me. You...

766
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,159
Xiao Qing, please explain for me,

767
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:28,840
okay?

768
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:29,639
She wouldn't listen to anything

769
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:30,840
I said right now.

770
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,040
Xiao Qing.

771
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:37,479
What are you doing?

772
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,159
That night,

773
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,280
I gave you a call

774
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,919
and I asked if you would
practice at the rink,

775
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:45,600
right?

776
00:41:45,959 --> 00:41:46,840
Do you remember?

777
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:48,719
That night,

778
00:41:49,479 --> 00:41:51,159
I... I was trying to confess to you.

779
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,040
And after I hung up...

780
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:54,919
After I hung up,

781
00:41:54,959 --> 00:41:55,719
there was a figure appeared.

782
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,600
I thought it was you,

783
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,159
but I didn't expect
it would be Xiao Qing.

784
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,360
I... I know

785
00:42:00,479 --> 00:42:01,159
I was so wrong.

786
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,199
But I have explained

787
00:42:02,399 --> 00:42:02,959
everything

788
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:03,760
to Xiao Qing.

789
00:42:03,919 --> 00:42:04,719
Right, Xiao Qing?

790
00:42:04,919 --> 00:42:06,080
Can you explain it for me?

791
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,399
I'm begging you.

792
00:42:13,959 --> 00:42:14,719
Right.

793
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,520
The confession was an accident.

794
00:42:17,959 --> 00:42:18,399
So I...

795
00:42:18,479 --> 00:42:18,959
But I accepted it

796
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,199
sincerely,

797
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,360
