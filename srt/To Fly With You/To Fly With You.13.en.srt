=Episode 13=

3
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:39,599
Thank you anyway.

4
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,639
You're welcome.

5
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,440
You won't accept them anyway.

6
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:46,480
They are too expensive.

7
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,680
Can you find a way to

8
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,760
return them?

9
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:51,400
Don't worry about the ice skates.

10
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,040
Worry about your training.

11
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,239
Are you still mad at me?

12
00:01:58,839 --> 00:01:59,480
What?

13
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,680
Are you so afraid

14
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:01,800
of me being angry with you?

15
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,680
Of course.

16
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,440
Do you know
how I felt these couple of days...?

17
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,320
Alright, I will not talk to you anymore.

18
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,080
I'm off to bed.

19
00:02:15,679 --> 00:02:16,360
OK.

20
00:02:16,839 --> 00:02:17,360
I'm hanging up now.

21
00:02:18,279 --> 00:02:18,759
Good night.

22
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,839
Shao Beisheng.

23
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,160
What?

24
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,240
Thank you.

25
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,399
Good night.

26
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:46,140
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team
of Lingbei University)

27
00:02:46,559 --> 00:02:47,759
I'll show you a jump.

28
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:49,080
OK.

29
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:01,759
When jumping,

30
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,679
be sure to lift your legs.

31
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,320
OK.

32
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,199
Try it.

33
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:05,520
OK.

34
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:18,600
What's wrong?

35
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,639
Did you strain yourself while jumping?

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,880
I'm fine.

37
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,160
I'll try it again.

38
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,320
Actually, we can do it little by little.

39
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:30,520
I'm worried that if you do it like this,

40
00:03:30,559 --> 00:03:31,479
it's easy to get hurt.

41
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,839
It's okay. I'll just be careful.

42
00:03:36,839 --> 00:03:37,399
But I have to

43
00:03:37,679 --> 00:03:38,399
trouble you

44
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:40,039
to teach me during this period.

45
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,160
Sorry about that.

46
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:43,039
If it weren't for me,

47
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:44,720
you wouldn't have to suffer this.

48
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,399
No, no.

49
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,800
Don't think that way.

50
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,360
Let's go on.

51
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,039
Be careful.

52
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,039
It feels so good

53
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:58,639
to get down on ice with my hand.
I finally made it.

54
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,039
I'll be fully recovered in a few days.

55
00:04:00,559 --> 00:04:02,320
You've made great progress lately.

56
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,360
Shen Zhengyi.

57
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:06,119
Where are you going?

58
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,639
What?

59
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:11,720
Shouldn't you be happy to see me?

60
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,639
Yes.

61
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:13,759
Why did you want to run away?

62
00:04:14,559 --> 00:04:15,800
What bad things have you done?

63
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,200
Nothing.

64
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,160
Calm down.

65
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,160
Can you guys stop acting

66
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:23,239
in front of me?

67
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,239
Isn't it hard to pretend?

68
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,160
‍I know about everything.

69
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:27,320
‍What do you mean?

70
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,839
I already know about
your contractual relationship.

71
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:31,679
Now,

72
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,760
we are on the same boat.

73
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,160
What did you promise me?

74
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,399
I just feel that...

75
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:51,200
I feel that

76
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,359
Lele is like a family.

77
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,040
It's okay to tell her.

78
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,640
Shao Beisheng.

79
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,839
Why did he leave on his own?

80
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,040
Is he mad?

81
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,279
He is too strange with this temper.

82
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,839
Luckily, you are only
in a contractual relationship.

83
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:11,920
It's not his fault.

84
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,679
He is now having a bad time.

85
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,640
I can understand that.

86
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,519
I think you did nothing wrong.

87
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,720
The fake is always the fake.

88
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:18,600
It'll be revealed sooner or later.

89
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:20,359
I'll try to persuade him.

90
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:21,679
Don't worry.

91
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,160
We will get going now.

92
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,239
Okay, bye.

93
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,959
Beisheng.

94
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,920
Are you OK?

95
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,600
Are you injured?

96
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,559
It has nothing to do with the training.

97
00:05:55,239 --> 00:05:56,040
Gotta go.

98
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:17,160
I can now understand

99
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:17,880
why Eunkyung Choi

100
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,839
is so skilled.

101
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:20,320
Why?

102
00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:21,239
What do you think?

103
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:22,359
Of course because of Coach Zhuang.

104
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,239
She's like a devil.

105
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,519
For just a few days,

106
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,480
even my speed

107
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,079
was increased by 0.15 seconds.

108
00:06:27,559 --> 00:06:29,079
I'm almost 0.1 seconds faster.

109
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,640
I got nervous as soon as

110
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,279
I thought about contests,

111
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:32,519
but now I'm getting more confident.

112
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,079
She is really awesome.

113
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:35,440
If she can make me

114
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,959
as fast as Eunkyung Choi,

115
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,000
I would like to double

116
00:06:38,119 --> 00:06:39,519
my amount of training every day.

117
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,679
No, it's enough.

118
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,480
It's better to kill me.

119
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:44,959
Are you stupid?
That will improve yourself.

120
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,359
Zhengyi,

121
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,679
Coach Xiao is so kind to you,

122
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,079
giving you such nice skates.

123
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:55,160
You mean these?

124
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:56,559
‍They were from the team.

125
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:57,760
You may have them

126
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:58,640
if you apply.

127
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,760
Shen Zhengyi,

128
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,679
you don't really think that

129
00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:02,200
Coach Xiao

130
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:03,839
applied for those skates
from the team for you, do you?

131
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,880
Otherwise?

132
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,000
Are you stupid

133
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:10,239
or naive?

134
00:07:10,559 --> 00:07:11,200
Think about it.

135
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,839
Does our team have the budget

136
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,519
to buy a pair of skates for everyone?

137
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,239
That pair of skates was
definitely bought for you

138
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,480
by Coach Xiao.

139
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,040
But Coach Xiao

140
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,200
told me that...

141
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,040
He said so

142
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,559
only because he's nice.

143
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:24,839
He is afraid after telling the truth,

144
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,000
you will feel burdened.

145
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,720
(Coach Xiao is so kind to you,)

146
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,320
(giving you such nice skates.)

147
00:08:01,359 --> 00:08:02,640
(Think about it. Does our team)

148
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,640
(have the budget)

149
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,480
(to buy a pair of skates for everyone?)

150
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:07,480
(That pair of skates was
definitely bought for you)

151
00:08:07,559 --> 00:08:09,040
(by Coach Xiao.)

152
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:13,920
(He's so kind to me)

153
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,119
(and even gave me skates.)

154
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,000
(How can I repay him?)

155
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,000
(Should I ask him now?)

156
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,679
(Well, I'd better wait)

157
00:08:20,679 --> 00:08:21,880
(until I get the championship.)

158
00:08:32,239 --> 00:08:34,000
Zhengyi, what are you drawing?

159
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:35,119
Nothing.

160
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,159
Let me see.

161
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,119
Well, it's better...

162
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,520
Let me see.

163
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,599
This cartoon is so interesting,

164
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,679
and is so well drawn.

165
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,960
Coach?

166
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,000
Is this cartoon image

167
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,239
my brother?

168
00:08:58,239 --> 00:08:59,000
Don't get me wrong.

169
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,159
I've always regarded Coach Xiao

170
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,880
as my idol

171
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:05,440
and the aim I'm fighting for.

172
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,440
Does my brother know about this?

173
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,320
I plan to tell him

174
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,359
when I win the championship.

175
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,320
Why do you have to wait
to win a championship?

176
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:18,239
Without the championship,

177
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:19,320
my brother will also

178
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,760
be very proud of you.

179
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:22,000
Zhengyi,

180
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,119
you have a lot

181
00:09:23,239 --> 00:09:24,599
that I can learn from.

182
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:27,320
‍You are hardworking and tough.

183
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:29,799
But you can also learn

184
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,119
from me sometimes.

185
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,599
I like Shao Beisheng.

186
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,559
I will try to stay with him.

187
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,640
If you

188
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,119
admire my brother,

189
00:09:40,359 --> 00:09:41,840
you should be brave and tell him that.

190
00:09:55,359 --> 00:09:57,119
Come on, hurry up!

191
00:09:57,359 --> 00:09:58,119
It's the aesthetics teacher's class.

192
00:09:58,359 --> 00:09:59,119
You don't want to fail the class,
do you?

193
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,080
Absolutely not.

194
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,080
Then run fast.

195
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,359
Why are you in such a hurry?

196
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:06,559
We have a class of
a tough teacher to attend.

197
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,679
Gotta go.

198
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,520
Come on!

199
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:10,320
Hurry up!

200
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,080
Zhengyi!

201
00:10:41,239 --> 00:10:43,200
What are you doing?

202
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,679
I...

203
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,119
I can't find my sketchbook.

204
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,719
Which one?

205
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,880
The one I carry every day

206
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,320
with the yellow cover.

207
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,760
Think carefully.

208
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,760
Did you leave it somewhere?

209
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,919
Probably not.

210
00:10:56,719 --> 00:10:57,840
Did I drop it?

211
00:10:58,479 --> 00:10:59,239
I'm going to look for it.

212
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:01,440
You can't leave now.

213
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:02,239
The class is about to start.

214
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,159
Take it easy.

215
00:11:03,239 --> 00:11:03,919
Take the class first

216
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,960
and I'll look for it with you
when class is over.

217
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,559
Okay?

218
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,599
Okay class, let's get started.

219
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,760
‍It could be left in the dormitory.

220
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:11,119
Don't worry.

221
00:11:12,119 --> 00:11:13,000
Today's class is about

222
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,520
the evolution of art.

223
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,359
I brought it with me this morning,
right?

224
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,599
I remember you had it with you.

225
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,039
It must have been lost.

226
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,400
I'm leaving now, Ma.

227
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:35,840
Well...

228
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:36,919
Just give me a minute.

229
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,919
I have something for you.

230
00:11:48,599 --> 00:11:50,200
After training, put this on.

231
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,679
Thanks.

232
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,960
You just changed to Single Skating.

233
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:02,000
Take things slow.

234
00:12:16,359 --> 00:12:16,960
Don't worry.

235
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,440
We can follow the same path back,

236
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:19,119
and we will find it.

237
00:12:19,479 --> 00:12:20,039
Excuse me,

238
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:20,640
have you seen

239
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:21,760
a brown notebook?

240
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,719
‍Sorry, I didn't see it.

241
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:23,440
Thanks.

242
00:12:24,479 --> 00:12:25,479
‍It is not in the dorm either.

243
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,320
‍Do you remember

244
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,119
‍where you saw it last time?

245
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:28,760
W‍ell, I really remember

246
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,119
‍ I took it with me this morning.

247
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,359
But where did I drop it?

248
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,520
What happened?

249
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:37,840
Why are you in such a hurry?

250
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,039
She can't find her sketchbook.

251
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,400
What sketchbook?

252
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,400
It's a kind of sketchbook for

253
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,159
drawing pictures.

254
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:45,359
Is it expensive?

255
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:46,840
Why don't you buy another one?

256
00:12:47,239 --> 00:12:48,760
It's not a matter of money.

257
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,000
You wrote a love letter on it?

258
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,039
What are you talking about?

259
00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:53,239
Anyway, I have to find it.

260
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:54,520
The point is that

261
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:55,520
we can't find it now.

262
00:12:56,239 --> 00:12:57,159
It'll be hard.

263
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,359
It's good that she didn't lose herself.

264
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,520
If you don't help,

265
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,840
don't talk about this nonsense.

266
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,719
If you sincerely ask me,

267
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,080
I can help you.

268
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,520
Lele!

269
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,880
What does the notebook look like?

270
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,119
It's a brown one

271
00:13:16,599 --> 00:13:17,880
with an angel unicorn

272
00:13:18,119 --> 00:13:18,919
painted on the cover.

273
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:20,599
What?

274
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:22,520
I gotta go now.

275
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,799
Zhengyi!

276
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,919
An angel unicorn?

277
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:34,799
Where are we going?

278
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:38,479
Help me.

279
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,400
Post them.

280
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:43,239
A notice of lost object?

281
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:45,679
I would never do something

282
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,640
so humiliating.

283
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,200
I'll treat you to a big meal.

284
00:13:52,479 --> 00:13:53,520
I am a man of principle.

285
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,719
Thanks.

286
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,479
Two more.

287
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,840
Plus three limited edition game skins.

288
00:13:58,799 --> 00:13:59,719
You go to the east and I go to the west.

289
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,119
I like to be friends
with people like you

290
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:04,400
who have principles.

291
00:14:05,239 --> 00:14:05,919
Having principles

292
00:14:06,239 --> 00:14:07,080
is my credo in life.

293
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:10,690
(Lost)

294
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,680
(Lost) (A yellow sketchbook.
Reward to the one who finds it.)

295
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,719
It's OK as long as it's not upside down.

296
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:30,400
There are so many more.

297
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,039
Go on.

298
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:43,200
(Lost) (A yellow sketchbook.
Reward to the one who finds it.)

299
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,280
OK, go.

300
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:53,120
(Lost) (A yellow sketchbook.
Reward to the one who finds it.)

301
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,359
Shao Beisheng is definitely
in love with you.

302
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,640
You don't have a fever.

303
00:15:01,719 --> 00:15:02,719
Then what nonsense
are you talking about?

304
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:03,919
Look!

305
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,320
In order to find the sketchbook for you,

306
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,239
he has

307
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,200
posted the information

308
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,679
on all our school bulletin boards,

309
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,960
including

310
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:10,679
the faculty and staff dormitory.

311
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,479
If he is not in love with you,

312
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,919
why did he do this?

313
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,990
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team
of Lingbei University)

314
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:24,359
Xiao Qing,
I'm here in the training room.

315
00:15:25,479 --> 00:15:26,520
Where did you put your wrist brace?

316
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,359
(I found it.)

317
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,640
(I put it in my bag.)

318
00:15:30,239 --> 00:15:31,239
(It's fine now, brother)

319
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,039
Okay.

320
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,260
(Lost)

321
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,880
Cartoon dolls?

322
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:12,760
It's Shao Beisheng's phone number,
isn't it?

323
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,850
(Lost) (A yellow sketchbook.
Reward to the one who finds it.)

324
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:22,520
Will she really come?

325
00:16:23,359 --> 00:16:24,280
Will she come?

326
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,119
Of course.

327
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,080
You're not fooled, are you?

328
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,479
Shut up, will you.

329
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,640
I'm afraid.

330
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,919
Go, go, go.

331
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:36,880
Shao Beisheng.

332
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,159
Here comes the sketchbook.

333
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:40,000
Did you make the call?

334
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:41,280
Here you go.

335
00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:42,960
Thank you.

336
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,520
I've been looking for it
for a long time. Thanks!

337
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,799
There is so much kindness in this world.

338
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:54,280
There's really a unicorn here.

339
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,520
Shao Beisheng!

340
00:16:57,679 --> 00:16:59,239
There is a letter she wrote to you
in this notebook.

341
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,479
Remember to read it.

342
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,280
To Beisheng.

343
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:12,839
There is so much love

344
00:17:14,479 --> 00:17:15,959
‍ in this world.

345
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,199
What do you mean?

346
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,479
Since you can't find that one,

347
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,520
you can have a new one.

348
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,359
I believe you can draw better pictures.

349
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,640
This sketchbook

350
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:32,680
is for sketching.

351
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,439
And this one

352
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,959
is of leather cover.

353
00:17:37,479 --> 00:17:38,280
It's for drawing still objects.

354
00:17:39,199 --> 00:17:40,359
And this pink one,

355
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,599
which many girls like,

356
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,000
can be used for drawing me.

357
00:17:44,239 --> 00:17:45,079
I can also reluctantly

358
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,479
be your model.

359
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,040
You...

360
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:52,479
Don't speak it out
even if you're touched.

361
00:17:55,959 --> 00:17:58,160
You don't like it?

362
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,920
No, I do.

363
00:18:01,439 --> 00:18:02,479
But all these notebooks

364
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,599
are not the original one.

365
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:04,680
I know.

366
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,040
But you have lost that one.

367
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,920
Then tell me

368
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:08,760
what do you want?

369
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,359
What I want

370
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,199
is actually not the notebook.

371
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:13,760
It's the pictures in it.

372
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,880
Anyway...

373
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:17,640
I don't know how to describe that.

374
00:18:18,199 --> 00:18:18,959
If you don't know it yourself,

375
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:20,479
how can I help you find it?

376
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:22,079
It doesn't matter.

377
00:18:22,239 --> 00:18:23,040
You have bought these.

378
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,319
How much do these cost?

379
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,000
I'll transfer the money to you.

380
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,199
Who wants your money?

381
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:27,880
Keep them if you like.

382
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,479
If you don't like them,
just throw them away.

383
00:18:31,199 --> 00:18:32,119
Shao Beisheng,

384
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:36,239
thank you.

385
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,479
No worries.

386
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:39,239
Anyway, you don't like them.

387
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:44,560
God.

388
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,959
Tomorrow we will have
another anatomy class.

389
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:48,680
Don't get dizzy this time
in the anatomy lab.

390
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:51,079
I don't want that either.

391
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,239
If I could

392
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:53,160
help it,

393
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,280
I wouldn't be

394
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,680
so embarrassed every time.

395
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:02,839
Where are the notices

396
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,760
we posted during the day?

397
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,520
Who tore them up?

398
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,959
Good job!

399
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,160
I will continue to post.

400
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,880
I'll go back for more.

401
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:15,839
I will go there to check it out.

402
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:16,800
Okay.

403
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,520
Shen Zhengyi.

404
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,880
Coach Xiao.

405
00:19:31,959 --> 00:19:32,880
Why are you here?

406
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,079
Are you here for Xiao Qing?

407
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:35,199
I'm here for you.

408
00:19:38,479 --> 00:19:41,640
Is it because of the training?

409
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,479
I admit that today

410
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,000
I did wander off a few times.

411
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:48,800
Did you lose something?

412
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:50,520
A sketchbook?

413
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,680
You also saw the notice?

414
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,359
Sorry about that.

415
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,920
Is that it?

416
00:20:00,719 --> 00:20:01,760
My sketchbook!

417
00:20:02,719 --> 00:20:03,959
Where did you find it?

418
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,959
Well...

419
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Have you read

420
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,680
the contents in it?

421
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:24,640
I did look through it.

422
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,479
And I find

423
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,359
you are really good at drawing.

424
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,719
The characters and the plot

425
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:31,479
are fictional?

426
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,040
Yes.

427
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:43,800
Thank you

428
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
for drawing me so well.

429
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,680
Hey, what are you doing?

430
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,079
Xiao Qing?

431
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:08,560
What are you doing?

432
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,760
Why did you tear them up?

433
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:13,160
I don't want those

434
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,439
to influence your training.

435
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:16,719
And Zhengyi's notebook

436
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:17,839
has been found

437
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:19,400
by my brother.

438
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,119
Your brother has found it?

439
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:24,640
The notebook

440
00:21:24,719 --> 00:21:25,319
was also

441
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,239
for my brother.

442
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,040
What does the notebook have
anything to do with your brother?

443
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:29,520
The drawings in it

444
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,959
are all about Zhengyi and my brother.

445
00:21:31,479 --> 00:21:32,239
I think

446
00:21:32,239 --> 00:21:33,439
my brother is the one
who found her talent.

447
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,119
(Xiao Han is my idol.)

448
00:21:37,199 --> 00:21:38,599
(Whether for character or talent,)

449
00:21:38,719 --> 00:21:39,920
(you are far away from him.)

450
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,760
I'll leave now, bye.

451
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:11,599
Just some drawings.

452
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,280
What's the big deal?

453
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,160
Do you think that makes sense?

454
00:22:16,479 --> 00:22:17,719
You did so much for her,

455
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:18,839
but you never told her about it.

456
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,719
And you never admitted it.

457
00:22:19,959 --> 00:22:21,000
What do I admit?

458
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,640
You like Shen Zhengyi.

459
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,319
Do you know that

460
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,319
every time you get angry,

461
00:22:25,439 --> 00:22:26,479
you're not actually mad at
Shen Zhengyi,

462
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,640
but yourself.

463
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,079
It would be a huge waste

464
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:30,400
if you throw them away.

465
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:31,199
Why not give them to her?

466
00:22:31,719 --> 00:22:32,479
Coach Xiao has already

467
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,680
given her a pair.

468
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,959
She would not like mine.

469
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,400
Who said that?

470
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:38,719
Don't you have

471
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:40,119
many pairs of sneakers yourself?

472
00:22:40,439 --> 00:22:41,239
You didn't even give them to her.

473
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:41,800
How do you know

474
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,719
she doesn't like the shoes?

475
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,400
Maybe she'll

476
00:22:43,479 --> 00:22:44,520
like them.

477
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,359
Changed your mind?

478
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,439
No.

479
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,880
Shen Zhengyi.

480
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,319
Look!

481
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:31,000
Honey,

482
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,199
I can't focus.

483
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:37,119
How is it? Is it good?

484
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:37,920
It's so good.

485
00:23:38,239 --> 00:23:39,000
Who took it?

486
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,920
Wang Jun.

487
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,319
He said I looked so pretty

488
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:47,359
when I'm on stage.

489
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:49,199
He was so moved by me

490
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:50,439
that he shed tears.

491
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,400
Shen Zhengyi,

492
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,920
I fall in love with drama now.

493
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,940
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team
of Lingbei University)

494
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:00,959
We will leave now.

495
00:24:00,959 --> 00:24:01,959
- Bye.
- Bye.

496
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,079
Bye.

497
00:24:06,199 --> 00:24:07,160
Let's go to

498
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:08,359
the trampoline park later

499
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,119
to relax.

500
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:11,760
No, the competition is coming.

501
00:24:21,439 --> 00:24:22,199
Hello, mom.

502
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,199
Why are you

503
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,119
calling me all of a sudden?

504
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,160
If I don't call you,

505
00:24:26,479 --> 00:24:27,119
you'll never

506
00:24:27,239 --> 00:24:29,040
call home?

507
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:31,479
I'm just busy

508
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,520
because

509
00:24:32,719 --> 00:24:34,800
I have classes

510
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,800
and also a part-time job.

511
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,719
You're always busy.

512
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,719
You have to

513
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:40,959
come home tonight for dinner.

514
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,319
You didn't forget your father's birthday

515
00:24:43,439 --> 00:24:43,880
did you?

516
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,479
Absolutely not.

517
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,439
How could I forget?

518
00:24:45,959 --> 00:24:46,800
I've even

519
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,000
bought a gift for him.

520
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,839
You do have some conscientiousness.

521
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,439
And this weekend,

522
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,839
stay home with us.

523
00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:56,040
No.

524
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,560
I have part-time job this weekend.

525
00:24:58,239 --> 00:24:58,959
Is the part-time job

526
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:00,319
or your father's birthday
more important?

527
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:02,680
Come back tonight

528
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:04,199
and be careful on the road.

529
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,719
Oh, god, no!

530
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:09,760
What should I do?

531
00:25:10,239 --> 00:25:10,880
My mother told me to go home

532
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:12,040
to celebrate my dad's birthday.

533
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,040
Well, I thought

534
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:15,359
there would be no problem

535
00:25:15,479 --> 00:25:16,719
before the competition is over.

536
00:25:17,239 --> 00:25:18,760
What do I do?

537
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:19,719
Calm down.

538
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:21,359
So, after the dinner,

539
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,439
hurry back.

540
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,560
If you cannot do so,

541
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,520
let's do what we always do before.

542
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,319
I'll go to your home,

543
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,000
and say we have
something important at school.

544
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,040
That will not work.
My mother is very smart.

545
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:28,800
She won't believe it.

546
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,839
She will find it out.

547
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:32,719
Then, let's be tough.

548
00:25:33,239 --> 00:25:34,119
Don't go back.

549
00:25:34,239 --> 00:25:35,599
Go back when the contest is over.

550
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,479
No way.

551
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:37,920
‍Birthday is once a year.

552
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:38,479
If I don't go home,

553
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,800
my dad would be very sad.

554
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,839
So did you prepare

555
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,199
your dad's birthday present?

556
00:25:48,199 --> 00:25:50,000
Why did I say that?

557
00:25:50,239 --> 00:25:50,719
I gotta go now.

558
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:51,280
Bye.

559
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,880
Call me if anything happens.

560
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:06,359
Happy birthday to you!

561
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,160
Happy birthday to you!

562
00:26:09,239 --> 00:26:12,319
Happy birthday to you!

563
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:16,199
Happy birthday to you!

564
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,160
Thanks.

565
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,040
Make a wish now.

566
00:26:18,199 --> 00:26:19,199
Okay.

567
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,880
Happy birthday!

568
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,000
This is for you.

569
00:26:28,199 --> 00:26:29,079
It's for me?

570
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,719
Let me see

571
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,719
what this is.

572
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:37,439
The family prize.

573
00:26:37,719 --> 00:26:38,760
Happy birthday, daddy.

574
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,599
Good daddy in China.

575
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,959
Always love you, from Yiyi.

576
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,719
I'm so proud of you.

577
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,719
Only my daughter knows

578
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:45,959
what I'm thinking.

579
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,199
I'll take it to my office

580
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:49,160
and put it at the highest

581
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:50,239
and best place.

582
00:26:50,479 --> 00:26:51,880
‍I want it to be seen by all people.

583
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,400
Your daughter

584
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,079
only gave you

585
00:26:54,199 --> 00:26:55,160
a gift of 50 yuan,

586
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,640
and you are so satisfied.

587
00:26:57,599 --> 00:26:58,040
Darling,

588
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,040
it has nothing to do

589
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:00,040
with money.

590
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:02,199
This is kind of affirmation
from my daughter

591
00:27:02,439 --> 00:27:03,920
and it represents her sincerity.

592
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:04,640
Exactly.

593
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:05,880
The price of the gift

594
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,239
doesn't matter.

595
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,599
It's the sweetness behind it

596
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,439
that counts.

597
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:10,199
Good.

598
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:11,839
You are really sweet.

599
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:14,880
So how about

600
00:27:15,239 --> 00:27:16,880
we take a family trip

601
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:17,880
this weekend?

602
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:18,880
We leave tomorrow.

603
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,000
No.

604
00:27:20,199 --> 00:27:21,119
No way.

605
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,439
Why not?

606
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,520
- I have a part-time job.
- I have a meeting tomorrow.

607
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,000
It's just a part-time job.

608
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:30,319
You can take a few days off.

609
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,319
No way.

610
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,640
I have promised the boss.

611
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,439
Besides, if I leave without
giving him advance notice,

612
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,400
how could he find another one
to replace me?

613
00:27:36,719 --> 00:27:37,400
To be trustworthy

614
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,800
is the minimum standard of life.

615
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:39,800
Yes, it is.

616
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:41,800
Then is your daddy's birthday

617
00:27:41,959 --> 00:27:43,479
or you job more important?

618
00:27:48,239 --> 00:27:48,880
Darling,

619
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:50,719
I understand her.

620
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,000
She just wants us to

621
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,239
have a trip alone.

622
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,160
Yes.

623
00:27:54,479 --> 00:27:55,839
I have a meeting to attend,

624
00:27:56,199 --> 00:27:57,280
but I'm not going to attend.

625
00:27:57,599 --> 00:27:58,400
I'll make a phone call later

626
00:27:58,479 --> 00:27:59,040
to put it off.

627
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,319
So we can enjoy

628
00:28:00,719 --> 00:28:01,719
the time together tomorrow.

629
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:02,959
Stop.

630
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:03,920
How can you

631
00:28:04,239 --> 00:28:05,280
say such things

632
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,839
in front of your daughter?

633
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:08,439
That's okay. I understand.

634
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,160
Darling,

635
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:11,760
I do want to spend
a weekend alone with you.

636
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:12,959
Today is my birthday.

637
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:13,719
You need to listen to me,

638
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,119
only one time every year.

639
00:28:16,199 --> 00:28:16,959
Okay?

640
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,640
Mom, just grant his wish.

641
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,000
He canceled

642
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,040
such an important meeting,

643
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,719
just to spend more time with you.

644
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:23,920
Why reject him?

645
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,280
Darling.

646
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:29,520
Okay, I will listen to you.

647
00:28:30,439 --> 00:28:31,400
Then we'll leave tomorrow.

648
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,479
Great.

649
00:28:32,959 --> 00:28:33,920
Okay.

650
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:36,520
The soup is ready.
I'll go serve the soup.

651
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:42,880
She won't find out, will she?

652
00:28:44,239 --> 00:28:45,400
I'll deal with her.

653
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,520
Don't worry.

654
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:48,319
Later, you can go back to school,

655
00:28:48,439 --> 00:28:49,719
and focus on
your training and competition.

656
00:28:50,959 --> 00:28:51,520
Love you.

657
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,599
Where did you learn

658
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,640
these things?

659
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,719
I can do a lot.

660
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:03,800
The day after tomorrow,

661
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,640
we will leave for the competition.

662
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,319
10:00 am.

663
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,319
I hope you will not be late

664
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,119
for the departure.

665
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,359
For the College Student Ice League
this year,

666
00:29:08,479 --> 00:29:09,439
there will be
four universities as participants.

667
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,760
On the first two days,

668
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,479
it will be the 500-meter

669
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:12,280
and 1500-meter

670
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:13,199
group qualifying rounds.

671
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:15,160
The top two will go to the final.

672
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,479
Try your best

673
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,239
and take it easy,

674
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,520
especially the new members.

675
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,160
Is that clear?

676
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:22,959
Our rival team

677
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,199
is a top school team nationwide,
the Flyer.

678
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,000
We have competed with them many times.

679
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,319
I'm sure you're familiar with them.

680
00:29:29,479 --> 00:29:30,119
Yu Bingling

681
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:32,000
(Yu Bingling Physical Qualities)
is the ace player among them.

682
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:33,800
She is very skillful,

683
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,880
but with not enough explosive power.

684
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,160
So if you encounter her,

685
00:29:38,239 --> 00:29:39,000
remember

686
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,199
to get the advantage at the start.

687
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,160
Understand?

688
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:44,599
As for other members,

689
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,430
(Wang Ying, player of Flyer)
I think you are very familiar with them.

690
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,599
The characteristics of this team

691
00:29:46,719 --> 00:29:47,520
are very clear,

692
00:29:47,959 --> 00:29:49,079
so we are

693
00:29:49,199 --> 00:29:49,920
facing a team

694
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:50,800
with a very high level of cooperation.

695
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,479
Are you scared?

696
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:56,079
Don't be afraid.

697
00:29:56,959 --> 00:29:57,400
We also

698
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,439
have our advantages.

699
00:29:59,119 --> 00:29:59,719
What people used to know

700
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:00,880
about us is that

701
00:30:00,959 --> 00:30:01,920
we only have Luo Xiaoyi.

702
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:03,640
But today we're different.

703
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,079
We know our competitors well.

704
00:30:05,239 --> 00:30:06,319
But they don't know us.

705
00:30:06,719 --> 00:30:07,680
This is our advantage.

706
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:08,599
We're going to take them

707
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,599
by surprise.

708
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,280
Remember,

709
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,800
you are not alone in the fight.

710
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,640
Believe in yourself, your teammates

711
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:17,839
and your coaches.

712
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,680
We are a team.

713
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:22,000
Wind Chaser, sure win!

714
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:24,160
Wind Chaser, sure win!

715
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,680
Run.

716
00:30:42,199 --> 00:30:43,479
Tighten your waist and stomach.

717
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:45,839
Try it again.

718
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:46,920
Raise your legs.

719
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,800
Ready.

720
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,479
Go.

721
00:30:59,040 --> 00:30:59,719
Try it again.

722
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,959
Tighten your waist and stomach.

723
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:11,439
Get up!

724
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,599
Go.

725
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,839
(The start of short track speed skating
is important)

726
00:31:20,199 --> 00:31:21,160
(and it has a direct impact)

727
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,319
(on the competition.)

728
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,079
(So specialized training)

729
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:25,079
(is essential.)

730
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,400
One more time!

731
00:31:31,719 --> 00:31:32,599
Use force by your waist and stomach.

732
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,680
(Remember,)

733
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:34,520
(you have to practice)

734
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,959
(over and over again)

735
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:37,119
(until you can find)

736
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:38,160
(your own way of starting.)

737
00:31:42,199 --> 00:31:43,119
(How can I find)

738
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:45,280
(my own starting way?)

739
00:31:45,719 --> 00:31:46,599
Get up!

740
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,920
Excuse me, your coffee.

741
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:05,079
Thanks.

742
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:05,760
You're welcome.

743
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,640
What's wrong? You're not in a good mood.

744
00:32:22,199 --> 00:32:23,239
Something went wrong with the training?

745
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,439
You will be leaving tomorrow?

746
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,319
Yes.

747
00:32:30,439 --> 00:32:31,199
So in the next few days,

748
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:32,640
you have to do the training by yourself.

749
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:35,640
I have never been alone before,

750
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,680
whether it was a race

751
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:38,520
or a training session.

752
00:32:41,479 --> 00:32:42,199
As long as you can

753
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:43,680
take the championship
of the Elite Challenge,

754
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:45,000
not only the qualification

755
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:45,800
for Ling Yun Cup,

756
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:46,640
I believe you can

757
00:32:46,719 --> 00:32:47,520
also come back to the team soon.

758
00:33:06,239 --> 00:33:06,880
What are you doing?

759
00:33:07,239 --> 00:33:07,880
Get on the bus!

760
00:33:07,959 --> 00:33:08,839
Hurry up!

761
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:10,199
Figure Skating Team, be quick!

762
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:11,160
Get on the bus!

763
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:12,119
Quick!

764
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,040
Wind Chaser, hurry.

765
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:13,640
Hurry up!

766
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:14,800
You are still taking photos of them?

767
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,239
Help me organize.

768
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,199
It's almost time to leave.

769
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,119
What's wrong?

770
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:27,680
If Beisheng won't be there,

771
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,160
I feel a little lost.

772
00:33:30,239 --> 00:33:31,640
Who said he won't be there?
He'll arrive in a minute.

773
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:32,479
Really?

774
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,560
Get on the bus.

775
00:33:38,479 --> 00:33:39,400
Hurry!

776
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:42,760
See?

777
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:43,800
Are you sure you don't want to go?

778
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,239
A Russian

779
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,400
dance instructor is here.

780
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,599
He is also quite thoughtful
in choreography.

781
00:33:49,239 --> 00:33:49,920
I will show him

782
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:50,839
your information.

783
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:53,640
Xiao Qing,

784
00:33:53,719 --> 00:33:54,760
you've really done a lot for me.

785
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:56,839
As for choreography, I can do it myself.

786
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:57,959
Why don't you go with us?

787
00:33:58,439 --> 00:33:58,719
Maybe you will

788
00:33:58,839 --> 00:33:59,680
meet your future rivals.

789
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,839
I'll watch the videos.

790
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:02,520
It's okay. Go.

791
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:04,079
Hurry!

792
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:05,760
Okay.

793
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:09,000
Come with us, Xiao Qing.

794
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:09,959
Maybe next time!

795
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,560
Good luck to you all in the race!

796
00:34:12,959 --> 00:34:13,760
Okay.

797
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,159
Beisheng, why are you here?

798
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:16,320
Hey.

799
00:34:16,439 --> 00:34:17,120
How can I not come?

800
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,199
Can't I come to
see you compete in the games

801
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,600
and learn a little bit?

802
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,439
Don't be so modest.

803
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:21,760
Of course you can.

804
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,159
Xiao Qing is so nice to Beisheng.

805
00:34:25,479 --> 00:34:26,040
Yes.

806
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,320
Now, for Xiao Qing,

807
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:28,399
anyone is less important than

808
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,760
Shao Beisheng.

809
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,760
Don't make jokes about me, okay?

810
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:35,800
So funny.

811
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:36,560
Your sincerity is stronger than gold.

812
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,399
You still have a chance.

813
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,639
What does it have
anything to do with me?

814
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:39,679
Still pretending?

815
00:34:39,959 --> 00:34:40,840
I'm not pretending.

816
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:41,919
Stop.

817
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,520
Stop gossiping.

818
00:34:42,919 --> 00:34:44,080
He's miserable enough. Let him alone.

819
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:44,919
Let's get down to business.

820
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,479
The leader has

821
00:34:46,479 --> 00:34:47,080
approved Shao Beisheng

822
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,439
to change from Pairs Skating
to Single Skating.

823
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:49,520
So this time,

824
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:50,360
he will come with us

825
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,159
to watch the competition.

826
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:55,520
Beisheng,

827
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:56,760
you were skating so well the other day.

828
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,000
Join us in the race.

829
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:58,760
I agree.

830
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,199
I'll be modest and study hard.

831
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,239
You can do it, Beisheng.

832
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,639
Why am I starting to get nervous

833
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:06,639
even before I'm there?

834
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:08,760
Take it easy.

835
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,520
We are probably not

836
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:10,479
going to win, are we?

837
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,159
What are you talking about?

838
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,280
When you are at the starting line,

839
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:12,959
you must have the determination

840
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,320
to win the championship.

841
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:14,959
Do you know...?

842
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,120
Zhengyi!

843
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:17,959
Hi, auntie.

844
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:18,919
Hello, Lele.

845
00:35:18,959 --> 00:35:20,159
Didn't you go on a trip?

846
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:21,439
Seeing you work so hard,

847
00:35:21,479 --> 00:35:22,520
I don't want to go.

848
00:35:24,879 --> 00:35:25,520
How come?

849
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,800
I won't work that hard.

850
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,639
What do you have in that bag?

851
00:35:33,879 --> 00:35:34,840
When I'm back...

852
00:35:34,879 --> 00:35:35,800
Shen Zhengyi.

853
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,639
Well,

854
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:40,080
I'll explain it to you when I get back.

855
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,239
Come home with me now!

856
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,679
We can't leave now, auntie.

857
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,879
We'll be late.

858
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:44,639
Well...

859
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,239
Late for what?

860
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,280
Where are you going?

861
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,320
Take my bag. Hurry!

862
00:35:48,439 --> 00:35:49,239
Don't be late.

863
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:49,879
See you, auntie.

864
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,959
Mom, we...

865
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,520
You wear this uniform

866
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,360
to do the part-time job?

867
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,719
Well, mom,

868
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:00,120
I was planning to explain to you
when I come back.

869
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:02,120
How dare you lie to me like this?

870
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:07,760
Hurry up, Fang Nan!

871
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,879
Have you seen Zhengyi and Lele?

872
00:36:12,919 --> 00:36:13,560
No.

873
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,560
Fine. Get on the bus.

874
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:22,879
Hurry.

875
00:36:27,439 --> 00:36:28,080
Why are you alone?

876
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:28,879
Where is Shen Zhengyi?

877
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,120
I...

878
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:31,080
Where is Shen Zhengyi?

879
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:34,439
She'll arrive

880
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:35,679
soon.

881
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,159
Get on the bus.

882
00:36:53,439 --> 00:36:54,080
Don't sleep.

883
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,679
Shen Zhengyi was stopped by her mother

884
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:58,679
in the dormitory building.
What do we do?

885
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:03,600
Where are you going?

886
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,679
- Beisheng!
- Beisheng!

887
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,439
Beisheng!

888
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,520
Where are you going?

889
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,879
I left something behind.

890
00:37:09,959 --> 00:37:11,239
- What happened?
- What's wrong?

891
00:37:11,439 --> 00:37:11,879
What happened?

892
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,320
What happened?

893
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:18,080
I can't control them at all.

894
00:37:20,479 --> 00:37:21,919
Mom, I'll explain it to you later,

895
00:37:21,919 --> 00:37:22,320
okay?

896
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,439
I don't want to listen to your excuses.

897
00:37:23,879 --> 00:37:24,879
I'll give you one last chance.

898
00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:25,800
Leave the team

899
00:37:25,879 --> 00:37:26,520
and go home with me.

900
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,439
I'll pretend

901
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,239
this never happened.

902
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:28,520
No.

903
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,080
You cannot be so unreasonable.

904
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:30,879
How am I being unreasonable?

905
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,679
I'm your mother.

906
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:32,879
I disagree with this.

907
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:33,800
Well, mom,

908
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:35,040
I've grown up.

909
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:36,520
I can make the choice by myself.

910
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,600
But that cannot be a wrong choice.

911
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,520
Why is it a wrong decision?

912
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:42,959
So those national athletes

913
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:43,959
who are fighting for the glory
of our country,

914
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:44,879
did they make bad choices too?

915
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,800
You yourself are also
a short track athlete.

916
00:37:46,959 --> 00:37:47,600
You are also wrong?

917
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,600
Yes, I was.

918
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:50,320
So I know

919
00:37:50,439 --> 00:37:51,800
how dangerous it is.

920
00:37:54,959 --> 00:37:56,320
So what do I do now?

921
00:37:56,679 --> 00:37:58,040
They're all waiting for me.

922
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,320
If I'm the only one who is absent,

923
00:37:59,399 --> 00:38:00,520
I need to be responsible
for the consequence.

924
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:03,040
You still want to go to the competition?

925
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:03,959
Come home with me now!

926
00:38:04,439 --> 00:38:04,879
Don't go anywhere.

927
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:06,600
Why don't you ever listen to me?

928
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:07,879
I'm being late.

929
00:38:07,959 --> 00:38:08,520
Don't try to leave.

930
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,080
Go home with me.

931
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:09,800
Shen Zhengyi.

932
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,439
Auntie.

933
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,080
It's you.

934
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:17,879
Are you also one of Wind Chaser?

935
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:19,320
Shen Zhengyi,

936
00:38:19,439 --> 00:38:19,959
how many people did you get

937
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,040
to lie for you?

938
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,159
Auntie,

939
00:38:23,399 --> 00:38:23,959
I believe that

940
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:24,719
Shen Zhengyi

941
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,679
will explain it to you later.

942
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,320
But now the whole team
is waiting for her.

943
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,879
We can't be late for the race.

944
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:30,800
Sorry, auntie.

945
00:38:31,439 --> 00:38:32,080
I have to take her with me.

946
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:33,239
She can't go anywhere!

947
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,239
Mom.

948
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:35,600
Tell your coach

949
00:38:35,879 --> 00:38:36,959
that she won't join the competition.

950
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:38,080
No, I'll.

951
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:38,679
Auntie,

952
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,879
she was qualified to participate

953
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,000
through the selection.

954
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:42,399
She now carries

955
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,840
the expectation and trust
of the whole team.

956
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,120
If she doesn't come,

957
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:46,000
that is irresponsible

958
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,280
and chickening out.

959
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,320
What will those who were not selected
think of her?

960
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,959
And also the coaches.

961
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,000
Sorry, auntie.

962
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:53,840
She has to come with me today.

963
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:54,959
Let's go.

964
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,520
Get on the bike!

965
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:02,560
Go.

966
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,000
If you go, don't come home again.

967
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,959
Stop crying. We're late.

968
00:39:38,439 --> 00:39:39,280
Hold on to me.

969
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Hold on.

970
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,840
How long do we have to wait?

971
00:40:04,439 --> 00:40:05,719
Why don't you call them?

972
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,120
Wait a little longer please.

973
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:16,840
They will be here soon.

974
00:40:16,919 --> 00:40:17,600
Okay.

975
00:40:20,439 --> 00:40:21,320
They're here.

976
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:24,719
They're here, Ma.

977
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,080
This is what Beisheng left behind.

978
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,679
He came back with another one.

979
00:40:35,439 --> 00:40:36,560
Zhengyi,

980
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:39,520
I believe that

981
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,840
your mother will definitely
approve of you one day.

982
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,600
Don't think about it now.

983
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:43,959
Adjust your emotion.

984
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,800
Let's go.

985
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,120
Do you have any sense of time?

986
00:40:54,399 --> 00:40:55,840
We are all waiting for you.

987
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,280
What happened?

988
00:41:00,439 --> 00:41:01,560
What's the matter?

989
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:03,959
Sorry.

990
00:41:05,239 --> 00:41:06,120
Get on the bus.

991
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,959
How did it go? Did it work out?

992
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,159
We can go now.

993
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,879
Sorry, mom,

994
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,159
I can't

995
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,399
leave my teammates behind.

996
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:35,679
And I can't

997
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,439
be irresponsible and just go home.

998
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,360
When I come back,

999
00:41:39,479 --> 00:41:40,919
I'll explain it to you.

1000
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,320
Sorry.

1001
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:49,980
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team of
Lingbei University)

1002
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:57,890
(The Ninth College Student Ice League)

1003
00:41:57,959 --> 00:41:59,000
What happened to the training today?

1004
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,159
I was not in very good condition.

1005
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,439
Compare the performance of Li Mi

1006
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,159
and your performance.

1007
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:02,840
Do you think a Quadruple

1008
00:42:02,959 --> 00:42:03,679
is that easy?

1009
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:06,560
Listen,

1010
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,840
in your usual training,

1011
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:08,840
you have to control

1012
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:09,760
your angle.

1013
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,560
In this case, a Triple will be...

1014
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,239
Running Nose Li!

1015
00:42:19,399 --> 00:42:20,320
That guy is calling you, right?

1016
00:42:20,879 --> 00:42:21,840
I gotta go, Mi.

1017
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,439
Bye.

1018
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:27,159
Fatty Shao!

1019
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:31,600
Why are you here?

1020
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,560
I thought you are not going to the race.

1021
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,879
So what?

1022
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:36,719
Can't I just come here to visit you?

1023
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:37,719
Visit me?

1024
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,520
Tell me the truth.

1025
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,520
Why are you here?

1026
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,439
I'm here to declare war.

1027
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,120
What war?

1028
00:42:45,439 --> 00:42:46,760
I hurt my hand,

1029
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:48,439
so I cannot do Pairs Skating anymore.

1030
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,439
What happened to your hand?

1031
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,600
It's fine. It's recovered now.

1032
00:42:51,399 --> 00:42:52,439
I'm here just to tell you that

1033
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,159
I've changed to Single Skating.

1034
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,280
That's great.

1035
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:00,040
That's the Shao Beisheng I know.

1036
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,159
Tell me.

1037
00:43:02,399 --> 00:43:04,199
Do you need any help from me?

1038
00:43:05,159 --> 00:43:05,959
No, I don't.

1039
00:43:06,399 --> 00:43:08,199
