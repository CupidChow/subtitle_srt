3
00:01:37,279 --> 00:01:37,879
Xiao Qing, what's

4
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,879
in your mind?

5
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,639
You said no to

6
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,760
such a good opportunity

7
00:01:41,839 --> 00:01:42,839
without any discussion with me?

8
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,120
I'm an adult now.

9
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:44,599
I can be responsible for

10
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,959
all my decisions.

11
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,279
Could you just leave me alone?

12
00:01:49,199 --> 00:01:49,519
Anyway,

13
00:01:49,639 --> 00:01:50,279
you want to stay in Wind Chaser

14
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,400
just for Shao Beisheng, right?

15
00:01:51,559 --> 00:01:52,760
Right, I do this just for him.

16
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,000
He switches to Single Skating, so do I.

17
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,959
He practices, then I follow.

18
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,599
Can't I?

19
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,400
Are you an idiot?

20
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,319
Shao Beisheng has a girlfriend.

21
00:01:59,559 --> 00:02:01,319
He and Zhengyi are not real couples.

22
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:03,559
What did you say?

23
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,559
Anyway, they are...

24
00:02:06,279 --> 00:02:07,199
I cannot tell clearly.

25
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,800
Anyway, they are not real couples.

26
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:13,039
Okay.

27
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:14,720
Fine.

28
00:02:14,839 --> 00:02:15,759
I don't care if they're real.

29
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,080
Xiao Qing, I'm telling you that

30
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:18,759
you can't be so emotional.

31
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,119
You're playing with your future.

32
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:21,639
I'm not playing.

33
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,160
I've made up my mind.

34
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,600
You have something you want to pursue.

35
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,399
So do I.

36
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,080
It's the only way I won't regret it.

37
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:29,119
And if you

38
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,639
go for Shao Beisheng again,

39
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,199
I will never speak to you again.

40
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:36,479
Never speak to me again?

41
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:39,240
You just said

42
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:39,880
you will never speak to me again

43
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,520
because of Shao Beisheng?

44
00:02:44,279 --> 00:02:47,000
Brother, just let me change.

45
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,039
My jumping is quite good.

46
00:02:49,279 --> 00:02:50,080
And based on the current condition
of Women's Single

47
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:50,919
in the nation,

48
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,639
I will have no problem to change to it.

49
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:53,839
I'll practice well.

50
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,919
Just let me change.

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,279
I'll get the gold medal, okay?

52
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,559
What if I say no?

53
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,399
I would still do so anyway.

54
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,720
I hope you won't regret it.

56
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:31,800
Take a look.

57
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,399
Excuse me.

58
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:32,919
Take a look.

59
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:33,440
Have a look.

60
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,639
Have a look, the Seagull.

61
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,160
Hello,

62
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,279
new play from Drama Club.

63

The Seagull.

64
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,960
The play of Seagull.

65
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,679
Our school's inspirational

66
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,160
new play for youth, the Seagull.

67
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,279
Hello.

68
00:03:47,839 --> 00:03:48,479
Hello.

69
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,080
(Tickets)

70
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,279
Excuse me,

71
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,360
a play

72
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,399
called Seagull.

73
00:03:52,679 --> 00:03:53,679
The play, Seagull,
please have a look.

74
00:03:53,679 --> 00:03:54,679
No, I don't need it. Thank you.

75
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:01,240
The prettiest face.

76
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,039
Did you send them out?

77
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,080
Not a single one.

78
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,320
Why did you put your phone down?

79
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:11,199
Anyone replied?

80
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:12,559
They won't even reply

81
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:14,000
when I said it's from the Drama Club.

82
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:16,200
What about you?

83
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:16,920
Did you send the message to groups?

84
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:18,399
Ever since I joined the Drama Club,

85
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,200
no one plays with me anymore.

86
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,320
You two,

87
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,640
at least I sent out two.

88
00:04:25,559 --> 00:04:26,359
Amazing!

89
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,640
100% attendance

90
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,519
for the venue.

91
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,839
To be honest,

92
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,880
I kind of regret it.

93
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:34,119
President, be optimistic.

94
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,519
Look, there are so many people.

95
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:42,279
100% attendance!

96
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:43,480
100%...

97
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:45,160
100%...

98
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:47,040
How can we achieve it?

99
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:48,600
Maybe today is the day

100
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,640
to create a miracle

101
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:52,720
of 100% emptiness.

102
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:53,959
- Right.
- I...

103
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:56,600
Sis,

104
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,799
didn't you say you have a plan?

105
00:04:58,519 --> 00:04:59,640
What could she do?

106
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,920
Let me tell you something.

107
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:04,880
I've already told my friends

108
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,279
to promote it in Wind Chaser.

109
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,640
If everything goes well,

110
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,720
at least I'll bring you

111
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:09,600
two teams.

112
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:12,239
Figure Skating Team and
Speed Skating Team, right?

113
00:05:13,239 --> 00:05:14,040
Smart!

114
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:15,239
You can give a preemptive answer now.

115
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,480
Even Shao Beisheng and Shen Zhengyi

116
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,959
bring us the whole Wind Chaser team,

117
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,399
there will be not enough people.

118
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,559
I am afraid you don't
have enough seats.

119
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,239
I have been to

120
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,200
Wind Chaser.

121
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,679
There are just a few people

122
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,040
in Figure Skating Team and
Speed Skating Team.

123
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,440
Even if they all come to see,

124
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,920
the attendance is
still less than a fifth.

125
00:05:33,679 --> 00:05:35,320
Is this the place to

126
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,160
get the ticket of Drama Club?

127
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,440
We want 20.

128
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,040
Yes, right.

129
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,119
It's here.

130
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,000
Please.

131
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:49,160
We still have them.

132
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,399
We still have the tickets.

133
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:57,160
Please support the original,
and help us promote it.

134
00:05:58,679 --> 00:05:59,359
Here, we have them here.

135
00:05:59,399 --> 00:05:59,839
We have them here.

136
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:51,079
Tickets were all sent out

137
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,559
like that.

138
00:06:54,559 --> 00:06:55,559
I'm so curious about

139
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,640
what you have done.

140
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:57,799
Then I'll answer

141
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,920
your question.

142
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,720
Here, look.

143
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:04,320
Is this your

144
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,600
Lingbei New Style column?

145
00:07:09,239 --> 00:07:10,880
I'm on the top?

146
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:15,079
You can't be in love with me, huh?

147
00:07:18,119 --> 00:07:18,839
You're not even my type.

148
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:19,720
Okay?

149
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,799
Be in love with you?

150
00:07:22,679 --> 00:07:24,160
But I can feel your intense love

151
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,079
from your text.

152
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:27,480
Really?

153
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:29,880
Do you believe I...?

154
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:31,519
Yes, yes, yes.

155
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,320
Stop, stop, stop.

156
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:35,320
Let me explain to you.

157
00:07:36,119 --> 00:07:36,679
Think about it.

158
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:38,279
A man whose name

159
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:39,320
has never been heard of

160
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:40,320
shows up

161
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,519
on the top of my

162
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,079
Lingbei New Style column.

163
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:43,519
And I used

164
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:44,519
the buzz

165
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,519
to promote our play.

166
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,559
How was it?

167
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:50,440
Amazing!

168
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,119
Just applause?

169
00:07:53,359 --> 00:07:54,760
Go get me a cup of milk tea.

170
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,559
Be quick.

171
00:07:57,679 --> 00:07:58,399
Anything else?

172
00:07:59,200 --> 00:07:59,959
A cup of milk tea

173
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,519
can't be enough for me to thank you.

174
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,239
Then 10 cups. Just go!

00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,760
Xiao Qing,

177
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,320
I've thought about it.

178
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,519
Actually, I think

179
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:21,640
it is not necessary for you

180
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,959
to change to Single Skating so urgently.

181
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,320
Maybe you can meet

182
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,359
a partner better than me.

183
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:32,799
Actually, after practicing
for all these years,

184
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,640
I've wanted to challenge myself.

185
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,559
I want to try

186
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,640
if I can do better

187
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:37,400
on Skating Rink

188
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,359
without a partner.

189
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,679
And it is easier for me

190
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,599
to change to Single Skating than you,

191
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,479
because I did it before.

192
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,679
Coach Ma and Director Zhang

193
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,640
have agreed.

194
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:44,799
But I still think...

195
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:46,239
Alright, don't over think it.

196
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,200
Before everything,

197
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,159
I have to help you

198
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,039
adapt to Single Skating.

199
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,280
You should focus on
jumping in Single Skating.

200
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,200
I have been good at jumping.

201
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:53,200
I'll help you.

202
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:55,000
Let me show you.

203
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,799
Thank you.

204
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,760
I'll try.

205
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,599
Sharpening your skates?

206
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:20,679
Isn't that obvious?

207
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,280
What are you looking at?

208
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,280
Just sharpen your skates.

209
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,400
Don't look anywhere else.

210
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:33,520
Don't blame me

211
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,280
if you hurt your hand.

212
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,359
Be professional, okay?

213
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,520
That's because you

214
00:09:37,599 --> 00:09:38,440
came in so suddenly.

215
00:09:38,599 --> 00:09:39,359
So scary.

216
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,400
I...

217
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,400
I won't blame you,

218
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:49,960
but look at your shoes.

219
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:50,760
See?

220
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:52,320
It's almost broken.

221
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:53,280
Why don't you buy new ones?

222
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:54,479
What are you talking about?

223
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,479
They are still good.

224
00:09:56,239 --> 00:09:57,440
And it's my lucky charm.

225
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,440
I can get into Wind Chaser
thanks to them.

226
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:00,559
I am telling you.

227
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,760
We professional athletes

228
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,960
should have professional gear.

229
00:10:03,239 --> 00:10:03,719
Understand?

230
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,799
It is easy to get hurt

231
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,760
wearing such kind of shoes.

232
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:07,000
College Student Ice League is coming.

233
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,919
Are you going to wear them to compete?

234
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:11,799
What?

235
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,679
They are good.

236
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:13,719
Well, you...

237
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:14,679
You put my shoes down.

238
00:10:15,479 --> 00:10:15,760
Well,

239
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:17,000
‍what are you doing here?

240
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,880
I came to sharpen my own skates.

241
00:10:19,239 --> 00:10:19,840
You want to sharpen your skates.

242
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,119
Then do so.

243
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,799
Don't be nosy here

244
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,719
and be critical to someone.

245
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:24,799
I am not critical

246
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:25,400
and nosy.

247
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:26,640
I am just being kind to...

248
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,280
Whatever.

249
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:31,239
I, Shao Beisheng,

250
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,320
am never nosy.

251
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,280
Weird.

252
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:43,679
Bend right shoulders down
when turning right.

253
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:45,559
Be quick, be quick.

254
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:52,640
Okay.

255
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:58,679
Give me more power.

256
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,200
Wang Fang, raise your legs.

257
00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:10,559
You didn't bend down enough.

258
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:11,799
I've told you many times.

259
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,200
Be more powerful
when pushing off the ice.

260
00:11:33,239 --> 00:11:34,080
Everyone,

261
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,640
stop.

262
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:39,880
Are you okay?

263
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,799
It's okay.

264
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:43,359
Coach Xiao, I'm sorry.

265
00:11:44,599 --> 00:11:46,000
Today my shoes

266
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,840
are not...

267
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:50,440
You didn't check your gear properly

268
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,400
before getting on the ice?

269
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:54,000
‍I'll adjust them right now.

270
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:57,400
Stand here.

271
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,119
Professional athletes

272
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,559
should have professional gear.

273
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,640
Shen Zhengyi,

274
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,320
your shoes can't get used to

275
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,960
intensive professional training.

276
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,159
Before you change your skates,

277
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,719
you are not allowed to get on the ice.

278
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:09,599
This is not just about you.

279
00:12:09,719 --> 00:12:10,679
It's for the safety of the whole team.

280
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,799
Do you hear me?

281
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,960
Do you hear me?

282
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,159
End of training. Dismiss!

283
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:26,919
Coach Zhuang is right.

284
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,320
You are getting better

285
00:12:28,359 --> 00:12:29,080
on curve skills.

286
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,400
So the pressure on your shoes

287
00:12:30,479 --> 00:12:31,760
is getting bigger.

288
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:32,599
These shoes cannot stand it anymore.

289
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:33,919
It's time for a new pair.

290
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,280
Are you okay?

291
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,280
Let's go.

292
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:57,880
My skating boots.

293
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,359
Why are they broken?

294
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,520
It's really killing me.

295
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:03,640
I'm telling you.

296
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,559
Professional skating boots

297
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:06,599
cost at least thousands.

298
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,080
How can I buy them?

299
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,400
Of course.

300
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,760
The shoes of Coach Xiao

301
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,039
used in the contests

302
00:13:12,119 --> 00:13:13,039
were all custom-made.

303
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,280
A pair of shoes that fits

304
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:17,320
costs ten or twenty thousand, at least.

305
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,799
Really?

306
00:13:21,479 --> 00:13:23,400
Poverty limits my imagination.

307
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:26,119
Don't worry.

308
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,840
I'll figure out a way for you.

309
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:31,000
When I got into college,

310
00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:31,799
my parents gave me a pair

311
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,039
of new skating boots.

312
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,520
You can ask your parents

313
00:13:34,599 --> 00:13:35,520
to buy you a pair too.

314
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:36,760
Impossible.

315
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:38,760
Don't mention my mom.

316
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:39,760
My dad's pocket money

317
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,479
is supervised by my mom.

318
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:42,479
I have to

319
00:13:42,599 --> 00:13:43,840
figure it out myself.

320
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,840
If I can

321
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:48,200
eat less meals,

322
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,440
drink less milk tea,

323
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:53,320
maybe I can save some money.

324
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,440
I'm so disappointing.

325
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:56,239
Disappointing.

326
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,559
What can I do?

327
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,110
(WeChat Transfer)

328
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,440
What are you doing?

329
00:14:13,239 --> 00:14:14,559
Why are you transferring money to me?

330
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,520
I'll keep 300 for myself,

331
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,320
which is enough.

332
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:19,239
I bought a bunch of

333
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,039
stuff,

334
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,359
so I just have 800 now.

335
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:22,719
500 for you, 300 for me.

336
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:23,640
Don't.

337
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,799
I cannot take your money.

338
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,599
It's okay.

339
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:27,840
It's enough for me to have 300.

340
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,599
Really.

341
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,000
No way. I cannot take your money.

342
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,599
Lele, you are so sweet to me.

343
00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:38,520
So pitiful.

344
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:41,679
Then,

345
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,359
what do you like to eat?

346
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:43,559
I'll treat you to dinner tonight.

347
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,559
That's fine.

348
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,640
After I bought the skating boots,

349
00:14:53,719 --> 00:14:54,840
I'll treat you something delicious.

350
00:14:56,359 --> 00:14:56,799
Fighting!

351
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:58,200
Fighting!

352
00:15:23,359 --> 00:15:23,760
What are you looking at?

353
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,880
Something dirty?

354
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,039
It's none of your business.

355
00:15:26,239 --> 00:15:27,400
Don't you know sharing?

356
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,960
Don't you know privacy?

357
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:31,280
Go away.

358
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,119
Privacy.

359
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:39,599
Except for the line of army in games,
there is nothing between us

360
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:40,760
that cannot be shared.

361
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,719
Female Short Track Speed Skating boots.

362
00:15:45,719 --> 00:15:46,960
For Shen Zhengyi, right?

363
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,239
That expensive?

364
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,039
You are going to pay a lot.

365
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,719
Luxury.

366
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Money is not that important.

367
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:57,599
The point is, which do you think

368
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,280
she would like?

369
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,359
Isn't it simple?

370
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:04,559
It's a gift for your girlfriend.

371
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,119
Pick the expensive ones.
It won't be wrong.

372
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:08,919
This pair.

373
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,039
Believe me.

374
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,359
Okay.

375
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,100
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team
of Lingbei University)

376
00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:26,640
What's up?

377
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,080
I have something to tell you.

378
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,239
But keep it down.

379
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:36,039
Don't let Shen Zhengyi hear us.

380
00:16:36,359 --> 00:16:36,679
Why can't we let

381
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,559
Shen Zhengyi hear?

382
00:16:40,239 --> 00:16:41,400
Shao Beisheng bought

383
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,559
a pair of skating boots
for Shen Zhengyi.

384
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,599
That's so sweet.

385
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:46,679
Don't interrupt me.

386
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,679
But here's the thing.

387
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,080
Although Shao Beisheng bought

388
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,000
a pair of skating boots
for Shen Zhengyi,

389
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,719
he doesn't know

390
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:52,840
how to give them to her.

391
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:54,719
So the following information

392
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:55,520
is very important.

393
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,320
After having lunch

394
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:57,799
and going back to your dorm,

395
00:16:58,119 --> 00:16:58,799
you have to figure out a way

396
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:00,119
to ask Shen Zhengyi

397
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,080
visit that second-hand website.

398
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,479
I'll send you pictures of skating boots

399
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,920
and a code.

400
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,319
We'll make the deal.

401
00:17:07,239 --> 00:17:07,760
Well,

402
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,400
so you are saying that

403
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,160
Shao Beisheng bought a pair
of second-hand skating boots,

404
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,280
and wants to ask Shen Zhengyi

405
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,359
to visit the second-hand website

406
00:17:13,479 --> 00:17:14,520
to buy this pair of
second-hand skating boots?

407
00:17:14,719 --> 00:17:15,719
What second-hand?

408
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:17,760
It's a brand new limited edition.

409
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,640
He's afraid that it's so expensive

410
00:17:19,719 --> 00:17:21,160
that Shen Zhengyi won't take it.

411
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,599
Well, I still don't get it.

412
00:17:22,719 --> 00:17:24,239
It's perfectly normal for a boyfriend

413
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,160
to give a gift to his girlfriend.

414
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,160
Why to make it so complicated?

415
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,439
You don't have to understand that much.

416
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,319
Do you remember?

417
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,479
Alright, I am leaving.

418
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:31,560
Don't forget.

419
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,359
Why?

420
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,479
Lele!

421
00:17:35,719 --> 00:17:36,599
I'm here.

422
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,239
Don't worry about the skating boots.

423
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,160
Look,

424
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:00,000
I found a second-hand website.

425
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,400
There are skating boots on it.

426
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:04,040
Second-hand?

427
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:06,239
The second-hand stuff
is not necessarily bad.

428
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,880
A lot of young people now

429
00:18:08,239 --> 00:18:09,199
are fickle in affection.

430
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,640
So they may sell the shoes online

431
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:12,000
after wearing for just a few days.

432
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,520
Really?

433
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:14,880
Yes, trust me.

434
00:18:15,239 --> 00:18:15,959
Let me search it for you.

435
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,239
But now we only

436
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:19,000
have a budget of 1500 yuan.

437
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:20,199
Is it enough?

438
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,520
Look, this pair is 95% new,

439
00:18:27,719 --> 00:18:29,599
No. 38, and in the same town.

440
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:31,280
Why is it so coincidental?

441
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:32,160
Listen,

442
00:18:32,239 --> 00:18:33,199
you might run into crooks.

443
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,599
Impossible.

444
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:36,479
Why is it impossible?

445
00:18:37,239 --> 00:18:37,839
Isn't your price

446
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:38,719
set too high?

447
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,319
The original price is
twice the labeled price.

448
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:42,560
If you set it too low,

449
00:18:42,719 --> 00:18:43,760
she might think they are fake.

450
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,479
You idiot!

451
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:45,800
Right.

452
00:18:48,719 --> 00:18:49,719
Because

453
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,280
in this website, they have to

454
00:18:52,439 --> 00:18:53,599
sign up with real names.

455
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:58,599
It, now...

456
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,760
How much is this pair of skating boots?

457
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,800
No way.

458
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,000
We only have a budget of 1500.

459
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:05,040
It is not enough.

460
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,560
You don't understand.

461
00:19:07,959 --> 00:19:08,760
In second-hand market,

462
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,479
you have to bargain.

463
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:11,719
I'll handle it.

464
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,719
Is the price negotiable?

465
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,439
The code. It's them.

466
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,520
You said you don't like her.

467
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,560
Liar.

468
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:26,199
It should be cheap and of high quality.

469
00:19:30,199 --> 00:19:30,839
What are you talking about?

470
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,719
Why can't I understand?

471
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,839
You don't understand.

472
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:34,400
It's the lingo in the field.

473
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,959
I'm asking him if he
can make it cheaper.

474
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,119
Really?

475
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,560
Can you sell it cheaper?

476
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:45,920
What's her budget?

477
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,680
How much is it?

478
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:48,160
Whatever.

479
00:19:48,199 --> 00:19:49,079
1500, we'll make the deal.

480
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:51,319
You give the lowest price immediately?

481
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:51,920
Or what?

482
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,160
At least you should make it more real.

483
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:54,680
Let me try.

484
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:00,439
At least 2000.

485
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,760
2000?

486
00:20:03,439 --> 00:20:04,160
What if she doesn't want it?

487
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:06,359
Impossible, trust me.

488
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,479
No, it's still too expensive.

489
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,119
It's okay.

490
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:15,400
I'll bargain for you.

491
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,400
How about 1000?

492
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,359
Don't.

493
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,479
If you bargain like this,

494
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,160
he may get angry

495
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,079
and doesn't want to sell it to us.

496
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,439
Don't worry.

497
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,239
I know what the sellers
on the second-hand website

498
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,479
are thinking.

499
00:20:28,199 --> 00:20:29,079
1000.

500
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,319
1000 is okay, 1000 is okay.

501
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,719
Calm down, and watch me.

502
00:20:35,439 --> 00:20:40,160
This is my favorite
pair of skating boots.

503
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,280
Although I just used it for a few days,

504
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,839
I have created

505
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,920
great connection to it.

506
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:49,839
Lele,

507
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,680
I think we should forget it.

508
00:20:52,199 --> 00:20:53,680
Let's not make things harder for them.

509
00:20:57,199 --> 00:20:57,959
You're right.

510
00:20:58,439 --> 00:20:59,199
Now he said

511
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,760
although he just used it for a few days,

512
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,599
he has created

513
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,319
great connection to it.

514
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:05,239
So he's hesitating

515
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:06,319
to sell it to us.

516
00:21:08,439 --> 00:21:09,439
I know it.

517
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,000
I knew it.

518
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,280
At least 1500.

519
00:21:18,439 --> 00:21:19,280
You're quite an actor.

520
00:21:19,439 --> 00:21:20,040
Of course.

521
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,880
No one knows acting better than me.

522
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,199
Shen Zhengyi,

523
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,680
he said the lowest price is this.

524
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:32,719
Really?

525
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,839
Yes, look.

526
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:38,599
Lele, you are my lucky star.

527
00:21:39,239 --> 00:21:39,880
I finally have skates.

528
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:40,920
I can get on the ice!

529
00:21:42,239 --> 00:21:43,640
Quick, keep him.

530
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:44,439
I'll transfer you the money now.

531
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:45,719
Quick, quick, don't let him go.

532
00:21:45,719 --> 00:21:46,319
- You transfer it to me.
- Now.

533
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:47,239
Now, now.

534
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:48,920
Now, buy it, buy it.

535
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,239
Is it done? Is it done?

536
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:54,400
I still have 50 left for meals.

537
00:21:56,199 --> 00:21:57,280
I can get on the ice!

538
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,640
Okay.

539
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:11,319
Wow, the silver legend.

540
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:16,920
This is...

541
00:22:17,239 --> 00:22:17,959
It's for you.

542
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,640
For me?

543
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:21,880
Such a nice pair of skating boots

544
00:22:21,959 --> 00:22:22,719
is for me?

545
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,640
The team gave it to you.

546
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:28,479
You put it on

547
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:29,880
and get good records for Wind Chaser.

548
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:33,079
Really?

549
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:34,839
Coach Xiao, rest assured.

550
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:36,119
I will do my best for sure.

551
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:39,079
But can I really take this?

552
00:22:41,959 --> 00:22:42,800
Go to try it on the skating rink.

553
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:45,920
Thank you, Coach Xiao.
Thank you, Wind Chaser.

554
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,479
I'll take it then.

555
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,319
Lele!

556
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:27,920
Here.

557
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:40,000
Is it good?

558
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,599
Well...

559
00:23:42,239 --> 00:23:43,680
What... what happened?

560
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,280
Where did these shoes come from?

561
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,160
What do you mean?

562
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,719
It's given by the school team.

563
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,400
And I'm telling you.

564
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,000
Coach Xiao gave this to me in person.

565
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:52,800
Is it good?

566
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,040
The school team would
buy us skating boots?

567
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,520
What... what about
the pair on the website?

568
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,400
Don't tell me

569
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:00,319
you're going to return it.

570
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,400
The seller didn't

571
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,280
intend to sell it
in the first place, did he?

572
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,920
Maybe you should discuss with him

573
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:06,599
to return it.

574
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:08,199
Return it?

575
00:24:10,479 --> 00:24:12,079
It cannot be returned. After all...

576
00:24:13,439 --> 00:24:14,280
After all...

577
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,199
After all, it's a famous brand.

578
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:17,319
And it's a classic one.

579
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:19,520
Famous and classic, so what?

580
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,199
Can it mean as much
as this pair of skating boots?

581
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:21,880
I'm telling you. This is

582
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:23,839
given by Coach Xiao in person.

583
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,079
I had it all thought through.

584
00:24:25,439 --> 00:24:26,040
I have to

585
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,280
wear these skating boots

586
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,000
to win a medal for Wind Chaser

587
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,479
in College Student Ice League.

588
00:24:32,479 --> 00:24:33,239
I think it's good.

589
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,359
But as for skating boots,

590
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:35,920
it's not much to have one more pair.

591
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:37,119
We can get both.

592
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:38,680
Zhu Lele,

593
00:24:39,719 --> 00:24:40,760
what are you doing?
Why are you still not on the ice?

594
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:42,839
I, well...

595
00:24:42,959 --> 00:24:44,160
Hurry! Change to your skating boots.

596
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,760
It's over.

597
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,239
It's all over.

598
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:06,839
Shao Beisheng.

599
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,119
What? Why are you so happy?

600
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:14,479
I have something nice to show you.

601
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,359
Do you want to have a look?

602
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,760
Yes, why not?

603
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:18,040
Ready?

604
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:23,800
Well...

605
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,319
My new skates. Are they nice?

606
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,800
Where did you get these skating boots?

607
00:25:28,479 --> 00:25:29,760
Coach Xiao Han gave them to me.

608
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,319
Well, but before...

609
00:25:33,439 --> 00:25:34,119
Listen,

610
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,520
this is my first

611
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:36,680
professional skating boots.

612
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,839
You feel them.

613
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,680
I think if I wear them,

614
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:41,719
no matter College Student Ice League,
Ling Yun Cup,

615
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,199
or Asian Cup,

616
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:42,839
whatever it is,

617
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:43,760
I'll be no problem.

618
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,280
Check out the color.

619
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:46,520
Does it match with me?

620
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:48,199
Look at the shape.

621
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:49,599
Is it beautiful?

622
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,040
Say, say something.

623
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,560
So ugly.

624
00:25:54,959 --> 00:25:55,719
Are you crazy?

625
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,119
What do you mean?

626
00:25:58,239 --> 00:25:58,800
No other meaning.

627
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,839
Just literal meaning.

628
00:26:00,199 --> 00:26:00,880
You have a bad taste yourself,

629
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:01,760
and you don't want
others to talk about it?

630
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:04,160
A pair of ugly skating boots.

631
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,239
What's the point to show off?

632
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:06,680
Who's showing off to you?

633
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,199
I'm just sharing good news with you.

634
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:09,359
We are not

635
00:26:09,479 --> 00:26:10,760
in a relationship
for sharing everything.

636
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:19,710
(Auditorium)

637
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,160
So annoying!

638
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,239
What's wrong?

639
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,680
Should I

640
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,719
tell Shen Zhengyi

641
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:37,040
that the pair of skating
boots on the website

642
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:38,119
was bought by Shao Beisheng

643
00:26:38,199 --> 00:26:38,880
for her?

644
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,680
You scared me.

645
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,560
I thought

646
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,400
you have no confidence

647
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,599
to tomorrow's show.

648
00:26:47,719 --> 00:26:49,160
I think we should let

649
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,359
Shao Beisheng and Shen Zhengyi
figure it out themselves.

650
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,079
You'd better stay out of it.

651
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,199
Well,

652
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,959
why did Shao Beisheng

653
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:58,319
make it so complicated?

654
00:26:58,719 --> 00:26:59,520
Giving

655
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,800
a pair of skating boots
to his girlfriend

656
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,280
to please her

657
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,359
isn't a good thing?

658
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:05,160
Why can't he just
give it to her directly?

659
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,880
He's just looking for troubles.

660
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:07,839
Right?

661
00:27:09,439 --> 00:27:11,400
Yes, you're right.

662
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:12,959
Just draw it.

663
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:22,160
Once there was a true love

664
00:27:22,479 --> 00:27:23,520
before me,

665
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,319
but I didn't cherish it.

666
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:27,239
It is too late to repent

667
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:28,760
when I lost it.

668
00:27:29,959 --> 00:27:30,880
Now you're repenting, right?

669
00:27:34,199 --> 00:27:35,319
I'll return it tomorrow.

670
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:50,160
The wind convolves the dark clouds...

671
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,000
Then what's next?

672
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:55,400
I will break through...

673
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:58,079
I will break through the black clouds,

674
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:01,680
cross the raging waves...

675
00:28:01,959 --> 00:28:03,560
Raging waves or giant waves?

676
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:06,280
The audience is already here.

677
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:07,920
How are you doing?

678
00:28:08,439 --> 00:28:08,959
Quite good.

679
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:11,520
Let me see.

680
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,640
Don't be nervous.

681
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,880
I am not nervous. I'm quite fine.

682
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:18,520
Would you stop shaking your hands?

683
00:28:19,719 --> 00:28:20,800
I can't help it.

684
00:28:22,239 --> 00:28:22,880
No, no, no.

685
00:28:23,239 --> 00:28:24,599
What if I forget the lines

686
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,199
when I am on the stage?

687
00:28:26,719 --> 00:28:28,079
There are so many
people in the audience.

688
00:28:28,719 --> 00:28:30,680
I will lose face.

689
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:34,439
Have a drink.

690
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,800
Relax. Here.

691
00:28:40,199 --> 00:28:40,920
Take a deep breath.

692
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,760
Do you feel better now?

693
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,599
Are you relaxed now?

694
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,439
No, no, no.

695
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,199
See?

696
00:28:52,719 --> 00:28:53,479
I think my foundation

697
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,040
is a little too white.

698
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:55,599
No.

699
00:28:55,719 --> 00:28:56,560
When the light is on me,

700
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,719
and wearing this shirt,

701
00:28:58,719 --> 00:28:59,880
I'll be like a ghost.

702
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:01,280
No.

703
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:02,800
You look beautiful.

704
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,839
Very beautiful.

705
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:07,160
Really?

706
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:07,959
Yes.

707
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,400
Maybe this will be the most beautiful

708
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,599
moment in your life.

709
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:12,959
Cherish it.

710
00:29:18,439 --> 00:29:19,319
Are you cursing me?

711
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,479
So energetic.

712
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,560
It seems you're not shaking anymore.

713
00:29:25,199 --> 00:29:26,280
Just keep it that way.

714
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,160
Let's go.

715
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,319
Go to the stage

716
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:29,640
to welcome your highlight moment.

717
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,520
Wings, wings.

718
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:31,560
Okay, wings.

719
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:33,839
Fighting!

720
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:34,640
Fighting!

721
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:44,040
Quite pretty.

722
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:46,160
On this endless ocean,

723
00:29:47,199 --> 00:29:49,880
where can I find my freedom?

724
00:29:57,239 --> 00:29:58,079
Fish?

725
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,079
I found it.

726
00:30:02,239 --> 00:30:02,800
I saw it first.

727
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,479
I saw it first.

728
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:05,079
- It's me.
- It's me.

729
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:05,560
Kids,

730
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,760
let's take off.

731
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:08,319
Quick, follow me.

732
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,439
You, what are you looking at?

733
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,359
I...

734
00:30:23,719 --> 00:30:24,839
I'm looking at the sun.

735
00:30:25,439 --> 00:30:26,520
The sun?

736
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,560
What is so special about the sun?

737
00:30:28,959 --> 00:30:30,359
The sun is just like a runny egg
that you can only look at

738
00:30:30,479 --> 00:30:32,160
but cannot eat.

739
00:30:32,439 --> 00:30:35,040
It's not as good as my fish.

740
00:30:36,479 --> 00:30:36,959
Alright.

741
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,280
Let's take off.

742
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,359
You, follow us.

743
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:41,839
Let's go.

744
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,680
You, follow.

745
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,719
Follow.

746
00:30:44,239 --> 00:30:45,040
Where are we going?

747
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,119
I don't know.

748
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,239
I don't know.

749
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:48,560
I don't know.

750
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,560
We don't even have a destination?

751
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:53,839
Never mind.

752
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:56,640
I will chase the sun alone.

753
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:10,760
Are you okay?

754
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,800
That is so good.

755
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:14,160
I feel like I am

756
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:15,520
that little seagull.

757
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:17,560
Do you really think so?

758
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,719
No one here

759
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,640
knows art better than you.

760
00:31:24,959 --> 00:31:25,680
Master.

761
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:28,040
The charm of drama.

762
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:29,880
I didn't expect the most artistic person

763
00:31:30,199 --> 00:31:32,199
is right next to me. Really.

764
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,400
So talented.

765
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,560
The second act is about to begin.

766
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,280
Let's go on watching.

767
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,680
I will break through the dark clouds,

768
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,199
cross the raging waves,

769
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,239
and face the wind, the rain,
and the lightning.

770
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,239
As long as I don't stop,

771
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,880
there's no one

772
00:32:10,239 --> 00:32:12,199
can stop me.

773
00:32:22,199 --> 00:32:23,160
Borrow me your phone.

774
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:27,359
Let's go. I don't want to
watch it anymore.

775
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:27,839
That's it?

776
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:28,839
I really cannot watch it anymore.

777
00:32:49,479 --> 00:32:50,160
You,

778
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,359
you're finally back.

779
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,040
Didn't you

780
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:54,040
go to chase the sun?

781
00:32:54,959 --> 00:32:57,119
How could the sun be chased by her?

782
00:32:57,839 --> 00:32:59,479
Are you as crazy as she is?

783
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,079
Shut up. Your safe return is good.

784
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,479
You,

785
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:04,680
from now on,

786
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:06,719
let's be

787
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,640
ordinary seagulls.

788
00:33:10,439 --> 00:33:12,119
We ordinary seagulls

789
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:13,000
should stay

790
00:33:13,439 --> 00:33:14,800
in the waters that we are familiar with.

791
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,160
We should

792
00:33:16,439 --> 00:33:18,280
fly in flocks.

793
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,959
We should ask fewer questions.

794
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,599
I didn't catch up with the sun,

795
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,079
but I saw the whole world.

796
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,800
I think

797
00:33:31,439 --> 00:33:33,439
this is what I've always wanted,

798
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,280
the freedom.

799
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,719
Great!

800
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,520
Awesome!

801
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:50,920
Welcome the screenwriter
and director of this play,

802
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,959
Qu Zhi.

803
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,400
Thank you

804
00:34:03,479 --> 00:34:04,800
for supporting our play, the Seagull.

805
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:08,840
OK!

806
00:34:08,919 --> 00:34:10,120
The play is over.

807
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,320
Please exit this way

808
00:34:11,439 --> 00:34:12,040
in an orderly manner.

809
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:15,120
Thank you!

810
00:34:15,479 --> 00:34:17,040
Thank you.

811
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,000
Let's go.

812
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,320
I was so nervous.

813
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,600
Look at you.

814
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:35,719
Even the hands are sweating.

815
00:34:36,439 --> 00:34:37,600
How can I not be nervous?

816
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,120
But I always wonder

817
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:41,959
whether we just screwed the play up.

818
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:43,679
Why did almost all audience leave

819
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,639
when we just played for 10 minutes?

820
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,280
No, you did quite well.

821
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:48,280
Those who left

822
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,360
don't know art.

823
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:51,560
People who really know art
were even crying.

824
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,320
There was one person

825
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:53,760
in the first row

826
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,000
crying.

827
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:55,520
Really?

828
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:56,120
Really?

829
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:56,879
Really?

830
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,560
But it was really better than
what we did previously.

831
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,239
Last year, people all left

832
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,479
when we just started.

833
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:06,399
So we have to celebrate this year.

834
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,320
Really?

835
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,840
Go to the backstage and get changed.

836
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,439
To celebrate!

837
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,399
Let's go eat fish!

838
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:13,080
Go eat fish!

839
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:16,719
Cheers!

840
00:35:19,919 --> 00:35:20,879
Thanks to

841
00:35:20,959 --> 00:35:22,360
our leading lady this time.

842
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,320
So we can

843
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,919
achieve 100% attendance.

844
00:35:25,439 --> 00:35:26,000
That's true.

845
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,080
Let's toast again

846
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:27,840
to our leading lady.

847
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,439
Cheers!

848
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,919
Cheers, cheers!

849
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,239
But,

850
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,560
shame to say,

851
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,959
I just kept

852
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:37,399
10 minutes of 100% attendance.

853
00:35:37,879 --> 00:35:38,800
10 minutes.

854
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,520
At least, our drama club

855
00:35:40,879 --> 00:35:41,639
can go on.

856
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,320
Right, indeed.

857
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,600
Great!

858
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,239
Alright. Alright.

859
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:46,919
You guys are making me

860
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,719
feel embarrassing.

861
00:35:47,959 --> 00:35:49,320
Well, what else do you want to eat?

862
00:35:49,399 --> 00:35:50,159
I'll go get two more dishes.

863
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,360
No, no.

864
00:35:51,439 --> 00:35:52,560
That's enough.

865
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,159
Out of ice tea.

866
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,239
I'll go get some more bottles.

867
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,000
You can eat while waiting.

868
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,719
Okay, okay.

869
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,479
Wait for me.

870
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:00,520
Okay!

871
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,199
That stupid play
really got 100% attendance.

872
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,840
I think so.

873
00:36:03,959 --> 00:36:04,800
But a few minutes later,

874
00:36:04,879 --> 00:36:05,520
everyone was gone.

875
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,399
What do you want to eat?

876
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:12,520
I'd say the stupid drama club

877
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,320
should dismiss as soon as possible.

878
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,040
And they still want to compete with us.

879
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:16,679
Exactly.

880
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,719
What are you talking about?

881
00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:21,600
Forget it, forget it.

882
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,600
Forget it.

883
00:36:23,399 --> 00:36:24,199
Am I wrong?

884
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,600
A drama club,

885
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,840
with a biology student as the president,

886
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:30,560
a P.E. student,

887
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,040
an archaeology student

888
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:33,239
and a computer student as members.

889
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:34,800
I heard today

890
00:36:34,879 --> 00:36:35,600
the leading lady is

891
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:37,760
a skater.

892
00:36:37,879 --> 00:36:38,560
Right.

893
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:39,600
Just some nobodies.

894
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:40,479
Why do you still act?

895
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:41,679
Don't waste our time.

896
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,199
Okay?

897
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:43,800
What's wrong with the skater?

898
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,639
What? Do you want to fight?

899
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,120
Forget it, forget it.

900
00:36:47,439 --> 00:36:48,479
Music and drama are inseparable.

901
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,360
We are all brothers.

902
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:50,560
Don't hurt the friendship.

903
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:52,879
Let's go.

904
00:36:55,439 --> 00:36:56,040
Forget it, President.

905
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:56,639
Don't be mad at them.

906
00:36:56,919 --> 00:36:57,639
They're just jealous.

907
00:36:58,919 --> 00:36:59,840
Jealous?

908
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:00,919
You are a bunch of

909
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,040
nobodies who don't know art.

910
00:37:02,399 --> 00:37:03,560
What did you say?

911
00:37:07,919 --> 00:37:09,120
- God.
- I...

912
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,399
I...

913
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:20,439
Help.

914
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:21,639
Run separately.

915
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,520
Okay!

916
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,520
Chase them.

917
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,280
Don't run.

918
00:37:27,919 --> 00:37:28,879
Don't run.

919
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:33,520
Where are they?

920
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:36,000
Go over there and check it out.

921
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:36,679
Okay.

922
00:37:44,959 --> 00:37:45,639
There is no one.

923
00:37:45,919 --> 00:37:46,679
Up there, up there.

924
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:54,959
Go check it.

925
00:37:55,959 --> 00:37:56,639
Don't push me.

926
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,600
Anyone?

927
00:37:57,879 --> 00:37:58,679
- Go up.
- Take a look.

928
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,239
Go.

929
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:00,639
Go.

930
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,159
Anyone?

931
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:05,679
No.

932
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:06,719
Look at that little girl.

933
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,560
I don't think she can go up there.

934
00:38:08,959 --> 00:38:09,679
Did you find them?

935
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,120
No.

936
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,479
Keep looking for them.

937
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,199
No. Do you see anyone over there?

938
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,040
No, there's no one.

939
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:30,760
So tired.

940
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,280
Over there.

941
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,679
Go, go, go.

942
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,679
You're still laughing.

943
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Why did you run so slowly just now?

944
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:53,120
You are a professional athlete.

945
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:54,000
Can I compete with you?

946
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:55,520
Then why were you so timid?

947
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:56,959
You were also afraid

948
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:57,560
when you were there.

949
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,199
I...

950
00:38:58,239 --> 00:38:58,719
When you were in the canteen,

951
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,520
weren't you so brave?

952
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,199
They talked bad of us.

953
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:03,479
They said

954
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,199
we are a bunch of nobodies,

955
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,239
and outsiders.

956
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:07,840
And they said we don't know art,

957
00:39:08,399 --> 00:39:09,159
but they do.

958
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:10,479
I think it's them

959
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,360
who don't know art.

960
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,360
Right?

961
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,520
What is it?

962
00:39:16,879 --> 00:39:18,520
Actually, I think they

963
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,320
are right.

964
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,679
I am a biology student,

965
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:23,120
leading some outsiders.

966
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,479
Just motivated by enthusiasm,

967
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,919
what kind of good stuff can we play?

968
00:39:29,719 --> 00:39:31,280
But because of enthusiasm,

969
00:39:31,479 --> 00:39:32,320
we are all acting so good.

970
00:39:35,399 --> 00:39:36,280
But let me tell you.

971
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,239
In the past,

972
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,719
our drama club was quite popular.

973
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,280
When I joined the club,

974
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,320
the president was

975
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:42,360
a student from Department
of Chinese Language.

976
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:43,520
He did not repel

977
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,479
amateurs like us

978
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,840
and kept telling us to

979
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,560
have fun on stage,

980
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:48,919
and don't take other people's view

981
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,679
too seriously.

982
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:50,919
Because art

983
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,280
is the loneliness of a group of people.

984
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,159
Later,

985
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,399
I became the president,

986
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,239
and the drama club is
getting worse and worse.

987
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:03,719
Now it's about to become

988
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,919
my own carnival.

989
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:07,479
I don't think so.

990
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,120
Everyone is happy today.

991
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,360
So am I.

992
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,000
I am very, very happy.

993
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,239
Really?

994
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,280
Why?

995
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:21,879
Because

996
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,280
I haven't been a leading role

997
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,280
since I was little.

998
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:27,159
So I don't know

999
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:28,879
how it feels to be noticed.

1000
00:40:29,959 --> 00:40:31,239
Then I practiced
Short Track Speed Skating,

1001
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,399
in children group

1002
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,800
I always lost to the same one,

1003
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:35,679
so my home is full of silver medals.

1004
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:37,159
Later, I grew up,

1005
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,399
and she is half a year younger than me,

1006
00:40:38,959 --> 00:40:40,080
so she still stayed in
the children group.

1007
00:40:40,399 --> 00:40:41,239
Wasn't it good?

1008
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,080
You can finally win a gold medal.

1009
00:40:44,879 --> 00:40:45,879
What I didn't expect was

1010
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,679
there were more
tough ones in the junior group.

1011
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:49,439
I haven't even got
a silver medal since then.

1012
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:56,879
So no one would notice me

1013
00:40:57,399 --> 00:40:58,879
since I was little.

1014
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,040
Then I fell in love with a boy

1015
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,959
for a very long time.

1016
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,439
One day I finally

1017
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,040
took up the courage to tell him.

1018
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,879
He turned me down.

1019
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:14,439
Why?

1020
00:41:15,159 --> 00:41:16,040
What did he say?

1021
00:41:17,239 --> 00:41:18,080
He said

1022
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,159
you are so ordinary

1023
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:24,879
that I would not notice

1024
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:25,560
you at all

1025
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,520
if you are in a crowd.

1026
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,879
So you're not good enough for me.

1027
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:30,520
What made him say that to you?

1028
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,959
Is he handsome himself?

1029
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,600
He has small eyes with single eyelid,

1030
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,520
and is smiling all the time.

1031
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:41,959
He looks a lot like you.

1032
00:41:48,879 --> 00:41:50,159
No wonder you hate me.

1033
00:41:55,399 --> 00:41:56,239
Anyway,

1034
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,439
today is my first time

1035
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,040
standing in the center
of the stage in my life.

1036
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,520
Music,

1037
00:42:02,439 --> 00:42:03,239
lighting,

1038
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:04,679
and even all eyes

1039
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,520
are on me.

1040
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:08,520
It feels so good to be noticed.

1041
00:42:09,399 --> 00:42:10,439
Thank you.

1042
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:15,239
In fact,

1043
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,320
I always feel

1044
00:42:18,439 --> 00:42:19,320
you are special.

1045
00:42:19,879 --> 00:42:21,080
You deserve these.

1046
00:42:36,879 --> 00:42:37,600
Alright,

1047
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:38,800
the lead actress experience

1048
00:42:39,239 --> 00:42:40,760
shall end here.

1049
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,199
Starting from tomorrow,

1050
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,199
I will return

1051
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,080
to the real life.

1052
00:42:44,679 --> 00:42:45,919
I need to prepare myself
for the College Student Ice League.

1053
00:42:46,959 --> 00:42:47,600
Let's fight.

1054
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:48,919
Fighting!

1055
00:42:49,959 --> 00:42:50,919
Let's go.

1056
00:42:52,879 --> 00:42:54,239
Wait, let me help you.
