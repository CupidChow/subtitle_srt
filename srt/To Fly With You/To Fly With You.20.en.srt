=Episode 20=

3
00:01:37,199 --> 00:01:38,639
I barely watched movies.

4
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,839
Zhengyi,

5
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:46,000
do you like Shao Beisheng or not?

6
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,360
What are you thinking?

7
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,879
We are just friends.

8
00:01:57,199 --> 00:01:58,559
Really? Just friends?

9
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,680
What did you just say?

10
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,240
I asked if

11
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,039
you have watched

12
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:10,759
any good movies

13
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,919
about mother's love.

14
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,839
Let me see.

15
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,080
I would choose...

(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team of
Lingbei University)

17
00:02:34,839 --> 00:02:35,600
(Beisheng.)

18
00:02:36,839 --> 00:02:37,679
(Although pain is)

19
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:38,759
(the challenge every athlete)

20
00:02:38,839 --> 00:02:40,520
(needs to face,)

21
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,679
(this time)

22
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:44,279
(it has left you a)

23
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,759
(very cruel decision to make.)

24
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:48,600
(I'm not worried that you
are not strong enough.)

25
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:50,360
(What I'm worried about is that
you would force yourself too much.)

26
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,600
(Don't be afraid.)

27
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,759
(No matter what choice you make,)

28
00:02:55,839 --> 00:02:56,800
(mom will firmly)

29
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:58,160
(support you.)

30

Beisheng.

31
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:33,559
Mom.

32
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:34,080
Come here.

33
00:03:34,119 --> 00:03:34,960
Come to mommy.

34
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,960
Okay.

35
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,759
The skating is so great!

36
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,479
Stop. Stop!

37
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,960
Great!

38
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,559
I will skate with you, alright?

39
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,279
Yes.

40
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,880
Mommy, stay with me.

41
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:47,679
I'm scared.

42
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:48,559
Don't worry.

43
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:49,880
Mommy

44
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,080
will always be with my Beisheng.

45
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,119
Is it okay?

46
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,080
Yes.

47
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:38,440
So why didn't you

48
00:04:38,559 --> 00:04:39,760
keep your promise?

49
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,500
(The competition news of Shao Beisheng)

50
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:09,500
(The competition news of Shao Beisheng)

51
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,540
(Beisheng, mom misses you.)

52
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,460
(Beisheng, mom misses you.)

53
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:50,399
Drink more water.

54
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,720
Alright.

55
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,020
(Qu Zhi.)

56
00:06:02,119 --> 00:06:03,399
Hey. What's up?

57
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,399
I'm downstairs.

58
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,839
Can you come down?

59
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,720
Well... Okay.

60
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:09,920
Wait for a while.

61
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:11,959
Who's that?

62
00:06:13,799 --> 00:06:14,320
Food delivery guy.

63
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,119
I will go pick up the food.

64
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,519
Put on more clothes.

65
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,480
Lele, where are you going?

66
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,000
I will pick up the food.

67
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,160
Why are you here?

68
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,320
I heard that you got sick,

69
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:50,920
so I give some
medicine to you.

70
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,880
Are you okay?

71
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,119
Yes.

72
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,279
I just want to sleep.

73
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:56,920
Wait a second.

74
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,519
What is this?

75
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,200
Forehead temperature tester.

76
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,399
Is that necessary?

77
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,640
Yes.

78
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:20,839
36.2 degrees.

79
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:21,720
Not bad.

80
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,640
You are not having a fever.

81
00:07:25,119 --> 00:07:25,640
Alright.

82
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:27,000
I told them that I came downstairs
to pick up the food.

83
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,920
They will suspect me

84
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:28,920
If I go back too late.

85
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:30,440
Go back now.

86
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,320
Do you have to be

87
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,320
that sneaky?

88
00:07:35,119 --> 00:07:36,239
Do you have to hide me from people?

89
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,000
Of course not.

90
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:39,399
It's just that we

91
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,480
started too fast.

92
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,799
I don't know how

93
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,559
I should tell them.

94
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,799
Please understand me.

95
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:45,640
Okay.

96
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,239
I'm really touched.

97
00:07:49,359 --> 00:07:49,920
Alright.

98
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,519
See you around then.

99
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:52,959
Bye.

100
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,760
Bye.

101
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,600
Remember to take the medicine.

102
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,640
Sleep early.

103
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:21,959
What are you doing?

104
00:08:22,239 --> 00:08:23,359
Destroying the dorm?

105
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:26,279
What are you doing?

106
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,239
Looking for something.

107
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:29,239
He's been looking for
it for the whole day.

108
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,440
What are you looking for?
I will help you.

109
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:34,479
Don't touch my stuff.

110
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:36,840
Leave him alone.

111
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,200
Let him do it by himself.

112
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,680
Why do you have to be so irritable?

113
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:00,919
Look!

114
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,080
I said that he's looking
for the love token,

115
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,840
but he would not admit it.

116
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,479
Mommy, I'm scared.

117
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,119
What if I make

118
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,000
mistakes?

119
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,039
I want you to go with me.

120
00:09:13,599 --> 00:09:15,479
Mommy wants to go with you,

121
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,799
but mommy has a

122
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:18,200
very special and

123
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,239
important training,

124
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,320
so that I cannot go with you.

125
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,679
I'm sorry.

126
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,080
But,

127
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,560
mommy has a

128
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,320
magical thing for you.

129
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,599
What is this?

130
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,760
This represents

131
00:09:38,719 --> 00:09:39,799
mommy.

132
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:43,760
As long as you wear it,

133
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,080
it means that mommy

134
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,799
is next to you

135
00:09:49,599 --> 00:09:50,320
and cheering up for you.

136
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,760
Is it okay?

137
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,679
Yes!

138
00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:53,880
I see.

139
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:54,760
See you then, Beisheng.

140
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:56,479
Go to find the coach.

141
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,799
Say goodbye to mommy.

142
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,080
Goodbye, mommy.

143
00:10:02,599 --> 00:10:03,280
Beisheng.

144
00:10:04,239 --> 00:10:04,799
Fighting!

145
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,080
Fighting!

146
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,559
What is this? It's so ugly.

147
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:13,239
Did Shen Zhengyi give you that?

148
00:10:16,479 --> 00:10:17,880
Where are you going at this late hour?

149
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,700
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team of
Lingbei University)

150
00:10:42,719 --> 00:10:43,440
Beisheng.

151
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,479
Don't misunderstand me...

152
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:46,119
Do you really think

153
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,000
that you know me well?

154
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,479
Do you think that

155
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:49,400
you can prove that

156
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:50,119
you know me well just with

157
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,400
this book?

158
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,760
That's not what I mean.

159
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,760
Just because you

160
00:10:57,359 --> 00:10:57,880
saved some

161
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,960
edited photos,

162
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,719
pasted some news,

163
00:11:01,239 --> 00:11:01,719
and wrote about

164
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:02,599

166
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:03,880
you think that you

167

know me well, right?

168
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,359
I'm sorry.

169
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,159
That's not what I mean.

170
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,119
Really.

171
00:11:25,599 --> 00:11:26,239
This is my photo of

172
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,280
winning prize for the first time.

173
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,200
You only know that I won

174
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:30,960
the golden medal for the first time,

175
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,960
but you had no idea that

176
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,799
the committee organized

177
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,039
all the kids to take

178
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:36,719
pictures with their parents.

179
00:11:38,119 --> 00:11:39,039
All the players around me

180
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,919
stood together with

181
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,760
their parents

182
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,599
except me.

183
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:46,400
So even though I won the golden medal,

184
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,479
I took my dad

185
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:48,640
to the corner

186
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,880
of the last row.

187
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:52,159
Because if I stand in the middle,

188
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,200
other people's parents

189
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,080
will stand next to me.

190
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,239
This really made me sad.

191
00:12:04,239 --> 00:12:05,039
For this article,

192
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:08,039
back then, the host asked me that

193
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:10,919
who I would want to share

194
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,719
the news with first

195
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,000
if I win the golden medal.

196
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,479
The answer written there was

197
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:18,520
my dad, my coach,

198
00:12:18,599 --> 00:12:19,520
and my teammates.

199
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:23,760
But you didn't know that

200
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,760
the first name

201
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,359
I said was you.

202
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:33,880
This was the first time that

203
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,960
I made mistake during
international competition.

204
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:38,880
At that time, you sent me

205
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,159
a message in a while.

206
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:41,919
I was so excited when
I checked out the message,

207
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:43,520
because I wanted to know

208
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,159
what you would say to me.

209
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,919
However, it was not any caring words

210
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,679
or reminders,

211
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,119
not even a polite greeting.

212
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,640
You told me that

213
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,280
my leg lacked enough power,

214
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:58,640
and I needed to do the
enhancement training.

215
00:13:01,359 --> 00:13:03,159
But you had no idea that

216
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,520
I secretly trained myself

217
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:09,960
just for that contest,

218
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,520
so that it sprained
the muscle of my leg.

219
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,400
Still, I didn't care and I had to go.

220
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,080
I did my best to practice

221
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:19,239
and I must attend that contest,

222
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,520
because the final round of that game

223
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,159
would take place in Korea.

224
00:13:22,119 --> 00:13:22,719
I wanted to find

225
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:23,760
an honorable reason

226
00:13:25,359 --> 00:13:26,200
to see you.

227
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,719
You didn't know that

228
00:13:45,479 --> 00:13:46,280
before I turned 18 years old,

229
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:47,440
every time I won prizes,

230
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,960
I told myself that

231
00:13:51,359 --> 00:13:52,080
if I could

232
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,239
see you in the audience area

233
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:54,880
when I received the prize,

234
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,679
I would forgive you.

235
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:57,239
But it never happened.

236
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,679
Do you know that I even

237
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,239
envy about Shen Zhengyi?

238
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:02,679
Because no matter how

239
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:03,760
she prevented her

240
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,679
from skating,

241
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,039
at least

242
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:07,599
she stayed with her through
the whole childhood.

243
00:14:08,479 --> 00:14:09,479
Therefore, every time she tells me

244
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,719
that she envies me

245
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,719
because I have a mom who loves me,

246
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:15,440
it sounds ironic to me.

247
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,960
But what about me?

248
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,799
You know nothing.

249
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
So stop trying to fool

250
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,919
me with just a book.

251
00:14:35,479 --> 00:14:36,679
Beisheng.

252
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,840
I'm sorry.

253
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,200
I'm not a good mom.

254
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:52,359
I have been absent

255
00:14:52,479 --> 00:14:54,239
for too long.

256
00:14:58,239 --> 00:14:59,479
I'm sorry.

257
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:44,020
(Beisheng, mom misses you.)

258
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,559
I'm sorry.

259
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,150
(Beisheng, mom misses you.)

260
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:59,730
(Beisheng, mom misses you.)

261
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,799
It's okay.

262
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:24,840
I forgive you now.

263
00:16:27,599 --> 00:16:28,320
At least you

264
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,799
witnessed my growth,

265
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,520
right?

266
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,080
And,

267
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,479
I missed you.

268
00:16:46,119 --> 00:16:46,880
Mom.

269
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,440
Mom is so sorry.

270
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,320
Do you know how much I miss you

271
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,479
and how much I want to hug you?

272
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,520
I've been thinking about
it for decades of years.

273
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,359
Shao Beisheng.

274
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,199
Xiao Qing.

275
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,599
Do you have a moment later?

276
00:17:39,199 --> 00:17:40,160
What's up?

277
00:17:41,199 --> 00:17:42,119
There are a few good movies

278
00:17:42,199 --> 00:17:43,040
that I want to show you.

279
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,210
(Mother)
(With you by my side, I can love everything)

280
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,479
You want to

281
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:50,119
persuade me to get along
well with my mom?

282
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,079
Yes.

283
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:54,599
Thanks.

284
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,680
But I don't need it anymore.

285
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,560
I've taken care of it.

286
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:59,839
You've been reconciled
with Coach Zhuang?

287
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,439
Hi, I want to check out.

288
00:18:04,439 --> 00:18:05,319
Coming.

289
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:10,280
But still I want to thank you.

290
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,319
Is there anything you want to eat?

291
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:13,599
I will buy it for you.

292
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,719
Ice cream, then.

293
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,959
Ice cream in such cold weather?

294
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:20,640
Okay. Wait a second.

295
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,680
Okay.

296
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,880
(Bitter Coffee Ice Cream)
(Corn Flavored Ice Cream)

297
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,280
I like this flavor.

298
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,040
This one?

299
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:44,880
It's too much.

300
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:45,680
I can't finish it.

301
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:46,479
It's okay.

302
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:48,040
You can share them

303
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,520
with Zhengyi and others.

304
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:51,359
Thank you.

305
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,520
Why did you buy a lot of ice cream?

306
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,520
Not me.

307
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,800
Shao Beisheng bought them.

308
00:19:10,239 --> 00:19:11,319
Here. This one.

309
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,359
And this one.

310
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:15,079
Okay.

311
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:16,560
You like these?

312
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:18,920
Get some more.

313
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,680
No, I don't need that many.

314
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,599
It's okay. Get more since you like it.

315
00:19:25,479 --> 00:19:26,000
This one.

316
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,599
Well... Zhengyi,

317
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,319
I'm still sick,

318
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,319
so I will give mine to you.

319
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,199
Isn't this your favorite one?

320
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:38,479
So is this one.

321
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:40,359
No, thanks.

322
00:19:40,719 --> 00:19:41,880
I have a stomachache today.

323
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,119
You can keep...

324
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:44,119
keep them.

325
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:47,920
Yes.

326
00:19:48,439 --> 00:19:50,239
She... must have caught a cold.

327
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,880
I will get her some medicine.

328
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,439
Zhengyi.

329
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,920
I have some good news.

330
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,280
Shao Beisheng is finally

331
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,280
reconciled with Coach Zhuang.

332
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:01,239
Really?

333
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:02,319
When?

334
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,119
He told me when he

335
00:20:04,199 --> 00:20:04,920
bought the ice cream.

336
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,959
(For people like Shao Beisheng,)

337
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:34,319
(if he likes someone,)

338
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:36,160
(he would be in a hurry to terminate
the contract with me.)

339
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:41,199
Why are there a lot of ice cream?

340
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,160
Shao Beisheng bought them for me.

341
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,359
Don't you worry about

342
00:20:49,439 --> 00:20:50,400
your weight with this amount of sugar?

343
00:20:52,479 --> 00:20:52,920
How is your

344
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:53,800
single skating going?

345
00:20:54,239 --> 00:20:55,400
You seem to have given up your future,

346
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,160
and stay with Shao Beisheng instead.

347
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,599
I know what I'm doing

348
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,959
with skating.

349
00:21:03,199 --> 00:21:04,119
Don't take it.

350
00:21:26,439 --> 00:21:27,280
Cool.

351
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,760
It's me.

352
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:47,880
Are you going on a date

353
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,280
with me or

354
00:21:51,719 --> 00:21:52,959
going to be a spy?

355
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:55,319
We are still having

356
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,880
an underground relationship.

357
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:57,959
Come on.

358
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,880
There's a gift for me?

359
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,199
There are too many people here.

360
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:08,959
Take it now

361
00:22:09,239 --> 00:22:09,880
and put it in my bag later.

362
00:22:11,719 --> 00:22:12,400
Okay.

363
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,640
Come on.

364
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:14,839
You are going to

365
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,079
keep wearing hat and mask

366
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,400
when you are on a date with me?

367
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,760
It looks cool.

368
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,920
You even dress up nicely

369
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,640
and wear a dress

370
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,719
when you go to the

371
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,040
technology exhibition with Wang Jun.

372
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,079
Why do you wear

373
00:22:28,479 --> 00:22:30,000
hat and mask when you see me?

374
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,959
You said that I didn't look nice

375
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,880
like that.

376
00:22:35,199 --> 00:22:38,199
I was joking.

377
00:22:38,479 --> 00:22:39,959
Wait.

378
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,520
It's only been a few days

379
00:22:41,719 --> 00:22:42,880
and you are already ashamed of me?

380
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,439
I didn't.

381
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,040
Fine then.

382
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:44,599
Since you feel ashamed,

383
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:45,599
let's break up.

384
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:48,239
I'm sorry. I am wrong.

385
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:52,680
I'm sorry.

386
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:53,760
What I mean is that

387
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:55,479
I don't care about your look.

388
00:22:56,439 --> 00:22:58,199
I only care about your soul.

389
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:03,640
What are you doing?

390
00:23:03,959 --> 00:23:04,760
What's up?

391
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,680
Why are you having such reaction?

392
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,719
I...

393
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:09,160
I'm happy.

394

No.

463
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,400
is choosing players.

464
00:25:49,719 --> 00:25:50,880
Don't you want to give it a try?

465
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,439
I like Wind Chaser.

466
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:54,599
Yes. However,

467
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,319
the Female's Single Skating

468
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,439
has never been Wind Chaser's strength.

469
00:25:57,839 --> 00:25:58,520
I feel that it's better

470
00:25:58,599 --> 00:25:59,319
for you to go to

471
00:25:59,439 --> 00:26:00,280
Coach Jiang for selection.

472
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,959
She didn't accept me last time,

473
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:03,599
and she won't accept
me this time either.

474
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,280
I heard that it's you

475
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:07,280
who gave up the opportunity,

476
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,599
right?

477
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,079
Did my brother tell you that?

478
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,000
It doesn't matter.

479
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,680
I want to say that

480
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:16,599
it was only

481
00:26:16,719 --> 00:26:17,880
an accident that I got hurt last time.

482
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:19,280
Don't keep it in mind.

483
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:21,119
I think that you've already given up

484
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:22,560
one opportunity for me.

485
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,280
I don't want you to do it again.

486
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,680
Besides, I've made a successful

487
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,040
transfer.

488
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I believe that you can do it too.

489
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:30,680
I really believe it.

490
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,880
I know.

491
00:26:33,239 --> 00:26:34,800
But I like Wind Chaser

492
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,400
and I have affection

493
00:26:36,479 --> 00:26:37,319
for this place.

494
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,560
Stop trying to convince me.

495
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,359
I won't go to Coach Jiang.

496
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,119
Do you have plans tonight?

497
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,520
No.

498
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,359
What's up?

499
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,640
You bought me ice cream last time.

500
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,040
Let me treat you to dinner this time.

501
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:54,160
You don't have to.

502
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,760
Speaking of ice cream,

503
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:56,959
did you share them

504
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,920
with Zhengyi and others?

505
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,160
Yes,

506
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:00,040
but only Lele had it.

507
00:27:00,199 --> 00:27:00,640
Zhengyi had a stomachache,

508
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:01,400
so she didn't have it.

509
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:02,319
Then I brought ice cream home,

510
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:02,920
- and put it in the fridge...
- Why...

511
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:03,839
Why did she have a stomachache?

512
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,439
Maybe she caught a cold.

513
00:27:06,719 --> 00:27:07,800
I'm not sure either.

514
00:27:09,199 --> 00:27:10,760
You really worry about her.

515
00:27:12,239 --> 00:27:12,839
No.

516
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,280
I'm just wondering why

517
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:15,400
she suddenly had a stomachache.

518
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:16,680
Never mind then.

519
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:17,839
See you around.

520
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:19,959
Try to think about

521
00:27:20,719 --> 00:27:22,239
going to Coach Jiang.

522
00:27:24,719 --> 00:27:25,160
Bye.

523
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,719
Bye.

524
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:50,000
Hello.

525
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,839
Hello.

526
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:52,079
I want to ask

527
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,239
if players have to be there

528
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:54,719
for the selection,

529
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,880
or there are other ways?

530
00:27:57,959 --> 00:27:58,680
Could you explain it

531
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,400
in details about your situation?

532
00:27:59,520 --> 00:27:59,959
It's not me.

533
00:28:00,199 --> 00:28:01,319
I have a friend who might

534
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:03,079
not be able to go there.

535
00:28:03,439 --> 00:28:04,439
Then she can send her

536
00:28:04,439 --> 00:28:05,359
video and profile to me.

537
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:06,719
So video works too?

538
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,920
Yes.

539
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,520
Okay.

540
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,079
Is there anything else

541
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,719
you might need?

542
00:28:12,719 --> 00:28:14,199
Okay. Please write it down.

543
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:15,880
Sure. please wait a second.

544
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,319
Please say.

545
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,560
A few clips of 90-second video.

546
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,800
90-second video.

547
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,800
Two 2-inch profile photos.

548
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:28,239
Profile photos.

549
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,560
Two photos.

550
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:31,520
And authentic

551
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:32,680
personal profile.

552
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:34,079
Authentic...

553
00:28:34,439 --> 00:28:35,439
personal profile.

554
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,560
That's it.

555
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:37,800
That's all?

556
00:28:38,199 --> 00:28:38,839
Okay. Thank you.

557
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,160
Okay. Bye.

558
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:42,719
I didn't know you care
about Xiao Qing that much.

559
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,439
Yeah.

560
00:28:45,079 --> 00:28:45,640
After all,

561
00:28:47,479 --> 00:28:48,079
she can't continue the pairs skating

562
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,479
because of me.

563
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,760
Also, she has given up

564
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,959
many good opportunities because of me.

565
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:53,560
So I have to help her this time.

566
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,640
Are you sure that

567
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,839
she needs your help with this?

568
00:28:58,599 --> 00:28:59,119
Of course.

569
00:28:59,959 --> 00:29:01,479
Coach Jiang is the top coach

570
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:02,880
in China.

571
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:04,760
I think that her sense of guilt

572
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:06,040
is too strong.

573
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:08,199
If I cannot complete quadruple jump,

574
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,239
or if I don't achieve a good result

575
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,359
in single skating,

576
00:29:10,479 --> 00:29:11,599
she would not want to leave.

577
00:29:13,199 --> 00:29:14,479
Isn't it possible that

578
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:16,599
she doesn't want to
leave because of you?

579
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,719
Stop joking.

580
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:19,520
Please don't be.

581
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:21,680
By the way,

582
00:29:22,239 --> 00:29:23,640
if Coach Jiang is willing to accept her,

583
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,239
she doesn't have to waste her time here,

584
00:29:25,479 --> 00:29:26,119
right?

585
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,439
Right.

586
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:32,719
How is it between you and Shen Zhengyi?

587
00:29:33,239 --> 00:29:34,760
How long will your hard-to-get

588
00:29:35,239 --> 00:29:36,199
plan last?

589
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,160
It's none of your business.

590
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,520
I know what I'm doing.

591
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,719
Yeah, you always do.

592
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:08,359
There's someone I like.

593
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,119
I will start chasing her.

594
00:30:10,719 --> 00:30:12,160
Our contract terminates now.

595
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,400
Give me one more chance.

596
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,079
Shen Zhengyi, you're done.

597
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:33,680
Calm down.

598
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:00,959
Qu Zhi.

599
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,400
Li Mi.

600
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,599
Get up. Get up.

601
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:04,760
Get up.

602
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:06,119
Li Mi.

603
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:07,599
Li Mi. Get up. Get Up.

604
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:08,680
Li Mi. Li Mi.

605
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,400
Come on.

606
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,199
What're you doing? I just fell asleep.

607
00:32:13,479 --> 00:32:14,400
Emergency meeting.

608
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,959
What kind of meeting
in the middle of night?

609
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,040
I can't fall asleep.

610
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,119
Why do you wake us up

611
00:32:22,199 --> 00:32:23,920
if you can't fall asleep?

612
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:24,959
Exactly.

613
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:26,199
If you can't fall asleep,

614
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,959
go to find Shen Zhengyi.

615
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,760
I couldn't fall asleep,

616
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,400
and if I go to find her,

617
00:32:30,479 --> 00:32:31,479
there's no way for me to fall asleep.

618
00:32:31,959 --> 00:32:32,599
Then go practice skating.

619
00:32:32,959 --> 00:32:33,479
Go to practice.

620
00:32:34,199 --> 00:32:34,920
Shut up.

621
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:36,560
I just made an

622
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,760
important decision.

623
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:40,560
This weekend,

624
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:42,319
I will make my official

625
00:32:43,239 --> 00:32:44,199
confession to Shen Zhengyi.

626
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:54,319
Finally.

627
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,599
There's no one who creates
more trouble than you.

628
00:33:01,199 --> 00:33:02,400
I just came up with a very

629
00:33:02,479 --> 00:33:03,199
clever way.

630
00:33:03,479 --> 00:33:04,040
How clever?

631
00:33:05,959 --> 00:33:07,199
Listen to me.

632
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,119
Come on.

633
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,040
Get up!

634
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:16,320
(Hot Pot Restaurant)

635
00:33:24,959 --> 00:33:26,199
What's wrong? Why are you not eating?

636
00:33:27,479 --> 00:33:28,400
I have no appetite.

637
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,199
You must be joking.

638
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,400
You can even eat terrible cooking

639
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,839
as orange fried meat nicely

640
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,839
in the canteen.

641
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:35,319
There must be something

642
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,359
wrong if you don't have appetite.

643
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,520
Tell me about it.

644
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:42,680
Nothing.

645
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:44,040
I will eat. I will.

646
00:33:44,239 --> 00:33:44,839
See.

647
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:47,199
You're hiding it from me.

648
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,800
Are we friends?

649
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,079
Is it about the relationship?

650
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:04,239
Coach Xiao?

651
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,640
What are you talking about?

652
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,520
I am only respectful to Coach Xiao.

653
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,199
Nothing but respect.

654
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,080
He is my idol.

655
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,840
Then it must be Shao Beisheng.

656
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:23,940
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team of
Lingbei University)

657
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,760
That is nice.

658
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:15,080
Nice.

659
00:35:28,399 --> 00:35:29,439
Are you filming me secretly?

660
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:32,439
No.

661
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,000
How is it possible?

662
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:34,000
Show me then.

663
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:36,719
No way.

664
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
You must have filmed me.

665
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:39,280
Why would you deny it?

666
00:35:41,399 --> 00:35:42,120
No.

667
00:35:42,399 --> 00:35:43,040
I...

668
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,239
I didn't even put makeup on.

669
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,000
You look good

670
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,159
even without the makeup.

671
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:55,000
I will leave now.

672
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,879
You just complimented me.

673
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:12,719
So what are you

674
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,719
thinking now?

675
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,320
I thought you disliked

676
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:15,320
him.

677
00:36:16,439 --> 00:36:17,320
If I can figure it out,

678
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:19,000
I wouldn't be like this.

679
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,560
What shall you do now?

680
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,439
Have a fair competition with Xiao Qing?

681
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,280
What do I own to compete

682
00:36:26,439 --> 00:36:27,439
with her?

683
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,760
Beauty.

684
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:30,840
Let me tell you.

685
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:31,879
You just need to

686
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,040
change your hairstyle.

687
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:33,959
Besides,

688
00:36:34,439 --> 00:36:35,000
I saw an outfit

689
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:36,040
that really

690
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,159
fits you.

691
00:36:37,439 --> 00:36:39,239
Check it out. Sweet and cool.

692
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:40,520
The brand is nice too.

693
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,600
It doesn't fit. Thank you.

694
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:43,159
How would you know

695
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:44,000
if you don't try it on?

696
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:46,399
That's not the problem.

697
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:48,439
He told me clearly

698
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,600
when he terminated the contract.

699
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:50,959
He said that

700
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,560
he likes someone.

701
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,120
I cannot think of anyone else

702
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,560
except Xiao Qing.

703
00:36:58,439 --> 00:36:59,719
Xiao Qing.

704
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,719
What are you talking about?

705
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,040
Xiao Qing, you look

706
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,120
good today.

707
00:37:09,439 --> 00:37:09,959
Is there any

708
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,000
good news?

709
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:13,120
I just accompanied Shao Beisheng
on training.

710
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,439
It was great.

711
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,439
So I'm happy.

712
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:20,439
That does sound like

713
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,159
something happy.

714
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:24,840
I will wash my face now.

715
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:31,919
Don't be discouraged.

716
00:37:32,399 --> 00:37:33,080
We still have hope.

717
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,080
Okay?

718
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:37,919
I've decided.

719
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,360
From now on,

720
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:42,520
I will focus on my career of skating.

721
00:38:44,879 --> 00:38:46,159
(Wind Chaser Team of Lingbei University)
Guys, let's finish this soon.

722
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:48,199
Don't affect other students' training.

723
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,560
Well, put here.

724
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,959
Big guy, be careful.

725
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,399
It's slippery down here.

726
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,040
Don't worry.

727
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:56,600
How is it?

728
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,159
To the right. To the right.

729
00:38:58,479 --> 00:38:58,840
Right.

730
00:38:58,959 --> 00:38:59,600
(Let's be together)
Be careful there.

731
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,520
Don't fall.

732
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:03,879
What is this?

733
00:39:04,919 --> 00:39:05,600
Let me teach you.

734
00:39:06,399 --> 00:39:08,080
You need to remember what
she likes when you confess.

735
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,399
It's personalized. How romantic it is!

736
00:39:10,959 --> 00:39:12,080
When Shen Zhengyi receives
this facial mask,

737
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,639
Shen Zhengyi would say yes

738
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,000
to Shao Beisheng right away.

739
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:16,840
You're quite the

740
00:39:16,959 --> 00:39:17,959
leader of Shao Beisheng's

741
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:19,639
fan club.

742
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,600
Don't touch it.

743
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:23,399
Buy it yourself if you want to try it.

744
00:39:24,959 --> 00:39:26,520
Such oily skin like yours

745
00:39:26,879 --> 00:39:27,840
needs this kind of treatment.

746
00:39:28,959 --> 00:39:29,760
Who has oily skin?

747
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,080
Do your job.

748
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:33,840
Still chatting?

749
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:34,959
She's almost here.

750
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:35,840
Are the balloons done yet?

751
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:36,439
Come on.

752
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,439
They are all hung up.

753
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:38,840
Beisheng,

754
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,639
calm down.

755
00:39:40,959 --> 00:39:41,600
Stay calm.

756
00:39:41,959 --> 00:39:42,520
Follow me.

757
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:43,760
Inhale.

758
00:39:44,959 --> 00:39:45,760
Exhale.

759
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:47,639
How about making

760
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,760
it impossible for you not to breathe?

761
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:50,719
Guys,

762
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,399
Beisheng's happiness

763
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,520
all depends on you.

764
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:55,399
Please work harder.

765
00:39:55,399 --> 00:39:55,959
Okay, okay.

766
00:39:55,959 --> 00:39:57,719
- Nice.
- Don't worry.

767
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,639
Wait, Shao Beisheng.

768
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:00,080
You need to stay calm

769
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,000
in such situation.

770
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:02,439
Why are you sure

771
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,399
that Shen Zhengyi would come today?

772
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:06,280
She's been coming at 7pm every day

773
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,840
ever since she changed the project.

774
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,199
What if she misses it

775
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,000
today?

776
00:40:10,399 --> 00:40:10,959
I think that

777
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:11,879
you'd better confirm it.

778
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,399
Can you stop cursing?

779
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:14,439
Go do your work.

780
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:16,520
Just leave you alone.

781
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,600
I'd better confirm it.

782
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,520
Hey.

783
00:40:56,639 --> 00:40:57,320
Well...

784
00:40:58,159 --> 00:40:59,000
I just want to ask if

785
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:00,320
you have

786
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,399
extra training tonight.

787
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,639
Are you almost here then?

788
00:41:07,959 --> 00:41:08,639
I'm at the door.

789
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:09,320
What's up?

790
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,320
Nothing.

791
00:41:10,399 --> 00:41:11,080
Just checking.

792
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,199
Keep going.

793
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:16,080
Hope you break the record
of 2 minutes and 40 seconds soon.

794
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,520
Thank you.

795
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,439
Bye.

796

(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team of

797
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:37,320
Everyone. Everyone.

798
00:41:37,639 --> 00:41:38,520
She'll be here in a second.

799
00:41:38,879 --> 00:41:39,600
Please,

800
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:40,959
it all depends on today.

801
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:41,760
Do me a favor.

802

- Fighting!
- Fighting!

803
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,959
Come on. Let's hurry up.

804
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,360
Speed up, everyone.

805
00:41:49,719 --> 00:41:50,199
Hurry up.

806
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:51,199
Why is this flower on the ground?

807
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,320
Well... Well...

808
00:41:53,439 --> 00:41:54,439
Balloon! Balloon!

809
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:55,639
I'll take this.

810
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,719
So who will Shao Beisheng confess to?

811
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,760
Shen Zhengyi?

812
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,280
I heard that they broke up.

813
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,760
Then who would he confess to?

814
00:42:01,959 --> 00:42:02,639
None of my business.

815
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,760
We will know once she gets here.

816

You can count on me.
