3
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,040
I always feel

4
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,040
you are special.

5
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,800
You deserve these.

6
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:57,319
Alright,

7
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,519
the lead actress experience

8
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,480
shall end here.

9
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:01,919
Starting from tomorrow,

10
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,919
I will return

11
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,800
to the real life.

12
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,639
I need to prepare myself
for the College Student Ice League.

13
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,319
Let's fight.

14
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:08,639
Fighting!

15
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:10,639
Let's go.

16
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,960
Wait, let me help you.

17
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,020
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team
of Lingbei University)

18
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:18,759
For Women's 500m speed skating,

19
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,160
Shen Zhengyi and Fang Nan.

20
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,479
For Women's 1500m speed skating,

21
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,000
Liu Sisi, Wang Fang, and Zhu Lele.

22
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,160
That's all for the player list of the
College Student Ice League.

23
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,199
Coach Xiao.

24
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:31,639
Won't Luo Xiaoyi participate
in the Ice League?

25
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:33,639
She won't participate in

26
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,600
College Student Ice League
for the moment.

27
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,919
Flyer,

28
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,160
which we all know well,

29
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,479
is the strongest competitor

30
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,160
of our Wind Chaser.

31
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:42,720
They have outstanding
speed skating athletes

32
00:02:42,839 --> 00:02:43,440
in both short track

33
00:02:43,559 --> 00:02:44,600
and long track.

34
00:02:45,279 --> 00:02:47,320
More importantly,
they also have

35
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,039
all-rounders like Yu Bingling.

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,919
But don't be afraid.

37
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:59,320
We fight the strongest team
or we don't fight at all.

38
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,320
It is only through
competing against them

39
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,119
that you are able to
discover your strengths

40
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,119
as well as your weaknesses.

41
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,440
Your performance
in College Student Ice League

42
00:03:08,559 --> 00:03:10,000
is your entrance ticket
to Ling Yun Cup.

43
00:03:10,559 --> 00:03:13,039
Therefore, I hope you

44
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:14,839
value this opportunity

45
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,720
and do your best.

46
00:03:21,399 --> 00:03:22,160
All players for the Ice League

47
00:03:22,279 --> 00:03:23,479
will join a two-week
training camp,

48
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,639
including the weekends.

49
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,000
Don't be late

50
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:26,600
or ask for early leave.

51
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:27,479
No leave will be permitted

52
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,559
unless under special circumstances.

53
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:30,919
From now on, you will have a hard time.

54
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,039
Dismiss.

55
00:03:32,559 --> 00:03:34,440
- Thank you, Coach.
- Thank you, Coach.

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,039
We're doomed.

57
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,559
Even Coach Xiao said
the training would be hard,

58
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:44,160
then it must be.

59
00:03:44,399 --> 00:03:45,320
Have you noticed that

60
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,039
each time when Luo Xiaoyi was mentioned,

61
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,399
they asked Coach Xiao
about her situation?

62
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,119
There's something wrong with it.

63
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:51,759
I haven't

64
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,320
figured it out yet.

65
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,039
But I will.

66
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,639
Is Ling Yun Cup that
Coach Zhuang mentioned just now

67
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:55,479
quite important?

68
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,199
Of course!

69
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,559
Luo Xiaoyi became famous

70
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,399
only because she won Ling Yun Cup.

71
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,559
Well, I haven't realized that

72
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,199
I may also take part

73
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,720
in Ling Yun Cup someday.

74
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:06,160
Stop thinking about it now.

75
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,720
Think about how to go to the camp

76
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,199
without letting your mother know.

77
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:12,839
I don't know how...

78
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:13,919
Leave it alone.

79
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,279
Leave it alone.

80
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,480
Enter the curve.

81
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,440
Enter the curve.

82
00:04:28,119 --> 00:04:29,000
Pay attention to your speed.

83
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,880
(Zhuang Yue will not let you)

84
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,839
(take part in the
College Student Ice League.)

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,600
(You must win the champion)

86
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,040
(of the Elite Contest.)

87
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,559
(You'll lose everything)

88
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,880
(if you lose this one.)

89
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,320
(I'll definitely get the champion.)

90
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,100
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team
of Lingbei University)

91
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,920
What are you looking at?

92
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:09,959
Next week's syllabus.

93
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,040
The signal is gone...

94
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,040
Wang Jun.

95
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,760
Lele.

96
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,480
What's up?

97
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,040
Lele.

98
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,040
Can you do me a favor?

99
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:24,440
I want to buy a bottle of water,

100
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,760
but I've run out of money.

101
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:26,440
I'm desperately in need
for something to drink.

102
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,480
Can you scan the payment code for me?

103
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,880
Sure, let's go.

104
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:29,880
Wait for me.

105
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,320
Which one?

106
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,320
That one will be fine.

107
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,399
Thank you.

108
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,440
You are welcome.

109
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,440
Okay.

110
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,440
Can I add you on WeChat?

111
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,160
I'll transfer the money to you.

112
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,160
Added.

113
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:53,440
Thanks.

114
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,880
Are you guys finished?

115
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,440
Just wait.

116
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,600
See you then.

117
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,279
Okay.

118
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,320
Bye.

119
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:02,760
Bye.

120
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:06,559
He's cute.

121
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,839
Here is the uniform for you.

122
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:09,279
Really?

123
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,160
It's my uniform?

124
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:14,839
On the skating rink,

125
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:15,640
you represent Wind Chaser.

126
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,279
Of course you need to have

127
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:16,880
your own uniform.

128
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,480
Thank you, Coach Xiao.

129
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,760
I'll do my best

130
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,079
and never let our team down.

131
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:22,959
I have confidence in you.

132
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,799
Zhengyi,

133
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:26,679
Zhengyi,

134
00:06:29,679 --> 00:06:30,440
Zhengyi!

135
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:31,920
My mom?

136
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,239
No way.

137
00:06:36,359 --> 00:06:37,239
Hurry up!

138
00:06:37,359 --> 00:06:38,040
Help me!

139
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,720
Hurry up!

140
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:42,600
Mom!

141
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,359
What are you bustling about?

142
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,040
Why are you here?

143
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,160
This is?

144
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:48,239
Nice to meet you, madam.

145
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,119
I'm...

146
00:06:50,359 --> 00:06:50,920
My professor in sketching,

147
00:06:51,799 --> 00:06:52,679
Professor Xiao.

148
00:06:53,359 --> 00:06:54,040
It's very impolite

149
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,799
to interrupt

150
00:06:54,799 --> 00:06:55,559
when your professor is speaking.

151
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,359
That's fine.

152
00:06:56,559 --> 00:06:57,040
Professor Xiao,

153
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,359
how's Zhengyi behaving

154
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,440
in the college?

155
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,600
Well, Zhengyi

156
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:07,239
is the most hard-working student

157
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:08,119
in our class.

158
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,359
Your professor

159
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,239
has spoken highly of you.

160
00:07:10,359 --> 00:07:11,000
Yeah.

161
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:13,679
Please take the fruits, Professor.

162
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,480
It's so nice of you, but please don't...

163
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,000
Well, mom...

164
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,279
- Mom!
- Professor Xiao, please.

165
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,279
No, thanks.

166
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,279
Take these fruits, please.

167
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:19,200
Please take these.

168
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,160
Take these quickly.

169
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,279
Please do me a favor,
please take these.

170
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:22,519
Then mom, let's go to my dorm.

171
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,839
We can talk more there.

172
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:24,959
Let's go.

173
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:26,359
But...

174
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,040
Let's go to the dorm!

175
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:27,959
I haven't finished
talking to your professor.

176
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,480
Why are you in such a hurry?

177
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:31,720
The professors in your college

178
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,959
are all handsome young men like him?

179
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,519
What's wrong with you?

180
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,959
Are you coming to see me
or my professor?

181
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,640
You, of course.

182
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,519
You haven't been home for a few weeks.

183
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,040
I was worrying you've forgotten

184
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,480
your dad and me.

185
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,799
Look at the way you
put yourself on airs

186
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:46,920
and I have to come in person
to pick you up.

187
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,399
No way.

188
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,040
I just want you to check out our dorm.

189
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:50,920
Have a look around.

190
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,359
Hello? Zhengyi?

191
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,160
How's it going?

192
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,640
She agreed.

193
00:07:56,799 --> 00:07:57,200
Well,

194
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,600
she's not too happy though.

195
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,399
Listen,

196
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,359
I've checked it up for you just now.

197
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:04,160
Currently most of those
who teach children arts

198
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:05,720
are students working part-time,

199
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,040
so it's very persuasive

200
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,359
based on your major.

201
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,839
But listen,

202
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:11,160
it's not enough by just
telling that to her.

203
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,079
What about this?

204
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:12,799
Tomorrow morning,

205
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,640
you come and pick me up,

206
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:14,799
and we'll go together.

207
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:15,519
Then my mom

208
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,720
will rest assured.

209
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:19,600
What's up?

210
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,079
You look nervous.

211
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,480
I've brought your package.

212
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:24,399
It arrived this afternoon.

213
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:26,480
Who're you talking with?

214
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:28,040
Lele.

215
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:29,399
Why are you so nervous

216
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,519
talking to Lele?

217
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,159
No,

218
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:33,520
I am not nervous.

219
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:34,599
But you should have

220
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:35,719
knocked on the door
before you came in.

221
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,719
I'm no longer a kid,

222
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,280
and I need privacy.

223
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,159
Fine.

224
00:08:40,359 --> 00:08:42,159
You're a grown-up with your own privacy.

225
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:49,840
Listen,

226
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,919
I have to count on you tomorrow.

227
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,719
Don't be late,

228
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:52,359
do you get it?

229
00:08:58,479 --> 00:08:59,280
Dear,

230
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,400
I've got a nice thing for you.

231
00:09:00,719 --> 00:09:01,640
When your legs hurt,

232
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,039
let's call a housekeeper.

233
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,280
Always on call.

234
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,159
See?

235
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,200
That's very user-friendly.

236
00:09:07,599 --> 00:09:08,599
All right. Hire one.

237
00:09:11,599 --> 00:09:12,359
What's up?

238
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,039
I feel there's something wrong

239
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,840
with Zhengyi.

240
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,599
What's the matter?

241
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:19,080
She's hiding something from us.

242
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:22,599
Darling,

243
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,159
she's grown up

244
00:09:24,719 --> 00:09:26,280
and it's normal to have

245
00:09:26,719 --> 00:09:27,719
her own little secrets.

246
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,520
Stop wild guess.

247
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,599
It's a waste of time talking to you.

248
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,039
You men are so insensitive

249
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:34,640
to things like this.

250
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:35,960
You're always the last one to know.

251
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,479
To what things

252
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:39,159
are we insensitive?

253
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:42,599
Relationship.

254
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,640
Our daughter has a boyfriend?

255
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,719
Be quiet!

256
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,919
Impossible.

257
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,520
Do you know who her boyfriend is?

258
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:51,280
I just went to her room,

259
00:09:51,479 --> 00:09:51,919
and she said that

260
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:52,640
I need to

261
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,400
knock on the door
before coming in.

262
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,799
She has her own privacy.

263
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,840
Privacy!

264
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,599
Do you think we should
ask her about it

265
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,080
and help judge her boyfriend?

266
00:10:01,479 --> 00:10:02,200
Judge what?

267
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:03,400
She's in her first year of college.
It's so early to be in a relationship.

268
00:10:03,599 --> 00:10:04,159
Come on!

269
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,599
Just now you said
our daughter is a grown-up.

270
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,359
That is a different thing!

271
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:13,080
I've found no signs

272
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:14,080
of her staying close
with any boy.

273
00:10:14,719 --> 00:10:16,640
Stop yelling!
She's gonna hear you.

274
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:35,159
Hello? Lele?

275
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:35,840
Where are you now?

276
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,479
Sorry, Shen Zhengyi!

277
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,960
I can't make it!

278
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,479
It must be the midnight snack

279
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:43,400
I had last night.

280
00:10:43,719 --> 00:10:44,840
I'm gonna file a complaint.

281
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,080
Hold on for a second.

282
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:47,400
I need to go to the rest room.

283
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,799
Hello? Hello?

284
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:53,400
No way.

285
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,039
I've told mom

286
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,159
that I'll go with a classmate.

287
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,719
Where can I find another person?

288
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,640
Zhu Lele!

289
00:11:03,599 --> 00:11:04,280
What shall I do?

290
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:05,400
What shall I do?

291
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,599
Maybe I can run away

292
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:10,640
before they get up.

293
00:11:13,599 --> 00:11:14,599
Hurry up!

294
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:36,520
Get Zhengyi for breakfast, dear.

295
00:11:45,599 --> 00:11:47,479
Did you hear me?

296
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,719
I'm coming.

297
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,799
What can I do now?

298
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,119
I need to calm down.

299
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,159
What shall I do?

300
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,719
If I'm not going,

301
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,159
Coach Zhuang will be mad at me.

302
00:12:05,479 --> 00:12:06,840
But if I go,
mom will be mad at me.

303
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:09,840
That's fine.

304
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:10,919
I just need to get another person
to go with me.

305
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,520
Go and find someone else.

306
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,359
I have a lot of good friends.

307
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:16,159
I don't have good friends!

308
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:21,039
What should I do now?

309
00:12:21,359 --> 00:12:22,039
Find someone else.

310
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,840
Think about someone else...

311
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,640
Zhengyi, your friend is looking for you.

312
00:12:25,719 --> 00:12:26,400
Lele!

313
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,919
Come in.

314
00:12:30,359 --> 00:12:31,159
- Lele?
- Thank you, auntie.

315
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:31,960
Zhengyi!

316
00:12:33,479 --> 00:12:34,359
Nice to meet you, uncle.

317
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,640
Shen Zhengyi, morning.

318
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,960
We should go now.

319
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:51,840
Are you coming?

320
00:12:54,719 --> 00:12:56,840
Not Lele?

321
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,479
Zhu Lele

322
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,960
asked me to pick you up first,

323
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,200
and then we can go meet her.

324
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,719
Are you coming?

325
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:07,719
Let's go.

326
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,960
I'll get my things.

327
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,039
Wait.

328
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:13,039
Who are you?

329
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,039
Nice to meet you, uncle and auntie.

330
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,200
I'm studying

331
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,400
at Lingbei University.

332
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,280
My name is Shao Beisheng.

333
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,840
He...

334
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,159
He is just my classmate.

335
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,840
We attend the drawing class together

336
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,039
as tutors.

337
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,400
Your professor and classmate

338
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:29,280
are both good looking.

339
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:31,919
Thank you, auntie.

340
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,280
First Lele,

341
00:13:33,719 --> 00:13:34,719
then you.

342
00:13:35,479 --> 00:13:36,960
How many of you are going out?

343
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,039
And who else?

344
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:41,039
Us,

345
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,719
and Qu Zhi.

346
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,080
Four of us, uncle.

347
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,960
Is Qu Zhi a boy or a girl?

348
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,400
He's a boy, uncle.

349
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,960
Then you are two girls and two boys

350
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:54,039
going out together, right?

351
00:13:54,599 --> 00:13:55,479
Yes, uncle.

352
00:13:55,719 --> 00:13:56,520
What are you doing?

353
00:13:56,719 --> 00:13:57,640
Be normal, please!

354
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:59,039
You're like interrogating a prisoner.

355
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,039
Zhengyi, go get yourself dressed.

356
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,840
I'm done with that!

357
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,840
Hurry up!

358
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:07,159
Sit here and wait for her.

359
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:07,840
Okay.

360
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,400
Come here.

361
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,159
Have a seat.

362
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:09,799
Hurry up.

363
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:11,039
Okay. Thanks.

364
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,400
What's your name?

365
00:14:15,599 --> 00:14:17,080
I'm Shao Beisheng.

366
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,919
Come with me.

367
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,799
Wait, what are you gonna do?

368
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,799
I have a few things to ask him.

369
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,440
Come here.

370
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:26,719
Hurry up.

371
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:36,799
Zhengyi. Zhengyi.

372
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,840
Uncle, what's the matter?

373
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,159
Just tell me directly.

374
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:01,919
What's your height?

375
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:05,080
Between 182cm and 183cm.

376
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:05,919
Blood type?

377
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:07,000
Type O.

378
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:09,000
Tell me frankly,

379
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:09,679
when did you two

380
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,919
start?

381
00:15:11,599 --> 00:15:12,880
We are not in a relationship, uncle.

382
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,599
We are just friends and classmates.

383
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:16,880
I come here today to...

384
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:17,599
Stop pretending.

385
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,760
Good try.

386
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:20,760
Tell me the truth.

387
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,520
We are really not...

388
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,640
Well, how to put it...

389
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:26,919
We are friends, indeed.

390
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,640
She, well she...

391
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:32,039
I see.

392
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,640
Then my daughter hasn't accepted you
as her boyfriend, right?

393
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,280
It's all your wishful thinking, right?

394
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:36,239
Well then.

395
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:38,400
Uncle...

396
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,400
Dad, what did you say to him?

397
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,280
Nothing.

398
00:15:43,599 --> 00:15:44,919
Just random talk.

399
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:46,919
Do I bother you

400
00:15:47,119 --> 00:15:48,000
for talking to your boyfriend?

401
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,159
What are you talking about?

402
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,679
He's not my boyfriend.

403
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,400
Your mom and I already knew it.

404
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,520
You're wrong, uncle.

405
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,520
We are really not...

406
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,000
We were once young.

407
00:15:59,239 --> 00:16:00,280
These little tricks and gimmicks

408
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:00,799
that you play

409
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,000
are nothing new.

410
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,520
Besides,

411
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:06,159
I'm not going to let you have

412
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:06,760
my daughter easily like this.

413
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:08,799
What are you doing?
You are scaring him.

414
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,520
I think

415
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,119
he's good looking.

416
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,400
But as our future son-in-law,

417
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,640
being good looking is not enough.

418
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,679
He must also be kind,

419
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,640
and has good character.

420
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,679
Most importantly,
he must be kind to you,

421
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:20,520
right?

422
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,640
You're still
in the first year of college,

423
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,760
it's a bit early
to be in a relationship.

424
00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:25,280
I'll tell you the truth.

425
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,520
Our team is going to join
the training camp

426
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,359
for College Student Ice League.

427
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,119
But I can't let mom

428
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:30,000
know it.

429
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,280
I asked Lele to pick me up,

430
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,400
but she got diarrhea.

431
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:34,880
So he came instead...

432
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,760
That's true.

433
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,760
Zhu Lele couldn't come,

434
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,760
so I came here instead of her.

435
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:42,159
Just for training?

436
00:16:42,479 --> 00:16:43,679
Then what else?

437
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,000
So you two are not...

438
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,119
No, definitely no.

439
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:49,880
Well, if that's the case,

440
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,679
then hurry up.

441
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,640
See you, dad.

442
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,400
See you, uncle.

443
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:00,760
Young man,

444
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,920
focus on your training!

445
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,400
Train yourselves well!

446
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,640
Thank you for what you did today.

447
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,599
Do not mistake me.

448
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,760
I wouldn't have come

449
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,680
if Zhu Lele didn't
beg me to do so.

450
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,760
But I shall

451
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,640
express my gratitude to you.

452
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,760
Don't take what my dad said

453
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,640
seriously.

454
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,000
He just cares so much about me.

455
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,479
Your dad did think that

456
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,479
he was much better looking than me.

457
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,000
Now I know

458
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,359
why you have such a special taste

459
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,160
for the ice skates.

460
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,599
I'm just wondering

461
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,640
why you keep that

462
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,760
sarcastic attitude

463
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,000
after I showed you my skates that day.

464
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,880
What do you want?

465
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,920
Can't you just be straight-forward?

466
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,400
No way.

467
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,640
How was it?

468
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:01,000
Dear,

469
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,640
I've got things clear.

470
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,400
It's normal for college students

471
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,479
to develop a relationship with someone.

472
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,160
But for those two kids,

473
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,359
they are merely friends.

474
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,520
Take it easy.

475
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,160
Who wanted to

476
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:15,760
teach that boy a lesson?

477
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,599
Now you changed your mind?

478
00:18:18,479 --> 00:18:19,479
I'm done.

479
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,760
I'm going for a nap.

480
00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:22,160
Need to get some sleep back.

481
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,760
I got up so early to cook for you,

482
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,119
and neither of you
is going to have the meal?

483
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:27,280
Help yourself.

484
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,520
Just on purpose.

485
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,330
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team
of Lingbei University)

486
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,479
Speed up!

487
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,280
Don't stand up
until I say so.

488
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,760
Excuse me!

489
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,760
Shen Zhengyi, why are you late?

490
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,520
Sorry, Coach Zhuang.

491
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,760
There were some family issues.

492
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:47,880
Then why didn't you

493
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,280
report it earlier?

494
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,160
I've emphasized for many times

495
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:51,760
that you are not allowed to

496
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:53,400
be late or leave early during the camp.

497
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,040
What's the matter with you?

498
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,479
Coach Zhuang,

499
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,479
Zhengyi reported it to me before.

500
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,880
I forgot to tell you that.

501
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,479
200 frog leaps for being late.

502
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,400
- Oh no...
- You, too!

503
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,479
Don't stand up until I say so.

504
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,479
Squat!

505
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,760
Stand up!

506
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,239
What're you looking at? Hurry up!

507
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,239
It hurts so much.

508
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:26,400
By the way,

509
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,280
Coach Zhuang

510
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,640
really stands well to her reputation

511
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,680
as the monster coach.

512
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,920
Our training

513
00:19:31,479 --> 00:19:32,800
is virtually a concentration camp.

514
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,119
You have the nerve to say so.

515
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:34,800
I did 200 more frog leaps

516
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,680
than you.

517
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,640
I don't know how to

518
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,520
go downstairs now.

519
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,479
Let's go.

520
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,800
It hurts!

521
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,359
- We're so miserable...
- I can't do it.

522
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,880
Let's take a rest.

523
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,760
Can you sit down?

524
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,000
It hurts.

525
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,280
But that's fine for you.

526
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,520
You can let Shao Beisheng

527
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,599
give your legs a massage.

528
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,640
What's wrong with you?

529
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,040
A massage?

530
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,599
He's probably gonna beat me

531
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,520
if he sees me here.

532
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:16,680
I don't know

533
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,119
what's going on with him.

534
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,479
Do you know?

535
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,680
No.

536
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,760
I just think

537
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,280
you should ask him.

538
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,920
What if there is

539
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,880
some special reason, right?

540
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,760
What kind of special reason?

541
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:35,479
Wait.

542
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,040
You just told me

543
00:20:37,239 --> 00:20:38,599
that I should not be too submissive
in a relationship,

544
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,359
and I shouldn't make him

545
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,479
the center of the world, right?

546
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,239
I just

547
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:44,239
didn't want you guys to be unhappy.

548
00:20:44,479 --> 00:20:45,800
Well, happiness comes the first,

549
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,520
right?

550
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,400
That makes sense.

551
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,520
My legs hurt, and now my head aches.

552
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,119
How did they get together?

553
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,680
What are they going to do?

554
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,599
They may go to the
dance room for training.

555
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,640
But Xiao Qing

556
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,000
is no longer Shao Beisheng's partner.

557
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,119
Why do they still train together?

558
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:07,599
Don't you feel that

559
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,599
there is something wrong with

560
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,400
Xiao Qing's attitude towards
Shao Beisheng?

561
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,280
No.

562
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,640
Come on, let's go.

563
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,160
Let's go.

564
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,160
Let's go.

565
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,640
Three, two, one. Go.

566
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:25,520
Come on! Let's go.

567
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,280
Come on.

568
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:34,800
I'm a painter

569
00:21:35,239 --> 00:21:37,280
being so good at painting...

570
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:39,599
Shen Zhengyi, listen.

571
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:40,520
You must stay with Shao Beisheng

572
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,280
for his training tomorrow.

573
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:43,880
Are you crazy?

574
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,520
I haven't worked out my own training.

575
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:46,680
How can I accompany him
in his training?

576
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,400
He cares so much about you.

577
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,000
How can you just

578
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:51,160
leave him alone?

579
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,280
You two are definitely going to

580
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,599
break up if you
continue to be like this.

581
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,280
Do you know?

582
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,599
I've never

583
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,400
left him alone.

584
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:56,800
Besides,

585
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,400
I don't think

586
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,359
he cares much about me.

587
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,680
My dearest!

588
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,520
Other than you,

589
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:01,400
everyone else

590
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,119
can tell how much

591
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,359
he cares about you.

592
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:04,000
Sometimes

593
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,640
you need to show more concern for him.

594
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,880
Besides, he bought

595
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,479
ice skates for you,

596
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,880
but you returned them.

597
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,800
Which ice skates?

598
00:22:19,479 --> 00:22:20,880
Let me be honest with you.

599
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,040
The skates we bought

600
00:22:22,239 --> 00:22:23,760
from the second-hand shopping website

601
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,760
were actually a gift for you

602
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,920
from Shao Beisheng.

603
00:22:26,239 --> 00:22:28,119
They are brand-new limited edition.

604
00:22:28,239 --> 00:22:29,040
He just bought the skates for you.

605
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:29,640
I don't know why

606
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,800
it lost to the skates.

607
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,400
Zhu Lele, you and...

608
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,800
Fine, I know.

609
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,400
It's kind of weird for Shao Beisheng

610
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,800
to do that.

611
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,400
But let's be honest,

612
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,000
he's handsome, right?

613
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,760
Why would you help him?

614
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,119
You lied to me and made me
take the skates.

615
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,520
I don't want those skates.

616
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,640
Is there a reason

617
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,160
for your boyfriend to
buy you a present?

618
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,280
Our relationship...

619
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,520
We are not...

620
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,160
Fine, fine.

621
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:54,280
I know what you wanna say.

622
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:55,760
Well,

623
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,119
it's reasonable

624
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,239
for Shao Beisheng to be angry with you.

625
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,479
Think about it.

626
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,880
Any boy would get mad

627
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,520
if the girl he likes is wearing

628
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,119
the ice skates given by some other guy,

629
00:23:05,239 --> 00:23:06,800
right?

630
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,400
Anyway,

631
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,520
I can't take those skates.

632
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,800
Why?

633
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,000
Because they are expensive, ok?

634
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,640
I won't take the skates. I mean it.

635
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:20,000
Can you just

636
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,000
stop being so difficult
for some time?

637
00:23:21,479 --> 00:23:22,520
Shen Zhengyi. I...

638
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,640
How come I'm the one

639
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,160
who worries about
her relationship the most?

640
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I'm back.

641
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,680
You're quite late.

642
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,760
Where did you go?

643
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,280
I watched Shao Beisheng training.

644
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,119
It took longer time today.

645
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,520
I don't intend to offend you.

646
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,920
As a previous partner,

647
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,280
you seem to perform more duties

648
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,359
than his girlfriend,

649
00:24:01,479 --> 00:24:03,760
right?

650
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,400
Well, as long as
Shao Beisheng can succeed,

651
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,520
everything I do can pay off.

652
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,239
Xiao Qing.

653
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,000
I've got something

654
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:16,160
that I have always wanted to tell you.

655
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,160
You are just

656
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,160
Shao Beisheng's
previous partner.

657
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,640
Maybe you should

658
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,119
think twice about who you are

659
00:24:22,439 --> 00:24:24,040
and keep your distance.

660
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,520
What do you mean?

661
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,560
I think that

662
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,560
I've been clear enough.

663
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,439
Shen Zhengyi is your friend.

664
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,239
You won't go so far as to
steal her boyfriend, right?

665
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,239
I'm not that kind of person,

666
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,400
and you don't have to say this to me.

667
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,359
It'd be the best

668
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,520
if you're not thinking that way.

669
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,400
I don't want to see any

670
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:45,280
stupid drama of love triangle

671
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,359
going on in our dorm.

672
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,760
I'd also like to warn you

673
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,560
that you shall not step in
others' relationship.

674
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,800
Or you'll be punished for it.
Understand?

675
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:54,920
Their relationship does not

676
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,280
involve a third person,

677
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:57,520
because they are not real couple.

678
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,359
Don't mess up if you don't know
what is going on,

679
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,000
all right?

680
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:00,160
Then what have you done yourself?

681
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,520
What's wrong with you guys?

682
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:03,800
What's up?

683
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:04,920
Zhengyi!

684
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:05,880
She said you and Shao Beisheng

685
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
are fake couple.

686
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,760
Isn't it amusing to lie to yourself

687
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,040
like that?

688
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,119
Zhu Lele thought

689
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,520
I stepped into your relationship.

690
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,640
Explain to her.

691
00:25:22,239 --> 00:25:23,640
Well, let me tell you the truth.

692
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,280
We're not in a relationship

693
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,119
like the way you think.

694
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,359
We have been a fake couple

695
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,439
from the very beginning.

696
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,040
‍What do you mean?

697
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,040
Shao Beisheng wants

698
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:36,800
Liu Fei to give up,

699
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,880
so he asked Zhengyi for help.

700
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,160
Zhengyi agreed

701
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:39,920
because she wanted to
secure her qualification for skating.

702
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,520
Then, how come she knows

703
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,640
everything about you?

704
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,920
I didn't tell anybody.

705
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:45,680
It's written down in my contract

706
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,520
that I must not

707
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,560
tell anyone about it.

708
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,800
It's Xiao Qing...

709
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,280
I discovered it by myself.

710
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,880
Wait, Xiao Qing,

711
00:25:54,239 --> 00:25:54,920
do you think

712
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,160
I look funny right now?

713
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,640
Shen Zhengyi.

714
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:58,760
I've been so concerned

715
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,439
with you two,

716
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,880
it turns out
I was just being meddlesome.

717
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,280
Wait, let me explain,

718
00:26:02,439 --> 00:26:03,160
it's not what you think.

719
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,760
- No, I won't!
- Lele!

720
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:06,040
Let her calm down.

721
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,520
Why are you crying?

722
00:26:23,439 --> 00:26:25,000
You knew it already, right?

723
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,920
Just a little earlier than you.

724
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,439
How earlier is that?

725
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,680
What?

726
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,040
When they just started.

727
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,439
So you all take me as a fool,

728
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,160
right?

729
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,239
You had a great time making fun of me,

730
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,280
right?

731
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:43,280
No. Things are not like that.

732
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:43,920
We didn't take you...

733
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:44,920
You don't have to explain.

734
00:26:45,239 --> 00:26:45,640
I don't want to see you guys

735
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,040
anymore!

736
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,400
Go away!

737
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,160
Are you fine?

738
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,160
Are you hurt?

739
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,239
Don't touch me.

740
00:26:55,439 --> 00:26:57,040
I hate you.

741
00:26:59,439 --> 00:27:00,400
What's wrong with your eyes?

742
00:27:00,439 --> 00:27:01,359
Didn't you watch the road?

743
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,760
Why is everyone

744
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,119
bullying me?

745
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:11,920
Don't cry.

746
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:12,640
Don't cry.

747
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,439
You're the one who causes the trouble,

748
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,760
what's your ground for crying?

749
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,640
You look fine.

750
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,760
Just get up and stop pretending.

751
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,920
What are you doing?
Don't touch her!

752
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,400
Do you know how to ride?

753
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,760
You can't see

754
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,400
her standing here?

755
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,400
She bumped into me first!

756
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,040
You ride your bike and
she walks her way.

757
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,560
She's a person, instead of a metal!

758
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,920
Can she do any damage to your bike?

759
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,040
Are you alright?

760
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:39,640
Ok, you look totally fine.

761
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:40,640
Are you injured?

762
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,880
She's got injured!

763
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,040
Do you know who she is?

764
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,400
You don't know who she is?

765
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,400
She is a professional athlete.

766
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,280
You know what will happen

767
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:50,280
after you bump into her?

768
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,800
She will miss her training,

769
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,160
miss the College Student Ice League,

770
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:53,920
the city contests,

771
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,119
the national contests,
and world-class competitions!

772
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,760
Stop, stop,
you're exaggerating it too much!

773
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,800
There are so many people looking at us.

774
00:27:59,040 --> 00:27:59,800
That's no exaggeration.

775
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,800
We will lose a world champion,

776
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,680
and there will be one less medal
for the Winter Olympics.

777
00:28:04,239 --> 00:28:05,119
Can you take full responsibility
for that?

778
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,280
No.

779
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,439
Well, it looks you are fine.

780
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,160
I have to go now.

781
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:08,920
Stay, you can't go.

782
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:09,640
Excuse me, sorry,

783
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,520
it's my fault.

784
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,280
I didn't watch my way.

785
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,280
Sorry.

786
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,760
Stop!

787
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,880
Stop!

788
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,920
My legs hurt so badly.

789
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:21,800
Let me massage your legs.

790
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:28,000
Does it hurt? Are you feeling better?

791
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,680
Are you still angry?

792
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,040
Listen,

793
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:33,239
for what happened today,

794
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:33,920
we're not finished yet.

795
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,040
Listen,

796
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,640
I must make it clear with him.

797
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,640
Come back.

798
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,000
I'm starving!

799
00:28:42,439 --> 00:28:42,800
What do you want to eat?

800
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,560
Anything expensive.

801
00:28:45,439 --> 00:28:46,160
But it can't be too expensive.

802
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,280
Let's go.

803
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,680
Then you owe me 2 meals.

804
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,880
The BBQ today was great!

805
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,160
Glad you like it.

806
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,400
Next month it'll be on you.

807
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,400
No problem.

808
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,280
You pay the bill.

809
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,880
No problem. We're close.

810
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:13,800
Order takeout!

811
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,640
I want fried chicken.

812
00:29:16,239 --> 00:29:18,160
Fine, do you want BBQ?

813
00:29:18,479 --> 00:29:19,479
Ok.

814
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,160
Lele!

815
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,400
Someone asked me to give this to you.

816
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,040
Who's it?

817
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,160
Check it out yourself.

818
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,800
Vending machine
before the canteen.

819
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,000
Who's being so boring?

820
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,439
You need a bottle of happy water.

821
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,640
Turn left and walk 500m straight.

822
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,310
‍(Forgive me)

823
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,660
(Please give me a chance)

824
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,640
(Forgive me)

825
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:34,400
(Looking for your forgiveness)

826
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,959
Take it down.

827
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,479
Put it up.

828
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,719
Now I give you a chance.

829
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,719
If you can amuse me

830
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,479
with no more than 3 facial expressions,

831
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,719
I'll forgive you.

832
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:51,959
Otherwise I'll no longer

833
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:52,760
hang out with you
for the rest of my life.

834
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,199
Enough, enough.

835
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:03,119
Give me a hug.

836
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,760
Sorry,

837
00:33:06,959 --> 00:33:08,640
I should have told you.

838
00:33:08,719 --> 00:33:10,199
But I didn't mean it.

839
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,520
I wanted to tell you the truth,

840
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:14,959
but it's in the list that

841
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,760
I can't tell anyone else about it.

842
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,400
That's fine. Don't cry.

843
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,520
I'm sorry.

844
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,040
Sorry.

845
00:33:23,959 --> 00:33:24,959
It was my fault

846
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:26,479
not to tell you about it at first

847
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,400
as your friend.

848
00:33:27,719 --> 00:33:28,280
That's ok.

849
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,719
I forgive you.

850
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:33,119
Now I'm gonna ask you.

851
00:33:33,719 --> 00:33:34,560
You've got so much time

852
00:33:34,719 --> 00:33:35,359
preparing a whole lot of things

853
00:33:35,439 --> 00:33:36,439
for me,

854
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,640
why didn't you

855
00:33:37,719 --> 00:33:38,479
come for me earlier?

856
00:33:38,959 --> 00:33:39,479
You know how embarrassed

857
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,000
I was down the dormitory?

858
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:41,880
But you

859
00:33:41,959 --> 00:33:43,239
tend to get angry easily,

860
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,719
and it's hard to please you

861
00:33:44,959 --> 00:33:47,199
because of that.

862
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:48,400
So I need to prepare for it.

863
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:49,760
Then these things

864
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,640
are all for me?

865
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,560
Don't you like them?

866
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,719
I bought everything you like.

867
00:33:56,239 --> 00:33:56,880
Then fine.

868
00:33:57,959 --> 00:33:59,800
I'll forgive you

869
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,119
after using these things up

870
00:34:01,199 --> 00:34:01,959
and becoming prettier than you.

871
00:34:02,239 --> 00:34:03,040
Is that likely?

872
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,160
No.

873
00:34:06,439 --> 00:34:07,359
Go away!

874
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,000
It's really my fault.

875
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:10,120
I didn't tell you the truth.

876
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:10,760
However,

877
00:34:10,959 --> 00:34:12,760
I know I'm wrong.

878
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,439
I got so pissed off with you

879
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,719
that I almost ran out of breath.

880
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,040
Massage my shoulders.

881
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,479
Okay, massage your shoulders.

882
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:43,959
Oh my goodness!

883
00:34:45,479 --> 00:34:47,239
How come my face looks so greasy

884
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,959
just after having one heavy meal?

885
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,879
Doomed. I'm doomed.

886
00:34:51,439 --> 00:34:52,159
I need to apply

887
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,360
my amino-acid facial mask.

888
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:54,360
I need to apply a thick layer

889
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,120
for deep cleansing.

890
00:34:57,959 --> 00:34:58,760
By the way,

891
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:02,679
who did you go with for dinner?

892
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,360
Well,

893
00:35:06,959 --> 00:35:07,639
Qu Zhi.

894
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,679
Are you guys...

895
00:35:11,479 --> 00:35:12,280
Then what about you and Shao Beisheng?

896
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,239
Are you making it real?

897
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:16,959
No!

898
00:35:18,479 --> 00:35:19,760
It shouldn't be...

899
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:20,800
He is acting

900
00:35:20,919 --> 00:35:22,199
like such a great boyfriend.

901
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,879
That can't be faked.

902
00:35:24,959 --> 00:35:25,679
He only takes me

903
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,199
as his friend.

904
00:35:28,879 --> 00:35:30,439
What about Xiao Qing?

905
00:35:30,959 --> 00:35:32,760
Does she like him?

906
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:35,479
Yes.

907
00:35:36,959 --> 00:35:37,959
But she

908
00:35:38,439 --> 00:35:39,239
makes it clear

909
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,360
after knowing we are

910
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,280
fake couple.

911
00:35:43,399 --> 00:35:44,120
So...

912
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:46,800
Oh no.

913
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:48,719
What I said to her
was quite out of line.

914
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,199
How can I apologize to her?

915
00:35:51,479 --> 00:35:52,360
That's fine, you have me.

916
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,719
I did it wrong in the first place.

917
00:35:53,959 --> 00:35:54,639
It's all my fault.

918
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:55,399
My fault.

919
00:35:55,919 --> 00:35:56,879
I should have told you.

920
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,760
Xiao Qing.

921
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:10,879
Sorry.

922
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:13,239
In fact, today...

923
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:20,199
You are at peace with each other now?

924
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,479
No longer angry with me?

925
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,719
My attitude was bad.

926
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:26,959
Sorry.

927
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:32,040
So you were not angry?

928
00:36:32,439 --> 00:36:33,399
I wasn't.

929
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,560
You didn't know about it,

930
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:36,479
so it's not your fault.

931
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,520
And you said those things

932
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:38,639
for the sake of Zhengyi.

933
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,159
Sorry, Xiao Qing.

934
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:41,760
I should have

935
00:36:41,919 --> 00:36:42,679
let Lele know

936
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:43,479
in advance.

937
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,479
No, it's my fault.

938
00:36:45,959 --> 00:36:47,040
What I said to you was out of line.

939
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:48,639
Well, you know I talk

940
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:49,479
before I think.

941
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,239
I beg your pardon,

942
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:52,399
and please forgive me.

943
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:54,479
That's fine. I'm not angry with you.

944
00:36:55,399 --> 00:36:56,199
I've brought you fruits.

945
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,879
Let's have these together.

946
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,800
What? I'm really not angry.

947
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:09,919
Let's hug.

948
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:11,719
Give me a hug.

949
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:13,479
Let's hug.

950
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,239
Great.

951
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,639
We are friends again.

952
00:37:17,919 --> 00:37:18,479
Fine, fine.

953
00:37:41,439 --> 00:37:42,239
What's up?

954
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:47,199
My muscle hurts.

955
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:52,959
I gave out everything I've got for her.

956
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,439
No.

957
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,719
Actually it's all the money
that I've given out.

958
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:03,000
How dare you say that.

959
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,719
And this is all because of you

960
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,360
and Shen Zhengyi.

961
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,360
What did we do?

962
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,679
Shao Beisheng.

963
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,439
You must be responsible for

964
00:38:20,959 --> 00:38:22,159
covering my living expense next month.

965
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:23,959
Otherwise you'll owe me too much.

966
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:29,040
Sure. Let's feed ourselves with the dirt
and drink water.

967
00:38:29,479 --> 00:38:30,239
Does that sound good to you?

968
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,000
Here is cold water for you.

969
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:47,360
(The skates we bought)

970
00:38:47,399 --> 00:38:49,080
(from the second-hand shopping website)

971
00:38:49,439 --> 00:38:50,239
(were actually a gift for you)

972
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,479
(from Shao Beisheng.)

973
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,679
(They are brand-new)

974
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,879
(limited edition.)

975
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:58,360
(I just heard about the ice skates.)

976
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,199
(I don't know)

977
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,560
(how I should thank you for it.)

978
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:05,800
(No way.)

979
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,399
(That's too straight forward.)

980
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:22,120
(How can I put it...)

981
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,439
(I appreciate your kindness?)

982
00:39:24,879 --> 00:39:26,239
(Well, that sounds too formalistic,)

983
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,280
(and not sincere at all.)

984
00:39:27,879 --> 00:39:29,239
(How should I say it...)

985
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:36,030
(You have recalled a message.)

986
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,560
What message did you recall?

987
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,959
What did you want to say?

988
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,919
Wait, am I taking the initiative?

989
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,080
No way.

990
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:02,919
I'm not going to be
the one who talks first.

991
00:40:13,919 --> 00:40:14,360
If you don't let me sleep,

992
00:40:14,439 --> 00:40:15,360
then I won't let you sleep either.

993
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,120
Recall the message!

994
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:18,850
(You have recalled a message.)

995
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,639
Aren't you curious about

996
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,080
the message I recalled?

997
00:40:51,439 --> 00:40:52,320
Maybe it was just a typo?

998
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,479
She probably messaged the wrong person?

999
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,000
But it's already this late.

1000
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,679
Who is she chatting with?

1001
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:29,980
(Shao Beisheng)

1002
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,120
Hello? What's up?

1003
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,199
You sent me a WeChat message,

1004
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,280
but why did you

1005
00:41:49,719 --> 00:41:50,639
recall it?

1006
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:51,719
What's up?

1007
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,879
But you also recalled yours, right?

1008
00:41:55,239 --> 00:41:56,520
In fact, there's no big deal.

1009
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:57,800
Why did you message me

1010
00:41:57,879 --> 00:41:58,800
if there is no big deal?

1011
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:00,800
Were you going to text someone else

1012
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:01,760
instead of messaging me?

1013
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,320
Well, that's the case.

1014
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,919
Stop doing that next time.

1015
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:05,879
I will go to sleep.

1016
00:42:06,959 --> 00:42:08,280
Wait.

1017
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,760
What's up?

1018
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,239
Well,

1019
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,159
thank you.

1020
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:21,919
For what?

1021
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:24,679
I just knew the ice skates
I bought online

1022
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,800
were from you.

1023
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,439
Thank you anyway.

1024
00:42:30,879 --> 00:42:31,479
You're welcome.

1025
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,280
You won't accept them anyway.

1026
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,320
They are too expensive.

1027
00:42:36,959 --> 00:42:37,520
Can you find a way to

1028
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,600
return them?

1029
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,239
Don't worry about the ice skates.

1030
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:42,879
Worry about your training.

1031
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,080
Are you still mad at me?

1032
00:42:48,679 --> 00:42:49,320
What?

1033
00:42:49,639 --> 00:42:50,520
Are you so afraid

1034
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,639
of me being angry with you?

1035
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:52,520
