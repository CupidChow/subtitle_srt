=Episode 30=

3
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:45,319
Mr. Zhao.

4
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:46,599
Shao.

5
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:47,839
What are you doing?
Why don't you go home?

6
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:49,279
I am waiting for Shen Zhengyi.

7
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,199
There's no one up there
and the doors have been locked.

8
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:52,919
There is no one?

9
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,599
Are you

10
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,760
at odds with your girlfriend?

11
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,080
No.

12
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,440
Alright, then I'll leave.

13
00:01:58,599 --> 00:01:59,360
Okay.

14
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,960
What's going on?

15
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:26,639
Qu Zhi.

16
00:02:30,279 --> 00:02:31,240
Keep a low profile.

17
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:32,000
You shall keep a low profile.

18
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,279
I want to show off

19
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:34,279
when I hug my boyfriend.

20
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,559
How was your trip alone?

21
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:38,240
Didn't you notice that

22
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,279
I got skinnier this week?

23
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,160
Poor guy.

24
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:42,759
How about you?

25
00:02:43,679 --> 00:02:44,919
Did you secretly stare

26
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,119
at other hot guys while I was away?

27
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,720
How is it possible?
I am making fun of you.

28
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,279
I've been studying hard every day

29
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,080
and waiting for you.

30
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:56,199
That's my girl.

31
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,399
Why is Shao Beisheng

32
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,199
calling me?

33
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:04,679
Hello.

34
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,720
Shao Beisheng.

35
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:07,440
Why are you

36
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,399
calling my girlfriend

37
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,559
behind my back?

38
00:03:10,559 --> 00:03:11,440
Stop the nonsense.

39
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:12,720
Give the phone to Zhu Lele.

40
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:13,839
Okay.

41
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:15,839
Hello. What's up?

42
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:16,919
Zhu Lele,

43
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,240
have you seen Zhengyi?

44
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:19,559
I'm not with her.

45
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,919
Zhengyi told me that

46
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,399
she was going to train herself today.

47
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,279
Okay. I see.

48
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,479
Zhengyi is missing.

49
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:27,759
What happened?

50
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,080
Shen Zhengyi is missing.

51
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,479
I have to call her.

52
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:34,919
Why is her phone off?

53
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,720
No way. I have to find her.

54
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:37,839
I will come with you.

55
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,440
You can put your luggage
in the dorm first.

56
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,440
Okay.

57
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,600
Call me anytime.

58
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:42,679
Okay.

59
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:50,559
The light is off.

60
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,320
Why was it locked?

61
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,320
Is anyone here?

62
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,359
Is anyone here?

63
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:36,640
The phone has run out of power.

64
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:40,559
Is anyone here?

65
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,799
Is anyone here?
I am still in the room.

66
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,720
Coach Xiao,

67
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,959
have you seen Zhengyi?

68
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,200
Zhengyi?

69
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,359
What happened to her?

70
00:04:58,839 --> 00:04:59,239
We cannot

71
00:04:59,320 --> 00:04:59,959
find her.

72
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:00,480
Do you know

73
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,359
where she was before?

74
00:05:02,239 --> 00:05:03,160
Let's go find her quickly.

75
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:04,040
Hurry up.

76
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,359
I'm starving.

77
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:13,920
Is anyone here?

78
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,679
I can do it.

79
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:25,959
I can do it.

80
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,000
I can do it.

81
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,920
I'm not scared.

82
00:06:28,359 --> 00:06:29,279
I'm not scared.

83
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,519
I'm not scared.

84
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,440
Shen Zhengyi.

85
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,040
- Shao Beisheng.
- Shen Zhengyi.

86
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,920
Help me. I cannot get down.

87
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:48,839
What are you doing?

88
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:49,959
Why don't you go from the door?

89
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,079
The door... the door was broken.

90
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,799
I cannot get down. Help me.

91
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,760
I can't last any longer.

92
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,959
Jump. Jump.

93
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,519
I'm down here.

94
00:06:56,679 --> 00:06:57,600
I will hold you.

95
00:06:57,679 --> 00:06:58,119
I will hold you.

96
00:06:58,239 --> 00:06:59,399
Come on. Hurry up.

97
00:06:59,559 --> 00:07:00,720
I will hold here.

98
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,440
It's okay. Jump.

99
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,440
Don't touch my waist.

100
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,119
Trust me.

101
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:04,600
I'm really good at lifting people.

102
00:07:04,679 --> 00:07:05,040
Trust me.

103
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,079
Have you held me?

104
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:06,679
Don't...

105
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,720
Don't make me fall.

106
00:07:07,799 --> 00:07:08,720
Come on. Trust me.

107
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,359
Trust me.

108
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:10,040
Take it slow.

109
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:10,880
Take it slow.

110
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:11,720
I'm here. I'm here.

111
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:17,079
It hurts.

112
00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:18,040
You said that

113
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,279
you have been good at lifting, right?

114
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:21,640
I...

115
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,279
I must have fallen hard.

116
00:07:24,799 --> 00:07:25,480
I can't move.

117
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:27,320
What have you been training for?

118
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,679
You said that you are great.

119
00:07:28,799 --> 00:07:29,480
But you didn't...

120
00:07:29,679 --> 00:07:30,720
you didn't catch me.

121
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:34,880
You are fooling me, right?

122
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,040
Get up.

123
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,079
I won't believe you.

124
00:07:42,799 --> 00:07:43,600
Don't scare me.

125
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,399
Shao Beisheng, don't die.

126
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:00,359
I'm not that heavy.

127
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:02,720
Help! Is anyone here?

128
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,799
Help!

129
00:08:04,559 --> 00:08:05,519
What's going on... Wake up.

130
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,600
Shen Zhengyi.

131
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:07,760
Lele.

132
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:08,679
Zhengyi.

133
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,399
Lele, call the ambulance!

134
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,920
Call the ambulance!

135
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,760
Something happened!

136
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,880
Who's dying? Who needs an ambulance?

137
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,880
What happened?

138
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,480
Don't kneel down on the floor.

139
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:27,359
It's so cold.

140
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,320
You don't have to do this.

141
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,079
Get up now.

142
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:29,839
What's going on?

143
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:30,839
There is no need for ambulance.

144
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,599
What's going on?

145
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,640
Well... I...

146
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,239
I found that the door was locked

147
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,320
after changing clothes
in the locker room.

148
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,919
And my phone ran out of the power too.

149
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,799
So I was trying to climb
out from the window.

150
00:08:46,599 --> 00:08:47,760
Then I saw him.

151
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:49,719
Wait.

152
00:08:50,599 --> 00:08:52,039
I thought there was no one...

153
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,000
Maybe that I

154
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,760
was too slow.

155
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:54,880
Sorry about that.

156
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,760
Sorry for making you worried.

157
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:58,280
All right.

158
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,159
You should go back now.

159
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:00,919
Then we will leave now.

160
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,840
Coach Xiao, uncle.

161
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:03,960
Gotta go now.

162
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:05,599
- Bye.
- Bye.

163
00:09:06,119 --> 00:09:06,799
- Coach Xiao, see you.
- Coach Xiao, see you.

164
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,000
So you are really

165
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,039
not eating with us?

166
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:12,599
I will not eat with you.

167
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,799
Qu Zhi is starving

168
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:14,719
and he is waiting for me.

169
00:09:16,599 --> 00:09:17,239
I knew it.

170
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,799
As soon as boyfriend is back,

171
00:09:19,119 --> 00:09:20,520
good friend is not important anymore.

172
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:22,239
Come on.

173
00:09:22,359 --> 00:09:23,119
You're always important to me.

174
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,559
I love you the most.

175
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:25,960
Alright.

176
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,919
I will leave her to you.

177
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:27,799
See you.

178
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:28,840
Exactly.

179
00:09:29,359 --> 00:09:29,719
Bye.

180
00:09:29,719 --> 00:09:30,479
Be careful.

181
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,840
Don't say so.

182
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,000
You also have a

183
00:09:34,119 --> 00:09:34,880
boyfriend, right？

184
00:09:35,479 --> 00:09:36,000
Do I have a boyfriend?

185
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,119
I forgot.

186
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,919
I will get mad if you keep doing this.

187
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,799
What's your attitude?

188
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,640
You just pretended to be
dead and made me so worried.

189
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,280
I've been looking for you

190
00:09:45,359 --> 00:09:46,080
for the whole day.

191
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,799
I was so worried.

192
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,559
But you blamed me like that

193
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,479
after I helped you get down.

194
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:49,200
I thought that I would

195
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:50,640
make fun of you.

196
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:53,239
Alright. I will forgive you this time.

197
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,640
Just one time.

198
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,799
How is your training today?

199
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,400
I'm so worried

200
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,880
about you.

201
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,559
It has been just an accident today.

202
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:06,080
Don't overthink.

203
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:08,640
I need to go back home tomorrow.

204
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:10,559
I'm a little worried about my mom.

205
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:12,479
Speaking of this,

206
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,039
my mom found a folk prescription

207
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,479
that can relieve the pain

208
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:16,440
by applying hot compress on the knee.

209
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,599
I will give it to you

210
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,719
when she gives it to me.

211
00:10:19,359 --> 00:10:20,320
You can then bring it to your mom.

212
00:10:22,599 --> 00:10:23,799
I'm afraid that she

213
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:24,960
would not use it after knowing

214
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,359
it's from Coach Zhuang.

215
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:28,960
It's fine. You can just say
that I got it for her.

216
00:10:31,119 --> 00:10:31,919
That works too.

217
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,000
Are you starving?

218
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,320
Let's have dinner.

219
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:49,320
Dad, please

220
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,320
hang the clothes out in a minute.

221
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:52,960
I will do it.

222
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,719
Go check it out.

223
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,320
I will do it.

224
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,760
Why do you suddenly come back?

225
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:16,919
The training isn't going well?

226
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,080
No. It's great.

227
00:11:20,239 --> 00:11:22,080
Then is it your boyfriend...

228
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,080
No.

229
00:11:24,599 --> 00:11:25,679
How is my mom?

230
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:28,080
She's good.

231
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,799
What's going on?

232
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:41,559
Mom.

233
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:43,960
Shao Beisheng got you

234
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,679
a physical therapy device.

235
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:46,679
He also put many

236
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:48,679
physical therapy medicine bags in it.

237
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,320
You can try to use this device.

238
00:11:54,359 --> 00:11:55,960
How come Shao Beisheng
bought me this?

239
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,760
It must be from Zhuang Yue.

240
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,320
What are you doing?

241
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:03,559
Why did you throw it away?

242
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:04,479
Don't pick it up.

243
00:12:04,719 --> 00:12:05,799
I won't use what she gave to me.

244
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,440
I told you not to pick it up.

245
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,080
Do you have to go this far?

246
00:12:10,239 --> 00:12:11,799
Do you have to react like that?

247
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,000
Mom, if you don't treat

248
00:12:13,119 --> 00:12:14,559
illness, it won't get better.

249
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,239
What do you mean?

250
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:19,239
There must be many people

251
00:12:19,359 --> 00:12:20,359
who also told you over the years that

252
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,039
she didn't mean to hurt you.

253
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:23,280
She changed her track because

254
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,239
she wanted to block the

255
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,440
people coming from the back.

256
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:26,960
She was also trying to help you.

257
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,159
What do you know about it?

258
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:30,320
Everyone was telling me that

259
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,320
she did it to protect me

260
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,280
and to help me.

261
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,440
But that's because no one

262
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,039
knew what kind of person she was.

263
00:12:36,119 --> 00:12:36,599
No one knew how she insulted me

264
00:12:36,719 --> 00:12:37,559
before the competition.

265
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:39,640
Do you really think she would help me?

266
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:40,320
Just because she

267
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,640
said something hurtful,

268
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,760
you made her take

269
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,840
all the responsibilities?

270
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:44,760
Shut up.

271
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:46,760
For so many years,

272
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,719
you are not willing to forgive her.

273
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:48,359
Actually you are not

274
00:12:48,479 --> 00:12:49,599
willing to forgive yourself.

275
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,679
Because you know that

276
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:52,080
if you trusted her back then,

277
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:53,960
the accident wouldn't happen.

278
00:12:58,159 --> 00:12:58,960
Get out.

279
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,000
Go back to your Wind Chaser.

280
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,359
Darling,

281
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:03,479
don't be mad. Don't be mad.

282
00:13:03,599 --> 00:13:04,320
It's not good for you to be mad.

283
00:13:04,599 --> 00:13:05,400
Darling.

284
00:13:07,359 --> 00:13:08,479
Daughter.

285
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:09,760
Daughter, where are you going?

286
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,159
You two...

287
00:13:17,719 --> 00:13:19,799
Why wouldn't you stop arguing?

288
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:34,880
Just because she

289
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,159
said something hurtful,

290
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,200
you made her take

291
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,359
all the responsibilities?

292
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,359
For so many years,

293
00:13:39,479 --> 00:13:40,359
you are not willing to forgive her.

294
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:40,919
Actually you are not

295
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,400
willing to forgive yourself.

296
00:13:42,479 --> 00:13:43,359
Because you know that

297
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:44,679
if you trusted her back then,

298
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,559
the accident wouldn't happen.

299
00:13:52,239 --> 00:13:53,039
Remember to

300
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,280
keep the knee warm.

301
00:13:59,719 --> 00:14:00,599
How many episodes have you watched?

302
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,359
You don't seem to be watching.

303
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:03,479
Back forward.

304
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,000
It feels so nice, right?

305
00:14:09,359 --> 00:14:10,599
It's so warm.

306
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:13,359
You can be mad at Zhuang Yue,

307
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,559
but Yiyi is your own daughter.

308
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:18,239
You gave birth to her

309
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,719
and she is really worried about you.

310
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,119
Why are you staring at me?

311
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:39,520
I will get you a cup of hot milk.

312
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:40,679
You do know how to interrupt.

313
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:47,799
It's so nice.

314
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:51,080
I will get you some hot milk.

315
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,440
I've told you.

316
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:58,640
Stop following me.

317
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,280
It won't work.

318
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:01,119
It's okay, auntie.

319
00:15:01,239 --> 00:15:02,599
You can regard me as an invisible one.

320
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,520
I'm not expecting that

321
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:05,359
you would forgive me and my mom

322
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,719
just by drinking the water.

323
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,159
I just hope that you won't be

324
00:15:08,239 --> 00:15:09,760
mad at Zhengyi.

325
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,200
Just for Zhengyi?

326
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,000
Of course. Just for her.

327
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,400
Auntie,

328
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,159
sit down here and take a rest.

329
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,280
No.

330
00:15:39,719 --> 00:15:40,520
Auntie, you...

331
00:15:41,359 --> 00:15:42,280
You can regard

332
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,320
everything I do today

333
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:43,960
as what

334
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:45,200
Zhengyi does.

335
00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:45,960
Think about it.

336
00:15:46,119 --> 00:15:46,799
If she doesn't have

337
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,520
training today,

338
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,840
she will be the one
who accompanies you here,

339
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,840
right?

340
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,640
Then I'll regard all this

341
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,799
as what Zhengyi does.

342
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:53,960
Of course.

343
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:55,599
It has nothing to do with me.

344
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:57,679
Auntie, please.

345
00:15:58,479 --> 00:15:59,320
Sit here and watch.

346
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,359
Okay.

347
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,000
Okay.

348
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:02,799
Let's take some pictures.

349
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:04,520
Okay. Come on.

350
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,679
She is so good at dancing.

351
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,080
Auntie, do you want to try it?

352
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:10,960
I can dance with you.

353
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,479
Auntie, drink some water.

354
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,200
You must be thirsty.

355
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,159
We've walked a lot.

356
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,719
I think you should drink some water.

357
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,440
Come on, auntie. Please.

358
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,440
You are prepared.

359
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:23,280
Of course.

360
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,440
The service must be perfect.

361
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,520
I even have fruits.
Would you like to have some?

362
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,440
What's up? Check it out!

363
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,359
Such a good young man.

364
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,640
He really knows how
to take care of people.

365
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,280
Hello, aunties.

366
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:34,400
Is this your son?

367
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,119
So tall and handsome.

368
00:16:36,359 --> 00:16:37,080
He looks like you too.

369
00:16:37,239 --> 00:16:38,200
You're so lucky.

370
00:16:38,479 --> 00:16:39,400
He is not my son.

371
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,479
You must be joking.

372
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,359
Who would you treat you
so well except your son?

373
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:43,080
Auntie,

374
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:44,400
I'm just like her son although I'm not.

375
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,320
Great.

376
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,320
He's really not my son.

377
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,640
I only have a daughter.

378
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,760
So he is your son-in-law?

379
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,919
Then you are even luckier.

380
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:54,679
He even takes care of his
mother-in-law so well.

381
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,840
Then he must treat your daughter

382
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,359
even better.

383
00:16:57,719 --> 00:16:58,159
Yes.

384
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,599
Auntie, about that...

385
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,719
I'm only half way there.

386
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:03,719
It's not certain yet.

387
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,400
I've been working hard

388
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:05,160
on it.

389
00:17:05,479 --> 00:17:06,920
He... He's really not my son-in-law.

390
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,520
Well...

391
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,719
Please don't say so.

392
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:10,599
You're leaving?

393
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:13,640
See you, aunties.

394
00:17:14,719 --> 00:17:15,280
Young man,

395
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,280
fighting!

396
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:17,119
Fighting!

397
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,760
Aunt, would you like some fruits?

398
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,920
Auntie, have some water.

399
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,839
It's already cooled down.

400
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,719
You should go back home now.

401
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,680
It's okay. I don't need to go back.

402
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,520
I'm not tired.

403
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,280
Auntie, did you forgive Zhengyi?

404
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:31,119
Are you going back home?

405
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,239
Auntie, wait a second.

406
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:34,640
I will do it.

407
00:17:36,719 --> 00:17:37,359
Come on.

408
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,719
Auntie, be careful of your head.

409
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,040
Well... Auntie.

410
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,800
Can you stop being mad?

411
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,599
Please stop being mad at her,

412
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,439
okay?

413
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,680
Please.

414
00:17:49,199 --> 00:17:50,880
Why would I be mad?

415
00:17:52,199 --> 00:17:53,439
And is it important?

416
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,959
Yes, it's very important.

417
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,199
If you get mad,

418
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:57,160
Shen Zhengyi will not be happy.

419
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,439
I don't want her to be unhappy.

420
00:17:59,239 --> 00:17:59,880
If you were mad about

421
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:00,560
anything,

422
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,280
please let out

423
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,640
your anger on me.

424
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:04,560
How about writing my number down

425
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,400
so that you can call me

426
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:07,359
anytime as long as
I don't have training?

427
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,520
There's no need.

428
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,880
I have my daughter.

429
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,880
Why would I need other people's son

430
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,959
to take care of me?

431
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:17,319
So you are not mad

432
00:18:17,439 --> 00:18:18,479
at Shen Zhengyi anymore, right?

433
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:23,920
Auntie, be careful.

434
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,920
Auntie, drive safe.

435
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,839
Bye, auntie.

436
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:38,719
Come here.

437
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,800
What's up, auntie?

438
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,359
Get in.

439
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,599
I haven't forgiven you,

440
00:18:48,719 --> 00:18:49,439
just to be clear.

441
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:50,839
I'm just a little tired

442
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:52,040
and I don't want to drive.

443
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,640
Please.

444
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:01,239
Personal driver Shao

445
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,439
is honored to serve you.

446
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,640
Please fasten your seat belt.

447
00:19:03,719 --> 00:19:04,680
We will get on our way now.

448
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,359
Auntie, please fasten your seat belt.

449
00:19:11,719 --> 00:19:12,560
Let's go.

450
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:23,780
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team of
Lingbei University)

451
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,280
Xiaoyi.

452
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,839
(Everyone was telling me that)

453
00:21:07,959 --> 00:21:08,800
(she did it to protect me)

454
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,760
(and to help me.)

455
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,000
(My mom said that)

456
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:12,280
(she didn't want to
take over auntie's track.)

457
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,439
(She tried to block)

458
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,839
(the player coming from the back)

459
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:15,920
(to ensure the safety of auntie.)

460
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,160
(But she didn't expect that)

461
00:21:17,239 --> 00:21:18,199
(auntie also changed
the track suddenly,)

462
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,880
(so they had the collision.)

463
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:22,040
(No one knows how she insulted me)

464
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,040
(before the competition.)

465
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,079
(Do you really think she would help me?)

466
00:21:25,439 --> 00:21:26,439
(I should thank you)

467
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,959
(for believing me.)

468
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,719
(Our goal is the same.)

469
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:32,040
(We need to both consider
your mom's feeling,)

470
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,920
(and prepare for the Asian Cup.)

471
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,680
(If there's only)

472
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,479
(one person in the world)

473
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,479
(who can encourage your mom)

474
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,640
(to step out of the shadow,)

475
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:40,680
(you are the only person who can do it.)

476
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,520
Shen Zhengyi.

477
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,599
- Zhengyi.
- Shen Zhengyi.

478
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:13,719
Don't move. Call the doctor.

479
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:21,239
Does it still hurt?

480
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,520
Doctor Liu, how is she?

481
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,839
Did she break her bone?

482
00:22:25,199 --> 00:22:25,920
No, no.

483
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:27,599
She only has some scratches

484
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,319
and sprains near her ankle.

485
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,040
It's not that serious.

486
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:30,199
I've told you.

487
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,000
It's okay.

488
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:31,760
You should go.

489
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,599
How is that possible?

490
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,959
I've asked for the leave
from Coach Zhuang.

491
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,040
I have to be here for you.

492
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:38,479
Coach Xiao Han, you can go back.

493
00:22:38,959 --> 00:22:39,880
You are still busy.

494
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,560
I'm okay,

495
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,920
and I have doctor Liu here.

496
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:45,359
Lele, take good care of her.

497
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,640
I will go now.

498
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,359
Okay. Bye, coach Xiao.

499
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,680
Does it still hurt?

500
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:54,520
Not anymore.

501
00:23:01,439 --> 00:23:02,160
Luhan.

502
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:03,800
How come

503
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,199
Zhengyi suddenly fell

504
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,239
when she was skating well.

505
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,760
Maybe she suddenly got distracted.

506
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,599
It scared me.

507
00:23:11,199 --> 00:23:12,359
It scared me too.

508
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:15,920
It was so scary.

509
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:27,680
Well...

510
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,560
I want to tell you something.

511
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,839
I might have seen that

512
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,239
Luo Xiaoyi did something
to Zhengyi's skating blades.

513
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,160
Are you sure?

514
00:23:41,479 --> 00:23:43,119
Could you see it wrong?

515
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,640
I'm sure.

516
00:23:47,479 --> 00:23:48,719
Coach Xiao.

517
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,680
What's wrong?

518
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,199
Coach Xiao,

519
00:23:52,959 --> 00:23:53,920
Fang Nan said she saw Xiaoyi

520
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,079
doing something to
Zhengyi's skating blades.

521
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:57,520
You can't say something
without the proof.

522
00:23:57,959 --> 00:23:58,760
Did you really see it?

523
00:24:06,959 --> 00:24:07,839
Continue with your training.

524
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,479
Why did you directly

525
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,680
tell Coach Xiao about it?

526
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:15,680
I didn't think that much.

527
00:24:15,719 --> 00:24:16,599
What if she saw it wrong?

528
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:18,760
You saw it, right?

529
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:25,119
Be careful.

530
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:27,199
It's done?

531
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,199
- Coach Zhuang,
- Coach Zhuang.

532
00:24:28,959 --> 00:24:30,319
Doctor Liu, how is she?

533
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,479
I've applied the ointment

534
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,199
and wrapped the bandage for her.

535
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,239
I have also prepared

536
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:34,760
antibiotics for her.

537
00:24:35,239 --> 00:24:36,000
Remember to take the medicine.

538
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:36,959
Okay.

539
00:24:37,239 --> 00:24:38,199
Although it's not very serious,

540
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:39,239
she can't train

541
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:40,280
herself anymore,

542
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,199
and she will need to rest.

543
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,800
It's better that someone
can take care of her.

544
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,719
I will take care of her.

545
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:46,000
You need to go to class

546
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:46,719
and train yourself.

547
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:48,000
Call your parents and

548
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:50,000
stay home for a few days.

549
00:24:52,239 --> 00:24:52,880
How about

550
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,239
letting me drive you back?

551
00:24:56,199 --> 00:24:57,160
No, thanks. Coach Zhuang.

552
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,040
I can just call my dad.

553
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:01,400
My phone is left in the locker room.

554
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,199
Let's go get it.

555
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:02,880
I will help you get it.

556
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,239
See you, Coach Zhuang.

557
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:04,880
Slow down.

558
00:25:04,959 --> 00:25:05,599
Bye, doctor Liu.

559
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:08,520
Don't do any strenuous exercise anymore.

560
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,839
I see.

561
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:14,800
Thank you.

562
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,160
You hurt me.

563
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,640
What's up?

564
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,760
Did you take Zhengyi's skating blades?

565
00:25:37,239 --> 00:25:38,319
I'm asking you.

566
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:39,640
Did you do anything to
Zhengyi's skating blades?

567
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,680
Luo Xiaoyi,

568
00:25:46,439 --> 00:25:47,359
the life of a short track
speed skating athlete

569
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:48,319
all depends on skating blades.

570
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:49,880
How could you do this?

571
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,119
You almost destroyed her.

572
00:25:51,199 --> 00:25:51,839
Do you understand?

573
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:54,520
I did touch her skating blades,

574
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:56,119
but I didn't do anything.

575
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,800
Then tell me

576
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,640
how she got hurt?

577
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,439
I don't know either.

578
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,640
I took her skating blades out and

579
00:26:03,719 --> 00:26:04,520
then put them back.

580
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,000
I was also scared when

581
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:07,959
I saw her falling.

582
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,680
But I really didn't do

583
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,119
anything to her skating blades.

584
00:26:11,959 --> 00:26:12,560
Luo Xiaoyi,

585
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:13,800
why do you have to

586
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,079
keep aiming at Shen Zhengyi?

587
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:18,760
You have really disappointed me.

588
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,640
I really don't understand

589
00:26:25,719 --> 00:26:26,319
what makes you

590
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,760
who you are right now.

591
00:26:38,199 --> 00:26:38,959
Alright.

592
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,599
Since you think that I did it,

593
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:43,439
I'm the one who did it.

594
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,760
I touched her skating blades,

595
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:47,199
because I wanted to make

596
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:47,880
her not able to skate anymore

597
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,400
just like her mom.

598
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,119
I did it, alright?

599
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:55,520
Do you know

600
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:57,000
what you just said?

601
00:26:59,119 --> 00:26:59,880
Yes.

602
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,640
I will tell her now that

603
00:27:03,439 --> 00:27:04,520
you intended to let her assist me

604
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:05,599
by getting close to her

605
00:27:05,719 --> 00:27:06,680
from the very beginning.

606
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,280
You have been taking advantage of her.

607
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:33,119
So,

608
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,719
what Luo Xiaoyi said is true?

609
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:50,800
Zhengyi.

610
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:05,439
Lie down for a while
after drinking water.

611
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,560
I'm okay.

612
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:14,880
It was really an accident?

613
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,560
You were spoiling her.

614
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:18,280
She shouldn't go back

615
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,800
to Wind Chaser.

616
00:28:21,439 --> 00:28:22,640
It's all my fault. Yes.

617
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:29,719
Uncle, I...

618
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:30,400
How dare you...

619
00:28:30,479 --> 00:28:31,520
I'm here to see Zhengyi.

620
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:32,800
I just heard that she got hurt

621
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,719
when I went back to school.

622
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:34,439
I called her but

623
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,119
she wouldn't answer.

624
00:28:35,439 --> 00:28:36,479
I'm really worried about her.

625
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:44,319
Thank you, uncle.

626
00:28:45,479 --> 00:28:46,280
Thank you, auntie.

627
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,520
Zhengyi, are you okay?

628
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,359
Why are you here?

629
00:28:57,439 --> 00:28:58,280
Don't move. Don't move.

630
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:02,680
Zhu Lele told me about

631
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,760
your injury

632
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,959
and what happened with Xiao Han.

633
00:29:09,959 --> 00:29:10,479
It's okay.

634
00:29:10,719 --> 00:29:11,280
Such person doesn't deserve

635
00:29:11,439 --> 00:29:12,839
to be your coach.

636
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,599
Do you think that

637
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,000
I look like a fool?

638
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,119
As for what has happened,

639
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:21,800
there's no coach who

640
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,160
can coach me anymore.

641
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:26,920
How do I attend the Asian Cup?

642
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:29,719
It's okay.

643
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:31,280
It's okay.

644
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,680
There will be a solution.

645
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:45,120
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team of
Lingbei University)

646
00:29:52,719 --> 00:29:53,839
Brother, I also want to

647
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:55,439
be a world champion when I grow up.

648
00:29:55,439 --> 00:29:56,280
Okay.

649
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,199
But at that time,

650
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,560
Xiao Han and I

651
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,560
must have retired then.

652
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,199
Exactly.

653
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:01,599
When we all retire,

654
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,000
we will be your coaches

655
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
and train you to become
the world champion.

656
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:05,119
Great.

657
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:06,400
You promise!

658
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,400
Of course. Grow up fast.

659
00:30:15,959 --> 00:30:16,359
Luo Xiaoyi has been

660
00:30:16,479 --> 00:30:17,280
absent from training recently.

661
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:18,920
How dare she comes back?

662
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:20,280
Zhengyi got injured all because of her.

663
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,119
Why can't I say something
about her? She...

664
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,040
Luo Xiaoyi.

665
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:35,119
Can you explain

666
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:35,760
why you did something to

667
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,839
Zhengyi's skating blades?

668
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:41,959
Xiaoyi,

669
00:30:42,479 --> 00:30:43,280
you went too

670
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,719
far this time.

671
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:46,560
It's lucky that Zhengyi
didn't injure very badly.

672
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,680
Otherwise, there would

673
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,920
be very terrible consequence.

674
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,479
Exactly.

675
00:30:50,959 --> 00:30:51,959
You can resolve problem with Zhengyi

676
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:53,000
in person but this was

677
00:30:53,719 --> 00:30:55,000
a little bit too much.

678
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:00,439
Do you have evidence that

679
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:02,319
I did anything to her skating blades?

680
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:06,719
I saw it.

681
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,319
Not only she saw it,

682
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,479
I also heard the conversation

683
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,359
between you and Coach Xiao.

684
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,880
I just don't get it.

685
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,040
After all, Zhengyi

686
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:13,800
is also your teammate.

687
00:31:13,959 --> 00:31:15,199
How could you do that?

688
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:17,680
Teammate?

689
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,640
Not anymore.

690
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,199
She...

691
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:25,160
What did she mean?

692
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,560
Will she withdraw from the team?

693
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:30,359
Well...

694
00:31:30,959 --> 00:31:32,239
Did you guys see

695
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,599
Luo Xiaoyi crying just now.

696
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,760
Did she cry?

697
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:38,040
It seemed like.

698
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,119
Why did she cry?

699
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,239
Zhengyi should be the one

700
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:42,520
who feels wronged.

701
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,479
Come on.

702
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:55,319
She even cried.

703
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,640
If I may say so,

704
00:31:56,719 --> 00:31:57,800
you are the one who shall be upset.

705
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,839
Why did she cry?

706
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:00,800
So you mean that

707
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,160
Luo Xiaoyi caused my injury?

708
00:32:03,239 --> 00:32:03,959
Isn't it?

709
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,000
I think...

710
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:08,000
Lele,

711
00:32:08,479 --> 00:32:09,160
have some fruits.

712
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,479
Thank you, auntie.

713
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,160
Who did you say that

714
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,839
caused Zhengyi's injury?

715
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,239
Mom, you misheard me.

716
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:15,839
No.

717
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:17,000
It has nothing to do with

718
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:18,160
Luo Xiaoyi.

719
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,079
Wait. Do you have amnesia?

720
00:32:20,479 --> 00:32:21,160
When Coach Xiao quarreled

721
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:22,239
with Luo Xiaoyi the other day,

722
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:23,040
he said clearly that

723
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,880
Luo Xiaoyi did something
to your skating blades.

724
00:32:25,199 --> 00:32:26,199
I've checked my skating blades

725
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,400
before going on the rink.

726
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,680
There was nothing wrong with it.

727
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:30,079
Besides, I got injured that day

728
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,560
only because

729
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,680
I got distracted.

730
00:32:33,199 --> 00:32:34,520
Then how would you explain the

731
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:35,640
crack on your skating blade?

732
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,800
It must be cracked

733
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:40,199
when I fell.

734
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,400
Anyway, when you go back,

735
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,520
explain it to others.

736
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:46,160
Do I have to?

737
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,880
It was a fact that Luo Xiaoyi

738
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,040
touched your skating blades.

739
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,920
Why would we explain it?

740
00:32:51,239 --> 00:32:52,520
Why would you speak for her?

741
00:32:52,719 --> 00:32:53,800
I'm not speaking for her.

742
00:32:54,199 --> 00:32:55,560
I'm sure that there was no

743
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,520
problem with the skating blades
before I went on the rink.

744
00:32:58,239 --> 00:32:59,280
I don't know what she

745
00:32:59,359 --> 00:32:59,959
was thinking,

746
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:01,280
but we can't make her

747
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:02,199
take all the responsibilities

748
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,000
just because she has

749
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,280
such thoughts.

750
00:33:07,959 --> 00:33:08,800
Right.

751
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,959
Alright, stop thinking.

752
00:33:11,199 --> 00:33:11,880
Try to recover soon.

753
00:33:12,719 --> 00:33:13,640
I will tell everyone

754
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:15,280
to apologize to her.

755
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,560
I gotta go.

756
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,199
Are you staying for dinner, Lele?

757
00:33:25,239 --> 00:33:26,079
Thank you, auntie.

758
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:19,740
(Contact)

759
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:22,980
(Shen Zhengyi)

760
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:57,919
What's up?

761
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,719
I know that you don't want to see me.

762
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,360
I've submitted the application
for withdrawing from the team.

763
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:02,719
I will retire ahead of schedule.

764
00:35:03,439 --> 00:35:04,199
Retire?

765
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:05,879
Luo Xiaoyi,

766
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:07,280
you need to have a limit
for being self-willed.

767
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:08,800
You cannot just retire when you want to.

768
00:35:08,879 --> 00:35:10,000
I've thought it through.

769
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,000
I'm not here to ask

770
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:11,919
for your opinion.

771
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:13,000
I'm just here to inform you.

772
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,360
Besides,

773
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,560
no matter if you believe it or not,

774
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:17,560
I'm going to say it again.

775
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,439
I did nothing to

776
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,520
Shen Zhengyi's skating blades.

777
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:24,520
Luo Xiaoyi.

778
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,800
You didn't complain about

779
00:35:34,919 --> 00:35:36,199
your leg pain these days.

780
00:35:36,439 --> 00:35:37,639
It seems that this stuff brought back

781
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,800
by our daughter does work.

782
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:41,719
Is Zhengyi sleeping?

783
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,280
I saw that she turned off
the light in her room.

784
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:46,719
She's not in a good mood these days

785
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:47,879
so she sleeps early.

786
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:49,639
I really didn't expect that

787
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:51,360
Coach Xiao is such a kind of person.

788
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:53,800
Our daughter can no longer

789
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,080
stay at Wind Chaser now.

790
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:58,159
(I don't have any coaches now.)

791
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,719
(How can I attend the Asian Cup?)

792
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,360
(Asian Cup is the first time Zhengyi)

793
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,560
(will participate in
international games.)

794
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,159
(Can we not let what
happened between adults)

795
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:07,360
(affect kids?)

796
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,080
Xiaoyi.

797
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,159
- Xiaoyi,
- Xiaoyi.

798
00:36:22,919 --> 00:36:23,560
Xiaoyi.

799
00:36:23,879 --> 00:36:25,040
We have something to say.

800
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,040
What else do you want to do?

801
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,040
We are here to apologize to you.

802
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:31,879
Zhengyi told us that

803
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,479
she has checked her skating blades

804
00:36:33,919 --> 00:36:35,199
before going on the rink and

805
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,280
there was nothing wrong with it.

806
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,919
We misunderstood you.

807
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,040
Sorry.

808
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,040
Sorry.

809
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,320
Sorry.

810
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,600
We're really sorry.

811
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,879
We misunderstood you.

812
00:36:47,879 --> 00:36:48,719
Sorry.

813
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,479
The Asian Cup

814
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,600
will soon start.

815
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,600
You should come back soon
and continue with training.

816
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:55,919
Don't let this

817
00:36:56,479 --> 00:36:57,320
affect your race.

818
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:58,719
Exactly.

819
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,719
I will not attend the Asian Cup.

820
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:04,639
I will quit short track
speed skating too.

821
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,479
I will retire.

822
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,080
- Xiaoyi.
- Xiaoyi.

823
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,159
Xiaoyi.

824
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,879
Xiaoyi, it was our fault

825
00:37:10,919 --> 00:37:11,719
that we misunderstood you earlier.

826
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:12,879
You shouldn't retire

827
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,800
because of that.

828
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:14,719
Exactly.

829
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,760
Come back and train yourself.

830
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:17,080
Yes.

831
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:18,360
We even prepared gifts for you.

832
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:19,639
Be happier.

833
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,199
It had nothing to do with you.

834
00:37:21,879 --> 00:37:22,879
I didn't want to continue to skate.

835
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:24,320
Thank you.

836
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:25,879
- Xiaoyi.
- Xiaoyi.

837
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,000
Don't be like this.

838
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:28,199
Stop being mad at us, Xiaoyi.

839
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,199
What should we do?

840
00:37:35,919 --> 00:37:36,919
She is still mad.

841
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:39,879
Let's leave her alone for a while.

842
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,320
Let's go.

843
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,639
We can do nothing but
waiting for her to calm down.

844
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:16,479
(I'm sure that there was no)

845
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,360
(problem with the skating blades
before I went on the rink.)

846
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,199
(I don't know what she)

847
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,040
(was thinking)

848
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,199
(but we can't make her)

849
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,199
(take all the responsibilities)

850
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:24,040
(just because she has)

851
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:24,959
(such thoughts.)

852
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:30,800
Who's that?

853
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,040
Zhengyi's mom,

854
00:38:43,399 --> 00:38:44,320
I'm here to see Zhengyi.

855
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,520
You should be the person that Zhengyi
wants to see the least right now.

856
00:38:49,399 --> 00:38:49,919
Today I'm here to

857
00:38:49,959 --> 00:38:50,919
apologize to Zhengyi

858
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,239
and you.

859
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,239
On the day I went to Wind Chaser

860
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,199
to take Zhengyi away,

861
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:57,159
how did you promise to me?

862
00:38:58,239 --> 00:38:59,080
You said that what
I was worried about

863
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:00,199
would not happen.

864
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,800
I trusted you and left my kid to you.

865
00:39:02,919 --> 00:39:03,679
But then?

866
00:39:26,959 --> 00:39:28,239
I'm sorry. Zhengyi.

867
00:39:30,919 --> 00:39:32,520
You said that I was talented.

868
00:39:33,919 --> 00:39:35,199
You said that I was

869
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:36,199
the seeded player for skating.

870
00:39:37,879 --> 00:39:39,199
Was it all a lie?

871
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,639
Of course not.

872
00:39:42,479 --> 00:39:43,199
I really thought that

873
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:43,760
you are an athlete

874
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,639
with great potential.

875
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,080
I also wanted to help you sincerely.

876
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:49,520
Yes.

877
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:51,199
At first I was hoping that

878
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,439
you could assist her,

879
00:39:52,479 --> 00:39:53,439
so I trained you.

880
00:39:54,679 --> 00:39:55,520
But then I found that

881
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:57,199
your made progress

882
00:39:58,239 --> 00:39:59,639
faster than I expected.

883
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:01,040
You did have potential

884
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:02,199
to fight for champion.

885
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:03,520
But still you chose

886
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:04,639
Luo Xiaoyi.

887
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:08,760
Because she is more

888
00:40:08,879 --> 00:40:09,760
experienced than you.

889
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,199
Her on-the-spot performance

890
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,320
is also more stable than you.

891
00:40:15,439 --> 00:40:16,080
Zhengyi,

892
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:17,199
I didn't want to deprive

893
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,520
your hope of getting the championship.

894
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:19,840
I just want you to

895
00:40:19,879 --> 00:40:20,760
wait a little bit.

896
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:22,719
You're the professional coach

897
00:40:23,959 --> 00:40:25,520
and you will make
professional judgement.

898
00:40:25,879 --> 00:40:27,080
I wouldn't blame you for that.

899
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,199
But if you only wanted me to

900
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:31,520
assist others
from the very beginning,

901
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,760
why wouldn't you tell me?

902
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,439
Am I difficult for you to trust?

903
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,639
It is my fault.

904
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:44,199
To me, you were

905
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,719
more than just a coach.

906
00:40:45,879 --> 00:40:47,879
You were the person who I
trusted and respected the most.

907
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,639
You didn't have to hide it from me.

908
00:40:59,959 --> 00:41:00,760
Zhengyi,

909
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,159
I'm very sorry.

910
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:05,399
I betrayed your trust.

911
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:11,719
But please don't

912
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,719
give up because of me.

913
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:19,400
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team of
Lingbei University)

914
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,400
Luo Xiaoyi quit?

915
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,399
What's her reason?

916
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,719
She only said that

917
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,520
she didn't want to continue practicing
short track speed skating anymore.

918
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,080
Does Xiao Han know about this?

919
00:41:37,879 --> 00:41:38,719
I told him.

920
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,199
There was nothing that he could do.

921
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,199
Luo Xiaoyi is an ace player

922
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,040
of our speed skating team.

923
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,520
What do we do for Asian Cup

924
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,600
if she quits?

925
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:02,280
If Luo Xiaoyi wouldn't attend

926
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:03,760
the Asian Cup,

927
00:42:03,959 --> 00:42:05,280
we have to let Shen Zhengyi attend.

928
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,959
How is it possible

929
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:07,840
for her to win with just herself?

930
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,879
She had such a huge

931
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:11,959
difference with Eunkyung Choi

932
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,280
when they raced last time during
the 7-circle chasing race.

933
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:15,080
If she races with

934
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,600
just herself this time,

935
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,520
I'm afraid that she wouldn't even

936
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:20,639
win Yu Bingling.
