=Episode 3=

3
00:01:43,839 --> 00:01:44,959
Isn't that Xiao Qing?

4
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,239
Why is she here?

5
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,760
She has collected so many

6
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:49,120
gold medals abroad.

7
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:50,360
Why did she come back to China?

8
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,120
(Xiao Qing)
(National Champion of Junior Pairs Skating)

9
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,120
Coach Ma,

10
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,599
sorry I just arrived.

11
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,360
It's alright.

12
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,480
This is Xiao Qing.

13
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,839
Why is she here?

14
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,120
I'm going to get ready.

15
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,240
Go ahead.

16
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,960
Wait and see. Come on.

17
00:02:41,839 --> 00:02:42,800
Look at her movement.

18
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,130
(Triple Toe Loop Jump)

19
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,279
What do you think of this Triple?

20
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:54,919
How is it?

21
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,400
Let me tell you.

22
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:56,160
This Xiao Qing has won

23
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,440
the champion of Pairs Skating

24
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,520
in youth group

25
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,160
of the National Championship.

26
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,679
Wow. She is good.

27
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,040
Nice!

28
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,230
(Biellmann Spin)

00:03:41,399 --> 00:03:42,279
Beisheng.

30
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,160
Beisheng.

31
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:48,639
I've been waiting for you.

32
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:49,720
Oh.

33
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,600
I heard that you got sick.

34
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,119
Here's the ginger soup I made for you.

35
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,639
Thanks, Liu Fei.

36
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,399
I... I feel

37
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,240
a lot better already.

38
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,479
Ginger soup

39
00:03:59,119 --> 00:04:00,160
is a little too much.

40
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,119
Thank you.

41
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,880
Well... I have something to do.

42
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,639
I will get going now.

43
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,119
Wait.

44
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:04,000
I made the ginger soup

45
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:04,639
for you because I care about you

46
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,360
as a friend.

47
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,759
You are not going to drink it?

48
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,520
Liu Fei, I've told you.

49
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:11,279
I have a girlfriend.

50
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:12,520
It's not possible.

51
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,520
You are lying to me again.

52
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,160
I... It's true.

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,759
My girlfriend is

54
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,000
very sensitive.

55
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,399
If she finds out that

56
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,000
other girls made me

57
00:04:20,119 --> 00:04:21,279
ginger soup,

58
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,519
she will get really mad.

59
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,760
Then she will fight with me.

60
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,880
Things will become very difficult.

61
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:26,880
Can you stop fooling me?

62
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,600
I know that

63
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,799
you are lying to me.

64
00:04:29,119 --> 00:04:30,160
Can't you at least

65
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,119
make up a more sincere excuse

66
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:32,519
to reject me?

67
00:04:32,799 --> 00:04:33,279
I know that you are acting like this

68
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:34,720
just to fool me.

69
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,600
Not to mention that we have been

70
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,640
training together
every day for two years...

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,880
Liu Fei,

72
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:40,720
I really have a girlfriend.

73
00:04:44,559 --> 00:04:46,279
Bro, emergency!

74
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,519
Do me a favor. Don't talk.

75
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:48,279
Follow my command.

76
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:55,399
She is my girlfriend,

77
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,799
Shen Zhengyi.

78
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,160
You must be starving. Eat more.

79
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,519
Eat more if it tastes good.

80
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,519
She is a little shy,

81
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,640
because we haven't told anyone yet.

82
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,640
So...

83
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,679
We will get going now.

84
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,040
Bye.

85
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:16,399
Hang in there.

86
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:17,000
Don't talk.

87
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:17,920
Don't talk. Hang in there.

88
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,279
Hold until she cannot see us anymore.

89
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:21,000
OK? Alright?

90
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:22,600
Bro, I'm begging you.

91
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,760
Come on. Eat this. It's okay.

92
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,000
Emergency. Emergency.

93
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:37,920
Are you trying to kill me?

94
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:38,760
What are you doing?

95
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,279
Who... who is your girlfriend?

96
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:41,920
No... I'm sorry.

97
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,239
It was a very emergent situation

98
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,359
and I had to do this.

99
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:44,880
I'm so sorry.

100
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,559
You cannot use me as the shield

101
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,640
just because you are
having an emergency.

102
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,519
Who do you think you are?

103
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,160
Does the whole world

104
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,000
have to circle around you?

105
00:05:50,359 --> 00:05:50,880
Alright.

106
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:52,640
You did do me a

107
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,519
huge favor.

108
00:05:53,559 --> 00:05:53,880
How about this?

109
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,519
I will do you a favor too.

110
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,079
I can do one thing for you.

111
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,119
Even if you do ten things,
I don't need it.

112
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,000
Just one thing.

113
00:05:58,239 --> 00:05:58,839
Do not appear in front of me

114
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,239
ever again.

115
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,279
So annoying.

116
00:06:07,679 --> 00:06:09,279
Why did you steal my line?

117
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,920
Brother, you are back.

118
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:28,399
The meal is just ready. You can eat now.

119
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:44,600
Didn't you keep saying that

120
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:45,760
you want to try my dishes?

121
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,679
Please.

122
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,600
You have been so busy
handling Wind Chaser.

123
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,200
I can't believe you still have
time to cook for me.

124
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,119
Do you still see me as your brother?

125
00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:04,839
Why do I have to know
everything from others?

126
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,640
I was just going to

127
00:07:06,799 --> 00:07:07,880
explain it to you.

128
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,920
As I said before,

129
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,160
the Male Pairs Skater that I admire

130
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,119
the most in the whole nation

131
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,119
is Shao Beisheng.

132
00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:14,920
I believe that there will be

133
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,040
chemistry between us on the court.

134
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,160
So, you acted on your own and

135
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:18,320
joined Winder Chaser.

136
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,600
How did you tell me a
couple of days ago?

137
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:23,359
You said that you came
back for a few days

138
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,359
just to check on me.

139
00:07:24,679 --> 00:07:25,959
Xiao Qing, it seems like
that you've grown up

140
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:27,119
and you learned how to lie.

141
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,959
It's all because you didn't support me.

142
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,279
How could I have supported you?

143
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,720
You've done so much in Korea

144
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:34,920
in order to become the ace player there.

145
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,720
All the resources
were there for you

146
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,640
and everyone values you.

147
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,839
You can join the most authorized

148
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:39,920
contests there,

149
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,160
train with the best coach,

150
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,600
and pick the best partner.

151
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,359
However, you are just going
to throw all those away

152
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,880
and restart everything in China?

153
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:46,959
As long as I have the capability,

154
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,440
I can get any resources I want.

155
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,200
But a partner like Shao Beisheng

156
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:50,640
is not that easy to find.

157
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:54,359
I've studied all the contest profiles

158
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,679
of Shao Beisheng.

159
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,200
I found that he is the one

160
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,600
that matches me the most.

161
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:05,839
Brother,

162
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,000
my goal is the world champion,

163
00:08:08,119 --> 00:08:09,359
and you know it.

164
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:10,440
Only Shao Beisheng

165
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,679
can make me stronger.

166
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,480
I have the confidence to be his partner.

167
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,200
Can't you just support me?

168
00:08:25,359 --> 00:08:27,119
I know that you are in a hurry
to surpass yourself,

169
00:08:28,119 --> 00:08:29,040
but it is such a sudden decision

170
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,440
for you to come back.

171
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,600
How about this?

172
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:32,880
You get some rest at home
for a few days,

173
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,280
and then we will discuss
the long-term plan.

174
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,760
Have dinner.

175
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,080
I cannot stick with any long-term plan.

176
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,200
I have already applied
for school transfer

177
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:43,280
and Lingbei is now processing it.

178
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,840
I know that you would be mad,

179
00:08:45,479 --> 00:08:46,559
so I applied for the student dorm.

180
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,280
I will move out in a few days.

181
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,760
You are here, Xiao Qing.

182
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,960
Coach Ma,

183
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,440
did my brother come to you?

184
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,159
He kept calling me yesterday

185
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:18,919
and I figured that he wanted
to talk about this.

186
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,880
So I didn't even dare to pick it up.

187
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:21,280
Let me tell you.

188
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:22,679
The issue between you and your brother

189
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,400
should stay between you two.

190
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:26,280
Morning.

191
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:27,320
Good morning.

192
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,400
Hurry up.

193
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,440
Look at how early she is.

194
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:31,039
I arrived on time!

195
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,520
Can't you be a little bit earlier?

196
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:34,760
Show some respect, alright?

197
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:36,520
Let me tell you both.

198
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,200
Be careful during your
first cooperation.

199
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,280
Make sure you have stretched well, okay?

200
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,799
It's okay, Coach Ma.

201
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:41,840
I've watched the contest video

202
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,719
of Shao Beisheng and Liu Fei,

203
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,280
and I pretty much know

204
00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:45,359
his habits and movement.

205
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:47,280
You can just do your planned movement

206
00:09:47,599 --> 00:09:48,280
and I will be able to follow.

207
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,799
Look at how well prepared she is.

208
00:09:50,359 --> 00:09:51,479
Hurry up. Hurry, hurry.

209
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:03,359
Slow down.

210
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,039
Take it slow.

211
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:05,760
Slowly.

212
00:10:08,119 --> 00:10:08,679
Okay.

213
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,760
Pay attention to facial expression.

214
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:20,479
Follow the music tempo.

215
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,559
Make sure to sync on the movement.

216
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,159
Cooperate well.

234
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,679
I'm taking off. I will get going now.

235
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:01,760
Coach Ma, wait a second.

236
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,679
I have something that
I want to discuss with you.

237
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:05,440
If you are not in hurry,
we can talk about it tomorrow.

238
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:06,559
I'm in a hurry. Just a few minutes.

239
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:07,640
It won't take too long.

240
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:11,400
It must be about Xiao Qing.

241
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,799
She has no idea

242
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:16,760
what she is doing.

243
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:17,400
If she gives up

244
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,679
the opportunity in Korea,

245
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:20,320
she will regret it for sure

246
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,159
in the future.

247
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:22,679
I hope that

248
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:23,520
Coach Ma

249
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:24,599
could help me persuade her.

250
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,520
Coach Xiao, as far as I'm concerned,

251
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,840
although Wind Chaser is

252
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,559
not as strong as the team in Korea,

253
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,239
at least it's not a bad thing

254
00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:33,599
for her to join us.

255
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
That is not what I mean.

256
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:37,479
Athletes all have their

257
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,440
own training plans.

258
00:12:38,719 --> 00:12:39,840
She has completed her training in Korea

259
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,080
with the coaches there.

260
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:42,599
If she comes back,

261
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,359
she might have to start over.

262
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,119
Partner is very important for

263
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,200
Pairs Skating athletes.

264
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,719
For example,

265
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,719
look at these dramas.

266
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:52,320
No matter how good the
director and the script are,

267
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:53,719
if two actors

268
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,320
don't match each other,

269
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:56,200
it won't be a good show.

270
00:12:56,719 --> 00:12:57,559
What do you think?

271
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,599
Yes.

272
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,520
For such a capable player

273
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:00,520
like Xiao Qing to

274
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,280
join us Wind Chaser,

275
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:03,039
I'm more than happy to welcome her.

276
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:04,200
Yet you are asking me to
persuade her to leave.

277
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,640
I'm afraid it's very difficult for me.

278
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,280
However, I do understand

279
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,280
how you feel.

280
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:13,880
Even if you are not her brother,

281
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:14,919
just as her coach,

282
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,440
shouldn't you persuade her anyway?

283
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:17,320
Right?

284
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:18,919
I will try to talk to her.

285
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:21,039
Thank you so much.

286
00:13:21,119 --> 00:13:21,719
Not a problem.

287
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,239
Don't worry.

288
00:13:22,359 --> 00:13:23,000
I will do my best.

289
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,159
Then I will see myself out.

290
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,159
Your bag.

291
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:25,840
I will leave it here

292
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,400
and take it tomorrow.

293
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:28,359
See you.

294
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,440
We have achieved

295
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,320
quite a good cooperation so far.

296
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,119
We can try to add
a leg splitting movement

297
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,479
on top of twizzle.

298
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,280
What do you think?

299
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:37,919
Sure.

300
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:38,640
It can also help bring up

301
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:39,640
our rating level.

302
00:13:42,119 --> 00:13:42,479
I wish we can have

303
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:43,679
extra training every day.

304
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,479
But Coach Ma won't agree.

305
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:46,960
He always says that

306
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:48,679
I'm in a hurry.

307
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:49,919
So annoying.

308
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:50,760
It's okay.

309
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,280
I can help you persuade Coach Ma.

310
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:53,200
Really?

311
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,320
Beisheng.

312
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,039
Done training?

313
00:13:59,200 --> 00:13:59,760
Are you tired?

314
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,479
I'm okay.

315
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:02,919
Ah, this is Xiao Qing,

316
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,479
my previous partner.

317
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:05,559
This is Liu Fei.

318
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:06,400
Hello.

319
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:07,039
Hello.

320
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,400
I've seen your contest videos before.

321
00:14:09,119 --> 00:14:10,760
I have something to say to Beisheng.

322
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,760
You guys talk. I will get going.

323
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:15,000
Bye.

324
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,280
- Bye.
- Bye.

325
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:20,919
What's up?

326
00:14:21,119 --> 00:14:21,679
What's the matter?

327
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,479
Nothing.

328
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:24,039
I haven't seen you for a long time

329
00:14:24,119 --> 00:14:25,039
and I miss you.

330
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:27,200
Let's have dinner together.

331
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:29,559
Liu Fei,

332
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:30,640
I have told you that

333
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,919
I have a girlfriend.

334
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:33,760
Can you stop doing this?

335
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:34,760
Girlfriend?

336
00:14:35,119 --> 00:14:36,200
The girl last time?

337
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:39,880
Beisheng, you don't have to lie to me.

338
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,559
We have been

339
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,760
training together and

340
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,760
going to competition
together for two years.

341
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:43,679
We have spent the most time

342
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,640
with each other.

343
00:14:45,599 --> 00:14:47,119
It can't be true that
she is your girlfriend.

344
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:48,919
Anyway,

345
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:50,799
can you stop bothering me?

346
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:52,000
You will really

347
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,200
affect my training.

348
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:53,960
I don't want to lose

349
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,200
you as a friend.

350
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,479
Did I affect your training?

351
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,239
Don't lie to me.

352
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,359
Don't try to make me give up

353
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,640
with a random excuse.

354
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:09,520
How can I make her believe?

355
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,119
Abstraction is opposite to

356
00:15:12,239 --> 00:15:13,320
true life

357
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,559
in terms of painting style.

358
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,599
It reflects the conceptual thoughts

359
00:15:16,719 --> 00:15:18,719
of artists to visual elements

360
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,880
such as dots, lines, and shapes.

361
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:22,239
It can also show the subjective emotions

362
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,559
through media expression.

363
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,719
Why does it have to be Shen Zhengyi?

364
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,840
I just used her as a shield to

365
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,679
reject Liu Fei.

366
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:29,679
If I suddenly change a girlfriend,

367
00:15:30,119 --> 00:15:31,440
would you believe it if you are Liu Fei?

368
00:15:33,719 --> 00:15:35,000
But I don't think she will agree to it.

369
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:37,840
I will think of a way to make her agree.

370
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,400
Alright, that's it for the class.

371
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,520
In your free time,

372
00:15:44,599 --> 00:15:46,119
try to practice painting.

373
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:46,960
Do you understand?

374
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,280
Yes.

375
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:49,799
Alright, class is over.

376
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,719
Well... Lele,

377
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:53,840
I will go now.

378
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:55,679
You are not eating with me again?

379
00:15:55,719 --> 00:15:56,440
No, I have to use

380
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:58,000
every second I have to practice.

381
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,000
See you at night, alright?

382
00:16:08,479 --> 00:16:09,440
Shen... Shen Zhengyi.

383
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,039
Shao Beisheng?

384
00:16:13,359 --> 00:16:14,200
Why are you here?

385
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,799
I'm just passing by.

386
00:16:17,479 --> 00:16:18,200
Passing by?

387
00:16:19,599 --> 00:16:20,200
Shouldn't be.

388
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:20,960
The biology building is

389
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:21,880
far away from

390
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:22,640
our animation department.

391
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,599
How is it possible for you to pass by?

392
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,479
How...

393
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,359
Whatever.

394
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,440
If you say so.

395
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:29,640
I published an event

396
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,440
on the school forum.

397
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,520
I need a photo of you.

398
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:33,200
Can you add me on WeChat?

399
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,320
I will scan your QR code.

400
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,039
Qu Zhi, I have something to do.

401
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:36,760
I will get going now.

402
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:39,640
He is in a hurry.

403
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:40,760
You can let me know instead.

404
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:42,719
Why shall I do that? Are we close?

405
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,479
Come on.

406
00:16:43,599 --> 00:16:44,479
As his roommate and

407
00:16:44,599 --> 00:16:45,479
fans club leader,

408
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,599
I do have the right

409
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,760
to talk if it's about him.

410
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,320
What did you just say?

411
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,320
I do have the right to talk.

412
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:54,880
Previous one.

413
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:57,239
As his roommate and

414
00:16:57,359 --> 00:16:58,919
fans club leader...

415
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:01,919
Sorry.

416
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:03,599
Sorry that I didn't recognize you

417
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,920
as the fans club leader.

418
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,479
How about this? Let's add
each other on WeChat.

419
00:17:06,719 --> 00:17:07,239
You scan my code.

420
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,880
Come on, quickly.

421
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:10,959
Come on.

422
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:11,760
Scan it.

423
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,599
Quickly.

424
00:17:13,479 --> 00:17:14,719
In future, let me know

425
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,479
if there's any scandal

426
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,959
or recent photos

427
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:17,959
of him.

428
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:18,800
Okay?

429
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,199
Leader,

430
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,359
what would you like to eat?

431
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,920
Let's have some coffee to stay awake.

432
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:27,079
Sure.

433
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,079
Leader,

434
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:32,640
so here's the thing.

435
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,199
It's hard for them to

436
00:17:34,479 --> 00:17:35,239
make a cup of coffee

437
00:17:35,479 --> 00:17:37,920
at this dining hall.

438
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,359
That's true.

439
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,640
Then give me

440
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,680
a cup of water of 85 degrees.

441
00:17:43,239 --> 00:17:45,920
Not a degree higher or lower.

442
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:46,880
Thanks.

443
00:17:49,199 --> 00:17:49,920
Sure.

444
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,439
Collect all today?

445
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,199
Leader.

446
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,239
Leader, here's your hot water.

447
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:17,359
Enjoy it.

448
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:18,959
Please make me a cup of coffee.

449
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:20,880
Sure.

450
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,199
Here's your coffee.

451
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,079
Considering how sincere

452
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,319
you are,

453
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:43,719
I can listen to

454
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,640
one requirement from you.

455
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,479
Really?

456
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:47,959
I want a childhood photo

457
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,160
of Shao Beisheng,

458
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,439
because I initiated an event

459
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,400
of childhood photo sharing

460
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,839
on the school forum.

461
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:55,640
Now, only

462
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,839
his photo is not ready.

463
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,319
That's a piece of cake.

464
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,599
I will help you get it.

465
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,199
Thank you, leader.

466
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:04,160
But

467
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,319
I don't have much time recently

468
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,640
to bring this up to him,

469
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:10,199
as I've been too busy

470
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,520
dealing with all these
issues of the team.

471
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:15,040
No problem.

472
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,839
All on me.

473
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:21,880
Working permit.

474
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,760
Help me collect the attendance
sheet this afternoon.

475
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:26,079
No problem.

476
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,439
Thanks.

477
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,420
(Lingbei Kids Ice Club)

478
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,199
Coach Xiao,

479
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,000
why are you here?

480
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:53,839
I heard that

481
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,839
you usually train here,

482
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,599
so I'm just stopping by.

483
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:56,800
How is

484
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,839
your cold? Feeling better?

485
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,359
Yes.

486
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,079
The medicine from Doctor Liu works well.

487
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:02,560
I'm much better now.

488
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:04,319
I haven't said thank you

489
00:20:04,439 --> 00:20:06,000
for what happened the other day.

490
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:06,920
It was just a small favor.

491
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:08,000
No worry.

492
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:10,880
I saw that you were training

493
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,880
yourself to control sliding at curves.

494
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,479
Based on the tutorial,

495
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:15,920
the control of turning

496
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:17,719
has something to do with the
angle of tilting at curves,

497
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:19,319
which depends on

498
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:19,959
the speed.

499
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:21,680
But every time I speed up,

500
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,920
I would lose my center of gravity.

501
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:25,000
So the angle of how much I tilt

502
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:25,920
is also not stable.

503
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:27,800
You don't have to hurry.

504
00:20:28,199 --> 00:20:29,439
The angle of tilting at curves

505
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:30,239
is not just a

506
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:31,079
simple movement.

507
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,479
It requires the speed,

508
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,319
techniques, strength

509
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,400
and core control

510
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,719
to improve the stability.

511
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,640
When your stability is improved,

512
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:39,880
you can have the ideal tilting angle

513
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,640
that matches the speed.

514
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:43,079
When you can control

515
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:43,920
all of these,

516
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,199
that's when you start
controlling the speed.

517
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,319
All these require lots
of time of training.

518
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:50,359
Have you ever seen

519
00:20:50,439 --> 00:20:51,599
how you skate?

520
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,400
Slide a little more

521
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,359
and I will record for you.

522
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,760
Hello, excuse me.

523
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:04,400
This is the

524
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,400
Yingji oatmeal latte you ordered.

525
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:06,280
Enjoy it.

526
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,160
This is the rose tea coffee

527
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,119
for you to taste.

528
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:09,920
Okay. Thanks.

529
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:10,599
Great, thanks.

530
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,599
You're welcome.

531
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,000
Let's see.

532
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,000
Have you noticed your problem?

533
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,800
You tilted your upper body too soon,

534
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,800
but your lower body

535
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:19,560
didn't follow.

536
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,599
Actually, your power
when pushing off the ice

537
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,319
is very good

538
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:22,920
except for this one problem.

539
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,719
Have a look.

540
00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:25,319
The angle of the blade to the ground

541
00:21:25,479 --> 00:21:26,439
was not adjusted to its best.

542
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,560
And also how much you shake your arm.

543
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,280
They all affect

544
00:21:29,439 --> 00:21:30,280
your body balance.

545
00:21:31,199 --> 00:21:32,439
After disassembling the
movement like this,

546
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,760
I'm so unprofessional.

547
00:21:35,199 --> 00:21:36,000
Have you never joined

548
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:37,199
any professional team before?

549
00:21:38,239 --> 00:21:38,839
No.

550
00:21:39,239 --> 00:21:39,920
Basically,

551
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:41,160
I trained myself.

552
00:21:43,439 --> 00:21:43,920
So actually,

553
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,239
Coach Zhuang was right about this.

554
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,000
I don't reach the required level

555
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:49,760
even in terms of basic skills
and movement.

556
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:53,160
You shouldn't think of it this way.

557
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,479
You have already made fast progress.

558
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,400
Have a look.

559
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,640
You have the power and speed.

560
00:21:58,119 --> 00:21:59,119
As long as you find the
appropriate approach,

561
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,400
it's not too late.

562
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:01,920
But there's just one thing.

563
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:03,599
You should not continue to

564
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,400
train like this.

565
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,760
Different curves have

566
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,959
different tilting angles,

567
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,479
and you need to adapt to the
professional training ground

568
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:09,640
as soon as possible.

569
00:22:12,719 --> 00:22:13,520
You can be a bit lower.

570
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,400
Hold it. Hold it.

571
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:15,959
Okay. Get up.

572
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,719
Get down.

573
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,160
Lower.

574
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:20,959
Lower.

575
00:22:21,199 --> 00:22:22,079
Hang in there.

576
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:24,400
Okay. Get up.

577
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,839
Get down.

578
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:29,439
Keep in parallel.

579
00:22:30,439 --> 00:22:31,319
Can you get even lower?

580
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,760
That's good.

581
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:35,959
One, two, three. Get up.

582
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,520
That was good.

583
00:22:44,439 --> 00:22:45,319
Are you okay?

584
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:51,239
I'm fine.

585
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:51,920
I can do this.

586
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:53,040
I can get up by myself.

587
00:22:56,239 --> 00:22:56,760
Here.

588
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:58,160
Continue.

589
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:02,560
Very good.

590
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,359
Two.

591
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,359
Hang in there.

592
00:23:07,479 --> 00:23:08,319
Two.

593
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:11,319
One.

594
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,920
Two.

595
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,620
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team
of Lingbei University)

596
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
It seems that Coach Xiao

597
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,760
really cares about Shen Zhengyi.

598
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,359
Because she is really

599
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:26,760
talented.

600
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,119
But there are many people

601
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,000
like her in the team.

602
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,359
But there's no one in the team

603
00:23:31,479 --> 00:23:33,119
who would train as hard as she does.

604
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:36,119
Also I heard that Coach Zhuang

605
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,160
gave her one week to

606
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:38,439
prove herself.

607
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:40,160
Yeah.

608
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,920
But you should know

609
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:45,479
that her skills are not so good.

610
00:23:47,479 --> 00:23:47,920
I don't believe

611
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,760
that you didn't see

612
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,800
her potential.

613
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,680
She has trained herself all alone

614
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,439
for these years and
gets where she is now.

615
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,760
Besides talent,

616
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,800
she must have put a lot of efforts

617
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,160
that we can't imagine.

618
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:00,239
First of all,

619
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:02,119
short track

620
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,000
speed skating

621
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,239
is not only based on

622
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,800
personal talent.

623
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,920
You can see clearly that

624
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,359
as soon as Shen Zhengyi
is up there on the track,

625
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,560
all she thinks is

626
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,359
the speed.

627
00:24:14,479 --> 00:24:15,359
No other thoughts.

628
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:17,920
Putting someone like
that on the ice rank

629
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:19,119
is like throwing a time bomb.

630
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,680
Shouldn't we be responsible

631
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,920
for the safety

632
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,040
of other teammates?

633
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,040
Coach Zhuang,

634
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:25,319
if you don't give her the
chance to join the team,

635
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,359
how would she understand

636
00:24:26,439 --> 00:24:28,000
teamwork and cooperation?

637
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,439
Not to mention that Wind Chaser

638
00:24:30,479 --> 00:24:31,760
really needs some talents right now.

639
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,359
Yeah,

640
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:35,560
I agree.

641
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,479
Considering the current
condition of Shen Zhengyi,

642
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,359
she seems

643
00:24:38,439 --> 00:24:39,760
somewhat dangerous on the ice rank.

644
00:24:40,239 --> 00:24:41,359
But she has strong willpower

645
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,160
that can get others motivated.

646
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,439
Don't you need someone

647
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,119
to light up the fire

648
00:24:45,239 --> 00:24:46,439
in Wind Chaser?

649
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,800
Speaking of this, Coach Zhuang,

650
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:51,119
if you really worry about

651
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:52,160
how dangerous she is on the ice rank,

652
00:24:52,479 --> 00:24:53,560
I will take full responsibility of it.

653
00:24:54,439 --> 00:24:56,000
If she causes any problem,

654
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,920
I will handle it all by myself.

655
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,920
I'm the chief coach,

656
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,800
so I will be the one
taking responsibilities

657
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,359
if anything happens.

658
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:05,239
How about this?

659
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,160
Shen Zhengyi can join the team

660
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,920
on one condition.

661
00:25:12,439 --> 00:25:13,920
I hope you can agree to it.

662
00:25:20,199 --> 00:25:20,920
You are back.

663
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:23,119
You were on a date with Shen Zhengyi?

664
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,079
What date?

665
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:30,079
She didn't say yes?

666
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:31,199
I thought you were confident.

667
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,079
She ran so fast just like
how she skates,

668
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:34,280
and I couldn't follow at all.

669
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,719
Then what to do?

670
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,359
Wait.

671
00:25:42,239 --> 00:25:42,560
Shouldn't you be

672
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,640
doing the cleaning right now?

673
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:45,439
Why do you have time for games?

674
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:47,199
I'm in ranking.

675
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:48,479
What ranking? What's up with you?

676
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,439
Don't worry.

677
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,599
Someone is helping me do it.

678
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,800
Give it back to me.

679
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,920
I can't believe someone
is cleaning for you.

680
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,439
Give it back to me now.
I'm almost back to life.

681
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,000
Who is it?

682
00:25:56,119 --> 00:25:56,599
Give it back to me.

683
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,319
Who is it?

684
00:25:57,439 --> 00:25:58,359
That Zhu Lele who

685
00:25:58,479 --> 00:25:59,119
is often seen together

686
00:25:59,199 --> 00:26:00,000
with Shen Zhengyi.

687
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:00,359
Wait.

688
00:26:00,479 --> 00:26:01,599
Why would she do the work for you?

689
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,599
I'm charming,

690
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,040
so she listens to me.

691
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,719
That's perfect.

692
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:12,719
Let her ask

693
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,800
Shen Zhengyi out for me.

694
00:26:18,719 --> 00:26:19,599
That's so smart.

695
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:21,800
I was just about to say that.

696
00:26:22,959 --> 00:26:23,959
Try to use your charming personality.

697
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,280
I lost again.

698
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,199
What is wrong with you?

699
00:26:47,959 --> 00:26:48,640
Shen Zhengyi,

700
00:26:49,439 --> 00:26:50,079
look at me.

701
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,160
Look at me.

702
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:54,959
How is it?

703
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,640
Did you smell anything?

704
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,640
I smell your madness.

705
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,280
This is the smell of a super idol.

706
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:03,319
Based on my

707
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,280
close contact today,

708
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,079
I'm sure that the smell

709
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,839
on Shao Beisheng must be

710
00:27:07,199 --> 00:27:09,280
coming from this shampoo.

711
00:27:09,719 --> 00:27:10,199
That's it.

712
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,520
I have to write it

713
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,400
on my Lingbei New Style Column.

714
00:27:21,959 --> 00:27:24,040
(Bring Shen Zhengyi to the
plant garden tomorrow,)

715
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:24,880
(and you can get the)

716
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,959
(childhood photo of
Shao Beisheng that you want.)

717
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:40,800
Well...

718
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:41,680
Why do you have to

719
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,079
come here to draw today？

720
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:45,839
Look at the waterfall.

721
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,160
What a huge waterfall!

722
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,640
Let's try drawing fluid.

723
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:51,040
What fluid?

724
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:52,640
You can't even draw a still life well.

725
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,319
Fluid?

726
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,560
Isn't this trying something new?

727
00:27:59,160 --> 00:27:59,800
I'll go to the bathroom.

728
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:00,800
You draw first.

729
00:28:01,439 --> 00:28:02,800
You didn't even move your pen.

730
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,920
You're going to the bathroom now.

731
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:14,160
Get down.

732
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,560
Well...

733
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,280
Why did you

734
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:17,319
ask me to bring Zhengyi here?

735
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:19,680
I'm going to observe her.

736
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:21,319
I'm going to develop her as
a member of the fans club.

737
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,560
No way. She won't attend.

738
00:28:24,439 --> 00:28:25,160
Really?

739
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:26,760
Then you come with me.

740
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,160
Where?

741
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,560
You'll know when you go.

742
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,400
Where?

743
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,439
Let's go.

744
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,199
Sorry.

745
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:37,199
Seat taken.

746
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,079
What are you doing here?

747
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,920
Watch the waterfall.

748
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,439
And also I want to talk to
you about something.

749
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,760
What will you talk to me about?

750
00:29:04,439 --> 00:29:05,920
I'm in some trouble.

751
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,520
I'd like to ask you a favor.

752
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,800
What is it?

753
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,319
I have a

754
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,800
very good chance now.

755
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:20,040
It's an opportunity

756
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,400
that many people want.

757
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:23,400
This good opportunity is

758
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:26,560
to be my girlfriend.

759
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,040
Is there anything wrong with you?

760
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:28,640
Why should I

761
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,400
be your girlfriend?

762
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,319
Keep your voice down.

763
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,280
I ask you to help me,

764
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,040
because

765
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,800
you won't like me

766
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,760
and I won't like you,

767
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,880
so it's safe.

768
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,160
What do you mean?

769
00:29:42,439 --> 00:29:43,280
I'm safe?

770
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:44,160
No, no, no.

771
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:44,920
I mean,

772
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,640
you're brave and righteous.

773
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,560
When you see injustice,
you will definitely help.

774
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,400
I admire it.

775
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,199
For all these advantages,

776
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:51,800
I accept.

777
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,040
But I refuse your offer.

778
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:53,800
Bye. Leave now.

779
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,760
Well, why?

780
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:57,160
What a good chance!

781
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,040
Are you crazy?

782
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,319
I don't know you.

783
00:30:00,439 --> 00:30:01,160
Why should I accept

784
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:02,040
your proposal?

785
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,000
And I'm a girl.

786
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,000
This thing

787
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,439
will affect my reputation.

788
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,680
And I find your proposal

789
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,040
boring and absurd.

790
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:11,760
Bye.

791
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,520
I won't help you.

792
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,160
Get out!

793
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:13,680
I want to draw.

794
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,560
Then

795
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,760
you can make a requirement.

796
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:18,000
What requirement?

797
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:19,280
I don't want to make
any requirement. Go away.

798
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:20,000
You...

799
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,920
My paint!

800
00:30:30,199 --> 00:30:31,319
Come back!

801
00:30:41,479 --> 00:30:43,239
Why am I so unlucky?

802
00:30:43,439 --> 00:30:43,839
I can meet

803
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:45,160
Shao Beisheng anywhere.

804
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:47,599
Why am I

805
00:30:47,719 --> 00:30:48,520
so unlucky?

806
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,199
I can miss Shao Beisheng

807
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:50,439
no matter where I go.

808
00:30:51,959 --> 00:30:52,800
How come?

809
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,400
What did he say to you?

810
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,520
Nothing.

811
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,199
He even knocked over my paint.

812
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,079
Why didn't he knock over

813
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,599
my paint?

814
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:07,199
How about I give you a punch?

815
00:31:12,439 --> 00:31:13,160
Everyone's here?

816
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,560
Then let's start the lecture.

817
00:31:15,199 --> 00:31:15,920
In the previous lecture,

818
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:17,800
we talked about abstractionism,

819
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:18,800
but we didn't finish it.

820
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,959
Today we will continue with it.

821
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:20,920
Today

822
00:31:20,959 --> 00:31:22,040
we will be learning

823
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:23,920
Jackson Pollock.

824
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:24,959
Pollock uses the method of

825
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:26,280
drip painting to

826
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,160
create artworks

827
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,280
without any structure

828
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,680
using paint.

829
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,520
It shows the quintessence

830
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,319
of abstractionism.

831
00:31:38,719 --> 00:31:39,719
Pick it up.

832
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:47,800
Where does this new paint come from?

833
00:31:56,599 --> 00:31:57,040
How was my

834
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:57,920
turn today?

835
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,640
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team of Lingbei)
Still not my match.

836
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,520
Even Coach Ma spoke highly of me today.

837
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:14,000
You are looking for me?

838
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:17,000
This is from you?

839
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:18,839
Yeah.

840
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:22,000
You don't even know how to apologize.

841
00:32:22,239 --> 00:32:23,119
Here you are.

842
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:29,880
I apologize for what happened
in the plant garden.

843
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:31,479
- Zhengyi.
- Actually...

844
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,119
Coach Xiao.

845
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,280
Coach Xiao.

846
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,640
Take it.

847
00:32:43,239 --> 00:32:44,160
If you don't want it,
you can throw it away.

848
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:47,000
You guys talk.

849
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:50,880
What's the matter?

850
00:32:51,239 --> 00:32:52,119
I have a good news.

851
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,760
You can join Wind Chaser tomorrow.

852
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:54,920
Really?

853
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,119
But you are not an official member yet.

854
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,000
It still depends on

855
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,040
your performance later on.

856
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,119
There's a grade requirement

857
00:33:01,239 --> 00:33:02,400
that you need to meet in order to stay.

858
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,760
I can do this.

859
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,760
Thank you, Coach Xiao.

860
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,640
I will do my best for sure.

861
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,479
So from now on,

862
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,040
if you have any professional questions,

863
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:07,920
feel free to find me.

864
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:09,800
Your offer letter has been

865
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,680
delivered to your home.

866
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:11,640
Let your parents sign it.

867
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:15,680
Why did it get delivered to my home

868
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,800
since I'm here?

869
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:18,160
Wind Chaser is a professional team,

870
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:19,040
and we need to follow the procedure.

871
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:20,319
Wait. You have already sent it?

872
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:22,839
Oh no.

873
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,160
Oh no.

874
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,439
Well... Coach Xiao,

875
00:33:25,439 --> 00:33:26,439
I have to take care of something,

876
00:33:26,439 --> 00:33:27,439
so I will see you around. Bye.

877
00:33:41,959 --> 00:33:42,880
I'm back.

878
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,880
I thought you would stay in school

879
00:33:45,239 --> 00:33:47,040
and not come home for the semester.

880
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,040
How... how come?

881
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,839
What have you been doing at school?

882
00:34:05,239 --> 00:34:08,000
Well... what else can I
do besides studying?

883
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:12,600
Mom, has your leg been hurting recently?

884
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,000
Does it hurt?

885
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,159
Let me massage it for you.

886
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,360
Save it.

887
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,639
Have we got any packages?

888
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,840
Yeah.

889
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,600
I've opened it.

890
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:25,600
You opened it?

891
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,879
Why didn't you tell me?

892
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,000
Well, I...

893
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,600
I didn't hide it from you on purpose.

894
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,399
I wanted to wait a little
longer before I tell you,

895
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,600
because I'm afraid that
you would get mad.

896
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,280
Why would I get mad?

897
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:41,360
Yiyi is back?

898
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,719
What are you two talking about?

899
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,120
I've been asking her about

900
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,280
the delivery.

901
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,120
Is it this one?

902
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:51,360
Our little girl

903
00:34:51,479 --> 00:34:53,280
is so sweet.

904
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,719
Knowing that your leg hurts again,

905
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,000
she got you this knee cover

906
00:34:58,239 --> 00:34:59,239
for physical therapy.

907
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,239
There are even shoes.

908
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,360
It's too hot. Too hot.

909
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:03,879
This... it's too hot.

910
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,520
Right, right. It's so good.

911
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,280
Look at this pair of shoes.

912
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:09,120
They said we can replace
or return the shoes

913
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,000
if we are not satisfied.

914
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,719
This is so good.

915
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,639
Why would you return them?

916
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,040
It seems that...

917
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,360
-This is a nice brand.
- She likes it.

918
00:35:21,239 --> 00:35:22,399
You do have some conscientiousness.

919
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,879
Alright, I will start cooking.

920
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,600
Clean up the beans.

921
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,520
No problem.

922
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,520
Why did you come back?

923
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,120
Check on you two.

924
00:35:43,399 --> 00:35:44,360
I thought it was

925
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,959
for a letter.

926
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,280
It seems like I have misunderstood it.

927
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,120
You got the letter?

928
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,639
Then why didn't you say it earlier?
I was scared to death.

929
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,360
I go first?

930
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,239
You go first.

931
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,600
I'm having stomachache and
I need to use the bathroom.

932
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,159
Dear Shen Zhengyi,

933
00:36:17,399 --> 00:36:18,399
based on the selection,

934
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:19,520
you have been admitted to the

935
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,040
Wind Chaser Skating Team

936
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,719
as a short track speed skater.

937
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,639
Why do you look unhappy?

938
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:30,600
It's not enough

939
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:31,719
to skate as a hobby?

940
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,120
Now you have to join
the professional team?

941
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:34,879
The professionals are different

942
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,239
from amateurs.

943
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,040
Also, you know that

944
00:36:38,879 --> 00:36:39,840
my dream is to join

945
00:36:39,959 --> 00:36:41,000
a professional team.

946
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,120
Do you know

947
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:44,000
what my dream is?

948
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:44,639
Tell me.

949
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:46,639
My dream is for you to be happy

950
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,320
and safe.

951
00:36:48,959 --> 00:36:49,840
Don't worry.

952
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,600
I'm already an adult

953
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:53,199
and I can protect myself.

954
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:55,360
Many people say that,

955
00:36:55,439 --> 00:36:56,080
but in the end

956
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,679
they have injured all over the body.

957
00:37:01,479 --> 00:37:02,360
Have you ever thought that

958
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:03,719
if your mom finds out

959
00:37:03,959 --> 00:37:05,360
and she doesn't agree to it?

960
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,800
Well, she has to agree.

961
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,719
I've grown up

962
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,600
and I have my own goals

963
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,840
that I want to achieve.

964
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,360
I cannot be stopped.

965
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,439
You were such

966
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,360
a little girl,

967
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:22,600
but you've really grown up.

968
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,600
You have your own

969
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:25,120
thoughts now.

970
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,479
Look at my eyes and

971
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,320
answer me seriously.

972
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:34,600
Do you really like skating?

973
00:37:35,479 --> 00:37:36,239
Yes, I do.

974
00:37:38,479 --> 00:37:39,120
Okay.

975
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,199
Since my daughter likes it,

976
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,080
I will support you.

977
00:37:42,959 --> 00:37:43,600
Thank you, dad.

978
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,080
Dad, dad.

979
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:46,679
Help me drag her a little longer.

980
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:47,360
Let me take a look a little longer.

981
00:37:55,479 --> 00:37:56,840
Even the paper smells so good.

982
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,530
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team
of Lingbei University)

983
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:04,479
I've never thought that one day

984
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,239
I can wear the team
uniform of Wind Chaser.

985
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,320
Alright.

986
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:08,719
You've been repeating it

987
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,000
since last night.

988
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,199
(Wind Chaser Off-ice Training Room)
The uniform is almost worn out.

989
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,600
I'm happy, and that's why.

990
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,479
Alright, alright.

991
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:15,239
When does Coach Xiao usually come?

992
00:38:15,879 --> 00:38:17,199
Coach Xiao

993
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:18,679
should be having

994
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,080
morning training with Luo Xiaoyi.

995
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,840
Morning training?

996
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:37,320
It was not enough to be

997
00:38:37,439 --> 00:38:38,320
chased out the other day,

998
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,959
and she came here again today?

999
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,719
Shen Zhengyi

1000
00:38:42,959 --> 00:38:43,840
has been officially admitted

1001
00:38:43,879 --> 00:38:45,199
by Wind Chaser.

1002
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,120
Now there's a show we can watch.

1003
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:49,840
Why can someone like her

1004
00:38:49,879 --> 00:38:50,719
join Wind Chaser?

1005
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,600
Why do you talk like that?

1006
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:53,959
What do you mean by someone like her?

1007
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:54,959
What's the problem with her?

1008
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,840
Let's stretch.

1009
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:03,959
Remember what

1010
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,679
we trained this morning.

1011
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:05,239
Don't forget.

1012
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,560
Now go stretching.

1013
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:07,959
Morning, Coach Xiao.

1014
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:08,959
Morning, Coach Xiao.

1015
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:09,840
Good morning.

1016
00:39:17,479 --> 00:39:18,439
Who are you trying to show to

1017
00:39:18,479 --> 00:39:19,360
being so eagerly attentive?

1018
00:39:19,879 --> 00:39:20,560
Reminder,

1019
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,719
don't try to get close to Coach Xiao.

1020
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,719
Enough, Sisi.

1021
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:27,560
Why do you compete with a new member?

1022
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,000
Others will laugh at you.

1023
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,840
Assemble.

1024
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,879
- Morning, Coach Zhuang.
- Morning, Coach Zhuang.

1025
00:39:49,719 --> 00:39:50,439
Today I have something

1026
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,360
to announce.

1027
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,080
The College Student Ice League

1028
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,520
of the province will kick off soon.

1029
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:55,239
This competition is

1030
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,479
the warm-up contest for Ling Yun Cup.

1031
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,479
I hope that we can all

1032
00:39:57,919 --> 00:39:58,879
cheer up

1033
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:01,000
and train well for it.

1034
00:40:01,919 --> 00:40:03,760
I'm going to join the College League.

1035
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,479
To prepare for it,

1036
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,879
we will have

1037
00:40:08,399 --> 00:40:09,360
an internal selection.

1038
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,399
We will treat old members

1039
00:40:11,879 --> 00:40:12,639
and new members the same.

1040
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,760
Isn't it a shame for us to

1041
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,399
compete with new members?

1042
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,520
We shall break the old rules.

1043
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,120
No matter you are an old member

1044
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:22,879
or a new member,

1045
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:24,879
as long as you have good grades,
you have the right to join.

1046
00:40:25,879 --> 00:40:26,879
Understand?

1047
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,280
Yes.

1048
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,600
As for you, Shen Zhengyi,

1049
00:40:30,959 --> 00:40:31,959
since you are a trail member,

1050
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:32,840
your grade has

1051
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,439
to be among the top three

1052
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,439
in order for you to

1053
00:40:35,959 --> 00:40:37,159
stay in Wind Chaser.

1054
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,679
Is that clear?

1055
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:40,719
Yes.

1056
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,159
One more thing.

1057
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,679
From today on,

1058
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,679
I will be in charge of
training old members,

1059
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,000
while Coach Xiao will train new members.

1060
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,000
Clear?

1061
00:40:49,399 --> 00:40:50,439
Yes.

1062
00:40:50,479 --> 00:40:51,360
Okay. Get ready.

1063
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,879
Coach Zhuang,

1064
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,360
you might not know this,

1065
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,760
but Coach Xiao did

1066
00:40:56,879 --> 00:40:58,679
my training plan by himself.

1067
00:40:58,959 --> 00:41:00,439
I was also trained by him.

1068
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:02,159
It's all thanks to Coach Xiao

1069
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:03,679
for me to get where I am today.

1070
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:05,120
So I want Coach Xiao

1071
00:41:05,399 --> 00:41:05,959
to continue to be in charge of

1072
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,199
my training.

1073
00:41:07,959 --> 00:41:09,000
From today on,

1074
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,360
all the training plans of

1075
00:41:10,439 --> 00:41:11,280
Wind Chaser will be created

1076
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:12,639
by me.

1077
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:14,679
You just need to

1078
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,360
do the training.

1079
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,239
Understand?

1080
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,479
Yes.

1081
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:18,159
Okay.

1082
00:41:18,199 --> 00:41:19,679
Get ready.

1083
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,719
Get down on ice.

1084
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:36,120
Quickly.

1085
00:41:38,439 --> 00:41:39,719
Curves, curves.

1086
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,679
What are you doing

1087
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,959
by standing that high?

1088
00:41:44,959 --> 00:41:46,280
Get down at curves.

1089
00:41:47,959 --> 00:41:49,120
Lower the right shoulder.

1090
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,679
Didn't you hear me?

1091
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:54,600
What happened to the speed?

1092
00:41:59,959 --> 00:42:01,439
Lower. A little lower.

1093
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:04,719
Note the tilting angle.

1094
00:42:06,959 --> 00:42:08,239
How many times should I say it?
Get down.

1095
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:18,280
All of you, take a 5 minute break.

1096
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:31,919
Are you okay?

1097
00:42:32,959 --> 00:42:33,399
Why do I always

1098
00:42:33,439 --> 00:42:34,760
fail at curves?

1099
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:38,280
You are training together with

1100
00:42:38,399 --> 00:42:39,120
these professional athletes

1101
00:42:39,399 --> 00:42:40,040
just to learn

1102
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:41,239
how they skate

1103
00:42:41,479 --> 00:42:42,000
as well as tempo.

1104
00:42:42,479 --> 00:42:43,280
Remember the distance

1105
00:42:43,399 --> 00:42:44,439
when you enter the curves
and when you leave the curves.

1106
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,000
Think about

1107
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:46,959
why your route

1108
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:47,959
is so different from

1109
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,120
theirs.

1110
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:52,679
I will do my best to adapt to it.

1111
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,760
That newbie Shen Zhengyi

1112
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,760
is haunting around Coach Xiao again.

1113
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,120
She doesn't even know how to turn.

1114
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,000
I don't know how she got in.

1115
00:43:10,919 --> 00:43:12,560
It must be through some improper ways.

1116
00:43:12,959 --> 00:43:13,959
Why would we care about her?

1117
00:43:15,399 --> 00:43:16,399
She's dragging us.

1118
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,120
Coach Xiao,

1119
00:43:21,439 --> 00:43:23,439
why did Coach Zhuang suddenly agree

1120
00:43:23,479 --> 00:43:24,479
to let me into the Wind Chaser?

1121
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:25,879
‍She hasn't seen

1122
00:43:25,959 --> 00:43:26,959
how I make through the curves.

1123
00:43:28,679 --> 00:43:30,199
I think she's the same as me.

1124
00:43:30,959 --> 00:43:32,520
She has seen your possibilities.
