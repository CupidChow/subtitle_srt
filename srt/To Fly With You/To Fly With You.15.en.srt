=Episode 15=

3
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,640
(Quadruple Salchow)

4
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:44,519
Look.

5
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:45,080
What did I say?

6
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,440
He's been holding it back.

7
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:47,080
Oh my god.

8
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,680
Li Mi has finished

9
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,040
a Quadruple Salchow.

10
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,959
Amazing!

11
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:54,639
Ma,

12
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,400
when can I

13
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,400
do Quadruple Salchow?

14
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,080
It won't be long.

15
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:07,080
Yes!

16
00:02:14,679 --> 00:02:15,360
(If a tiny defect)

17
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,520
(must be found,)

18
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:18,080
(maybe we can say it lacks some part of)

19
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,160
(artistic expression)

20
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:19,880
(because of the high
degree of difficulty.)

21
00:02:20,279 --> 00:02:21,399
(But there's no doubt that)

22
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,160
(Li Mi definitely represents)

23
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,559
(the top level of young)

24
00:02:24,559 --> 00:02:25,199
- (male Single Skating player.)
- Liu.

25
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:28,679
(It's so exciting.)

26
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,119
(Li Mi is quite great.)

27
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,240
(He actually finished)

28
00:02:31,399 --> 00:02:32,600
(the very difficult performance)

29
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,960
(of Quadruple Salchow.)

30
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,160
(It was almost perfect.)

31
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,119
(He has laid the solid foundation)

32
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:38,839
(for Flyer)

33
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,600
(to get the gold medal for men's team.)

34
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:42,000
- Good.
- Bravo.

35
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,440
Li Mi,

36
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:51,759
you are the best.

37
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,880
Well...

38
00:03:00,839 --> 00:03:01,960
Don't lose heart, everybody.

39
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,160
There is still
a team competition, right?

40
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,160
They only have one Li Mi, right?

41
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,279
We're still stronger

42
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,279
on the overall strength.

43
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,479
Which gold medal

44
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,160
is of the most value in Figure Skating?

45
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,160
Figure Skating team competition.

46
00:03:13,399 --> 00:03:14,199
Be energetic!

47
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,720
You have to get me the gold medal.

48
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:17,960
Beisheng!

49
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,279
Beisheng!

50
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:50,039
You cry every time you lose.

51
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,440
Are you ashamed?

52
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,600
I can give you the medal.

53
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,479
I don't need it.

54
00:03:53,679 --> 00:03:55,119
I lost every game.

55
00:03:55,559 --> 00:03:57,000
If you lost every game,

56
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:58,639
you will also cry.

57
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,039
It's impossible.

58
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,440
I was born to be a champion.

59
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,559
You are such a bully.

60
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,000
Coach, Shao Beisheng bullied me.

61
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,279
(Li Mi, you finally won.)

62
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:16,799
Coach Xiao,

63
00:04:17,119 --> 00:04:17,679
when I get back,

64
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:18,679
I will treat you a dinner.

65
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:19,880
It's okay.

66
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,920
You'd better think about
the simultaneous entry

67
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,600
as soon as possible.

68
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,239
Coach Xiao, I'll leave now.

69
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:31,320
Okay.

70
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,000
Coach Xiao, bye.

71
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:43,000
What are you doing here?

72
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,440
Nothing.

73
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:51,040
Why are you here?

74
00:04:51,679 --> 00:04:52,760
I am the one who
should ask the question.

75
00:04:52,799 --> 00:04:53,239
Shouldn't you

76
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:54,440
be in there watching the competition?

77
00:04:56,239 --> 00:04:57,440
I don't want to watch it anymore.

78
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,920
Li Mi can do Quadruple Salchow now.

79
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,679
I'm too far behind him.

80
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:12,000
What? You want to give up?

81
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,799
Give up?

82
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:16,200
I am telling you.

83
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,239
There is no such word

84
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,679
in my dictionary.

85
00:05:19,559 --> 00:05:20,799
Next time when I officially stand

86
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,320
on the single skating court,

87
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,440
I will let everyone know

88
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:25,559
there's nothing

89
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,920
I cannot do.

90
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,480
That's more like you.

91
00:05:34,239 --> 00:05:35,399
- How is it? Has the car arrived yet?
- Yihang?

92
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,559
Yes, at the gate.

93
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:38,200
Yihang, what happened?

94
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:41,239
Slow down. His leg hurts.

95
00:05:41,239 --> 00:05:42,119
Are you okay?

96
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,359
I'll talk to you later. Are you okay?

97
00:05:43,679 --> 00:05:45,000
- I'm fine.
- Let's go.

98
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:46,359
Don't come with us.

99
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,200
You don't need to follow us.

100
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,980
(Emergency)

101
00:05:55,799 --> 00:05:56,480
Well, he was good just now.

102
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,559
Why is he hurting like this?

103
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,359
He was trying to put the technique score

104
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:00,200
a bit higher,

105
00:06:00,239 --> 00:06:01,440
bringing more opportunities
to win the game.

106
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,279
How is it, Ma?

107
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:06,679
How is it?

108
00:06:06,679 --> 00:06:07,760
He cannot play for now.

109
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,480
How many times do I have to tell you?

110
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,760
The most important thing
in team competition is the total score.

111
00:06:17,239 --> 00:06:18,440
He increased the difficulty on his own.

112
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:19,920
See? He can't play now.

113
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,239
You really give me a headache.

114
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:23,839
Then Ma,

115
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,279
we have one person less
for the team competition now.

116
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:26,200
What should we do now?

117
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,079
What to do? I don't know.

118
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,480
Go, go, go.

119
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:29,160
Stop standing around here.

120
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:29,959
We cannot get another 80 points

121
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,920
for the team competition
even if you stand here.

122
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:31,920
Go, go, go.

123
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,920
You go back now.

124
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,760
Ma,

125
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:50,200
let me replace him.

126
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,000
What did you say?

127
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,920
Just consider the fact that
there is one person less

128
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,880
for the team competition.

129
00:06:55,359 --> 00:06:56,200
Anyway, we'd lose.

130
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:56,839
But if you allow me to play...

131
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:58,000
Don't even think about it.

132
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,559
You just changed to
Single Skating for a few days.

133
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,559
How many points
can you get if you play?

134
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,839
You can only be at the bottom.
You know that?

135
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:03,920
My head hurts a lot.

136
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,440
Don't bother me now.

137
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:04,799
That's true.

138
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:06,079
But I think it's better than zero.

139
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:07,160
Listen,

140
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,200
the first performance

141
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,079
you show up as a Single Skating player

142
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,839
should be perfect and excellent,

143
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:11,959
so it is not now.

144
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:13,959
Don't talk about it anymore.

145
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:14,679
Don't!

146
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,440
You go! I'll stay here.

147
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:18,079
Leave me alone.

148
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,799
You did well today.

149
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,480
Aren't they friends from Wind Chaser?

150
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,519
I heard one of your team members

151
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:44,200
got injured.

152
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:45,200
Injured?

153
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,679
I was planning to

154
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,640
compete with you seriously.

155
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:48,959
Now,

156
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:51,600
it brings no honor to the victory.

157
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,600
What do you mean?

158
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,880
Are you gloating?

159
00:07:54,119 --> 00:07:55,559
Isn't it obvious?

160
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:57,640
Now there are only three

161
00:07:57,679 --> 00:07:58,440
for the team competition of Wind Chaser.

162
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,640
How do you compete?

163
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,640
Who said there are only three?

164
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,760
Are you going to play?

165
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:07,880
What?

166
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:09,920
Can't I?

167
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:12,679
Shao Beisheng,

168
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:14,040
I heard you changed to
Single Skating recently.

169
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,480
Have you prepared for the show?

170
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,239
If you're really going to play,

171
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,799
I'm afraid you're going
to be at the bottom.

172
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:23,440
Nonsense, who did you say?

173
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,200
Am I wrong?

174
00:08:25,359 --> 00:08:27,040
I am not wrong. I am telling you.

175
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:28,440
Yes, Shao Beisheng

176
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:30,359
is awesome in Pairs Skating,

177
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,239
but it is totally different

178
00:08:31,359 --> 00:08:32,239
from single skating.

179
00:08:32,359 --> 00:08:32,840
You know that?

180
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:33,359
Do you really think

181
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:34,479
you're Prince Sheng?

182
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,840
He can just wait to be

183
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,919
defeated by Li Mi.

184
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,640
Beisheng,

185
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,960
you don't need to care what they say.

186
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,080
Right, Beisheng,

187
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:44,640
if you want to play,

188
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,760
we'll support you for sure.

189
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:46,719
Right.

190
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,760
You can just skate casually.

191
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,840
You will be certainly
better than those guys.

192
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:49,760
We'll play together!

193
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,640
They should prepare to fail.

194
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,840
Here, fighting!

195
00:08:55,599 --> 00:08:56,400
We have to win!

196
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,039
Fighting!

197
00:09:15,479 --> 00:09:16,479
What's the matter?

198
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:19,000
Are you okay?

199
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,479
Of course I am.

200
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:23,359
What? Why do you care me so much?

201
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:25,159
Don't talk glibly.

202
00:09:26,719 --> 00:09:28,599
I heard you want to
play in the game as a substitute,

203
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:29,799
but Coach Ma doesn't agree.

204
00:09:31,479 --> 00:09:32,719
The news spread so fast.

205
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:35,239
So?

206
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,400
Do you think I should play?

207
00:09:38,239 --> 00:09:39,239
Of course.

208
00:09:40,599 --> 00:09:42,000
Coach Ma doesn't agree,

209
00:09:42,719 --> 00:09:44,039
because he's afraid you'd get hurt.

210
00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:45,119
But I know

211
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:45,799
you won't do nothing

212
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,000
about three of Wind Chaser
against four players from Flyer.

213
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:49,799
Moreover, you are not that bad.

214
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,599
Aren't you afraid
I'm going to lose badly?

215
00:09:54,479 --> 00:09:55,479
If you are afraid of losing,

216
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,760
you're not Shao Beisheng.

217
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,119
Then,

218
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,599
I'll take action.

219
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,520
I'll train with you these days.

220
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:08,760
Really?

221
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:11,039
Keep your promise. Don't cheat me.

222
00:10:11,239 --> 00:10:12,000
Of course.

223
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:12,679
Hurry.

224
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,479
You answer the phone first.

225
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:19,200
I'll go warm up.

226
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,200
You and I will run laps later.

227
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,239
Hello, Xiao Qing, what's wrong?

228
00:10:27,719 --> 00:10:29,400
Beisheng, are you okay?

229
00:10:30,119 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm fine.

230
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,640
I'm not the one who got hurt.

231
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,159
Why is everyone

232
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,239
worrying about me?

233
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,880
I've heard about it.

234
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,520
Beisheng, don't play in the competition.

235
00:10:39,119 --> 00:10:39,400
You are not

236
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,640
in the player list.

237
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:41,640
Even if Wind Chaser loses,

238
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,280
it is not your fault anyway.

239
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,000
Why do you think

240
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:46,039
I should not play?

241
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,840
We're not supposed to

242
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,080
play in such competition
without any preparation.

243
00:10:49,359 --> 00:10:49,719
For the past days,

244
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,960
I've been discussing with the coach,

245
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,320
and he will find you

246
00:10:52,479 --> 00:10:53,359
a new soundtrack and choreography

247
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,359
according to your
body and characteristics.

248
00:10:55,599 --> 00:10:56,320
When you're back,

249
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,080
and after we are prepared,

250
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,440
then we'll go to compete, okay?

251
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,799
I'll think about it.

252
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,159
If there's no other thing,

253
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:02,960
I have to hang up now.

254
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,080
Beisheng, listen to me.

255
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,520
Don't get lazy. Hurry...

256
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:09,559
Xiao Qing, what?

257
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,520
Is that Zhengyi?

258
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,559
Beisheng,

259
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,919
if you want to play in the competition,

260
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,520
I can find you

261
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,679
a new soundtrack and choreography now.

262
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:18,520
No, thank you.

263
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:19,679
Then I'll hang up.

264
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,559
Let's go.

265
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:26,280
Let's go.

266
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,039
Let's go.

267
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:28,640
Let's run till you die.

268
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:29,799
Till I die?

269
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:30,919
Till you die.

270
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,520
With your stamina? Forget it.

271
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,760
Let me help you find one.

272
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,760
Listen to this song.

273
00:11:51,719 --> 00:11:52,520
Please come in.

274
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,159
What are you two doing?

275
00:11:56,119 --> 00:11:56,919
Choosing the music.

276
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,640
The competition is coming.

277
00:11:58,919 --> 00:11:59,400
We have to prepare

278
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,640
every section seriously.

279
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,520
It's good you're here.

280
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,799
Help me choose.

281
00:12:03,359 --> 00:12:04,280
Just choose one for him.

282
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,039
Be quick!

283
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,760
What do you think?

284
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,640
Well...

285
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,080
It's not right.

286
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:26,520
Why?

287
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:29,320
I cannot feel anything from this music.

288
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,559
It is with elegant melody
and full of emotions.

289
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:32,840
I think it's quite good.

290
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:33,559
Not at all.

291
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,679
You just want me to lose.

292
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,159
Next one.

293
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:49,919
(Beisheng,)

294
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,760
(if you have decided to compete,)

295
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,039
(I will also support you.)

296
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,039
(I chose some songs)

297
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:55,320
(that fit you.)

298
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,760
(I did some choreography)

299
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,640
(regarding your previous practice)

300
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:58,520
(and movement.)

301
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,200
(I hope it helps.)

302
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,119
Li Mi, wait.

303
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,000
Listen to this song
and see if it is okay?

304
00:13:23,239 --> 00:13:24,599
Isn't that the theme song
for the Wind Chasing Boys?

305
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:26,880
I think it fits you perfectly

306
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,640
to express yourself.

307
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,799
That's a good one, really.

308
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,719
I think you should try it.

309
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,799
I didn't think of that.

310
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,719
This is really okay.

311
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,000
Let's try.

312
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,280
Be quick. Let's go.

313
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,880
Go try it.

314
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,760
We've finally found it.

315
00:13:52,239 --> 00:13:54,080
Beisheng, are you okay?

316
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,200
I'm okay.

317
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:56,440
Take a rest.

318
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:57,320
Right.

319
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,799
Don't rush to practice the Triple.

320
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:00,440
I'm okay. Don't worry.

321
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,799
Let's take a break for meal.

322
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,440
Let's go.

323
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:03,440
I'll practice a little more.

324
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:03,880
You go first.

325
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,799
I'll catch up with you later.

326
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:06,159
Then take easy on it.

327
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,760
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

328
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,479
Be careful.

329
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,919

What?

340
00:14:40,599 --> 00:14:41,359
I just recorded

341
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,479
a video of your jumping.

342
00:14:44,119 --> 00:14:45,039
When you jumped,

343
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:46,719
the core of your legs did not keep up.

344
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,799
So when you are spinning

345

It's obvious that
when you were in the air,

351
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,159
your core was a bit in the back.

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,160
(Don't worry.)

436
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,560
Why didn't you reply to my message?

437
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:27,719
We could guarantee the bottom line

438
00:18:27,719 --> 00:18:29,000
to get the champion of Pairs Skating.

439
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,119
But it's definitely impossible

440
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:31,079
for the Pairs Skating this time.

441
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,280
And Li Mi got the champion

442
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:33,239
of Single Skating.

443
00:18:33,439 --> 00:18:34,439
The team competition

444
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,680
will be totally ruined.

445
00:18:36,719 --> 00:18:38,160
If Beisheng can do the Triple Axel,

446
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:39,319
there is still hope for us.

447
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,400
Didn't you see him

448
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,479
falling like that?

449
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,959
Do you really think
he can do Triple Axel

450
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,520
in such a short time?

451
00:18:50,719 --> 00:18:52,959
Well, he's been practicing so hard.

452
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:54,199
Can you say something good?

453
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:55,319
Well,

454
00:18:55,439 --> 00:18:56,199
I said the truth.

455
00:18:56,439 --> 00:18:57,439
Well, let's...

456
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,479
Let's have a meal.

457
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:03,040
Moreover, I'm worried about him.

458
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:03,959
Right?

459
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:04,680
With his current state,

460
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,680
he'll lose anyway.

461
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:07,839
If we play three against four
in the team competition,

462
00:19:07,959 --> 00:19:08,599
with one person less,

463
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,959
it's understandable that we lose, right?

464
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:12,319
If we still lose when we have four,

465
00:19:13,439 --> 00:19:14,719
it will be a shame.

466
00:19:15,439 --> 00:19:16,199
It would be more ashamed

467
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:17,160
with Beisheng playing too,

468
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,319
since he's the ace Figure Skating player

469
00:19:18,479 --> 00:19:19,560
of the Wind Chaser.

470
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,239
Maybe we should find someone

471
00:19:21,479 --> 00:19:22,199
to talk him out of it.

472
00:19:23,439 --> 00:19:25,560
What? I don't dare to do that.

473
00:19:30,479 --> 00:19:31,839
Shao Beisheng.

474
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:39,319
Too bad.

475
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,640
I don't think he heard me.

476
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,439
I don't know.

477
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,920

Leave me alone, okay?

486
00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:24,959
I don't want to play anymore.

487
00:20:25,719 --> 00:20:26,839
Leave me alone.

488
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,160
Is that right?

489
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,800

492
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,839
Coach Zhuang, please come in!

493
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,680
Coach Zhuang, why are you here?

494
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:12,560
I saw the photo

495
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,359
you sent me.

496
00:22:15,479 --> 00:22:16,680
Beisheng decided to play?

497
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:20,560
Coach Zhuang,

498
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,079
do you think

499
00:22:22,199 --> 00:22:23,280
his decision is right?

500
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,280
As an athlete,

501
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:26,719
he should be fearless
to stick to his goal.

502
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,280
No problem.

503
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:30,319
I support his decision.

504
00:22:37,199 --> 00:22:38,319
This is Beisheng's clothes?

505
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:40,959
Right.

506
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:42,560
It breaks in the sleeve.

507
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:43,959
I want to sew it.

508
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:44,599
But I...

509
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:47,359
It's really hard for you.

510

00:24:24,239 --> 00:24:25,239
Hello, coach.

Be energetic.

515
00:24:29,959 --> 00:24:31,239
Even with one person less,
we can still compete.

516
00:24:31,479 --> 00:24:32,599
We cannot lose heart
even we lose the game.

517

00:24:36,479 --> 00:24:37,359
I am asking you.

519
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:38,959
- Yes.
- Yes.

520
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,599
Yes.

521
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,520
Be prepared.

522
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,319
Why are you here?

523
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,880
Who's it?

524
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:25,239
Why are you here?

525
00:25:27,239 --> 00:25:28,479
I have something to talk to you.

526
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:34,959
I... I yesterday...

527
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:35,719
You say it or not?

528
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:36,479
I'll close the door if you don't.

529
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,359
No, no. I will say it.

530
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:50,359
You know,

531
00:25:50,479 --> 00:25:52,319
if M and N quarrel,

532
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,599
who will apologize first?

533
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,479
It's M,

534
00:25:56,719 --> 00:25:57,119
because...

535
00:25:57,239 --> 00:25:58,359
I am sorry.
[*Sounds like 'M sorry'.]

536
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,640
I have another one.

537
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,760
You owe me 50,

538
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,719
but I give you 100 back.

539
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:11,359
The answer is I...

540
00:26:11,479 --> 00:26:13,239
I apologize.
[*Sounds like Chinese 'I owe you back']

541
00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:16,319
Why do you keep stealing my lines?

542
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,079
Why don't you apologize properly?

543
00:26:18,199 --> 00:26:18,959
Why do you have to

544
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,359
keep telling meaningless cold jokes?

545
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,959
I don't... I cannot say...

546
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,000
Sorry.

547
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:34,959
I should not

548
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,959
get mad at you yesterday.

549
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,359
Actually,

550
00:26:37,479 --> 00:26:38,640
it has nothing to do with you.

551
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,959
I didn't

552
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,959
control my temper.

553
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,119
So I...

554
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,119
But... but I promise

555
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:47,280
I'll never do that again.

556
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:48,479
I won't be mad at you again.

557
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,760
And I won't lose my temper
in front of you.

558
00:26:51,959 --> 00:26:53,119
Can you forgive me?

559
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,599
What do you think of
the team competition?

560
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,319
Your teammates

561
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,719
will figure it out sooner or later.

562
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,959
It's not about them,

563
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:11,359
but you.

564
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,560
How do you think?

565
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,560
I'm not afraid of being shamed.

566
00:27:16,959 --> 00:27:18,199
The Wind Chaser
should not avoid competition.

567
00:27:19,239 --> 00:27:20,239
I had it all figured out
before I came here.

568
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:22,040
I decided to play.

569
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,319
You have dropped
your competition clothes,

570
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,599
and how can you compete?

571
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:36,880
I... I'll go find it now.

572
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,520
It could still be there.

573
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,920
I'll go find it.

574
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,520
Wait.

575
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,800
Come back.

576
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,760
If I waited for you to go find it now,

577
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:47,959
it will be already too late.

578
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,319
Stay here.

579
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,000
Here you are.

580
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,680
What is it?

581
00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:11,119
I have found it and fixed it for you.

582
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:16,000
You fixed it?

583
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:18,760
Inside this,

584
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:19,560
there are the ankle guards.

585
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,920
I think they're the same brand

586
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:21,920
to the ones you use.

587
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:22,719
You can use them.

588
00:28:22,959 --> 00:28:23,599
What happened to your hands?

589
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:25,920
Did you hurt your hands
while fixing the clothes?

590
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:27,800
Nothing.

591
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,079
I'm doing this for my brother

592
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:30,959
even at the loss of my life.

593
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,439
Does it hurt?

594
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:35,079
Don't worry about my hands.

595
00:28:35,479 --> 00:28:36,000
I am telling you that

596
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:36,959
I have my blood out,

597
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:37,719
so you have to play it well.

598
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:38,599
Understand?

599
00:28:42,479 --> 00:28:44,199
So you're not mad at me anymore?

600
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,599
No.

601
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:47,239
Why should I forgive you?

602
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,839
We'll talk about it
after you finish the competition.

603
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,520
Hurry up. Go.

604
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:52,280
Get ready for the competition.

605
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:53,079
If I win,

606
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,199
you can't be mad at me anymore.

607
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,640
No way.

608
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:58,680
Go. Hurry up!

609
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:13,800
Listen to me.

610
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,760
This is definitely not going to work.

611
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,479
Just go back.

612
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,040
Coach, I... I'm begging you.

613
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:18,079
Just let me play.

614
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:19,719
Yihang, you go back and get some rest.

615
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:20,640
We three can handle it.

616
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,199
No way.

617
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,119
I'm not leaving the three of you.

618
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:23,239
Coach Ma,

619
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,479
I've already

620
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,319
recovered.

621
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,040
I promise...

622
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,599
I promise as soon as I get on the ice,

623
00:29:27,959 --> 00:29:28,760
I definitely won't show myself off.

624
00:29:29,479 --> 00:29:30,599
I'll just get the basic score.

625
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,199
Kid,

626
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,560
why don't you understand me?

627
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:36,760
Beisheng!

628
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,040
What are you doing here?

629
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:41,000
Yihang, let me play.

630
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,239
No, Beisheng.

631
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:43,839
Trust me.

632
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:45,400
I'll just get the basic score.

633
00:29:45,719 --> 00:29:46,599
I can get the basic score too.

634
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,800
Don't you believe me?

635
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,040
I trust you.

636
00:29:49,479 --> 00:29:50,000
But trust me.

637
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:50,640
Look at my legs.

638
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,040
They have almost recovered.

639
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,239
Can your legs really do so?

640
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,040
Do you want your legs or not?

641
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:55,800
Do you still want to play

642
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,479
in future competition?

643
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:56,959
Alright,

644
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:57,560
don't be in misery here.

645
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,800
You all leave. No one can play.

646
00:29:58,959 --> 00:29:59,800
Send him out.

647
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,800
Ma,

648
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,000
let me play.

649
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:02,959
No way.

650
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,280
I know what you are thinking.

651
00:30:05,719 --> 00:30:06,119
I also know

652
00:30:06,239 --> 00:30:07,040
what you're worrying about.

653
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:07,800
But now if we want to win,

654
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,119
someone has to play, right?

655
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,040
I've figured it out.

656
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:13,560
If I play and lose,

657
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,800
the worst is to make a fool of myself.

658
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:17,239
But if Yihang plays

659
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:17,800
and he makes mistakes,

660
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,319
his

661
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,560
athletic career would be ruined.

662
00:30:19,719 --> 00:30:20,479
Then what should he do?

663
00:30:23,479 --> 00:30:24,880
Let me play, Ma.

664
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:32,479
All players,

665
00:30:32,479 --> 00:30:34,520
please gather in the court to warm up.

666
00:30:36,719 --> 00:30:37,599
Trust me.

667
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:49,959
Get prepared.

668
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,199
Beisheng!

669
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,680
Beisheng!

670
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,400
About that day, I'm sorry.

671
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:01,119
Alright, we're brothers.

672
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:07,000
Wind Chaser, sure win!

673
00:31:09,439 --> 00:31:10,160
Listen,

674
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,479
don't get distracted.

675
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,800
Don't let anything
happened off the court

676
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,439
affect you.

677
00:31:14,959 --> 00:31:16,400
Play to the best of your ability.

678
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:17,680
Be safe.

679
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:18,880
It's okay for you
to get the basic score.

680
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,400
Do you understand?

681
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,280
Wind Chaser.

682
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,640
Sure win!

683
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:25,880
(The one performing on the court
right now)

684
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,319
(is Wang Kai of Topspeed Team.)

685
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:29,599
(This player of Topspeed Team)

686
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:30,760
(keeps smooth and stable movement.)

687
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:32,839
(Well done, perfect!)

688
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,760
(The movement was
beautifully completed.)

689
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,839
(The player of Topspeed Team)

690

00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:48,719
(Very good.)

692
00:32:04,239 --> 00:32:04,520
(Okay.)

(Speaking of Shao Beisheng,)

701
00:32:15,959 --> 00:32:17,119
(we should be familiar with this name.)

702
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:18,359
(Now, Shao Beisheng)

703
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:19,800
(is a little bit more legendary.)

704
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,680
It's okay. Don't be nervous.

705
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,560
(Because of physical problems,)

706
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:22,680
(he just changed from Pairs Skating)

00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:25,400
(which is definitely)

709
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,439
(not an easy decision)

710
00:32:26,439 --> 00:32:27,319
(for a male player.)

711
00:32:27,959 --> 00:32:28,680

(Let's wait and see.)

715
00:32:33,239 --> 00:32:34,640
As long as his score is no lower than

716

87.8,

717
00:32:36,199 --> 00:32:37,520

859
00:39:23,959 --> 00:39:24,959
dinner with the whole team before.

860
00:39:25,439 --> 00:39:26,479
You must drink today.

861
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:27,120
Right.

862
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,000
No, I cannot drink.

863
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:29,520
You know I...

864
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,879
I get drunk easily when I drink.

865
00:39:33,399 --> 00:39:34,439
Maybe let's just forget it.

866
00:39:34,879 --> 00:39:35,600
You both are the same.

867
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:36,280
Then Zhengyi drinks it.

868
00:39:36,439 --> 00:39:37,600
No, she...

869
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:38,520
She cannot drink.

870
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,479
She's got a competition tomorrow.

871
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:40,280
She can't drink.

872
00:39:40,959 --> 00:39:42,080
Neither of you will drink.

873
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:43,000
Neither of you will drink, then...

874
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:43,639
Right.

875
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,479
Put on a show.

876
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,639
Put on a show.

877
00:39:46,919 --> 00:39:47,760
Show us a kiss.

878
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:57,719
- Kiss.
- Kiss.

879
00:39:57,879 --> 00:39:58,800
I think I'd drink it.

880
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,360
Don't drink too much.

881
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,679
- Good.
- Good.

882
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,360
Whose turn?

883
00:40:07,439 --> 00:40:08,000
Me.

884
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:09,679
Beisheng, I'll propose a toast to you.

885
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,120
If it weren't you today,

886
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:11,800
we couldn't have won the champion

887
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,919
of team competition.

888
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,280
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

889
00:40:42,959 --> 00:40:44,800
(Our Prince Sheng finally drank.)

890
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:15,600
I didn't expect this year's

891
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,560
gift for College Student Ice League
is so nice.

892
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,590
(Wang Jun)

893
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:25,479
(The hero saved a beauty.)

894
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:27,159
(The first time for Prince Sheng.)

895
00:41:27,959 --> 00:41:29,679
(That's what he should do.)

896
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
(So jealous.)

897
00:41:33,479 --> 00:41:34,239
(What are you jealous of?)

898
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,479
(I am jealous that
he can drink for Shen Zhengyi.)

899
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,040
(I wish there will be someone)

900
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,040
(who needs my help.)

901
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:41,879
(I believe there will be one soon.)

902
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:47,560
You... can you walk well?

903
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:48,639
I can't carry you.

904
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,879
Well, you...

905
00:41:53,479 --> 00:41:54,320
The swimming pool.

906
00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:55,360
What swimming pool? Come back.

907
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,360
Come back.

908
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,320
No! Come back.

909
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:00,159
This way. Hurry.

910
00:42:00,399 --> 00:42:00,919
We don't swim.

911
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:01,800
We don't swim today.

912
00:42:01,959 --> 00:42:03,040
Today, today...

913
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:05,639
Today we skate.

914
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,959
Right, skate.

915
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:09,360
Let's go. We're almost there.

916
00:42:11,399 --> 00:42:13,040
Little red flower.

917
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:14,760
No.

918
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,320
No, no, no.

919
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:17,679
Don't touch it.

920
00:42:17,719 --> 00:42:18,280
Don't touch it.

921
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,320
Come back.

922
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:20,439
Come back.

923
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:21,320
Come back.

924
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,520
I'm really tired.

925
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:23,320
Would you please stop doing that?

926
00:42:23,639 --> 00:42:24,399
Just take a few more steps,

927
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,399
and we'll be there, okay?

928
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,719
Here we go.

929
00:42:26,959 --> 00:42:28,959
Let's go, 1, 2, 1.

930
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:32,840
Big stage.

931
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:37,919
No. You come down.

932
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:38,679
Listen,

933
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,600
if you do like this... Listen.

934
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:42,399
Little tiger, little tiger,

935
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,280
run so fast, run so fast.

936
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,080
One has no eyes.

937
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:48,399
One has no tail.

938
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:49,360
Very weird.

939
00:42:49,439 --> 00:42:50,040
Come down. Hurry up!

940
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:50,600
So humiliating!

941
00:42:50,879 --> 00:42:51,879
So humiliating, come down.

942
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:53,159
Come down.

943
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,280
You will be photographed tomorrow.

944
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:54,719
I am telling you...

945
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:55,879
Slow down.

946
00:42:56,679 --> 00:42:57,520
