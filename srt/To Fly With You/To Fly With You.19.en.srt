3
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,279
What are you doing?

4
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,199
I gotta go training.

5
00:01:43,279 --> 00:01:44,360
Come back!

6
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:46,000
Do you have any idea
how serious this is?

7
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,080
I am telling you that if he
reports to the Skating Association,

8
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,360
you'll be out for the whole
sports competition season.

9
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,000
Are you aware of that?

10
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,199
You can't play in Ling Yun Cup,

11
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:52,559
not to mention the Asian Cup.

12
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:53,919
You will be suspended for this year.

13
00:01:54,839 --> 00:01:56,440
Are you joking about your future?

14
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:58,559
I'll be responsible for

15
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,599
what I did.

16
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,199
Good for you!

17
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,800
Who will be responsible for me?

18
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:08,199
Anyone can slate me!

19
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:17,020
(College of Arts)

20
00:02:26,119 --> 00:02:26,759
Stop writing.

21
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:27,440
Come over here.

22
00:02:28,839 --> 00:02:30,440
Shao Beisheng got suspended.

23
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:32,240
Suspended?

24
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,520
Keep it down!

25
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,039
Well, why?

26
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,600
I heard that

27
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,039
he beat a member of the Flyer.

28
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,479
And then the coach of Flyer

29
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,160
said he is going to report it
to the Skating Association.

30
00:02:44,679 --> 00:02:45,240
I'll go find him.

31
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:45,960
Take care of my stuff.

32
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,479
Why did you fight with others?

33
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,600
No reason.

34
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,800
I just don't like him.

35
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:00,000
You will get suspended.

36
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,000
Don't you know?

37
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,919
How many times do I have to tell you?

38
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:02,960
I don't care.

39
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,360
Then what do you care?

40
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,080
You're a professional athlete.

41
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,960
You know clearly

42
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:10,759
what a suspension means.

43
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,160
Can you just leave it alone?

44
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,960
Then how about

45
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:23,880
I accompany you to

46
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,559
find the coach of Flyer.

47
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,639
And we talk about it calmly.

48
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,360
Let's not joke around about your future.

49
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,279
Okay?

50
00:03:30,279 --> 00:03:31,119
I don't want to.

51
00:03:33,119 --> 00:03:34,000
Shao Beisheng,

52
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:36,839
there is a limit to be self-willed.

53
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,559
Can you just be an adult?

54
00:03:39,279 --> 00:03:39,679
Do you think

55
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,160
you are still a kid of 7 or 8 years old?

56
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:43,960
7 or 8 years old?

57
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,479
Do you know

58
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:51,039
what I was like
when I was 7 or 8 years old?

59
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,079
Talk to me.

60
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,399
What on earth did you fight for?

61
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,399
Being silent

62
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,040
is not the way to solve the problem.

63
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,239
You're not usually

64
00:04:50,359 --> 00:04:51,440
a man who likes to fight.

65
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,079
Whatever.

66
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,320
I'll leave if you don't tell me.

67
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,920
He insulted my mom.

68
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:19,920
Liu,

69
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:21,440
about this thing,

70
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:23,320
wouldn't it be a big deal to report it
to the Skating Association?

71
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,399
Kids are ignorant.

72
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,640
Why do you have to be so serious?

73
00:05:26,239 --> 00:05:27,119
Kids are ignorant,

74
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:27,959
so he can hit anyone at will?

75
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,200
If he can hit me, too?

76
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,799
You're just talking me back.

77
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:33,399
Director Liu.

78
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,200
Coach Zhuang.

79
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,239
It was really wrong that
Beisheng hit someone.

80
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:39,959
I'll ask Coach Ma to give
him a severe penalty.

81
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,320
Right, I will.

82
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,000
After all, this kid

83
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,079
is really

84
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,079
a nice athlete.

85
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:45,200
Am I right?

86
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:46,880
Coach Zhuang,

87
00:05:47,239 --> 00:05:49,000
this has bothered you.

88
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:50,200
But we can handle the matter

89
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:51,320
of the Figure Skating teams.

90
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,519
I won't let you bother.

91
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,679
We are all in Wind Chaser,

92
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,399
and we don't make the distinction.

93
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,839
Director Liu,

94
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,440
you must know Beisheng

95
00:05:58,799 --> 00:06:00,000
got injured and

96
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,239
changed from Pairs to
Single not long ago.

97
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:03,480
For this kid,

98
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:05,600
this year is very special and important.

99
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,519
If because of one impulsive behavior,

100
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,640
he gets suspended,

101
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,679
he will be out for the whole season.

102
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:11,440
Right.

103
00:06:11,799 --> 00:06:12,519
You must know

104
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:13,839
what

105
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,920
it means to the future

106
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,880
of an athlete.

107
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,839
Look,

108
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:19,600
please give

109
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:20,600
one more chance to the kid.

110
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,600
Coach Zhuang, so that's how it is.

111
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,359
I think,

112
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,200
as a professional athlete,

113
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:24,920
his morality is

114
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,559
as important as techniques.

115
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,200
Yes.

116
00:06:27,359 --> 00:06:28,079
Shao Beisheng skates well on the court,

117
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,119
but so what?

118
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,480
Ma, you saw him

119
00:06:30,679 --> 00:06:31,119
being arrogant and unreasonable

120
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,880
outside the court.

121
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:33,920
I have no idea

122
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,200
how his parents taught him

123
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,000
and how you led him.

124
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,519
Right.

125
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,000
It's the coach's problem.

126
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:42,839
I... I'm not a good coach.

127
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:43,880
I'll talk to him

128
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:44,839
and ask him to apologize.

129
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:46,399
Please give him one more chance.

130
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:47,320
Liu.

131
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:56,679
Indeed, they were wrong to

132
00:06:57,799 --> 00:06:59,000
speak ill of Coach Zhuang,

133
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,079
but you can't hit them, either.

134
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,679
I hate people the most

135
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:03,920
to gossip behind the back.

136
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,399
She is not a very good mother,

137
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,559
but she's definitely a good coach.

138
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,880
That's true.

139
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,480
Well, if someone

140
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:19,399
speaks ill of my mother,

141
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,679
I guess I'll hit them too.

142
00:07:29,359 --> 00:07:30,279
Then you just explain it

143
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:31,320
to them.

144
00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:32,679
If you could just make it clear

145
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,399
to them...

146
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,519
I don't want to.

147
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,000
Well, you can't get
suspended because of this.

148
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,679
I'm not going to tell them anyway.

149
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,480
If you think of me as a friend,

150
00:07:42,679 --> 00:07:43,720
you can't tell them either.

151
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:51,170
(Lingbei University)

152
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,679
Don't worry.

153
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,519
They're my bros.

154
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,440
I'm here.

155
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:58,600
I'm going to get you justice.

156
00:07:59,279 --> 00:07:59,959
Okay. Thanks.

157
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:01,839
Zhang,

158
00:08:04,239 --> 00:08:05,040
someone bought us drinks.

159
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,359
And with a girl.

160
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,399
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

161
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,440
Take one yourself.

162
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,480
Is it enough?

163
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:11,519
I'll buy more if not.

164
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:12,519
What is happening?

165
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:14,119
You're not afraid that
Yu Bingling would know?

166
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:15,760
Stop joking.

167
00:08:16,559 --> 00:08:17,000
She is here

168
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,119
for Shao Beisheng.

169
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:22,519
What to discuss about this?

170
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,559
Well, Shao Beisheng

171
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,839
didn't mean to get into trouble.

172
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:26,040
He had his reasons.

173
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,040
He hit me.

174
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,399
And he had his reasons?

175
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,000
Were you being heard when

176
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,119
you spoke ill of others?

177
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,719
How is it possible?

178
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,719
We were talking about the
Wind Chaser Short Track Team.

179
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,119
This has nothing to do
with Shao Beisheng.

180
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,799
Why doesn't it matter?

181
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,799
If you think of me as a friend,

182
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,679
you can't tell them either.

183
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,200
His girlfriend.

184
00:08:51,719 --> 00:08:52,960
His girlfriend is in the
Short Track Speed Skating team.

185
00:08:54,239 --> 00:08:54,960
Let me introduce to you,

186
00:08:55,599 --> 00:08:57,679
Shen Zhengyi,
Shao Beisheng's girlfriend.

187
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,280
You!

188
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,200
No wonder!

189
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:03,599
That day,

190
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,440
I did say something about you.

191
00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:07,960
Just one.

192
00:09:09,239 --> 00:09:10,479
Then why don't you just apologize?

193
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:13,679
I'm sorry.

194
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,799
It's okay. I forgive you.

195
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:18,719
Alright.

196
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,280
You guys go play basketball.

197
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:24,000
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team of
Lingbei University)

198
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,559
Li Mi has told me

199
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:39,719
about the whole process of this matter.

200
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Since both sides are at fault,

201
00:09:41,479 --> 00:09:42,159
apologize to each other.

202
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,119
I won't report it.

203
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,440
Ma, say something.

204
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,039
Look.

205
00:09:48,119 --> 00:09:48,880
Director Liu

206
00:09:49,599 --> 00:09:51,599
is so noble and generous.

207
00:09:52,599 --> 00:09:53,559
Hurry to apologize.

208
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,280
I'm sorry.

209
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,719
We should not discuss

210
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:00,760
about Wind Chaser
Short Track Team behind the back,

211
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,679
and say something bad

212
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,599
about the coach and players.

213
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:15,359
Hurry up.

214
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,359
I'm sorry. I was also on
the spur of the moment.

215
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,599
Who knows

216
00:10:23,719 --> 00:10:25,080
Shen Zhengyi is your girlfriend?

217
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,919
The way you protected your girlfriend,

218
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,320
I'm really impressed.

219
00:10:36,599 --> 00:10:37,479
Why doesn't he come out?

220
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,039
He's coming out.

221
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:41,640
So quick?

222
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,159
Where's he?

223
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,440
Beisheng.

224
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:56,520
You shouldn't have done that for me,

225
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,359
but I am...

226
00:10:58,799 --> 00:10:59,520
Don't think too much.

227
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,200
I did it for Shen Zhengyi,

228
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,679
not for you.

229
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,080
He did it for you?

230
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:06,840
No.

231
00:11:07,119 --> 00:11:08,280
He's using me as an excuse.

232
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,400
When can they

233
00:11:13,599 --> 00:11:14,799
get along?

234
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,359
Coach Zhuang is really hard.

235
00:11:20,359 --> 00:11:21,599
I just remembered
I have something to do.

236
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,719
I won't be here with you any longer.

237
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:24,159
Where are you going?

238
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:25,280
Something sweet.

239
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,039
Well, why do I have to stay here?

240
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:53,679
Wang Jun!

241
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,080
This is

242
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:02,440
for you.

243
00:12:05,479 --> 00:12:06,159
Lele,

244
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:07,640
you don't have to

245
00:12:07,719 --> 00:12:09,000
give me present anymore.

246
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,080
Why?

247
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,039
Didn't Qu Zhi tell you?

248
00:12:17,119 --> 00:12:18,320
Tell me what?

249
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,799
Lele,

250
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:27,320
let's just stay friends.

251
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:36,640
Zhu Lele!

252
00:12:47,719 --> 00:12:48,719
That's fine.

253
00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:49,760
Friends

254
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,239
can care about each other.

255
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,520
Right?

256
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,239
Here.

257
00:13:08,599 --> 00:13:10,559
Zhu Lele, say something.

258
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,719
Why don't you talk?

259
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,000
Tell me.

260
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,359
What did you...?

261
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:22,640
It hurts so much.

262
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,679
My hand is fractured.

263
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,440
It is fractured.

264
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:25,880
It is really fractured.

265
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,320
Can you tell me what

266
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,400
you just said

267
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:33,280
to him?

268
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:35,479
We're friends, too.

269
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,039
Why can't you

270
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:38,039
care about me?

271
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:41,559
Do we know each other very well?

272
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:44,599
Zhu Lele.

273
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,400
Can you just

274
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,960
stop following me?

275
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,799
Hello, Shen Zhengyi.

276
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,960
Is Zhu Lele back to the dorm?

277
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:16,320
Okay, okay, I see.

278
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:17,760
Nothing.

279
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,520
I'll go find her.

280
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:27,010
(Auditorium)

281
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,359
Why didn't you answer the phone?

282
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:39,359
Nothing.

283
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:42,919
I

284
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,840
just don't get it.

285
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,359
Why does a guy with double-fold eyelids

286
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,559
also do so?

287
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,039
That means it's not about

288
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,039
the eyelids at all.

289
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,039
Then that's my problem, isn't it?

290
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,359
He was nice to me at first.

291
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,200
He would buy me chocolates.

292
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,320
He would take nice pictures of me.

293
00:16:09,479 --> 00:16:11,039
There's just the confession left.

294
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:13,400
But why

295
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,320
does he act like this now?

296
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,799
It's because of me.

297
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,239
It must be because

298
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,119
I did something wrong.

299
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,359
Right?

300
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,719
Do you really like Wang Jun?

301
00:16:31,119 --> 00:16:31,840
They said

302
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:34,159
if you make eye contact with someone
you like for ten seconds,

303
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,760
you'll know his mind.

304
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,000
Have you ever made
eye contact with Wang Jun?

305
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:45,559
You don't even like Wang Jun.

306
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:47,119
It's just because it was the first time

307
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,200
someone did this to you,

308
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,640
and you like the way it feels.

309
00:16:50,239 --> 00:16:50,880
You just love

310
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,159
what you do to him.

311
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:56,599
No.

312
00:16:57,239 --> 00:16:58,320
I like Wang Jun.

313
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:00,559
That's not like
what you're saying at all.

314
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,520
I don't believe it.

315
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,719
You come over.

316
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,719
What are you doing?

317
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:15,119
Look into my eyes for ten seconds.

318
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:26,599
(I always feel)

319
00:17:26,719 --> 00:17:27,599
(you are special.)

320
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,239
(You deserve these.)

321
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,520
Well, you come over.

322
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,119
You really took the picture?

323
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,839
Yes, I did.

324
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:15,280
But there are

325
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:16,400
no tricks at all.

326
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,599
I did it all by my heart.

327
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,040
I did it sincerely.

328
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:20,400
Really.

329
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,520
Alright, alright. Stop.

330
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:26,880
And you can tell, right?

331
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:28,560
That picture I took for you

332
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,000
is full of emotion.

333
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,760
I told you to stop.

334
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,199
Why?

335
00:18:35,959 --> 00:18:36,959
The picture I took

336
00:18:37,719 --> 00:18:39,079
has been helping others for so long.

337
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:39,959
Then I cannot talk about it

338
00:18:40,199 --> 00:18:41,439
myself?

339
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,160
Just shut up.

340
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,439
Stop.

341
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,760
Zhu Lele,

342
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,760
give me a chance.

343
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:49,680
I promise

344
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,119
I'll take such kind of photos
for you every day.

345
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,520
Okay?

346
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,079
Okay?

347
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:56,000
Okay?

348
00:18:56,439 --> 00:18:57,359
Fine.

349
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,040
But,

350
00:19:04,719 --> 00:19:06,000
don't tell anyone yet.

351
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,680
Why?

352
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,760
If you don't want to, just forget it.

353
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,980
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team of
Lingbei University)

354
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:28,760
Coach Xiao, are you looking for me?

355
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:33,090
(Athlete Registration Form)

356
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:35,800
My mom's profile?

357
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,439
Your mother

358
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,640
had a collision in the Asian Cup

359
00:19:40,719 --> 00:19:41,959
(Brief instruction of personal experience)
1500m Final and

360
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,119
was too badly injured

361
00:19:43,439 --> 00:19:44,199
to recover,

362
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,560
so she retired after that.

363
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:47,040
She should be

364
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,319
the person who understands you the best.

365
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,000
We should

366
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:51,040
find out what's bothering her.

367
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:52,119
Maybe in this way, we can solve

368
00:19:52,239 --> 00:19:53,239
the conflict between you two.

369
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,239
Pay attention to work together.

370
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,319
Liu Sisi is defending the outer track.

371
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:06,920
Why doesn't Luo Xiaoyi

372
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,839
care about the inner track?

373
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,760
Why doesn't Luo Xiaoyi slow down a bit?

374
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,280
The last two groups
are good. Keep it up!

375
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,959
Look at them.

376
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:22,680
What's going on today?

377
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,040
Luo Xiaoyi, Liu Sisi.

378
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,040
Where's your cooperation?

379
00:20:48,719 --> 00:20:49,160
Well,

380
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:50,239
why is Luo Xiaoyi

381
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:52,000
always in the way of Liu Sisi?

382
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,880
It's too dangerous this way.

383
00:21:07,479 --> 00:21:08,680
What are you two doing?

384
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,319
What are you doing?

385
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:16,760
Luo Xiaoyi.

386
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,959
Liu Sisi, what are you doing?

387
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,839
Luo Xiaoyi, what do you mean?

388
00:21:23,239 --> 00:21:24,000
When I defended the outer track,

389
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:24,719
what were you doing?

390
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,800
We're supposed to work together.

391
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,280
Why were you always

392
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,199
in my way?

393
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,439
I'm the one who should ask the question.

394
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,520
That's how you cooperate?

395
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,439
I think you're making it pretty clear

396
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,439
that you want to compete with me.

397
00:21:32,719 --> 00:21:34,040
You and I should work together.

398
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:35,040
I'm not the only one who should do so.

399
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:36,119
You should do so too.

400
00:21:36,719 --> 00:21:38,319
Someone who won a silver medal
in College Student Ice League

401
00:21:38,439 --> 00:21:39,839
wants me to cooperate with you?

402
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:40,959
Do you think you deserve it?

403
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:42,599
I don't.

404
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,439
You can practice with
someone who deserves you.

405
00:21:44,959 --> 00:21:45,599
Just quarrel.

406
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,760
Keep quarreling.

407
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:48,280
Come here.

408
00:21:59,040 --> 00:21:59,839
Liu Sisi,

409
00:22:00,479 --> 00:22:01,280
what are you doing?

410
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:03,359
Coach, it's her who didn't
cooperate with me.

411
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:08,439
Luo Xiaoyi, I've told you that

412
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,479
the cooperation training

413
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:10,400
is not something fixed

414
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,800
to decide who should assist.

415
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,000
If you don't cooperate,

416
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:14,439
you can train alone.

417
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:16,719
You, 50 laps as a penalty.

418
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,319
Get off the ice.

419
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,920
Are you kidding me?

420
00:22:26,199 --> 00:22:27,079
Let's go.

421
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,599
Why is this quarrel?

422
00:22:29,719 --> 00:22:30,680
For what?

423
00:22:39,719 --> 00:22:40,479
Why are you here?

424
00:22:42,439 --> 00:22:43,479
I got you something nice.

425
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,839
I gotta go.

426
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:57,839
Just go.

427
00:23:18,719 --> 00:23:19,680
What's this?

428
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,000
You said you want to know more

429
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:24,640
about your mom, right?

430
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:31,680
She owns so many

431
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:32,680
awards and medals?

432
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,439
At that time, your mom

433
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,099
(Wang Limin, silver medal of
500m Short Track Speed Skating)

434
00:23:36,199 --> 00:23:37,000
was so amazing.

435
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:38,239
She has been learning

436
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:39,199
to skate since she was eight.

437
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,200
(Wang Limin, first prize, Women 500m Short Track)
She got in from city team to provincial team.

438
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,640
The provincial team at that time

439
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:46,239
was at national first-class level.

440
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:48,439
All the great players

441
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,599
were in her team.

442
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:52,400
(Wang Limin, first prize, Women 500m Short Track)
Before she retired, your mom

443
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,599
had always been
the ace player in the team.

444
00:24:00,719 --> 00:24:01,479
Is this the...?

445
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:03,119
Asian Cup,

446
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,800
1500-meter race.

447
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:08,800
Your mom only got the silver medal.

448
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,400
It's also your mother's biggest regret.

449
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,880
She missed the gold medalist

450
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:15,040
by 0.2 seconds.

451
00:24:16,199 --> 00:24:17,040
In order to win the gold medal

452
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:17,920
next year, your mom

453
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,000
had prepared for one whole year.

454
00:24:19,439 --> 00:24:20,520
But during the competition,

455
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,880
her teammate tried to

456
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,040
compete with her,

457
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,839
so they bumped into each other

458
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,640
and fell badly.

459
00:24:27,439 --> 00:24:28,520
She ruptured her Achilles tendon

460
00:24:29,199 --> 00:24:30,599
and injured the nerves
at lower leg level.

461
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,239
She spent over
half a year in the hospital,

462
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,959
and can never get on the ice again.

463
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:39,680
I met your mom

464
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,599
at that time.

465
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,359
Yiyi,

466
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,599
your mother isn't being unreasonable.

467
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,160
She just has a knot in her heart.

468
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,439
She knows all the athletes

469
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,160
are the same.

470
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:54,839
As long as you are capable,

471
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,560
everyone wants a gold medal.

472
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:00,040
But competitive sports are cruel.

473
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:03,439
Your mom is worrying that you would

474
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,000
get hurt like her,

475
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,640
and she is not willing to

476
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,199
see you hurt others in order to

477
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:12,439
win gold medals for achievement.

478
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:41,760
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team of
Lingbei University)

479
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:46,800
(I have figured it out.)

480
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,479
(I'm going to do 1500m race.)

481
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,000
(Curve skills are my weakness.)

482
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,640
(In 1500-meter race,)

483
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,640
(there are 27 curves in total.)

484
00:25:53,239 --> 00:25:54,560
(I'm going to overcome them one by one.)

485
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:56,359
(I want to make it up to mom,)

486
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,920
(and prove it to her with my actions)

487
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,920
(that I can do it.)

488
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,760
Zhengyi's mom disapproves
of her taking up the sports

489
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,280
because of some reasons.

490
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,560
But 1500m race

491
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,439
is the most challenging one

492
00:26:25,479 --> 00:26:26,479
in Short Track Speed Skating.

493
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,880
Zhengyi wants to use her strength

494
00:26:27,959 --> 00:26:28,839
to prove to her mother

495
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:30,000
that she made the right decision.

496
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:32,719
Have you thought this through?

497
00:26:33,439 --> 00:26:34,319
Yes.

498
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,280
I'll finish the simultaneous entry
training as soon as possible

499
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,239
to attend Ling Yun Cup's

500
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:38,520
1500m race.

501
00:26:58,479 --> 00:26:59,479
I like skating.

502
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:01,199
I like the feeling of

503
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,719
flying at high speed on ice.

504
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,760
It's like I could

505
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,239
fly with the wind.

506
00:27:05,479 --> 00:27:06,479
If everything goes as planned,

507
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,520
after Liu Sisi retires,

508
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,079
she can assist you instead of Liu Sisi.

509
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,280
What are you thinking? So absorbed.

510
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,640
Nothing.

511
00:27:22,719 --> 00:27:23,959
Could you knock the door
next time you come in?

512
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,040
I'm just being kind to bring you fruit.

513
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:26,680
Why are you so mean?

514
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,680
I know what you're thinking.

515
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:36,359
Brother, actually,

516
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:37,760
you should not think
about training all days.

517
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,400
Find something you enjoy,

518
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,760
like going on a date.

519
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,280
After all,

520
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,400
you're getting old, too.

521
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,760
I found you recently

522
00:27:46,479 --> 00:27:47,719
are a bit idle.

523
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:49,880
Since you have time to think for me,

524
00:27:50,239 --> 00:27:50,920
why not practice more

525
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,959
of your Single Skating?

526
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:53,880
Get out.

527
00:27:56,199 --> 00:27:57,599
Practice, practice, all about practice!

528
00:27:58,079 --> 00:27:59,040
Boring!

529
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,000
(Northern Canteen)

530
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,800
Where do we sit?

531
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,160
Shao Beisheng.

532
00:28:13,439 --> 00:28:14,599
Qu... Qu Zhi.

533
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:22,920
Slow it down.

534
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:28,959
I'll sit for a while.

535
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:36,680
Lele,

536
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:37,439
you clean it for me later.

537
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,359
It's too late. I have to go.

538
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,920
I gotta go. Bye.

539
00:28:45,479 --> 00:28:46,119
What's wrong with her?

540
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,119
Zhengyi...

541
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,640
She's been practicing

542
00:28:51,719 --> 00:28:52,520
1500m so hard

543
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,680
that she always forgets food and sleep.

544
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,640
Why is she suddenly practicing 1500m?

545
00:28:57,359 --> 00:28:58,760
Because she said she is
going to help her mother

546
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,199
win a 1500m gold medal,

547
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,040
so her mom might let her

548
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,599
stay in Short Track Speed Skating team.

549
00:29:12,719 --> 00:29:13,760
The lunch in the canteen

550
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:15,199
is exceptionally delicious today.

551
00:29:16,199 --> 00:29:16,920
What are you talking about?

552
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,599
Weirdo.

553
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:26,680
Well,

554
00:29:27,439 --> 00:29:28,520
bro, you're hemming and hawing.

555
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,400
Can you just be direct?

556
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,680
What do you mean?

557
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:32,199
To confess.

558
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,079
Don't tell me

559
00:29:33,199 --> 00:29:34,160
you don't like Shen Zhengyi.

560
00:29:34,959 --> 00:29:35,680
It's none of your business.

561
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,599
If you don't confess,

562
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,479
and Shen Zhengyi

563
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:39,319
falls in love with someone else,

564
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:40,520
just don't cry.

565
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,520
I am telling you.

566
00:29:41,959 --> 00:29:42,599
If Shen Zhengyi

567
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,439
likes someone,

568
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,439
it must be me.

569
00:29:46,239 --> 00:29:47,400
Did Shen Zhengyi say so?

570
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,040
You're sure that she must like you?

571
00:29:50,239 --> 00:29:51,319
I'm not showing off,

572
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:52,719
but she got her fingers hurt

573
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,920
for fixing my clothes.

574
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:54,839
Well, wait.

575
00:29:55,239 --> 00:29:56,160
She fixed your clothes?

576
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,040
Are you sure?

577
00:29:57,239 --> 00:29:58,479
I cannot imagine the

578
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,920
pictures of her doing that.

579
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:00,920
Let's say the least.

580
00:30:01,239 --> 00:30:02,079
Even if Shen Zhengyi

581
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:02,959
really likes you,

582
00:30:03,239 --> 00:30:04,000
you will just sit here

583
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:05,319
and wait for the girl
to make the first move?

584
00:30:05,719 --> 00:30:06,920
Are you a man or not?

585
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,760
Well, Fatty Shao.

586
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
You are afraid of being rejected,

587
00:30:10,199 --> 00:30:11,319
so you don't dare to confess, right?

588
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:14,560
Who's afraid?

589
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,319
Then go.

590
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:16,319
Go.

591
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,359
Wait and see.

592
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,439
You are really going to confess?

593
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,719
I have my way.

594
00:30:30,719 --> 00:30:32,040
This time he should be okay.

595
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,439
He went with the contract.

596
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,640
Say what you want.

597
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,560
I have some other things to do.

598
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:00,119
Shen Zhengyi,

599
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:01,959
I have a crush on a girl.

600
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,599
I'm going to start pursuing her,

601
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:04,760
so we can't go on

602
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:05,800
pretending to be a couple anymore.

603
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,199
So from today on,

604
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,800
our contract is officially void.

605
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,439
Shao Beisheng, are you okay?

606
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,839
He's definitely not okay.

607
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,199
After you tear up the agreement,

608
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:34,680
you should hug her right away

609
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:36,839
and then tell her lovingly that

610
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:38,119
the contract is over,

611
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,160
and let's date.

612
00:31:40,439 --> 00:31:41,920
What did you say back then?

613
00:31:42,439 --> 00:31:43,599
You didn't say what you should say,

614
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,239
but said what you should not say.

615
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,400
I will bet with you.

616
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,719
If Shen Zhengyi doesn't misunderstand

617
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:48,640
that you like someone else,

618
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,439
I couldn't do the Quadruple anymore.

619
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,439
Nice.

620
00:31:59,719 --> 00:32:00,760
You did it on purpose?

621
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:05,000
You're playing hard to get?

622
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,560
The agreement is fake.

623
00:32:10,199 --> 00:32:11,599
I like Shen Zhengyi now,

624
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:12,319
and want to pursue her.

625
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:13,239
But in order to let her

626
00:32:13,239 --> 00:32:14,479
understand my heart,

627
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,839
I decided to remain mysterious for now.

628
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:18,239
Then I will provide her

629
00:32:18,239 --> 00:32:19,680
a romantic and grand confession.

630
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,800
What do you two think?

631
00:32:28,719 --> 00:32:29,400
Good luck!

632
00:32:30,959 --> 00:32:31,880
Don't tell anyone anything about it.

633
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:33,560
Especially you.

634
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:35,040
If you dare to tell Zhu Lele

635
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:35,640
anything about it,

636
00:32:35,719 --> 00:32:36,439
I'm done with you.

637
00:32:38,239 --> 00:32:39,479
Dismiss.

638
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:00,959
I have a crush on a girl.

639
00:33:01,719 --> 00:33:02,719
I'm going to start pursuing her,

640
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,560
so we cannot

641
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,760
go on pretending to be a couple anymore.

642
00:33:11,719 --> 00:33:12,719
Just a stupid contract.

643
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:15,079
Whatever.

644
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,839
You're back.

645
00:33:22,719 --> 00:33:23,479
Who wanted to see you today?

646
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,800
Shao Beisheng.

647
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,760
Why did he want to see you?

648
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,560
Our contracts are canceled.

649
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,160
Really?

650
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,640
Why?

651
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,239
I wanted to say...

652
00:33:44,959 --> 00:33:45,760
He agrees?

653
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,719
No.

654
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,839
He proposed it.

655
00:33:51,719 --> 00:33:52,839
You were right.

656
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,040
A man like him,

657
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,640
once he has someone he likes,

658
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:58,800
he'll cancel the contract.

659
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,439
Shao Beisheng has a crush on someone?

660
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:07,239
He told me so himself.

broke up with Shen Zhengyi?)

I'd like a bottle of this, too.

00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:49,760
So cute.

691
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,639
(Beisheng, I'm sorry.)

692
00:36:56,879 --> 00:36:57,760
(I couldn't be there for you)

693
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,840
(when you need me the most.)

694
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,879
(The first game ended in failure.)

695
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,959
(The loin is flexible,)

696
00:37:09,439 --> 00:37:10,719
(but the muscles in the legs)

697
00:37:10,919 --> 00:37:12,040
(are weak.)

698
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,639
(You should practice on it.)

699
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,560
(Beisheng,)

700
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,120
(the present frustration)

701
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,000
(is the foundation of future success.)

702
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:28,239
(Be a strong man.)

703
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,520
(I will always support you.)

704
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,719
(Gold medal for junior group
of Figure Cup,)

705
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:37,840
(your first gold medal.)

706
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,159
(Too bad that)

707
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:41,239
(I couldn't cheer you up on the scene.)

708
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:43,320
(The whole movement was smooth.)

709
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,479
(Precise grasp of rhythm.)

710
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,399
(The power of lumbar abdominal muscles)

711
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:50,159
(and ankles still needs improvement.)

712
00:37:59,879 --> 00:38:01,239
Have you done with it?

713
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:05,959
Coach Zhuang,

714
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,399
I'm sorry.

715
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,959
I... I didn't mean to.

716
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,040
Alright.

717
00:38:11,439 --> 00:38:12,120
Are you here for something?

718
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:13,280
Well...

719
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:16,560
I came by to hand in the
written request for leave for Lele.

720
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,719
Coach Zhuang, I'm sorry.

721
00:38:23,479 --> 00:38:24,199
I didn't mean to

722
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,399
read your notebook.

723
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,879
But you are so thoughtful.

724
00:38:28,479 --> 00:38:29,040
Okay, alright.

725
00:38:29,399 --> 00:38:31,000
You've written down

726
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:32,719
every step of his growth

727
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,520
and every failure he made

728
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,719
since he was a kid.

729
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,719
I was so moved.

730
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,879
But what's the use of this?

731
00:38:41,879 --> 00:38:43,320
I wasn't even there for him

732
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,040
when he needed me the most.

733
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,760
Has Beisheng read

734
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:54,399
this notebook?

735
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:19,520
Shen Zhengyi.

736
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,320
Why did you look for me?

737
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,120
I have something to show you.

738
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,520
What is it?

739
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,040
A gift for me?

740
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:36,540
(One year older,
I wish Beisheng could...)

741
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:41,239
I don't want to read it.

742
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,040
Give it back to whoever gave it to you.

743
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,080
- Shao...
- Wait.

744
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,320
You... you just take a look.

745
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:00,439
Don't show me such kind of things

746
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,919
that will waste my time.

747
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,439
No, it won't.

748
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:03,639
It's quick, just... just...

749
00:40:03,879 --> 00:40:04,399
I won't.

750
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,199
Take a look.

751
00:40:05,399 --> 00:40:06,320
Just take a look.

752
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:07,600
It'll be read through in no time.

753
00:40:07,879 --> 00:40:08,239
I won't.

754
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,320
Just take a look.

755
00:40:09,879 --> 00:40:10,560
Take a look.

756
00:40:10,919 --> 00:40:11,520
Don't follow me.

757
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:12,560
I have to go to the botanical garden.

758
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:13,639
I'll go with you.

759
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,760
Take a look at it on your way.

760
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,280
Don't follow me.

761
00:40:20,479 --> 00:40:22,120
Why don't you just stop walking?

762
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,719
Why don't you just stop following me?

763
00:40:23,919 --> 00:40:24,800
I'm going to be busy.

764
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,239
Well, you just take a look.

765
00:40:30,479 --> 00:40:31,280
Shen Zhengyi,

766
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,800
does it have anything to do with you?

767
00:40:33,479 --> 00:40:34,280
No.

768
00:40:34,959 --> 00:40:35,800
But I'm jealous.

769
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,280
Can't I be jealous?

770
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,479
I'm jealous you have

771
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,000
a mom who supports your dreams.

772
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,199
You are on my side or her side?

773
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:45,080
Well, you're mother and son.

774
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:46,919
Why do I have to be on one side?

775
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,439
Just read it.

776
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,159
Okay?

777
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:51,439
Don't you love her?

778
00:40:51,959 --> 00:40:53,159
You love her so much that you can

779
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:54,239
even fight for her
at the risk of being suspended.

780
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,679
Why can't you just

781
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,600
be brave

782
00:40:56,679 --> 00:40:58,040
and try to get close to her?

783
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,719
She asked you to give me this notebook?

784
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,919
How is it possible?

785
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,000
She's more scared than you are.

786
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:05,000
She is too scared

787
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:06,719
to tell you anything

788
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,959
she did for you.

789
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:11,800
I will tell you the truth.

790
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,679
I didn't fix your clothes for the
College Student Ice League

791
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,760
last time.

792
00:41:17,439 --> 00:41:18,560
Coach Zhuang did it.

793
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:20,199
And I didn't prepare you

794
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,520
the ankle guards.

795
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:24,000
She also prepared them for you.

796
00:41:25,959 --> 00:41:26,760
And this notebook.

797
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,040
You saw it yourself.

798
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,639
There are so many photos in it,

799
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,760
so it cannot be made overnight

800
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,800
for certain.

801
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,879
Don't be so quick to reject her.

802
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,600
Just take a good look at it.

803
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,360
Take a good look yourself.

804
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,360
I will leave you alone.

805
00:41:41,439 --> 00:41:42,280
You decide whether to read it or not.

806
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,239
You're back.

807
00:42:05,879 --> 00:42:06,399
Xiao Qing,

808
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,560
I need you to take a look for me.

809
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:08,239
Quick.

810
00:42:08,679 --> 00:42:09,320
Come on.

811
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,159
Have you seen any movies

812
00:42:11,439 --> 00:42:13,199
about mother-son bonding?

813
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,560
I have watched so few

814
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:15,199
movies.

815
00:42:15,479 --> 00:42:16,840
I want to find one to
let Shao Beisheng watch,

816
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:18,800
and tell him to get along
with Coach Zhuang.

817
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,760
I barely watched movies.

818
00:42:26,479 --> 00:42:27,239
Zhengyi,

819
00:42:27,639 --> 00:42:29,399
do you like Shao Beisheng or not?

820
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:37,560
What are you thinking?

821
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:39,080
We are just friends.

822
00:42:40,399 --> 00:42:41,760
Really? Just friends?

823
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:47,879
What did you just say?

824
00:42:51,959 --> 00:42:52,439
I asked if

825
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,239
you have watched

826
00:42:53,399 --> 00:42:53,959
any good movies

827
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,120
about mother's love.

828
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,040
Let me see.

829
00:42:56,719 --> 00:42:57,280
