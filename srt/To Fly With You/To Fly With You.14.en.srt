=Episode 14=

3
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,559
I'm here to declare war.

4
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,239
What war?

5
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:42,879
I hurt my hand,

6
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:44,559
so I cannot do Pairs Skating anymore.

7
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:45,559
What happened to your hand?

8
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:46,720
It's fine. It's recovered now.

9
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:48,559
I'm here just to tell you that

10
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,279
I've changed to Single Skating.

11
00:01:51,639 --> 00:01:52,400
That's great.

12
00:01:54,839 --> 00:01:56,160
That's the Shao Beisheng I know.

13
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,279
Tell me.

14
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:00,319
Do you need any help from me?

15
00:02:01,279 --> 00:02:02,080
No, I don't.

16
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:04,319
You should focus on training

17
00:02:04,839 --> 00:02:06,080
since it won't be long before

18
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,080
you give away the championship.

19
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:08,039
Go away.

20
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,839
I've waited 10 years

21
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,919
for this day.

22
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,639
I don't want you to do Pairs Skating.

23
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,639
I want you to do Single Skating

24
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,039
with me.

25
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:21,960
Alright. Stop crying.

26
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,720
You are putting snot on me.

27
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,720
How can you still cry

28
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,080
when you're already eight years old?

29
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,039
Don't you feel ashamed?

30
00:02:27,399 --> 00:02:29,039
Anyway, I don't want you to go.

31
00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:30,880
Without you, there's no one

32
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,440
racing with me.

33
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,639
I will do Pairs Skating for two years

34
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,520
and I'll do Single Skating with you.

35
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,639
You promise?

36
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:40,440
Train hard and

37
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,039
don't let anyone surpass you.

38
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,960
I'm the only one who can win you.

39
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,720
Understand?

40
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,399
Then you should prepare

41
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:50,399
to cry again,

42
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:51,720
Running Nose Li.

43
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:52,919
I cry?

44
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,600
Shao Beisheng,

45
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,919
don't make me disappointed.

46
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,399
My beautiful wife,

47
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,839
can you calm down a little?

48
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,080
How can I calm down?

49
00:03:03,839 --> 00:03:04,720
Shen Jiacheng,

50
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:05,720
don't tell me that

51
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:06,080
you knew nothing

52
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:07,520
about this.

53
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:09,520
I was afraid that you would overreact

54
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:10,839
like how you are now.

55
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,720
If I didn't go to school,

56
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,479
how long do you plan

57
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,399
to keep hiding it from me?

58
00:03:13,839 --> 00:03:14,639
You two are teaming up

59
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,960
to be against me,

60
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,520
right?

61
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:17,759
How would you call that "teaming up"

62
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:18,720
to be against you?

63
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,160
I found out about this

64
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,960
just a few days ago.

65
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,520
I had no idea before then.

66
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:25,919
You've opposed her to do so for years,

67
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,279
but she's still been
secretly practicing.

68
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:29,960
She really loves it and
has been practicing so hard.

69
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,399
She even made it to the Wind Chaser.

70
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,000
You tell me what to do.

71
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:34,399
I really can't bear

72
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:36,279
to destroy her dream.

73
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,960
Can you?

74
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:38,479
If I don't destroy it now,

75
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,039
in the future, she...

76
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,039
This can't happen.
I need to find her now.

77
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,960
Darling,

78
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,279
calm down.

79
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:45,960
Have a sit first.

80
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,839
What are you doing?

81
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:47,399
Sit down.

82
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,600
If you go there now,

83
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,720
how embarrassed she will be

84
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,279
in front of so many teammates.

85
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,960
Even if you are trying to say something,

86
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,960
let's wait until she comes back.

87
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,960
But I'm really worried that

88
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,919
something will happen to her.

89
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,320
What can happen

90
00:03:59,399 --> 00:04:00,759
to her?

91
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:02,080
It's just 500 meters.

92
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,199
Maybe she will get weeded out

93
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:04,839
in the first round.

94
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,639
Don't you know her level?

95
00:04:07,399 --> 00:04:08,839
She joined Wind Chaser
with great difficulty.

96
00:04:09,399 --> 00:04:09,960
Calm down first,

97
00:04:10,279 --> 00:04:11,479
or your blood pressure
will increase again.

98
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,320
But I'm afraid...

99
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:14,639
I know. I know.

100
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,399
Well... well...

101
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,920
This fish glue is very good

102
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,519
and very nutritional.

103
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,600
Come on. Have some.

104
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:23,480
When she comes back,

105
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,320
I will teach her a lesson,

106
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,839
and you.

107
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,760
Okay. Teach me a lesson.

108
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:32,640
Still laughing!

109
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:34,720
Teach me a big lesson.

110
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:40,959
When did you buy it?

111
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,079
I just bought it

112
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,079
because everyone speaks highly of it.

113
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,040
You are wasting money.

114
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:47,959
Have more.

115
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:54,880
(This is the 9th College Student)

116
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,399
(Ice League.)

117
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,880
(Now we are watching at the scene)

118
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,880
(of Women's Short Track Speed Skating.)

(The audience and judges)

120

(is one of the most popular
racing events every year.)

123
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,720
(For the past few years, it has)

124
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,239
(gained even more attention.)

125
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:10,920
(Yu Bingling,)

126
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,760
(a popular athlete
of Short Track Speed Skating,)

127
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,880
(is the ace player)

128

(of Flyer Speed Skating Team.)

129
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,880
(I will be on the court soon.)

130
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:25,839
Today we will

131
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,440
do the 500-meter race first.

132
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,839
The qualifying round will be
divided into two groups.

133
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:30,519
Fang Nan,

134
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:31,959
you have avoided Yu Bingling.

135
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,200
Do your best.

136
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,079
Remember to speed up
when you start,

137
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,760
and try to skate stably
when you take the position.

138
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:37,959
I trust you.

139
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:39,200
You will do it well.

140
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,519
Shen Zhengyi,

141
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:44,200
I only have one requirement for you.

142
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,600
Finish the race.

143
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,079
Calm down and don't hurry.

144
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,200
Just do it

145
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,040
as how you usually do.

146
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,760
Understand?

147
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,399
Okay. Cheer up.

148
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:53,959
Cheer up!

149
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:55,040
Cheer up!

150
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,040
Let's go.

151
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,959
Relax. Good luck.

152
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:20,839
The first girl there

153
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:21,839
is Yu Bingling.

154
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,519
Coach Zhuang.

155
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:24,519
Coach Zhuang,

156
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:25,440
hello, hello.

157
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,640
Long time no see. How are you?

158
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,640
Last time Coach Wang told me that

159
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,279
you are joining Wind Chaser,

160
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:28,959
and I haven't got the time

161
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:29,880
to visit you.

162
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:31,399
Liu Sisi,

163
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,959
where is Luo Xiaoyi?

164
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,839
Is she afraid to lose to me?

165
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,839
I've never imagined that one day

166
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,839
Wind Chaser will descend to

167
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,959
having you as the representative.

168
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,640
Whether I can represent Wind Chaser

169
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,440
is not decided by you.

170
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:51,440
Coach Xiao,

171
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:53,600
did you teach Luo Xiaoyi

172
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,839
to run away?

173
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,279
Wind Chaser used to be

174
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,720
a top team anyway.

175
00:06:58,399 --> 00:06:59,880
Don't lose too soon.

176
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,519
The game has not started yet.

177
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,839
How do you know that we'll lose?

178
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,760
Who are you?

179
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:07,279
Newbie?

180
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:10,959
Hello, I'm Shen Zhengyi.

181
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:13,600
Such a coincidence.

182
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,399
I'm in the same group with you,

183
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,519
but don't be nervous,

184
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,079
for I won't make you lose too badly.

185
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:20,839
Good luck.

186
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,640
You've made a big talk.

187
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,079
Good luck.

188
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,519
Why can't I control my mouth?

189
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:40,839
Good luck.

190

(9th College Student Ice League)
(Usmile will brighten your smile,)

191
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:44,720
(helping you chase your dream.)

192
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,119
(Welcome to)

193
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,920
(the competition site of)

194
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,600
(Yu Bingling, cheer up)
(9th College Student Ice League.)

195
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:56,920
Good luck.

196
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,399
Good luck.

197
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,359
Good luck.

198
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,720
Stop looking.

199
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:06,640
No one in Wind Chaser

200
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,440
can be a match to my girlfriend.

201
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:11,640
Your girlfriend?

202
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,600
That Yu Bingling is your girlfriend?

203
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,079
How is it?

204
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,640
Do you sense the atmosphere

205
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:18,640
of a born queen?

206
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,839
I love it.

207
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,160
Stop showing off.

208
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,959
Wind Chaser has a secret weapon.

209
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:27,040
Don't brag.

210
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:30,440
(The next race is)

211
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,839
(the qualifying round of 500-meter)

212
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:32,840
(Women's Short Track Speed Skating.)

213
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,280
Good luck.

214
00:08:45,599 --> 00:08:46,840
(We can see that all the players)

215
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:48,400
(are ready to start.)

216
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,280
(Newbie, you are no match to me.)

217
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,840
(Yu Bingling is such a top player
in many aspects.)

218
00:09:01,719 --> 00:09:03,280
(But she must have weakness.)

219
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:05,719
(What's her weakness?)

220
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:13,440
Go to the start.

221
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,520
(The center of gravity is wrong.
Do it again.)

222
00:09:35,599 --> 00:09:36,599
(Again. It's not right.)

223
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,200
(Ready.)

224
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,760
(One thing that
caught our attention is that)

225
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,760
(one player from Wind Chaser)

226
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,719
(struck a completely different pose)

227
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,080
(from other people.)

228
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,080
(This player is...)

229
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,280
(Shen Zhengyi.)

230
00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:56,440
(Shen Zhengyi, you can do it.)

231
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:01,719
(Okay. The game begins.)

232
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:02,960
(It's unbelievable that)

233
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,479
(the player who got in the first place)

234
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,559
(is Shen Zhengyi from Wind Chaser.)

235
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,039
(This player)

236
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,479
(doesn't have any past record)

237
00:10:07,479 --> 00:10:08,520
(in any contest.)

238
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:10,280
(We all know that this time)

239
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,719
(Wind Chaser sent)

240
00:10:11,719 --> 00:10:13,280
(some new members)

241
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:14,400
(instead of their ace player,)

242
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,479
(Luo Xiaoyi.)

243
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,320
(Shen Zhengyi is one of them.)

244
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:19,479
(Such a decision might seem bold,)

245
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:20,520
(but they do have their secret weapon.)

246
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,080
Go, go, go.

247
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,799
(Crazy.)

248
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,440
(This newbie has)

249
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,200
(already surpassed Yu Bingling
from Flyer Team)

250
00:10:28,239 --> 00:10:29,559
(by 0.3 seconds)

251
00:10:29,599 --> 00:10:30,520
(in a single lap.)

252
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:31,799
(This is unbelievable.)

253
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:32,960
Fortunately, there is only 500 meters.

254
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,960
Hope she can hang in there.

255
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,440
Keep it up, Yu Bingling.

256
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:38,440
Curve. Pay attention to the curve.

257
00:10:43,239 --> 00:10:44,559
(Shen Zhengyi is speeding up again.)

258
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:46,080
(She is speeding up even at the curve.)

259
00:10:46,239 --> 00:10:46,799
(Be careful.)

260
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,679
(She's catching up.)

261
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,039
What is going on?

262
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:52,960
How did she get surpassed?

263
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:53,719
A good player

264
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:54,840
does have obvious advantages,

265
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:55,840
but comprehensive technique
is very important.

266
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,080
(It's too dangerous.)

267
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,559
Shen Zhengyi, are you crazy?

268
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,280
Still speed up?

269
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:01,320
(Still speed up at the curve?)

270
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,280
(This is a very risky action.)

271
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,359
(She has skated)

272
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,320
(a longer distance
compared with other players.)

273
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,960
(She even lost)

274
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,320
(the vantage spot
that she won in the inner track.)

275
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,359
This is too risky.

276
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,320
(Yu Bingling is catching up.)

277
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:13,080
(There's only one lap left.)

278
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,760
(Now we are to come to
the climax of the game.)

279
00:11:16,359 --> 00:11:17,280
(As the game continues,)

280
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,000
(the strength of Yu Bingling...)

281
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,760
Cheer up, Yu Bingling.

282
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,200
Cheer up, Zhengyi.

283
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,679
(She used her comprehensive techniques)

284
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,280
(to shorten the distance
at every curve.)

285
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,520
(There's only one last curve.)

286
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:29,400
(Can Shen Zhengyi)

287
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,840
(keep the last minor vantage
she's got?)

288
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,159
(Shen Zhengyi
crossed the finishing line first)

289
00:11:36,239 --> 00:11:37,000
(with tiny vantage.)

290
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,719
(She... She fell through it.)

291
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:40,960
Nice.

292
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,440
Shen Zhengyi.

293
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,700
(Women's 500m Single Short Tracking Speed
Skating First Place in Team Shen Zhengyi)

294
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,039
(Anyway,)

295
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,200
(this newbie of Wind Chaser,)

296
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:56,799
(Shen Zhengyi,)

297
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,039
(has won the first place of this group.)

298
00:11:58,599 --> 00:12:00,119
(Let us congratulate this new player,)

299
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:01,799
(Shen Zhengyi from Wind Chaser.)

300
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:03,679
I won!

301
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,200
Zhengyi is the first.

302
00:12:07,599 --> 00:12:09,039
Yu Bingling, you are the best.

303
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:22,200
Nice, I did it!

304
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:23,640
I won.

305
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,919
Coach Xiao, I won.

306
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:31,719
Congratulations, Zhengyi.

307
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,440
I got the first place.

308
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:38,159
It's just winning a game.

309
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:39,440
Why do you have to hug everyone?

310
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,440
It's just losing a game.

311
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,799
Do you have to be so sad?

312
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:49,919
It's not like your girlfriend has lost.

313
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,200
My girlfriend will not lose anyway.

314
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,400
Do you have a girlfriend?

315
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:02,400
I... I don't have a girlfriend.

316
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,320
What were you looking at?

317
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:05,919
None of your business.

318
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:06,960
Does your girlfriend know

319
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:08,280
you have such strong curiosity?

320
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,799
If you are my bro, tell me the truth.

321
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:12,799
Is the girl that you like

322
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:13,799
among those people?

323
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:15,440
Is it the girl who got the first place?

324
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:18,320
No. I'll go to the bathroom.

325
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:22,039
You are trying to avoid it.

326
00:13:22,479 --> 00:13:23,599
Not an easy girl.

327
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:24,719
Wait for me.

328
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,960
Good job. Good job.

329
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:26,919
Come on. Relax.

330
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,200
Come on. I was just skating...

331
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,679
Where are you? I'm coming to you.

332
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:32,679
You are the hero of

333
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,919
Wind Chaser now.

334
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,200
You deserve it.

335
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,520
Zhengyi, are you thirsty?

336
00:13:37,719 --> 00:13:38,440
Do you want to drink some water?

337
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,320
Slowly.

338
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,039
Wait, aren't you afraid that

339
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,200
I will get used to this?

340
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:45,039
To thank you for letting us

341
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,280
see the distorted face of Yu Bingling,

342
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,679
I allow you to enjoy it once.

343
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,280
This might be the only chance

344
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,440
for you to enjoy such treatment.

345
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:51,440
You should cherish it.

346
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,679
Why is the score not coming out yet?

347
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,200
Is there any problem?

348
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:58,039
What can be the problem?

349
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,520
You need to give the judges some time

350
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:00,679
to calculate the scores, right?

351
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,919
Also, this isn't what

352
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,200
we should worry about now.

353
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,039
We should think about

354
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,440
what to eat for the celebration party.

355
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,679
We need something nice.

356
00:14:08,719 --> 00:14:10,320
Anything.

357
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,679
How about BBQ? Is that OK?

358
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:13,039
OK. I like BBQ.

359
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,679
What BBQ?

360
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:14,679
You guys eat so much.

361
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:15,320
Not BBQ, OK?

362
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:17,440
Zhengyi, BBQ.

363
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:18,840
Zhengyi, BBQ.

364
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:20,200
Zhengyi, BBQ.

365
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,559
Coach Zhuang.

366
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,080
You really think that you won?

367
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,719
You've forgotten all the moves

368
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:32,919
that you should do at the curves.

369
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:34,520
At the seventh curve,

370
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,719
you were trying to surpass Yu Bingling,

371
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,159
so you sped up
while skating on a further route.

372
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,159
You almost hit into the protecting wall.

373
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,400
You've cut the inner track
over and over again to grab the position

374
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,200
and failed to do every move.

375
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,799
You also forgot to
keep a safe distance.

376
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:45,719
Do you know how dangerous it was?

377
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:46,799
I've stressed it

378
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:47,840
over and over again to you.

379
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,520
What is the most important thing
during the game?

380
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:51,679
The safety of you and others.

381
00:14:51,719 --> 00:14:53,039
Did you remember what I said?

382
00:14:55,359 --> 00:14:56,320
This is just a qualifying round.

383
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,960
Top two players
can get into the next round.

384
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,200
What kind of show
were you trying to put on there?

385
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,440
I cannot lose.

386
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,919
What does it mean by winning one game?

387
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:05,960
You forgot all the techniques,

388
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,799
moves, and safety distance.

389
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,280
You might be lucky to win this time,

390
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,640
but it won't happen again next time.

391
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,640
You understand how dangerous it can be.

392
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,400
You were training pretty well.

393
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,799
But what was going on back then?

394
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:19,440
Tell me about it.

395
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,400
What were you thinking?

396
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:22,200
Sorry, I just...

397
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,880
I forgot everything when I was up there.

398
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:30,239
(Now, we will announce)

399
00:15:30,239 --> 00:15:31,640
(the players who can
get into the next round.)

400
00:15:33,239 --> 00:15:34,039
Coach Zhuang,

401
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,320
the judges will announce
the winning list.

402
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,039
Why are you here?

403
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:56,960
You should be preparing for

404
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,400
the elite game right now.

405
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,559
I just want to check it out

406
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,880
how Wind Chaser

407
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,200
will lose without me.

408
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:04,400
But I didn't expect that

409
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:05,960
it would turn out like this.

410
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:07,799
Actually, the fact that Shen
Zhengyi is getting stronger

411
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,159
is good for you.

412
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,919
You can only get stronger

413
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:11,960
when you are with strong people.

414
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:13,400
I saw her right.

415
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,159
If everything goes as planned,

416
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,280
after Liu Sisi retires

417
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,799
she can assist you instead of Liu Sisi.

418
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,679
Will she agree?

419
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,440
This is not what

420
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:21,440
you should worry about.

421
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:23,919
You should focus on
preparing for the game now.

422
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:24,960
I will take care of the rest.

423
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,080
Don't worry.

424
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:28,159
I will win for sure.

425
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:30,280
You've never let me down.

426
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,280
Alright. Go back.

427
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:48,760
(Based on the ranking
in the qualifying round,)

428
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:50,520
(the players who will get into)

429
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:52,280
(the final round of 500-meter Women's
Short Track Speed Skating are)

430
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,400
(Yu Bingling, who won the first place,)

431
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:56,320
Yu Bingling?

432
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:58,440
(Wang Ying, who won the second place,)

433
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:00,919
(Fang Nan, who won the third place,)

434
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:03,799
(and Ji Na, who won the fourth place.)

435
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,560
What is going on?

436
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,520
Why am I not there?

437
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,040
Why isn't Zhengyi included?

438
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,160
Yu Bingling should be

439
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,160
the second place.

440
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:13,400
There must be something wrong.

441
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,439
Zhengyi should be able to

442
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,280
get into the final round.

443
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,560
Unless...

444
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,800
the grade got canceled

445
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,040
for breaking the rules.

446
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,640
Breaking the rules?

447
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,160
Who broke the rules?

448
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:26,920
I didn't.

449
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:27,800
It's okay.

450
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:28,800
We will figure it out.

451
00:17:29,199 --> 00:17:29,920
We can't let it pass.

452
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:30,640
Let's go.

453
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,439
Lele.

454
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,880
Wait. What are you doing?

455
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,439
Zhengyi won and

456
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,800
we need to make it right.

457
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,560
This should be handled by coaches.

458
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,439
Come back.

459
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,640
Coach, I will go see how she's doing.

460
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,040
I don't want anything to happen to her.

461
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,460
(Women's Single Skating Team Race  Champion
Yu Bingling)

462
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,680
It's all your fault.

463
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,199
You were talking about fairness

464
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,160
and making me argue with the judge.

465
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,439
You made me get banned from the game.

466
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,160
You don't deserve

467
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:55,959
to be a coach.

468
00:17:56,439 --> 00:17:58,160
I have to ensure it's fair to you.

469
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,199
This is not the kind of fairness I want.

470
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,079
It's what you want.

471
00:18:00,439 --> 00:18:01,160
Why should I

472
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,439
get banned from the game?

473
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,800
Because you broke the rules,

474
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,160
the score was ineffective.

475
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,280
Broke the rules? I didn't.

476
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,040
Although you were the first player

477
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,040
who crossed the finishing line,

478
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,560
there was offensive behavior
during the game

479
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,880
such as blocking.

480
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,640
So the score was ineffective.

481
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,079
I didn't touch Yu Bingling.

482
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,040
We can see clearly

483
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,319
in this video.

484
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,199
Are you trying to deny it?

485
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,400
Well,

486
00:18:28,439 --> 00:18:29,800
I really didn't touch her.

487
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:31,400
Are you sure?

488
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,040
Yes.

489
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,680
Can I watch the video?

490
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,280
Go back, everyone.

491
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,079
In the video...

492
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,280
I... Coach Zhuang.

493
00:18:38,439 --> 00:18:39,280
- Coach Zhuang.
- Coach Zhuang,

494
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,280
they misjudged it.

495
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,760
All the players of Wind Chaser,

496
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,160
go back to the resting room.

497
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:45,640
If we leave like this,

498
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,560
what will happen to Zhengyi's score?

499
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,640
You didn't hear me?

500
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,800
It's not fair.

501
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:50,680
Exactly, Coach Zhuang, it's not fair.

502
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,640
It's not you who can decide

503
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,760
whether it's fair or not.

504
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,680
Go back.

505
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,680
Coach Zhuang,

506
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,040
please explain to them.

507
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:57,160
I swear. Please trust me.

508
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,560
I really didn't touch Yu Bingling.

509
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,199
I'm very sure

510
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,439
that I didn't touch her.

511
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:01,920
You need evidence to

512
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:02,800
challenge judges' decision.

513
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,079
They have the evidence,

514
00:19:04,199 --> 00:19:05,160
but there's something wrong
with the evidence.

515
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,520
The video is not clear enough.

516
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,439
I really didn't touch her.

517
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,800
I'm aware of what I did.

518
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,959
You shouldn't cause a mess here.

519
00:19:10,199 --> 00:19:11,040
Go back.

520
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,920
Why don't you trust me?

521
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,319
Didn't you hear me?

522
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:20,040
Go back.

523
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,880
Zhengyi.

524
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:27,800
Coach.

525
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,680
Thank you, Coach Zhuang,

526
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,680
for your support in our work.

527
00:20:05,439 --> 00:20:06,280
What's wrong?

528
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,560
Don't you think that
you are acting weirdly?

529
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:11,800
Don't you think that
you are acting weirdly?

530
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,280
Tell me.

531
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,319
Are you in a relationship?

532
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,880
Come on. As an old friend,

533
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:17,920
I'm really curious about

534
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:19,400
what kind of girl
you fell in love with.

535
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,800
Does it have anything to do with you?

536
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,040
Wait. What?

537
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,319
Hello.

538
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,040
Li Mi, where are you?

539
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,439
Show up in front of me

540
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,640
in 5 minutes.

541
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,560
Okay. I'm coming. A moment.

542
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,880
Don't... Don't be mad.

543
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,079
I told you that

544
00:20:43,199 --> 00:20:44,439
I have something to take care of.

545
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,800
Why are you so clingy?

546
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,079
Can't you just stay alone for a while?

547
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:49,439
Alright. Bye.

548
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,199
I have to take care of something.

549
00:20:54,439 --> 00:20:55,079
Gotta go now.

550
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:58,160
Have you seen any dramas saying

551
00:20:58,199 --> 00:20:59,479
that sentimental people will get hurt?

552
00:21:00,479 --> 00:21:01,760
I'm sentimental?

553
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,880
It's better than being alone like you.

554
00:21:05,719 --> 00:21:06,640
Wait, you...

555
00:21:07,719 --> 00:21:09,319
Wait, who is alone?

556
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:24,680
Shao Beisheng,

557
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,760
have you seen Zhengyi?

558
00:21:26,439 --> 00:21:26,800
No.

559
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,800
Go find her with me.

560
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,040
Wait. What's wrong?

561
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,439
There is something bad. Hurry.

562
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,640
What's wrong?

563
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:33,680
What happened?

564
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:37,570
(Host Committee Office)

565
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,520
Coach Zhuang, Coach Zhuang.

566
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,680
Director Zhang.

567
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,160
Come here.

568
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,280
I've heard what happened.

569
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,920
You took care of it well

570
00:21:54,959 --> 00:21:56,040
in a timely manner.

571
00:21:57,319 --> 00:21:58,280
They overreacted too much.

572
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,800
I was afraid that they would
dash around madly

573
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,040
and get unnecessary punishment.

574
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,400
Exactly. That's the thing.

575
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:05,079
But you are here...

576
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,560
Not allowing them to come

577
00:22:07,199 --> 00:22:08,319
doesn't mean that I won't fight for it.

578
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,800
I've been there during the whole game.

579
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:11,040
I know

580
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,439
although Shen Zhengyi

581
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,439
doesn't have mature techniques,

582
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,079
she didn't break any rule.

583
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,079
I have to seek for justice.

584
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,920
College Student Ice League
is a friendly game.

585
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:20,920
Do you think it's necessary

586
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:21,760
to make everyone awkward

587
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,520
just for one new member?

588
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,560
Yes.

589
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,079
For Wind Chaser,

590
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,160
it might be only a small game.

591
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,760
But for Shen Zhengyi,

592
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,040
it is the first game in her life.

593
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:30,760
If the first game is

594
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,560
so unfair,

595
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:32,920
how will she continue with it?

596
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:34,680
I have to take responsibility for

597
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,280
all of my members.

598
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,439
Zhuang Yue,

599
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,439
when can you

600
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,959
learn the lessons?

601
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:40,920
Do you have to fall

602
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,560
on the same problem

603
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,800
twice?

604
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,880
Will you be happy then?

605
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,520
I really can't

606
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,560
take such judgment.

607
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,760
The other team broke the rules

608
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,880
and we are the victim.

609
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:51,760
Why would you

610
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,680
cancel our score?

611
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,280
Wait.

612
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,400
We made the judgment

613
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:55,800
based on the video recording.

614
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,079
The video shows that

615
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,680
Eunkyung Choi touched other players

616
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,800
during the game.

617
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:00,959
What are you doing?

618
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,040
Chief judge,

619
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:02,880
I think that

620
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,760
it's due to the recording angle.

621
00:23:04,199 --> 00:23:05,920
I was there during the whole game.

622
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:07,280
Their player grabbed our player.

623
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,640
How can the video be fake?

624
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,560
If you still think so,

625
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,640
I will apply for arbitration.

626
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,040
You are her coach

627
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,680
and your words won't
be objective enough.

628
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,439
How can we change our decision

629
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,400
only because of

630
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,680
what you said?

631
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,920
What do you mean by that?

632
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,800
They are the one who broke the rule.

633
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,680
Didn't you see?

634
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,160
What kind of judge are you?

635
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:23,479
What are you doing, Eunkyung Choi?

636
00:23:24,959 --> 00:23:26,160
How can you act like this?

637
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:26,959
So unreasonable.

638
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,839
Do you know how important

639
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,040
this game is to me?

640
00:23:30,439 --> 00:23:31,800
Do you know?

641
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,880
Think about it carefully.

642
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,400
Why were you banned from the game?

643
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,680
Why are you only a coach

644
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,520
for a school team now

645
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,280
instead of an international team?

646
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,880
You should've
learned your lessons by now.

647
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,160
What is the situation of Wind Chaser?

648
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,880
It cannot take too much strike.

649
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,040
I've said everything I can.

650
00:23:58,439 --> 00:23:59,800
No matter on my personal perspective

651
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,160
or the leader's perspective,

652
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,640
I hope that you can

653
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,560
think carefully before you act.

654
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:18,520
(I would like to)

655
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,439
(express my sincere apology to)

656
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,880
(the committee and judges.)

657
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,280
(Actually, I don't have
opinions towards)

658
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,040
(the decision of the judges.)

659
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:28,560
(Since I had no idea of the truth)

660
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,280
(when I was incited by Zhuang Yue,)

661
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,959
(I was overreacting.)

662
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:32,800
(Considering the fact that)

663
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,439
(Zhuang Yue lacks the professionalism)

664
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,160
(as a chief coach,)

665
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,959
(she is not qualified
as the chief coach.)

666
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,079
(So from now on,)

667
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,160
(I will end my cooperation with her)

668
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,319
(and terminate my contract.)

669
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,560
I swear. Please trust me.

670
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,800
I really didn't touch Yu Bingling.

671
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,439
I'm very sure that

672
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,560
I didn't touch her.

673
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,199
Didn't you hear me?

674
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,160
Why don't you believe me?

675
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,640
I will look for her over there.

676
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,680
You can go that way.

677
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,640
Okay.

678
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:22,319
Shen Zhengyi.

679
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,160
What happened?

680
00:25:30,959 --> 00:25:31,760
Did you cry?

681
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:32,760
No.

682
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,040
I heard about it.

683
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:43,760
It's okay.

684
00:25:44,199 --> 00:25:45,040
There must be some misunderstanding.

685
00:25:46,479 --> 00:25:47,800
I can't understand that.

686
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:50,280
It's fine if my mom doesn't believe me.

687
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,160
Why wouldn't Coach Zhuang

688
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,560
believe me either?

689
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,280
I... I do.

690
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,760
No matter what happens,

691
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,760
I... I will believe you.

692
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,920
It's okay. Stop crying.

693
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,439
But I really

694
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,160
really didn't touch her.

695
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,640
There must be some misunderstanding.

696
00:26:13,199 --> 00:26:14,959
I didn't touch her for sure.

697
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,160
How wouldn't I know myself?

698
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,800
Zhengyi, Zhengyi,

699
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,439
I finally found you.

700
00:26:27,439 --> 00:26:28,439
What are you two doing here?

701
00:26:29,199 --> 00:26:29,959
Nothing.

702
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:31,959
Since when did you two

703
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:32,920
become so tacit?

704
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,959
Well, it occurred to me that

705
00:26:35,439 --> 00:26:36,079
I recorded a video for you

706
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,959
during the game.

707
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:38,319
We can see clearly

708
00:26:39,199 --> 00:26:39,640
whether you broke the rules or not

709
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,680
from this video.

710
00:26:40,959 --> 00:26:41,800
Really?

711
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,680
Is it this movement?

712
00:26:48,959 --> 00:26:49,680
Based on the video,

713
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,040
you... you didn't break the rules.

714
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,560
But the video of the judges

715
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,079
showed that

716
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,280
I broke the rules.

717
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,400
It's not an international game,

718
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,560
so there're not enough cameras.

719
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,520
I think it might be due to

720
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,199
the angle of recording

721
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,160
that caused the misjudgment.

722
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,040
What should I do now?

723
00:27:06,439 --> 00:27:07,280
Follow me.

724
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:07,959
Where are we going?

725
00:27:08,439 --> 00:27:09,640
Tell them the truth, of course.

726
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:11,640
Alright.

727
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:12,680
You're the winner.

728
00:27:12,959 --> 00:27:13,680
Stop crying.

729
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,880
Be strong.

730
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,800
Lele, can I borrow the phone?

731
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,079
Okay.

732
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,959
Aren't they pretending to be a match?

733
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,400
Never mind.

734
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,520
I need to find helpers.

735
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,680
I wouldn't accept the decision

736
00:27:40,719 --> 00:27:42,280
just by

737
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,520
looking at this video.

738
00:27:44,239 --> 00:27:45,079
I believe that it's completely

739
00:27:45,199 --> 00:27:46,479
due to the angle of recording.

740
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:47,719
Chief judge,

741
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:49,959
I was there during the whole game.

742
00:27:50,199 --> 00:27:51,719
I saw it clearly that

743
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,680
my team member did not

744
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,040
touch or grab the other player.

745
00:27:55,479 --> 00:27:56,479
As her coach,

746
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,959
I do not accept this decision.

747
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,479
I think the judgment is not fair.

748
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,400
Coach Zhuang,

749
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
the videos from different angles

750
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:08,800
are all here.

751
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,079
You can challenge us

752
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:12,000
but you need to have evidence.

753
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,239
I know that

754
00:28:13,479 --> 00:28:14,479
you are a famous coach.

755
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,959
But our judges are professional

756
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,959
as well.

757
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,640
We have given the fairest judgment

758
00:28:17,719 --> 00:28:18,719
at the competition site.

759
00:28:18,719 --> 00:28:19,719
Why do you say

760
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,479
the judgment is not fair?

761
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,719
You can cancel my qualification

762
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,040
as a coach,

763
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,640
but I won't accept it

764
00:28:26,719 --> 00:28:27,520
if those videos are the only reason.

765
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,640
Do you have other evidence?

766
00:28:29,479 --> 00:28:30,520
Then you used this for...

767
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,880
Why are you two here?

768
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,239
Chief Judge,

769
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:39,640
I can provide some evidence.

770
00:28:45,719 --> 00:28:46,479
Project it.

771
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,050
(The 9th College Student Ice League)

772
00:28:57,199 --> 00:28:58,160
They are in there.

773
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,719
What do you think?

774
00:29:27,719 --> 00:29:29,160
The video is not clear enough

775
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,439
to be used as evidence.

776
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:33,839
What about you?

777
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,719
Why are you here?

778
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,800
It has nothing to do with you.

779
00:29:44,239 --> 00:29:45,000
Move, please.

780
00:29:46,719 --> 00:29:48,040
Why should I move when you say so?

781
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,199
Excuse me,

782
00:29:54,439 --> 00:29:55,760
we are really in a hurry.

783
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:01,439
We all agree that the pixel is too low

784
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,439
and the video is too blurry

785
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,079
to be used as evidence.

786
00:30:06,479 --> 00:30:08,520
So we'll go with the original decision.

787
00:30:11,239 --> 00:30:12,640
Is this blurry?

788
00:30:19,719 --> 00:30:20,479
What's going on?

789
00:30:22,199 --> 00:30:23,040
Hi, chief judge.

790
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,000
I'm here to explain that

791
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:25,920
Shen Zhengyi did not

792
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,920
touch me

793
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:27,959
during the whole game.

794
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:29,040
She didn't break any rules.

795
00:30:29,719 --> 00:30:31,199
Please make the judgment again.

796
00:30:36,199 --> 00:30:36,880
Chief judge,

797
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:38,479
can this be used as evidence?

798
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,000
Since the litigant has verified,

799
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,239
there may be some controversy

800
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,479
in this decision.

801
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,479
We'll have a discussion first.

802
00:30:58,079 --> 00:30:58,719
Come here.

803
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,880
Thank you.

804
00:31:07,239 --> 00:31:07,959
There's no need.

805
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,719
Being lost is being lost.

806
00:31:10,199 --> 00:31:11,640
But it won't happen again.

807
00:31:13,439 --> 00:31:14,479
See you at the final round.

808
00:31:20,959 --> 00:31:21,880
I can't believe that

809
00:31:21,959 --> 00:31:23,000
Yu Bingling will admit her failure.

810
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,479
Why are you all here?

811
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,040
This is not just your own business.

812
00:31:32,239 --> 00:31:33,160
It's relevant to the whole Wind Chaser.

813
00:31:33,239 --> 00:31:34,079
Of course, everyone should be here.

814
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,239
Thank you, chief judge.

815
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,680
I'll leave now.

816
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,880
You made me see

817
00:32:02,479 --> 00:32:03,239
a very cooperative

818
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,079
Wind Chaser today.

819
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,520
I'm very happy.

820
00:32:11,199 --> 00:32:11,719
Good luck.

821
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Good luck.

822
00:32:19,959 --> 00:32:20,479
Darling,

823
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,000
I'm telling you.

824
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:22,199
You were so cool just now.

825
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,800
That's my girlfriend.

826
00:32:24,479 --> 00:32:25,439
Do you know what I like

827
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:26,000
about you the most?

828
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,719
Your integrity. I like it so much.

829
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,239
Winning is winning and losing is losing.

830
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,319
This time I underestimated the opponent.

831
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,239
But I will find a chance

832
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:35,280
to revenge.

833
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,479
My goal was Luo Xiaoyi originally,

834
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,959
and now it seems like
I need to change the goal.

835
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,479
Shen Zhengyi? Who is she?

836
00:32:44,479 --> 00:32:45,560
When did she start skating?

837
00:32:46,239 --> 00:32:46,880
I have no idea.

838
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,239
It doesn't matter.

839
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,160
I will ask around for you.

840
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
How?

841
00:32:54,719 --> 00:32:55,719
You don't need to worry about it.

842
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,479
What's important is that

843
00:32:57,959 --> 00:32:58,479
there is a very delicious

844
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,640
restaurant that I know

845
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,760
and I've booked it.

846
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:01,719
You can go by yourself.

847
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,079
I have appointment with other people.

848
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:05,800
Wait.

849
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,800
Who? A guy or girl?

850
00:33:08,239 --> 00:33:09,079
Why didn't you tell me again?

851
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:11,160
Can I go with you

852
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:12,000
or...?

853
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:12,800
Li Mi,

854
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:14,040
I just lost the game.

855
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,280
I'm not in a good mood right now.

856
00:33:15,719 --> 00:33:17,000
Can you leave me alone?

857
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,280
Then I will pick you up
when you are done.

858
00:33:23,479 --> 00:33:24,239
Okay?

859
00:33:25,719 --> 00:33:26,640
I'll contact you by WeChat.

860
00:33:29,239 --> 00:33:30,079
Be careful then.

861
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:31,160
You need to miss me.

862
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,479
Remember to reply when I message you.

863
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:40,439
Li Mi, what are you doing here?

864
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,000
Busy.

865
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:42,800
Gotta go.

866
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,680
Go away.

867
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,719
I didn't expect Coach Zhuang

868
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,760
would do such thing today.

869
00:33:50,959 --> 00:33:51,719
So cool.

870
00:33:52,199 --> 00:33:53,640
That's how she is.

871
00:33:54,239 --> 00:33:55,439
Talking little while doing a lot.

872
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,560
She's not good at expressing herself.

873
00:33:57,239 --> 00:33:58,239
Actually, it's not the first time that

874
00:33:58,319 --> 00:33:59,479
she does something like that.

875
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,040
She helped Eunkyung Choi appeal,

876
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,000
but offended the judges

877
00:34:03,239 --> 00:34:04,000
so that she got banned from

878
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,400
coaching in professional teams.

879
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,040
Otherwise, based on her capability,

880
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,479
she wouldn't have come to

881
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,679
Wind Chaser.

882
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:11,479
But she still

883
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,719
helped you speak so much today.

884
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:13,879
So touching.

885
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:15,879
Why didn't I see Coach Xiao

886
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,239
after what has happened today?

887
00:34:17,479 --> 00:34:17,959
I have no idea.

888
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:18,719
I haven't seen him

889
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,520
after the game.

890
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:20,959
I saw him together

891
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,520
with Luo Xiaoyi.

892
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,280
Luo Xiaoyi was there?

893
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,439
If I was her,

894
00:34:25,479 --> 00:34:26,320
I would not dare to come.

895
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,639
After all, no one

896
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,239
is as important as

897
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:30,479
Luo Xiaoyi in Coach Xiao's heart.

898
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:31,760
Don't think too much.

899
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:32,760
Everyone has done a great job today.

900
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
You can go back first.

901
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:34,919
I will go buy juice for everyone.

902
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,080
Orange juice with 30% sugar.

903
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:38,560
Half sugar with no ice for me.

904
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:39,479
Water is fine for me.

905
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:40,479
Anything works for me.

906
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,560
Let's go.

907
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,800
Do you think that
she will remember correctly?

908
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,479
Hard to say.

909
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,280
Come in.

910
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,439
Coach Zhuang,

911
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,560
I bumped into two old friends

912
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:02,479
outside just now

913
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:03,320
and we had a talk.

914
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:04,560
It was lucky to have you there today.

915
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:06,040
Otherwise, they may cause trouble.

916
00:35:06,399 --> 00:35:07,239
They've become more cooperative

917
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,520
because of what happened.

918
00:35:08,959 --> 00:35:10,000
So it's a good thing.

919
00:35:10,919 --> 00:35:11,639
True.

920
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,199
Shen Zhengyi's performance today

921
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,080
was very surprising.

922
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:15,560
So I was thinking that

923
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:16,399
as soon as
the College Student Ice League is over,

924
00:35:16,479 --> 00:35:16,800
we can train her

925
00:35:16,959 --> 00:35:17,919
to increase endurance

926
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:19,479
and join 1500-meter game.

927
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:23,879
Is it okay to make her do both so soon?

928
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,360
Look,

929
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,080
Liu Sisi is already a senior

930
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:28,199
and she will retire soon.

931
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,199
Besides Zhu Lele,

932
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,040
the only person who can

933
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:30,919
do 1500 meters

934
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,199
is Wang Fang,

935
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:33,360
no one else.

936
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:37,080
In addition, Shen Zhengyi

937
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,199
has made obvious progress

938
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,320
ever since

939
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,919
she joined Wind Chaser.

940
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,560
I think that she has the potential.

941
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,879
For Ling Yun Cup later on,

942
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:44,879
let's have her

943
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,360
in the 1500-meter training.

944
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:49,560
The thing is that

945
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:51,719
letting her do both

946
00:35:51,919 --> 00:35:52,600
at this point

947
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:54,639
is a little pushing.

948
00:35:55,919 --> 00:35:56,919
Why?

949
00:35:57,679 --> 00:35:59,320
We all know her personality well.

950
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,919
She is too anxious.

951
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:02,360
She only focuses on winning the game.

952
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,879
For 1500-meter race,

953
00:36:03,959 --> 00:36:05,040
there are 27 curves in total.

954
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,080
With her current curve skills

955
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:06,679
and mindset,

956
00:36:06,959 --> 00:36:08,080
she has no advantage at all.

957
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:09,239
Do you know what I worry about

958
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,199
the most right now?

959
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:12,919
If she continues to act recklessly

960
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,959
in the final round,

961
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:17,080
she would get injured.

962
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:23,159
Why is the school

963
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,320
so big?

964
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,680
(Tai He Engineering University
bulletin board)

965
00:36:31,879 --> 00:36:32,919
How come is there

966
00:36:32,959 --> 00:36:34,080
no map on the campus?

967
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,639
Hey, Shao Beisheng,

968
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:48,560
have you ever been

969
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:49,719
to this school?

970
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,360
It's too big and I got lost.

971
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:52,719
How can you get lost

972
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,560
even on campus?

973
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,000
You never got lost during skating.

974
00:36:55,399 --> 00:36:56,080
Where are you now?

975
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,280
There's a bulletin board on my left

976
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:00,560
and a lake on my right.

977
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:02,719
There are also some ducks

978
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,840
or gooses, for which I'm not sure.

979
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:05,719
I see.

980
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:06,719
Wait there.

981
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,199
Okay. Hurry up.

982
00:37:22,879 --> 00:37:24,000
Shen Zhengyi,

983
00:37:25,919 --> 00:37:26,719
why are you here?

984
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,560
Hello,

985
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,719
you are from Flyer, right?

986
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:34,439
Shen Zhengyi.

987
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,679
Li Mi, what are you talking about?

988
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,199
I'm just asking her

989
00:37:41,479 --> 00:37:42,320
if she has a boyfriend.

990
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:45,679
It's me.

991
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,399
Alright?

992
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:48,760
If I didn't ask her,

993
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,840
you won't tell me forever, right?

994
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:50,760
Do you think that I'm like you

995
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,320
who only know showing off girlfriend?

996
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:53,560
We are really destined,

997
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,199
right?

998
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,479
We haven't even competed

999
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,040
and those two started first.

1000
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,399
Are you talking about Yu Bingling?

1001
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:02,040
Do we look like a match?

1002
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,959
Yes.

1003
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:10,320
I haven't introduced myself.

1004
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,239
Hi, I'm Li Mi.

1005
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,239
Hi.

1006
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,679
Hello, Shao Beisheng.

1007
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,199
Self-introduction? Leave him alone.

1008
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:17,959
He is not very smart.

1009
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:20,199
He was joking.

1010
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:20,679
Hold this for me.

1011
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,399
Hurry up. It's so heavy.

1012
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:23,120
Why did you buy so many cups of juice?

1013
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,199
For them.

1014
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:24,679
Give me one.

1015
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:25,760
Someone ordered that.

1016
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:26,760
Oh really?

1017
00:38:27,399 --> 00:38:27,959
Well...

1018
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:29,760
take this.

1019
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,040
Me?

1020
00:38:32,479 --> 00:38:33,479
You gave one to him but me.

1021
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:34,560
I will be mad.

1022
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,399
Is that OK?

1023
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,040
Well,

1024
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,560
bring this to Yu Bingling for me.

1025
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,560
I really want to thank her today.

1026
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:41,919
Gotta go.

1027
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,120
See you next time.

1028
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,800
You are really not giving it to me?

1029
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:48,520
It's not for me?

1030
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,840
Leave him alone.

1031
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,679
Isn't it for me by giving it to her?

1032
00:38:58,639 --> 00:38:59,320
It leaked.

1033
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,239
This way.

1034
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:16,199
Bingling.

1035
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:17,760
Luhan.

1036
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,199
Long time no see.

1037
00:39:19,919 --> 00:39:20,800
Why did you cut your hair?

1038
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:21,600
Do I look cool?

1039
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,800
Yes, you do. Have a seat.

1040
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,800
Have you lost weight?

1041
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,520
I've been training hard recently.

1042
00:39:26,479 --> 00:39:27,800
Order anything you want.

1043
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,520
I will treat you the meal today.

1044
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:33,600
You helped Zhengyi speak to the judges?

1045
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,639
I didn't expect that you would

1046
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,239
still speak for Wind Chaser
even though you have left it.

1047
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,679
I have no negative feeling
towards Wind Chaser.

1048
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,760
Besides,

1049
00:39:42,919 --> 00:39:43,840
it was Coach Zheng who

1050
00:39:43,919 --> 00:39:45,199
took me in Wind Chaser.

1051
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,199
I can't be where I am today

1052
00:39:46,399 --> 00:39:47,679
without him.

1053
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,360
Oh,

1054
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,199
why didn't Luo Xiaoyi

1055
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:51,679
join the College Student Ice League
this time?

1056
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:53,520
She

1057
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,360
quit before the competition.

1058
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:56,639
Coach Zhuang

1059
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,040
canceled her qualification directly.

1060
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,239
I was just about to ask you.

1061
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,479
Why would a coach in her level

1062
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:01,760
come to Wind Chaser?

1063
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,919
Director Zhang invited her here.

1064
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,639
Then what about Xiao Han?

1065
00:40:05,959 --> 00:40:06,800
Is he still a coach?

1066
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,360
Yes. But he doesn't have that
high level of authority.

1067
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:15,840
Then what is so special about

1068
00:40:15,959 --> 00:40:17,120
Zhuang Yue's training?

1069
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:18,360
Can you tell me about it?

1070
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,919
What's so special?

1071
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,639
She's extremely strict

1072
00:40:25,479 --> 00:40:26,639
and she pays special attention to

1073
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,399
the basic training and
team cooperation.

1074
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:29,919
Even since she comes here,

1075
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:30,679
everyone's record

1076
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,600
has improved,

1077
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,360
including mine.

1078
00:40:33,959 --> 00:40:35,120
No wonder she was the
coach of Eunkyung Choi.

1079
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:36,399
She does deserve it.

1080
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,639
Then what about that Shen Zhengyi?

1081
00:40:39,919 --> 00:40:40,959
Did she just join?

1082
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,520
Yes.

1083
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,919
And she has had no
professional training before.

1084
00:40:45,639 --> 00:40:46,919
But she's really been working hard.

1085
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:49,320
But I didn't expect...

1086
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,360
You didn't expect

1087
00:40:50,479 --> 00:40:51,360
that she would
win me today, right?

1088
00:40:51,919 --> 00:40:52,479
That's good.

1089
00:40:52,919 --> 00:40:53,399
It's been a while

1090
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,360
since I've encountered
such a strong opponent.

1091
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,120
At least she's better than Luo Xiaoyi.

1092
00:40:58,199 --> 00:40:59,520
It's just a qualifying round.

1093
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,120
That's it for this topic.

1094
00:41:02,679 --> 00:41:03,239
Let's order now.

1095
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,080
This tofu is very good.

1096
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,919
Waitress, order please.

1097
00:41:16,199 --> 00:41:16,840
Director.

1098
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,520
What time is it now?

1099
00:41:20,919 --> 00:41:21,919
Why did you just come back?

1100
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,840
I was treating a friend to meal.

1101
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:31,760
You even have such mood right now?

1102
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:32,800
Yu Bingling,

1103
00:41:32,959 --> 00:41:33,639
have you considered

1104
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,239
the standpoint and honor of

1105
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,320
Flyer today?

1106
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:37,639
What is wrong with you?

1107
00:41:38,959 --> 00:41:39,479
I don't think that

1108
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,760
I did anything wrong.

1109
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:41,800
Even if I win,

1110
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,800
I want to win

1111
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,360
completely and fairly.

1112
00:41:43,479 --> 00:41:44,239
What did I do wrong?

1113
00:41:44,399 --> 00:41:45,600
You want to win

1114
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:46,360
completely and fairly.

1115
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,239
But now Flyer has become

1116
00:41:47,479 --> 00:41:49,239
a joke to other people.

1117
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,320
Yu Bingling,

1118
00:41:51,399 --> 00:41:52,080
the ace player of Flyer

1119
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:53,760
tried to prove the innocence
for her previous team.

1120
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,120
Have you thought about

1121
00:41:55,239 --> 00:41:56,760
Flyer when you did that?

1122
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,679
Sorry, Director.

1123
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:00,800
I was a little too impulsive

1124
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:02,120
and didn't have any time
to consider that much.

1125
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,080
We have put a lot of efforts

1126
00:42:04,399 --> 00:42:05,520
just to train you.

1127
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,080
Do you understand how important
College Student Ice League means to us?

1128
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:08,479
Don't worry.

1129
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:10,120
I will get the champion back.

1130
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:12,679
You'd better do as what you've said.

1131
00:42:22,959 --> 00:42:23,919
(Now we are commentating on)

1132
00:42:24,399 --> 00:42:25,520
(Usmile 9th)

1133
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,199
(College Student Ice League.)

1134
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:28,840
(The next race)

1135
00:42:28,959 --> 00:42:30,120
(is the Men's Single Skating)

1136
00:42:30,199 --> 00:42:31,520
(between Flyer and Wind Chaser.)

1137
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,360
Li Mi!

1138
00:42:39,639 --> 00:42:40,919
He only performs regular moves?

1139
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,479
Is he holding it back?

1140
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:43,199
Aren't you his old best friend?

1141
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:43,800
Do you know anything?

1142
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,080
I'm from Wind Chaser after all.

1143
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,639
How could he tell me?

1144
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:53,600
(Quadruple Salchow)

1145
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:57,959
Look.

1146
00:42:58,159 --> 00:42:58,719
What did I say?

1147
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,239
Oh my god.

1148
00:43:00,399 --> 00:43:01,280
Li Mi has finished

1149
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,520
a Quadruple Salchow.
