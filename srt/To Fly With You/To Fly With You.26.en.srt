=Episode 26=

3
00:01:48,559 --> 00:01:49,919
Why are you standing there?

4
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,440
What happened?

5
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,760
Why are you crying?

6
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,440
Did anyone bully you?

7
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,040
Zhengyi,

8
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,160
Qu Zhi recruited the beauty queen of

9
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:08,160
Department of Literature
into the Drama Club.

10
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:11,479
Alright. Alright.
Stop crying. Stop crying.

11
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:12,559
I'm gonna take revenge for you!

12
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:13,880
Wait! Wait!

13
00:02:14,839 --> 00:02:15,399
What do you think?

14
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,479
Did my acting

15
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:17,360
get you?

16
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,039
What's the problem with you?

17
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,479
Why are you suddenly practicing acting?

18
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,639
I was so worried.

19
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,960
It's all because of Qu Zhi.

20
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,759
He said that there can
only be one heroine

21
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:28,960
and he found the

22
00:02:29,119 --> 00:02:30,360
beauty queen of the
Department of Literature

23
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,520
to replace me.

24
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:33,360
I will show him with my actions that

25
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,039
there's no way.

26
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,479
I will get the heroine of

27
00:02:35,559 --> 00:02:36,080
theater club and

28
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:37,399
also get my

29
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:38,520
boyfriend back.

30
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:39,360
Believe me.

31
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,479
Go for it.

32
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:43,759
But it is so hard.

33
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:45,839
Life is so hard.

34
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,160
Weren't you the one who always

35
00:02:47,279 --> 00:02:48,360
said that you wanted to break up?

36
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,960
Now you are regretting?

37
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,119
I'm already so doomed.

38
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,080
How can you laugh at me?

39
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,080
Qu Zhi needs to be
responsible for this too.

40
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,080
How can his mind be as narrow as

41
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:57,720
his eyes?

42
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:01,440
Zhengyi,

43
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,919
if you make Shao Beisheng

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,880
mad,

45
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,119
how would you comfort him?

46
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,759
Got it?

47
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,440
Isn't this the project
from previous semester?

48
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:45,320
I want to give it to Shen Zhengyi.

49
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,160
If I go to Russia,

50
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:50,039
it can remind her of me.

51
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:54,360
Then when she misses you,

52
00:03:54,679 --> 00:03:55,639
she will take a look at it

53
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,160
or eat one of its fruits?

54
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,559
You can just say that you are jealous.

55
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,559
Why would I be jealous?

56
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:04,240
If you are jealous,

57
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,000
you can give one to

58
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,839
Zhu Lele as well.

59
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,360
Why do I need it
when we already broke up?

60
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:13,320
I order you to get back together

61
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:15,320
with Zhu Lele within a week,

62
00:04:15,559 --> 00:04:15,960
so that Shen Zhengyi won't have

63
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:16,880
to keep worrying for you guys.

64
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,640
Understand?

65
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,519
None of your business.

66
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,860
(Bounce Factory)

67
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,320
President.

68
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,839
Here you are.

69
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,519
Curly Hair said
we would have membership training.

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,760
Where are the others?

71
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,200
It is membership training,

72
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,920
but we are divided into groups.

73
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:02,559
One group goes camping and
one group comes to Bounce Factory.

74
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,359
It is such a coincidence

75
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:04,920
that we are in a group.

76
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:09,839
Tell me the truth.

77
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,640
I bribed Curly Hair.

78
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,559
Since you have time for this,

79
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,160
I assume that you have
finished reading the script.

80
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,320
I'm almost done.

81
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,679
Let's set up a time as
soon as you finish.

82
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,200
Ye An is waiting.

83
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,040
Let's go inside.

84
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:39,920
I thought

85
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,920
you would not play with me.

86
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,279
Why wouldn't I since we
have bought the tickets.

87
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:46,079
Alright.

88
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,119
As long as you are happy,

89
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:48,359
we can play however you like today.

90
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:51,359
That would be hard.

91
00:05:56,799 --> 00:05:59,399
How is it this hard to comfort him?

Did you have a good time today?

00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,000
Kind of.

114
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,200
So you are not mad anymore?

115
00:07:58,959 --> 00:07:59,839
Nice weather today.

116
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:01,359
It's good for eliminating anger.

117
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,519
Since you are not mad,

118
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,160
can we repair

119
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,679
our relationship as well?

120
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:14,200
It's taboo to fix relationship today.

121
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,000
At least let's

122
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,320
add each other back

123
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,279
on WeChat.

124
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,440
Bye.

125
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,079
President.

126
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,440
What are you painting?

127
00:09:45,479 --> 00:09:46,440
You seem so focused.

128
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:48,200
Nothing.

129
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,520
You don't even cheer for me.

130
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,400
It's too late.

131
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,520
Give it to me.

132
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:06,239
You promised to be my model.

133
00:10:09,239 --> 00:10:10,000
Are you painting me?

134
00:10:10,599 --> 00:10:11,320
Are my legs this short?

135
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,599
Five-five body shape?

136
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,520
You don't know it yourself?

137
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm nine heads tall. Ok?

138
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,159
Since when have you started?

139
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,280
You've painted so many.

140
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,559
Recently.

141
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,880
You are going to Russia.

142
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,679
It will be too late if
I don't start early.

143
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,640
Don't be too optimistic.

144
00:10:35,359 --> 00:10:37,039
Maybe, Curry won't choose me tomorrow.

145
00:10:38,479 --> 00:10:39,960
Don't say such unlucky words.

146
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,719
I have a communication event

147
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,799
tomorrow with my team.

148
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:47,599
So I cannot take the day off.

149
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:49,359
It's okay.

150
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:51,520
You can take care of your own business.

151
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,239
I have something for you.

152
00:10:58,919 --> 00:10:59,599
What?

153
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:00,880
I wouldn't look.

154
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,239
(Go, Shao Beisheng!)
Here's a mascot.

155
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,799
You will get in for sure.

156
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,320
Did you paint it yourself?

157
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,640
I bought it.

158
00:11:17,239 --> 00:11:17,760
Let's go.

159
00:11:18,119 --> 00:11:18,880
I also prepared a mascot

160
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,599
for you.

161
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,479
What?

162
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,640
Follow me.

163
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:22,960
I will carry this for you.

164
00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:24,880
Come on.

165
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:25,760
What is it?

166
00:11:26,239 --> 00:11:27,200
You will find out by yourself.

167
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:38,320
You're back?

168
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:40,000
Don't talk to me.

169
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:40,880
Be careful. Be careful.

170
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,679
Be careful. Be careful.

171
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,559
Where did you get
this little tomato tree?

172
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,200
How is it?

173
00:11:49,479 --> 00:11:50,719
Shao Beisheng planted it for me.

174
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:52,520
Fan Fan.

175
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,719
No wonder he's from Biology Department.

176
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:54,880
He plants the fruits he eats.

177
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:55,640
When can you plant

178
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,479
one for me?

179
00:11:56,719 --> 00:11:57,320
Why?

180
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:58,599
Isn't this meant

181
00:11:58,679 --> 00:11:59,640
to be eaten?

182
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,359
Absolutely not.

183
00:12:00,479 --> 00:12:01,080
You know nothing but eating?

184
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:01,719
You can't eat this.

185
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:02,520
It's tomato that I eat,

186
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,400
not Shao Beisheng.

187
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,200
Why are you reacting so much?

188
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,039
No. No, you can't.

189
00:12:05,119 --> 00:12:05,760
Not a single one.

190
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,400
Not a half.

191
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,280
Go away.

192
00:12:07,599 --> 00:12:08,159
Just one.

193
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,359
It's okay. Fan Fan.

194
00:12:16,239 --> 00:12:17,760
This sister is lying.

195
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,479
She won't eat you.

196
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,080
If she eats you,

197
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,479
I won't let her go.

198
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,719
It's okay. Fan Fan.

199
00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:36,239
You will grow up healthily,

200
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,919
with cute and big eyes.

201
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:44,039
So loud. So loud.

202
00:12:52,359 --> 00:12:53,200
Morning, Ma.

203
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,520
Here you are.

204
00:12:55,119 --> 00:12:55,919
Get on.

205
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,440
Wait one second.

206
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,479
Wait for two people.

207
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,039
My cheerleaders.

208
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:03,880
Why are you two here?

209
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,599
You don't have training?

210
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:05,880
We want to cheer Beisheng up,

211
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,599
so that he won't be nervous.

212
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:07,440
Exactly.

213
00:13:07,719 --> 00:13:08,599
We need to meet your idol

214
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:09,880
and help you two take photos.

215
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,000
He's my bro.

216
00:13:11,719 --> 00:13:12,280
You can go.

217
00:13:12,599 --> 00:13:13,640
But don't talk too much. Just watch.

218
00:13:14,119 --> 00:13:14,599
Okay.

219
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,440
Let's go. Widen your horizon.

220
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:15,880
Sure. Sure.

221
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,880
Let's go.

222
00:13:17,599 --> 00:13:18,440
I will sit in the front.

223
00:13:33,359 --> 00:13:34,039
One second, everyone.

224
00:13:34,359 --> 00:13:35,239
Mr. Curry will be here in a moment.

225
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:36,280
Okay. Okay.

226
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,320
Thank you.

227
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,159
Don't be nervous.

228
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,080
I'm not.

229
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,919
Okay. I was wrong.

230
00:13:48,479 --> 00:13:49,159
I'm telling you.

231
00:13:49,359 --> 00:13:50,039
Today it would be the last stop

232
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:51,119
for Curry to be in China.

233
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,440
Maybe he can decide right after

234
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,119
watching your performance.

235
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,320
Do your best.

236
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,559
How is it? How is the ice?

237
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,400
Pretty good, Ma.

238
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:00,799
No need to pour more.

239
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,239
Okay. Just to make sure there
won't be any accident.

240
00:14:08,119 --> 00:14:09,239
Where shall we sit and watch?

241
00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:10,239
Don't be nervous.

242
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:11,880
Coming. Coming.

243
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,880
Eunkyung Choi is coming.

244
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:30,919
Nice to meet you.

245
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:31,719
Nice to meet you.

246
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,719
Welcome to Wind Chaser.

247
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,119
I'm Zhang Runhao.

248
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,400
Help me introduce.

249
00:14:36,599 --> 00:14:39,880
He is the leader, and his
last name is Zhang.

250
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,559
Let me introduce.

251
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,960
This is our Coach Zhuang

252
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:42,880
and Coach Xiao.

253
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,640
They are Coach Zhuang and Coach Xiao.

254
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:45,559
Welcome.

255
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:46,400
Thank you.

256
00:14:47,479 --> 00:14:48,239
Hello.

257
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:50,919
Choi.

258
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,750
(Eunkyung Choi)
(Champion of short track speed skating)

259
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,239
It's been a long time, Coach Zhuang.

260
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,479
Welcome.

261
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,200
This way, please.

262
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,159
Here's the situation.

263
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:54,359
Eunkyung Choi.

264
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:57,359
Coach Xiao.

265
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,400
This way, please

266
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,359
Gather, everyone.

267
00:16:07,119 --> 00:16:07,960
Eunkyung Choi.

268
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,479
Everyone, please welcome

269
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,760
Eunkyung Choi's team

270
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:14,679
who come here

271
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,280
to visit us today.

272
00:16:22,239 --> 00:16:23,280
This is the

273
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,960
Short Track Speed Skating Team
of Wind Chaser.

274
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,919
We will continue to visit the

275
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,280
equipment and facility.

276
00:16:30,119 --> 00:16:32,119
Later, we will have a

277
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:33,919
communication event with athletes

278
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,119
in the meeting room.

279
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:37,200
Director,

280
00:16:37,719 --> 00:16:38,880
I will go to prepare the
meeting room first.

281
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,760
Okay.

282
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:42,039
This way, please.

283
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,200
Why is she leaving?

284
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,200
Coach Zhuang.

285
00:16:55,479 --> 00:16:56,400
Haven't you heard that

286
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,119
Eunkyung Choi had some

287
00:16:58,239 --> 00:16:59,119
unpleasant issues and

288
00:16:59,200 --> 00:16:59,799
they had a falling-out?

289
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:00,640
Why do they look

290
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:01,599
like nothing happened?

291
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,239
Once a teacher, always a father.

292
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,560
They've fought together for
that many years after all.

293
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,599
What would destroy their relationship?

294
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,800
It's been a long time.

295
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,160
Don't you have anything to say to me?

296
00:17:13,479 --> 00:17:14,400
You look great.

297
00:17:14,719 --> 00:17:15,479
That's good.

298
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,239
I know that you are
coaching Wind Chaser.

299
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,920
I come back to visit you this time.

300
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,520
You don't have to.

301
00:17:22,479 --> 00:17:23,400
You should spend that time on

302
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,040
preparing for the Asian Cup.

303
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:27,839
I know.

304
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:28,359
We had some

305
00:17:28,479 --> 00:17:29,400
unpleasant moments before.

306
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,520
But the past belongs to the past, right?

307
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:32,640
You are still the most important

308
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,640
person to me.

309
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:34,880
There must be something else

310
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,959
you want to tell me besides those.

311
00:17:37,719 --> 00:17:38,520
Do you plan to stay at Wind Chaser

312
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,439
as a coach?

313
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,520
What do you mean?

314
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:42,119
I want to invite you back.

315
00:17:42,239 --> 00:17:43,199
I'm willing to apply to the club and

316
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,560
ask for you to be my coach.

317
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:46,239
We can work together like before.

318
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,239
I don't plan to leave here.

319
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,040
You can find someone else

320
00:17:50,479 --> 00:17:51,880
if you need a coach.

321
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:53,160
Why?

322
00:17:53,719 --> 00:17:54,439
Wind Chaser

323
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,400
is such a low-level team.

324
00:17:55,479 --> 00:17:56,359
Even if it gets in Asian Cup,

325
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,280
it's only a supporting role.

326
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,680
What do you mean by supporting role?

327
00:18:00,239 --> 00:18:00,839
No one had expectation on you

328
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:02,040
when you got in Asian Cup

329
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,599
for the first time.

330
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:05,760
Do you think that you can

331
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:07,079
develop a second me at Wind Chaser?

332
00:18:07,479 --> 00:18:08,800
Anyone with talents who wants to

333
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:10,839
endeavor and loves skating

334
00:18:11,199 --> 00:18:12,040
would definitely achieve

335
00:18:12,199 --> 00:18:13,439
the wanted results.

336
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:15,800
I'd like to help such a person.

337
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:16,800
Who are you talking about?

338
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,479
Luo Xiaoyi?

339
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:20,479
You will see in Asian Cup.

340
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,880
I would like to meet her now.

341
00:18:23,719 --> 00:18:24,239
Coach Xiao,

342
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,400
let all go to

343
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,359
the meeting room now.

344
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,760
Wait a second.

345
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:37,760
Director Zhang,

346
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,599
I have a suggestion.

347
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:42,239
Since we are here to

348
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:43,640
share experience with Wind Chaser,

349
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,359
and since we are all athletes,

350
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,199
it's not fun to just talk about it.

351
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,719
How about skating around?

352
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,920
We are not prepared.

353
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:54,199
I think this suggestion

354
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:54,800
is inappropriate.

355
00:18:58,479 --> 00:18:59,359
Athletes

356
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:00,319
should never

357
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,520
be unprepared。

358
00:19:05,239 --> 00:19:06,000
The unprepared one

359
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,680
doesn't deserve to be an athlete.

360
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,640
Eunkyung Choi.

361
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,199
Coach Zhuang.

362
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,119
Wind Chaser's team members

363
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:15,400
have the confidence and capability

364
00:19:15,479 --> 00:19:16,400
to have a race. Right?

365
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,800
How would you like to do it?

366
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,280
Very simple.

367
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,160
Wind Chaser picks the most

368
00:19:28,239 --> 00:19:29,040
capable athlete

369
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:31,520
to race with me for 7 laps.

370
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,319
What does she mean?

371
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:39,800
Luo Xiaoyi,

372
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,439
can you do it?

373
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,839
I... Can I do it?

374
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:03,119
Although I'm not the best.

375
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:04,880
Zhengyi,

376
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:06,160
don't.

377
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,520
Why? It's such a good chance.

378
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,880
Coach Zhuang,

379
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:10,640
does she deserve?

380
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,280
I forgot to introduce her.

381
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,119
Her name is Shen Zhengyi,

382
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:14,640
the champion of

383
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,640
1500m of Ling Yun Cup.

384
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,439
It's me.

385
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,640
Okay. You, then.

386
00:20:28,439 --> 00:20:29,280
See you on ice.

387
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,680
See you on ice.

388
00:20:37,479 --> 00:20:38,880
(Chasing Race Basic Rules)
Chasing race. 2 racers in each group.

389
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,599
Each racer will skate for 7 laps,

390
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:41,560
starting from the starting line

391
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,920
and the finish line
of the race course respectively.

392
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,119
No tactics, nor cooperation,

393
00:20:44,199 --> 00:20:44,920
nor contact.

394
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,359
It's only speed that

395
00:20:46,439 --> 00:20:47,239
the racers will race about.

396
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:49,160
Whoever uses the
shortest time will win.

397
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:51,400
7-circle chasing race is the

398
00:20:51,479 --> 00:20:52,560
best race for testing athletes'
personal capability

399
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,640
and

400
00:20:55,199 --> 00:20:56,719
increasing absolute speed.

401
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,079
Isn't it my strength?

402
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,839
This is also Eunkyung Choi's strength.

403
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,479
Otherwise, why would she

404
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,400
be called single wolf in the team?

405
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:08,479
She doesn't like to
cooperate with others.

406
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,439
She always believes that

407
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,760
personal capability is the most

408
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,040
important thing.

409
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,119
Then do you think that

410
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,199
I can win?

411
00:21:17,439 --> 00:21:18,400
Just do as how you always do.

412
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:21,400
Zhengyi, don't be pressured.

413
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,280
It's a good chance to

414
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,479
compete with strong rival.

415
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,359
You will grow,

416
00:21:24,439 --> 00:21:25,439
whether you win or lose.

417
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,800
So you don't need to think
about anything.

418
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,560
Just race at your fastest speed.

419
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,160
Eunkyung Choi is the one who

420
00:21:31,239 --> 00:21:31,839
would feel more pressured.

421
00:21:32,199 --> 00:21:33,119
You don't need to worry about anything.

422
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,599
As long as

423
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,520
you are not trapped, it will be okay.

424
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:41,880
I won't.

425
00:21:43,239 --> 00:21:44,439
Since I've answered the call,

426
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,000
I will do my best

427
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,959
and try to not lose
face for Wind Chaser.

428
00:21:48,199 --> 00:21:48,800
Exactly.

429
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:50,040
You make Wind Chaser proud

430
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:52,119
already by answering the call.

431
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,479
Go for it.

432
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:06,980
(Curry)
(Legend of Russian figure skating)

433
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,479
Bag. Take the bag for him.

434
00:22:19,479 --> 00:22:20,959
What are you doing? Go.

435
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:29,239
Hi, Curry.

436
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,400
I'm Shao Beisheng from Wind Chaser.

437
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,760
Nice to meet you.

438
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,160
I've seen your videos.

439
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,479
They're impressive.

440
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,839
Thank you. It's my honor.

441
00:22:39,239 --> 00:22:39,920
And I promise

442
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:40,959
you won't be

443
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:41,959
disappointed today.

444
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,199
And these are my teammate

445
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:46,800
and my coach, Mr. Ma.

446
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,000
Hello.

447
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:49,920
Hello, Mr. Curry.

448
00:22:50,439 --> 00:22:52,719
You are our idol.

449
00:22:53,959 --> 00:22:54,800
Nice to meet you.

450
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,119
I like you so much.

451
00:22:59,119 --> 00:22:59,760
Thank you.

452
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,359
Alright.

453
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:02,800
Shall we begin?

454
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:03,959
Yeah.

455
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:04,880
Let's see

456
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,839
what you got.

457
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:06,760
Okay.

458
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:08,280
I'm not nervous. I'm not nervous.

459
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,680
I'm not nervous.

460
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,479
I'm not nervous at all.

461
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,119
I'm not nervous. I'm not nervous.

462
00:23:14,239 --> 00:23:14,920
Zhengyi.

463
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,959
- Zhengyi.
- Zhengyi.

464
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:17,920
Shen Zhengyi.

465
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:18,920
I'm telling you.

466
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:19,920
Don't be nervous.

467
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,479
It's not embarrassing
to lose to Eunkyung Choi.

468
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,680
How is it not embarrassing?

469
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,800
It will lose face for Coach Zhuang.

470
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,119
Good luck. Good luck.

471
00:23:25,199 --> 00:23:25,800
Shen Zhengyi, go.

472
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,880
Go, Zhengyi.

473
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:28,800
Don't be nervous.

474
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,439
Go ahead. You will do well.

475
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:32,800
I'm not nervous.

476
00:23:34,199 --> 00:23:34,839
Zhengyi.

477
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:35,959
Forget the rival.

478
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,239
Just compete with yourself.

479
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,319
You've skated by yourself

480
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,239
for that many years.

481
00:23:39,479 --> 00:23:40,479
Just follow that feeling and skate.

482
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:41,920
Understand?

483
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,479
Yes.

484
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:46,959
It's almost the time.

485
00:23:49,439 --> 00:23:51,119
- She is coming.
- She is coming.

486
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,520
You're doing well.

487
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,359
Don't worry.

488
00:24:01,479 --> 00:24:02,479
Calm down.

489
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
You're doing great.

490
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:07,170
Good for you.

491
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,000
Say hi to everyone.

492
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,040
Call me if you need me.

493
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,030
(Brave and Fearless)

494
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,400
Ready?

495
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,239
Get on ice.

496
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,770
(Quadruple Toe Loop Jump)

497
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:10,000
Nice.

498
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,040
Quadruple Toe Loop Jump.

499
00:25:16,199 --> 00:25:17,479
She's so talented.

500
00:25:32,959 --> 00:25:33,479
Perfect.

501
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:55,079
Well done.

502
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,160
Thank you.

503
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:57,599
That was the best

504
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:58,599
ever since I've been here.

505
00:26:00,199 --> 00:26:00,959
He's speaking highly of him.

506
00:26:01,239 --> 00:26:02,079
He said that he did it well.

507
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,319
I always take you as my role model.

508
00:26:05,199 --> 00:26:05,959
It's my honor

509
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:06,880
to have your guidance.

510
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,319
Thank you.

511
00:26:10,719 --> 00:26:12,119
When is the girl getting here?

512
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,040
She has arrived.

513
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:17,959
What... what does he mean?

514
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,479
He said that there was another person.

515
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,760
Isn't that Xiao Qing?

516
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:34,839
Why is she here?

517
00:26:35,479 --> 00:26:36,319
I have no idea.

518
00:26:41,479 --> 00:26:42,560
Sorry, I'm late.

519
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,520
Mr. Curry, I'm Xiao Qing.

520
00:26:44,959 --> 00:26:46,319
I sent you that email.

521
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:47,479
Alright. We're waiting.

522
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,520
Let's get started.

523
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,319
Okay.

524
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:53,599
I thought that Curry

525
00:26:53,719 --> 00:26:54,800
does not accept female student.

526
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,319
I'm glad to be racing

527
00:27:23,439 --> 00:27:24,520
with you.

528
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,119
You can get down

529
00:27:27,719 --> 00:27:28,959
if you don't want to be a huge loser.

530
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,199
Watch carefully.

531
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,920
She is your biggest rival.

532
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,959
How would you know if you don't try?

533
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,520
Okay.

534
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,000
Then show me

535
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:52,920
all you've got.

536
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,479
Let me see what Zhuang Yue
has taught you.

537
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,599
Good luck.

538
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:02,560
You too.

539
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:14,800
(Shen Zhengyi, don't be afraid of her.)

540
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,599
(Zhengyi.)

541
00:28:17,199 --> 00:28:18,560
(It's a little early for you)

542
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,959
(to directly race with)

543
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:21,119
(Eunkyung Choi at this stage.)

544
00:28:21,479 --> 00:28:22,239
(But I believe that)

545
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,479
(challenging yourself)

546
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,239
(is what makes you so strong.)

547
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,760
Ready.

548
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:55,599
Where is she?

549
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:01,119
Go, Zhengyi.

550
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:02,479
Go, Zhengyi.

551
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,760
How is this happening?

552
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,640
- Go!
- Go!

553
00:29:49,959 --> 00:29:50,520
She's so aggressive.

554
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:51,319
She already got her

555
00:29:51,479 --> 00:29:52,359
but she doesn't allow any room for her.

556
00:29:52,719 --> 00:29:53,839
Why is she so aggressive?

557
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:55,160
Apparently, Eunkyung Choi wants

558
00:29:55,239 --> 00:29:56,199
to embarrass Wind Chaser.

559
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,119
Zhengyi shouldn't have
answered the call.

560
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,239
Shen Zhengyi.

561
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,719
Shen Zhengyi, hold on!

562
00:30:23,719 --> 00:30:26,439
- Shen Zhengyi.
- Shen Zhengyi!

563
00:30:26,439 --> 00:30:27,520
Keep going!

564
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:35,719
- Shen Zhengyi, keep going!
- Shen Zhengyi, keep going!

565
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,599
- Go!
- Go!

566
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,800
(So this is how being
surpassed feels like.)

567
00:30:46,239 --> 00:30:47,880
(So hopeless because of her
overwhelming capability.)

568
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:48,959
(No matter how much I try,)

569
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,239
(I cannot catch her.)

570
00:31:11,199 --> 00:31:19,119
- Shen Zhengyi, keep going!
- Shen Zhengyi, keep going!

571
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,719
Shen Zhengyi, go!

572
00:31:24,959 --> 00:31:26,359
Shen Zhengyi, go!

573
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:39,839
- Shen Zhengyi, go!
- Shen Zhengyi, go!

574
00:31:42,239 --> 00:31:43,119
Shen Zhengyi.

575
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,800
Follow your own pace.

576
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,479
Don't panic.

577
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,000
Coach Zhuang,

578
00:32:34,959 --> 00:32:35,640
I've seen the

579
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,520
capability of Wind Chaser.

580
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,199
Are you sure that you want to

581
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,839
keep wasting time and effort on them?

582
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:44,319
Nice job.

583
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,680
Keep it.

584
00:32:47,479 --> 00:32:49,359
Get prepared and continue
with the training.

585
00:33:05,439 --> 00:33:06,959
This music sounds so familiar.

586
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,319
Has Curry used it before?

587
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,160
The movement seems familiar too.

588
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:20,160
This is the performance that

589
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:21,199
Curry did in the World Cup.

590
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:24,319
Wait. How can Xiao Qing complete

591
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,319
such difficult movements?

592
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:11,760
Triple Axel!

593
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,760
When did she practice it?

594
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:14,679
She cannot make it

595
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,800
in such short period of time.

596
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,360
I have lunch

597
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,360
at this story at 12.

598
00:35:20,959 --> 00:35:21,959
I want to make sure that

599
00:35:21,959 --> 00:35:23,639
we've spoken this to Lea.

600
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:24,320
Mr. Curry.

601
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,120
Mr. Curry.

602
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,320
Can we have a talk? Just for a while.

603
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:30,840
I'm sorry.

604
00:35:30,959 --> 00:35:31,719
I've made my decision.

605
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:33,320
There is only one spot available

606
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,199
and I gave it to Xiao Qing.

607
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:36,520
Yeah, I know.

608
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,320
She's excellent today,

609
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,840
and I respect your decision.

610
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,840
But

611
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:43,560
can you just give me a reason?

612
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,760
Why you chose her, but not me?

613
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,520
It's really important to me.

614
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,600
Beisheng,

615
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:52,199
you're a good

616
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:52,919
skater.

617
00:35:53,479 --> 00:35:54,639
But I've made my decision.

618
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,320
I'm sorry.

619
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,520
Good luck.

620
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,199
Shao Beisheng.

621
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,520
I never expected that

622
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,959
one day we would become rivals.

623
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:21,959
Congratulations.

624
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:23,840
Sorry about it.

625
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,639
I took the

626
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:26,719
only one spot.

627
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:28,719
Hope that you won't hate me.

628
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:31,840
You earned it

629
00:36:31,879 --> 00:36:32,760
with your

630
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,800
capability.

631
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:38,120
Anyway, congratulations on
coming back to the course.

632
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:51,840
(Coach Zhuang,)

633
00:36:51,879 --> 00:36:52,840
(please share your thoughts)

634
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:53,760
(about the race today.)

635
00:36:53,919 --> 00:36:54,560
(There's not much time)

636
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,479
(left before the Asian Cup.)

637
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,199
(Do you think that)

638
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:56,919
(Wind Chaser can)

639
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:57,760
(win the medal)

640
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,679
(in the Asian Cup?)

641
00:36:58,919 --> 00:36:59,320
(Coach Zhuang,)

642
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:00,719
(both Eunkyung Choi and Shen Zhengyi)

643
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,560
(are your students.)

644
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:02,919
(Do you think that)

645
00:37:02,919 --> 00:37:04,199
(Shen Zhengyi is less)

646
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,679
(capable than Eunkyung Choi,)

647
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,719
(or your coaching skills)

648
00:37:06,879 --> 00:37:07,719
(has decreased?)

649
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,280
(Zhuang Yue Chief Coach of Wind Chaser)
(Shen Zhengyi is a new athlete,)

650
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,560
(Sports News)
(and she just joined the team.)

651
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,760
(It takes time for)

652
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,840
(an athlete to grow.)

653
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,280
(Hope you can all give her some time.)

654
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:17,760
(As for me,)

655
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,760
(I will do my best to help her.)

656
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,919
(Eunkyung Choi, please
share your comment.)

657
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,120
(As for your rival today,)

658
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,199
(Shen Zhengyi,)

659
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,679
(would you like to race with her again)

660
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,840
(during the Asian Cup?)

661
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,399
(First,)

662
00:37:32,479 --> 00:37:32,840
(I believe that)

663
00:37:32,919 --> 00:37:34,120
(she's a very talented athlete.)

664
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,679
(It must be hard)

665
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:36,280
(for Coach Zhuang to)

666
00:37:36,479 --> 00:37:37,280
(train her within)

667
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,679
(such short period of time.)

668
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,280
(But with her current skills,)

669
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:41,760
(it is impossible for)

670
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:43,120
(her to enter the Asian Cup.)

671
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,199
(I hope that Coach Zhuang…)

672
00:37:49,919 --> 00:37:50,919
It's just a one-time winning.

673
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:52,840
Never mind.

674
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:55,840
I've watched her videos

675
00:37:55,919 --> 00:37:57,000
a lot before and

676
00:37:57,399 --> 00:37:59,040
I know that she's fast.

677
00:38:00,399 --> 00:38:02,040
But today I realized

678
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,479
how big our difference is

679
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:04,479
after racing

680
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,560
with her.

681
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,840
It was impossible for me to catch her.

682
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,479
I don't even see any

683
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,679
hope in it.

684
00:38:11,479 --> 00:38:12,280
Zhengyi,

685
00:38:14,399 --> 00:38:15,199
this is your biggest

686
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,639
learning today.

687
00:38:17,479 --> 00:38:18,840
If you don't try for yourself,

688
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,479
you would not know her real

689
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:21,840
capability no matter how other
people describe it to you,

690
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,560
neither will you feel anything.

691
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,560
Coach Zhuang,

692
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,560
is it possible for me to
be as fast as she is?

693
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,280
I know that it might be a little

694
00:38:33,399 --> 00:38:34,479
over-confident for me to say this,

695
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,479
but I can at least

696
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,399
think of it as a goal.

697
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,199
If I say that I think you can,

698
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,199
and it won't be long
until you can make it,

699
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,280
would you believe it?

700
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:46,479
Then is there any hope for us

701
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,679
to enter the Asian Cup?

702
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,560
Zhengyi,

703
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,399
do you know what's the
most attractive thing

704
00:38:52,479 --> 00:38:53,760
about short track speed skating?

705
00:38:56,479 --> 00:38:57,560
Um...

706
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,399
If you want to succeed,

707
00:39:00,479 --> 00:39:02,159
personal capability is just one factor.

708
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,879
Strategic collaboration will

709
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,159
make the whole race

710
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,879
challenging.

711
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,000
If you want to win Eunkyung Choi,

712
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,000
it is not impossible.

713
00:39:10,479 --> 00:39:11,600
As long as you keep working
hard towards the goal,

714
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:12,439
you will make it.

715
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,439
Believe in yourself.

716
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,320
Take a hot shower

717
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:20,439
and go back to rest.

718
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:22,679
Okay. Thank you, coach Zhuang.

719
00:39:27,879 --> 00:39:28,840
Coach Zhuang.

720
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,159
If you ask me,

721
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:13,199
it's not that bad to stay here.

722
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:15,639
It's so cold in Russia.
Why would you have to go?

723
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:18,600
I just want to know

724
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:19,879
why I lost to her.

725
00:40:23,479 --> 00:40:25,479
Tell me the truth, Ma.

726
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,080
Let me tell you.

727
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,479
When coaches select athletes,

728
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:31,080
he will see where the limitation

729
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:32,000
of their potential lies.

730
00:40:32,919 --> 00:40:34,280
Seeing how Xiao Qing performed today,

731
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,040
I can tell you

732
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:35,719
for sure that,

733
00:40:36,479 --> 00:40:37,320
it is very rare

734
00:40:37,439 --> 00:40:38,199
for a female single skater

735
00:40:38,879 --> 00:40:39,600
to finish

736
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,040
such perfect

737
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,439
triple axel.

738
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:44,560
Of course,

739
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,560
you performed really well too today.

740
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:47,479
I think Curry was very satisfied
with your performance.

741
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:48,879
But I think that

742
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:49,760
the thing he concerns about the most

743
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,040
is how far you can go.

744
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,479
So he is suspecting

745
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,719
my potential?

746
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,560
Look at your height and weight.

747
00:41:01,479 --> 00:41:02,919
You switched to single
skating from pair skating,

748
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,479
and it's already a miracle

749
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,479
for you to finish triple axel

750
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,719
and quadruple jump like this.

751
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:08,600
As for what Curry

752
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:09,719
worries about the most,

753
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,280
I assume that he might think

754
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,320
that this is your limitation.

755
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,479
So you already knew

756
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,479
the result would be like this.

757
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,360
Of course I don't think

758
00:41:17,479 --> 00:41:18,479
that this is your limitation.

759
00:41:18,919 --> 00:41:19,479
I was certain that

760
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,800
Curry will take you.

761
00:41:21,919 --> 00:41:22,600
He is a master

762
00:41:22,919 --> 00:41:23,600
after all.

763
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:24,879
So I thought that he would

764
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,040
be good at evaluating people.

765
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:28,280
But it seems that he's
not so good at it.

766
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:29,639
Ma.

767
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,719
Beisheng,

768
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:32,879
as far as I'm concerned.

769
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,040
Anyone who went

770
00:41:34,439 --> 00:41:35,280
through what you did,

771
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,360
would only be able to go this far.

772
00:41:37,479 --> 00:41:38,159
But who are you?

773
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:40,439
You are Shao Beisheng.

774
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,159
You are Shao Beisheng from Wind Chaser,

775
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:43,479
the Shao Beisheng that I trained.

776
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,719
Curry doesn't know you well,

777
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,040
but I do.

778
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:49,080
Okay.

779
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,439
How can Curry complete

780
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,679
Triple Axel

781
00:41:52,959 --> 00:41:53,679
and Quadruple Salchow

782
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,679
so perfectly?

783
00:41:55,919 --> 00:41:57,120
The foreigners have superb
physical capabilities,

784
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,239
and can jump high.

785
00:41:58,479 --> 00:41:59,679
I won't be easily persuaded.

786
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:01,280
It's just two movements.
Keep practicing yourself.

787
00:42:01,399 --> 00:42:02,199
Every day!

788
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,399
You can outperform him

789
00:42:04,479 --> 00:42:05,479
as long as you jump high and far enough.

790
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,800
Right?

791
00:42:08,399 --> 00:42:08,959
Stop thinking about it.

792
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,280
Concentrate yourself

793
00:42:10,399 --> 00:42:11,120
on the present.

794
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,800
The Asian Cup is coming.

795
00:42:13,399 --> 00:42:14,199
Let's get a good result

796
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:15,239
and prove yourself to them.
