=To Fly With You=

00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,990
=Episode 16=

3
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,239
Here we go.

4
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,480
Let's go, 1, 2, 1.

5
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:44,360
Big stage.

6
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,440
No. You come down.

7
00:01:49,639 --> 00:01:50,199
Listen,

8
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,120
if you do like this... Listen.

9
00:01:51,199 --> 00:01:53,919
Little tiger, little tiger,

10
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,800
run so fast, run so fast.

11
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,599
One has no eyes.

12
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,919
One has no tail.

13
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:00,879
Very weird.

14
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:01,559
Come down. Hurry up!

15
00:02:01,639 --> 00:02:02,120
So humiliating!

16
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,400
So humiliating, come down.

17
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,680
Come down.

18
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,800
You will be photographed tomorrow.

19
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:06,239
I am telling you...

20
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:07,400
Slow down.

21
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:08,960
How was my singing?

22
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,559
You weren't

23
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,039
allowed to drink anymore,

24
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:11,440
but you insisted to drink.

25
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,559
If I don't drink,

26
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:13,919
I have to kiss you.

27
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,880
Do you want me to kiss you?

28
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,240
I don't want to do so even if you want.

29
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,399
I have to preserve my integrity.

30
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,279
Therefore,

31
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,639
let's stop pretending
to be a couple.

32
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,479
You just don't listen to me.

33
00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:37,759
Shen Zhengyi.

34
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,479
To be honest,

35
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:45,679
have you had a crush on
me for a long time?

36
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:48,800
After getting drunk,

37
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,039
you still be a narcissist.

38
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,360
Don't interrupt me.

39
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,199
If...

40
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,800
If I really kiss you,

41
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,559
will you get angry?

42
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,960
I guess I was acting in self-defense.

43
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,839
Shao Beisheng.

44
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:56,399
Are you alive?

45
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,559
I kissed you.

46
00:04:17,119 --> 00:04:19,079
Get up!

47
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,640
Okay, next.

48
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,119
Let's go!

49
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,040
No.

50
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,359
Get up now. Hurry up!

51
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,799
Get up!

52
00:04:35,119 --> 00:04:36,239
1, 2, 3.

53
00:04:42,359 --> 00:04:43,359
Okay.

54
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:44,839
Let's go!

55
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,839
Hurry up.

56
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,040
Shen Zhengyi, get up!

57
00:05:04,799 --> 00:05:05,399
Oh my goodness.

58
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,640
Hasn't she been back to bed all night?

59
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:11,760
Oh my goodness.

60
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,760
Why is her phone off?

61
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,160
Oh, no!

62
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:18,320
Something happened.

63
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,480
What are you doing?

64
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,239
What are you doing?

65
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:32,880
Why are you

66
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,079
sleeping in my room?

67
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:37,760
I was so sleepy last night,

68
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:38,920
so I probably fell asleep.

69
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,679
How do you explain this?

70
00:05:41,679 --> 00:05:42,279
Shen Zhengyi.

71
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,880
What did you do to me

72
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,640
when I was drunk?

73
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:49,480
Slow down.

74
00:05:53,679 --> 00:05:54,600
If you are alright,
then I'll just leave.

75
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,160
I'm alright.

76
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,320
But,

77
00:06:02,119 --> 00:06:02,959
I want to puke.

78
00:06:03,239 --> 00:06:04,320
Slow down.

79
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:08,200
You can puke now.

80
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:09,559
I cannot.

81
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,519
If you cannot, then don't puke.

82
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,399
Get up!

83
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,600
We've won!

84
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,640
We are the champion!

85
00:06:20,119 --> 00:06:21,239
I've been practicing for so long.

86
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:22,600
The champion of team competition.

87
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:25,399
The first gold medal
of team competition.

88
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,720
But my score was so low.

89
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:31,559
I got the lowest score.

90
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,640
I have to practice.

91
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:36,440
I practice off the ice.

92
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,079
Push off the ice.

93
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:44,079
Shao Beisheng, you're so funny.

94
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,320
It's not important.

95
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:50,000
Go on!

96
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:50,640
And what's the next?

97
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:51,440
What are you doing?

98
00:06:51,559 --> 00:06:52,200
Bend down to the curve.

99
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:53,720
How do you feel now?

100
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,720
No, don't take off the clothes.

101
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:56,920
Shao Beisheng,

102
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:57,799
don't take off clothes.

103
00:06:59,239 --> 00:06:59,799
You can practice now.

104
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,559
I'll get you a belt.

105
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,640
Here.

106
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,600
Athlete, athlete.

107
00:07:05,119 --> 00:07:06,119
I am an athlete.

108
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,640
Shen Zhengyi.

109
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:09,519
Okay.

110
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:10,839
Just practice.

111
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:11,799
Let's start practicing.

112
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,640
Push off the ice, ready, start!

113
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:20,559
I take a rest.

114
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,359
Focus the force on one point.

115
00:07:22,799 --> 00:07:24,799
Right. Push off the ice for both sides.

116
00:07:25,239 --> 00:07:26,440
Speed up.

117
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:27,839
Come on. Fighting!

118
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,000
Push off the ice.

119
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,160
The force of each step

120
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,399
has to be accurate...

121
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,640
accurate.

122
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:46,760
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2.

123
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:48,079
Okay.

124
00:07:48,239 --> 00:07:50,239
I am fortunate to keep the
evidence in advance.

125
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:51,279
That is from all aspects.

126
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:52,600
Shen Zhengyi.

127
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,079
You filmed me after I got drunk?

128
00:07:54,799 --> 00:07:55,920
Let me show you something really funny.

129
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,799
You...

130
00:07:57,559 --> 00:07:58,200
My phone has run out of power.

131
00:07:58,559 --> 00:07:59,239
Wait.

132
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,559
What time is it?

133
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,119
How do I know?

134
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,440
Oh, no.

135
00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:05,559
It's too late.

136
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,760
Shen Zhengyi, you...

137
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:15,160
Let's have breakfast.

138
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:15,679
Come back.

139
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,079
Wang Jun.

140
00:08:17,239 --> 00:08:18,200
It's not what you think.

141
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:18,920
I didn't hear you.

142
00:08:19,239 --> 00:08:20,000
Well, Zhengyi...

143
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,760
Lele is looking for you,

144
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:21,359
but she couldn't find you.

145
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:23,880
I am leaving.

146
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,359
Shen Zhengyi. She...

147
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:31,959
How did you hurt?

148
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,919
It's really tight.

149
00:08:45,719 --> 00:08:46,359
Let's have breakfast.

150
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:48,520
Okay, wait for a while.

151
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,679
Then I'll go first.

152
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:51,320
Alright.

153
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:04,919
The room card.

154
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:08,919
Fang Nan,

155
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,919
who are you with?

156
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,840
Yes, we'll set out at once.

157
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,280
See you later.

158
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,039
Shen Zhengyi.

159
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,760
Where have you been all night?

160
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,280
Wait a moment.

161
00:09:25,479 --> 00:09:26,119
You were out all night.

162
00:09:26,239 --> 00:09:26,799
Where did you go?

163
00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:28,200
What a mess of your hair!

164
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:28,760
I really can't explain

165
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,719
it to you for a while.

166
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,679
But now the priority is

167
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:31,719
the competition.

168
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,599
It's too late for the competition.

169
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,000
Get the clothes and the bag.

170
00:09:34,119 --> 00:09:34,760
Hurry up! A competition will be held.

171
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:35,640
Right, competition.

172
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:36,960
Competition.

173
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,119
Take the bag. Hurry up!

174
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:38,719
It's too late.

175
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,280
Let's go!

176
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,559
(Yu Bingling, the best!)
Yu Bingling, fighting!

177
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:46,320
Fighting, Zhengyi.

178
00:09:46,599 --> 00:09:47,840
Hang on, Yu Bingling.

179
00:09:59,119 --> 00:09:59,559
I've stressed it over and over

180
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,440
again to you.

181
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,119
What is the most important
thing during the contest?

182
00:10:02,599 --> 00:10:04,280
The safety of you and others.

183
00:10:04,359 --> 00:10:05,320
Did you remember what I said?

184
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,679
You might be lucky to win this time,

185
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:07,840
but it won't happen again next time.

186
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,919
(I made it!)

187
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,159
Keep the track.

188
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,479
Be steady.

189
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:34,080
Fighting! Fighting!

190
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,960
(Yu Bingling ranks first
for the moment.)

191
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:40,559
(The new dark horse Shen Zhengyi)

192
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,239
(is in hot pursuit.)

193
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:42,640
(Shen Zhengyi's speed
on the straight track)

194
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,960
(is really fast.)

195
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,080
(She almost catches up
with Yu Bingling.)

196
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,400
Go ahead,
and look for the opportunity.

197
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,479
(Will Shen Zhengyi risk
breaking through)

198
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:50,799
(on the curve this time?)

199
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,840
(There is no risky play.)

200
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,599
(Shen Zhengyi now)

201
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:56,039
(is different from the one
in the qualifying round.)

202
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:57,239
Hang on, Yu Bingling.

203
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,359
(She has really made a lot of progress.)

204
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,359
(She is speeding up.)

205
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,039
(Sprint!)

206
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,359
(Cross the finish line!)

207
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:06,880
(What a pity!)

208
00:11:07,119 --> 00:11:08,239
(Yu Bingling has taken the lead)

209
00:11:08,479 --> 00:11:09,719
(to across the finish line.)

210
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,239
(Yu Bingling has won.)
Yu Bingling has won.

211
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,559
(This gold medal belongs to Yu Bingling.)

212
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:14,239
Yu Bingling.

213
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:15,799
(The dark horse, Shen Zhengyi)

214
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,599
(cannot be underestimated.)

215
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,540
(Yu Bingling 44.020 Shen Zhengyi 44.305)
(Fang Nan 45.331 Wang Ying 45.508)

216
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,940
(Yu Bingling, fighting!)

217
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,479
Coach Zhuang.

218
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,760
Actually, I think

219
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,159
Shen Zhengyi has made a lot of progress

220
00:11:41,359 --> 00:11:42,080
in this competition.

221
00:11:42,239 --> 00:11:43,039
I think that

222
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,840
she has a very promising

223
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,080
future.

224
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:49,880
Come here.

225
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:51,520
So great!

226
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,520
Take a rest!

227
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,719
What would you like for dinner?

228
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:55,400
Hot pot.

229
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:55,960
Alright.

230
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,960
I will treat you.

231
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,479
Zhengyi, it's okay.

232
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:02,679
It's okay.

233
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,559
You guys have been great.

234
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,760
I didn't even make it to the final

235
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,000
the first time I attended the contest.

236
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,159
Zhengyi.

237
00:12:09,359 --> 00:12:10,280
Compared to an amateur before,

238
00:12:10,359 --> 00:12:11,719
you have really made a lot of progress.

239
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:12,799
What do you mean by amateur?

240
00:12:14,239 --> 00:12:15,159
Coach Zhuang, Coach Xiao.

241
00:12:15,239 --> 00:12:15,840
Sorry.

242
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:18,440
I still cannot catch up
with Yu Bingling.

243
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,239
Today you did great.

244
00:12:22,359 --> 00:12:24,000
Although you lost to Yu Bingling,

245
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:25,479
you have presented

246
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:27,000
your skills well,

247
00:12:28,359 --> 00:12:29,320
and have made great progress.

248
00:12:29,719 --> 00:12:30,440
I'm very pleased.

249
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,119
Keep working hard.

250
00:12:35,599 --> 00:12:37,200
Zhengyi, you are great.

251
00:12:37,719 --> 00:12:38,440
Did you hear it?

252
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,520
Coach Zhuang said you
have made great progress.

253
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,559
Be happy!

254
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:41,599
You are really great!

255
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,640
It's just a competition.

256
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,840
Alright, get off the ice.

257
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:47,239
Hurry up.

258
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,080
Alright.

259
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,880
You were out all night.

260
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,760
So you were

261
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,840
with Shao Beisheng.

262
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:58,359
No wonder Wang Jun didn't dare

263
00:12:58,479 --> 00:12:59,440
to tell me when I asked him.

264
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:01,200
I was taking care of

265
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,640
Shao Beisheng who got drunk.

266
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:04,039
I didn't even get the champion.

267
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:04,960
All you know is

268
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,039
to talk about my gossip.

269
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,080
Alright,

270
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,000
it's nice for you to get a medal

271
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,840
the first time you attended the contest.

272
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,000
Zhengyi.

273
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,000
Yu Bingling.

274
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,239
Congratulations!

275
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,799
Thank you.

276
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,200
You have really performed
much better than

277
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:19,960
you did last time.

278
00:13:20,719 --> 00:13:21,520
Go back and practice more.

279
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:22,799
You may not lose to me next time.

280
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,479
I have to say that

281
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,799
Coach Zhuang is

282
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,719
really good at coaching new players.

283
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,880
The new players

284
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:29,080
are not coached by Coach Zhuang.

285
00:13:29,239 --> 00:13:30,239
We are coached by Coach Xiao instead.

286
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,520
What a pity.

287
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:42,960
What do you mean?

288
00:13:43,359 --> 00:13:44,359
Coach Xiao Han.

289
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:47,960
I've got the champion.

290
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:49,119
Don't you even congratulate me?

291
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,280
Congratulations.

292
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,880
Unfortunately, Luo Xiaoyi didn't come

293
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,359
to see me receive the award.

294
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:58,320
Actually, the new players

295
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,840
of Wind Chaser are quite good.

296
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,559
But I think Coach Xiao

297
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:03,280
is going to let her

298
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,280
follow my path, right?

299
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,880
Yu Bingling, enough.

300
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,239
I am just curious

301
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,640
that who do you think
is better,

302
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,440
Shen Zhengyi or Luo Xiaoyi?

303
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,520
Of course Luo Xiaoyi.

304
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,679
And the two of us

305
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,799
practice different items.

306
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:18,320
She practices 1500m.

307
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:19,719
Although the items are different,

308
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,400
it doesn't matter,
right, Coach Xiao?

309
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:24,080
After all, she can even

310
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,039
withdraw from the training.

311
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:26,320
Luo Xiaoyi becomes

312
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,719
more and more promising.

313
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,719
I gotta go.

314
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:39,479
You guys shall clear up.

315
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,719
I have to go now.

316
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,440
Coach Xiao, bye.

317
00:14:43,719 --> 00:14:44,799
Bye coach.

318
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:47,200
Why did Yu Bingling say those

319
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,119
strange things?

320
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:49,919
You have no idea about it?

321
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:50,760
I don't know.

322
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,599
Well,

323
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,119
Wang Fang has told me this.

324
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,119
It's absolute true.

325
00:14:56,599 --> 00:14:57,599
What happened?

326
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,559
You are here.

327
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:06,280
Yu Bingling, you're late.

328
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:07,479
Hurry up! Start practicing.

329
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,119
What's up?

330
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:12,719
Just warm up,

331
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:13,799
and make up the rest.

332
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,400
Take a rest.

333
00:15:22,119 --> 00:15:22,679
You shall practice right away.

334
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,280
Don't make the coach angry.

335
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,880
Why are you packing the belt?

336
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,840
Yu Bingling, I'm talking to you.

337
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,840
Didn't you hear it?

338
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:34,719
I have to withdraw from the competition.

339
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:37,359
What did you say?
Withdraw from the competition?

340
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,200
Coach Xiao.

341
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,320
Don't you think you're being unfair?

342
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,479
My lap time

343
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:41,559
is no different from Luo Xiaoyi's.

344
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,520
Why did I assist her again

345
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:43,320
in Ling Yun Cup?

346
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,200
When can I stand out?

347
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:46,280
I can't accept it.

348
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,359
It's a team decision.

349
00:15:47,719 --> 00:15:48,760
Luo Xiaoyi's average performance

350
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,760
is much steadier than you.

351
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,880
We choose her to sprint
in the Ling Yun Cup

352
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,799
to reduce the error rate,

353
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:53,400
and also to increase the chance
of winning gold medal.

354
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,640
But the team has discussed that

355
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,320
next season maybe we'll let you...

356
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,000
Coach Xiao, you show partiality to her.

357
00:15:58,479 --> 00:16:00,119
If I could accept special
training every day,

358
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:02,280
I'm sure I can perform
better than she does.

359
00:16:04,479 --> 00:16:05,400
Yu Bingling.

360
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,799
Unfortunately, your strength

361
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,960
does not match your ambition.

362
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,760
You can't judge me

363
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,000
on my performance, right?

364
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,400
I am impossible to

365
00:16:11,479 --> 00:16:12,880
assist you, Luo Xiaoyi.

366
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:16,239
Yu Bingling.

367
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,159
What are you doing?

368
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,359
You can be in a bad mood,

369
00:16:19,599 --> 00:16:20,520
but you must take the
contests seriously.

370
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:22,200
Coach Xiao.

371
00:16:22,239 --> 00:16:23,039
I'm not kidding.

372
00:16:23,599 --> 00:16:25,039
I have decided to switch to
Flyer.

373
00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:26,919
Thank you for

374
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,640
training me this year.

375
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,159
We'll see you on the rink.

376
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,320
Bingling.

377
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,520
Keep training.

378
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,119
Why is this happening all of a sudden?

379
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,119
What are you doing?

380
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,719
Train yourselves!

381
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,719
I think what Yu Bingling said 

382
00:16:58,359 --> 00:17:00,119
can't be true.

383
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:01,559
Coach Xiao is not

384
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,479
that kind of person.

385
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,719
And we've been

386
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:05,160
training with him for so long.

387
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,760
He's really a good coach.

388
00:17:08,479 --> 00:17:09,280
However,

389
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,400
because you think

390
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,319
he's good,

391
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,239
you just speak

392
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,959
highly of him, right?

393
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:14,880
Let me tell you.

394
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:15,839
It's not the case.

395
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,680
I think Yu Bingling

396
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,680
had some problems with

397
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,920
Luo Xiaoyi,

398
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,040
then Coach Xiao was

399
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:23,520
caught in the middle.

400
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,479
Coach Xiao also gave me
a special training.

401
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:26,760
Then,

402
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,880
it might be the way he coaches, right?

403
00:17:29,719 --> 00:17:30,719
Coach students
according to their aptitude.

404
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,640
It makes sense.

405
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:39,920
Right.

406
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:41,040
It is said that when you recover

407
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:42,560
from the injury,

408
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,040
you can do any movement you want.

409
00:17:44,479 --> 00:17:45,479
Maybe you can do triple jump.

410
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:46,920
It's true.

411
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,839
It is the case when I
sprained my ankle last time...

412
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,760
You are just kidding.

413
00:18:08,439 --> 00:18:09,319
What's up?

414
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:10,719
I'm hungry.

415
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:11,920
Oh, no.

416
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:13,239
I ate all the food

417
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:14,239
I brought this morning.

418
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:18,079
I wonder if there is

419
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:19,520
any store nearby for buying food.

420
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,239
As you said so,

421
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:22,280
I am a little hungry.

422
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:23,959
Forget it.

423
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:24,920
Wait till we get back to school.

424
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:28,959
Have some.

425
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,359
Some more.

426
00:18:35,959 --> 00:18:36,959
Are they enough?

427
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:37,920
Yes.

428
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,040
Eat some dark chocolate
to replenish the energy.

429
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,319
So sweet.

430
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:47,199
That's the sweetest dark
chocolate I've ever seen.

431
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:48,119
I want it too.

432
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,239
Don't care about them. Just have it.

433
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:51,079
I don't. I...

Jun.

Let's go!

467
00:20:09,719 --> 00:20:10,520
Help us take the bags.

468
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:11,640
Why don't you take the bag for me?

469
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,880
I will take it. There is nothing.

470
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,000
Xiao Qing.

471
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:17,680
Zhengyi.

472
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:18,760
Congratulations!

473
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,599
You've got such a good result

474
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,680
the first time you attended the contest.

475
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:21,479
Thank you.

476
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:22,319
Then this bunch of flower

477
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,079
must be for me.

478
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,280
This is for Figure Skating team.

479
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,239
This is for Short Track
Speed Skating team.

480
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:25,920
You also have yours.

481
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,560
Let's share the flowers.

482
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,479
Thanks.

483
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:31,439
Welcome back.

484
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,479
Thank you, Xiao Qing.

485
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,199
This flower is so beautiful,
and you're thoughtful.

486
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,839
Beisheng, I have something to tell you.

487
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:41,319
I have contacted Curry,

488
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,880
your idol,

489
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,319
Ice Legend Curry.

490
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,800
I got in touch with him by email.

491
00:20:50,239 --> 00:20:50,880
I showed him your

492
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,079
video of 3A performance.

493
00:20:52,479 --> 00:20:53,239
He said he would

494
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:54,119
visit China soon,

495
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,199
and he'll recruit one player

496
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,119
to study in Russia.

497
00:20:56,239 --> 00:20:56,880
Really?

498
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,640
Is the news accurate?

499
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,959
He told me personally.

500
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:00,760
Of course it is accurate.

501
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:02,319
I think it's a

502
00:21:02,479 --> 00:21:03,560
very good chance for you.

503
00:21:03,719 --> 00:21:05,160
You can get prepared in advance.

504
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:06,160
Li Mi has also been coached by Curry

505
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:06,800
last year.

506
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:08,040
The news couldn't be more timely.

507
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,719
I don't know how to thank you.

508
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,400
If you really want to thank me,

509
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,239
just treat me a meal.

510
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,959
Alright, tonight.

511
00:21:16,199 --> 00:21:17,359
I can also invite Zhengyi and her friend

512
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,239
to celebrate her winning of
the silver medal.

513
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:21,719
And we can also invite Lele.

514
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:23,119
Okay.

515
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,920
Zhengyi, Lele.

516
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,199
Beisheng is going to
treat us a dinner tonight.

517
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:26,920
Let's go together.

518
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:28,040
Okay.

519
00:21:28,479 --> 00:21:29,439
After I make the reservation,

520
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,119
I'll text you.

521
00:21:30,439 --> 00:21:31,280
Okay.

522
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:35,119
Let's go.

523
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:44,030
(Hot Pot Restaurant)

524
00:21:59,079 --> 00:21:59,719
Good evening!

525
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:00,760
Good evening!

526
00:22:01,199 --> 00:22:02,160
I think I'll sit here.

527
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:04,000
Okay.

528
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,599
Didn't they come with you?

529
00:22:08,439 --> 00:22:09,239
I didn't go back to the dorm.

530
00:22:10,239 --> 00:22:10,920
Let me ask.

531
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,119
They should be here soon.

532
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:13,319
Okay.

533
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,439
I'll order first.

534
00:22:20,719 --> 00:22:22,280
It's rare that Shao Beisheng
treats us a dinner.

535
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,000
Today, we're

536
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:24,319
going to enjoy the feast.

537
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:30,140
(Xiao Qing)
(Are you coming?)

538
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,199
Who's it?

539
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,079
Xiao Qing.

540
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:37,959
She asked where we are.

541
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,880
Let's get going then.

542
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:40,839
It's too late.

543
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:42,319
Lele.

544
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,460
(Xiao Qing)
([2 messages]Xiao Qing: We order first.)

545
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:49,560
What's up?

546
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,239
I don't want to go.

547
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,959
Why?

548
00:22:59,199 --> 00:23:00,040
Then we're not going.

549
00:23:00,239 --> 00:23:01,040
After all, it's so cold.

550
00:23:01,199 --> 00:23:02,079
It's not worth going out

551
00:23:02,199 --> 00:23:02,959
for just a meal.

552
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,719
It's suitable for learning.

553
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,400
Waitress.

554
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:20,599
Hi, I...

555
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,719
Please wait a second.

556
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,439
What does Zhengyi like to eat?

557
00:23:32,239 --> 00:23:33,479
Just order what you want to eat.

558
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,520
Okay.

559
00:23:35,239 --> 00:23:36,079
Then I'll help Zhengyi and Lele

560
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:36,839
order.

561
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,479
Thank you.

562
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,520
Then please.

563
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,760
Zhengyi likes to have

564
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:44,640
braised chicken.

565
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,760
Braised chicken.

566
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,800
Okay.

567
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:48,079
And fried shredded pork
with green pepper.

568
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,359
Both of them.

569
00:23:51,199 --> 00:23:51,920
I think it's enough.

570
00:23:52,199 --> 00:23:54,520
Then I'll order one more.

571
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,239
Let me see.

572
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:56,719
Scrambled egg with tomato.

573
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,359
Hot and sour potato.

574
00:24:00,959 --> 00:24:02,680
Braised pork with preserved
vegetable in soy sauce.

575
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:03,839
Okay.

576
00:24:04,439 --> 00:24:05,560
What do you want to eat?

577
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,479
Okay, I am not picky.

578
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,160
Let me see.

579
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:11,280
I'll order something to drink.

580
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:15,599
Zhengyi said she wouldn't come.

581
00:24:17,959 --> 00:24:18,520
Why?

582
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,959
She said there's a temporary emergency.

583
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,439
Look!

584
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,370
(There's a temporary emergency.
Lele and I won't come tonight.)

585
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,719
So are we still eating?

586
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:30,800
We...

587
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,599
We've ordered the food.
So let's eat.

588
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,400
Excuse me.

589
00:24:37,479 --> 00:24:39,680
For the braised chicken and

590
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,199
fried shredded pork with green
pepper I ordered earlier.

591
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:42,000
Please help me pack them,

592
00:24:42,199 --> 00:24:42,800
instead of serving them.

593
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:44,000
Okay.

594
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,520
You take them back to Zhengyi

595
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,319
for me.

596
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,560
Okay.

597
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:48,640
That's all for now.

598
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:49,599
Okay.

599
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,160
Thank you.

600
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:50,880
You're welcome.

601
00:24:59,959 --> 00:25:00,599
Drink the water.

602
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:02,160
Thank you.

603
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:10,839
Zhengyi.

604
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,439
My...

605
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,439
my cousin's birthday is coming.

606
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,319
Am I going to buy him a scarf

607
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,479
or a coat?

608
00:25:20,239 --> 00:25:21,000
Both are nice.

609
00:25:22,199 --> 00:25:23,199
Let me have a look.

610
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:28,239
Zhengyi. Zhengyi.

611
00:25:28,479 --> 00:25:29,000
I saw a coat

612
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:29,880
on VIPSHOP.

613
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,160
Shao Beisheng also wore it before.

614
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:32,719
Please check out if it looks good.

615
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,560
Why can you

616
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,839
mention Shao Beisheng for everything?

617
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:42,319
Forget it.

618
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:44,079
I ask Qu Zhi.

619
00:25:49,199 --> 00:25:49,920
(If a girl)

620
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,760
(buys you a gift,)

621
00:25:51,199 --> 00:25:52,239
(which one do you prefer?)

622
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,880
You don't have to ask me directly

623
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,160
if you want to buy me a gift.

624
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,070
(If a girl buys you a gift,
which one do you prefer?)

625
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,710
(The scarf. It is quite good as it can
keep warm in winter and it's stylish.)

626
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:10,920
(It is quite good as it can
keep warm in the winter.)

627
00:26:14,719 --> 00:26:15,560
(I think all boys)

628
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,760
(like this brand?)

629
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,000
(Like it very much.)

630
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,280
I'm back.

631
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:44,959
You're back early.

632
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:48,079
I packed the meal for you.

633
00:26:54,959 --> 00:26:56,280
How's your dinner

634
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:57,359
with Shao Beisheng?

635
00:26:58,839 --> 00:26:59,520
It's okay.

636
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,599
I felt that Shao Beisheng didn't
feel so comfortable,

637
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:02,839
as he's not

638
00:27:02,959 --> 00:27:03,800
single nominally.

639
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:15,079
(Did you eat the food I packed for you?)

640
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:20,510
(Are you here?)

641
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,880
(I'm busy. What's up?)

642
00:27:30,439 --> 00:27:31,439
Zhengyi, don't you eat?

643
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,599
You eat first.

644
00:27:40,479 --> 00:27:41,760
Are they all

645
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:42,880
Zhengyi's favorite food?

646
00:27:43,439 --> 00:27:44,280
I ordered them specially.

647
00:27:44,479 --> 00:27:45,800
Pack them up before they're served.

648
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,000
(Now Liu Fei has left.)

649
00:27:56,199 --> 00:27:56,959
(I wonder if you could terminate)

650
00:27:57,199 --> 00:27:58,119
(our contract for being a couple.)

651
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,040
(I told you I am busy.)

652
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,439
(We'll discuss it later.)

653
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,199
I can sense your anger.

654
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:26,520
Who made you angry?

655
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,680
Nobody.

656
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,319
Go to sleep.

657
00:28:38,199 --> 00:28:39,400
What's wrong, Zhengyi?

658
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:43,199
Nothing.

659
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:46,439
I got some good news for you guys.

660
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,040
Shao Beisheng and I

661
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:50,920
will terminate
the contract in advance.

662
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,839
Let's eat.

663
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,840
(College of Biological Sciences)

664
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,640
Shao Beisheng.

665
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,280
Shao Beisheng.

666
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,479
What took you so long
to finish the classes?

667
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,079
What's up?

668
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,839
You want to talk about the breakup?

669
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:18,640
No way.

670
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,439
I'll send you a gift.

671
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,520
Really?

672
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,479
What gift will you send me?

673
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:24,280
Look!

674
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,439
I've worked so hard to

675
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,119
collect these.

676
00:29:26,199 --> 00:29:26,640
Are there anything

677
00:29:26,719 --> 00:29:27,680
you like?

678
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:29,319
Really?

679
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:31,640
There are so many
limited editions. You...

680
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,359
Why do you suddenly
give me a gift?

681
00:29:39,479 --> 00:29:40,599
Actually I think we can still

682
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,880
discuss more about the breakup.

683
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,199
I have told you several times that

684
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,760
it is impossible to break up.

685
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,040
You should do as required in the
contract without the discussion.

686
00:29:46,719 --> 00:29:47,800
But Liu Fei has left,

687
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,839
why can't we break up?

688
00:29:49,199 --> 00:29:51,199
What if she comes back

689
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,239
to visit Ma on holidays.
What shall I do?

690
00:29:52,439 --> 00:29:52,880
At that time,

691
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
we just have to act one more time.

692
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,000
If we break up,

693
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:55,839
and everyone knows it,

694
00:29:55,959 --> 00:29:56,719
what shall I do then?

695
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,760
We can get back together.

696
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,959
This is negotiable.

697
00:30:00,719 --> 00:30:01,599
No way.

698
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,560
Come back!

699
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:04,880
Oh, no.

700
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,280
Are you crazy?

(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team of
Lingbei University)

702
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,479
In this College Student Ice League,

703
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,839
everybody did a great job.

704
00:30:13,719 --> 00:30:14,640
But the only regret is

705
00:30:14,719 --> 00:30:16,000
that we failed to win a gold medal.

706
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,800
Even though we didn't
win the gold medal,

707

Wind Chaser

708
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,280
has won the most

709
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:28,000
medals in history.

710
00:30:29,439 --> 00:30:31,199
One silver and one
bronze medal for 500m.

711
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:34,000
One silver medal for 1500m.

712
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,959
Wang Fang has overcome the stress

713
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,000
to have a steady performance,

714
00:30:39,479 --> 00:30:40,479
and to make progress.

715

Liu Sisi,

717
00:30:44,719 --> 00:30:45,839

718

Fang Nan,

719
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,439
you are more confident than before,

720
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,719
and dare to try your best. Great!

721

Zhu Lele!

722
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,680
You skated very fast.

723
00:30:56,199 --> 00:30:57,319
You have performed better than
you did in any training session.

724
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,800
Keep going!

725
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:01,800
Shen Zhengyi.

726
00:31:02,439 --> 00:31:03,199
Congratulations.

727
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,479
You've become a

728
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,319
true professional player.

729
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,760
Whether you

730
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,920
won the medal or not,

731
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,479
you have broken through

732
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,239
in such a short period.

733
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,680
All of you deserve compliment.

734
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,839
What I'm most concerned about right now

735
00:31:25,239 --> 00:31:26,680
is what you have learned from

736
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:28,280
the College Student Ice League.

737
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,479
You can share it.

738
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:35,239
Say it.

739
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,920
I didn't expect that

740
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:38,560
at the 1500m final,

741
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:39,880
Yu Bingling would give up

742
00:31:39,959 --> 00:31:40,760
her chance of winning

743
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:41,880
and assist her teammate.

744
00:31:42,479 --> 00:31:43,439
It was my misjudgment

745
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,000
that let Flyer win the gold medal.

746
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,119
But the team work of Flyer

747
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,640
is really great.

748
00:31:49,959 --> 00:31:51,079
I am sincerely convinced.

749
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,439
Very good.

750
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,040
You are starting to

751
00:31:58,119 --> 00:31:59,160
focus on the team.

752
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,640
The success of a genius may be

753
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,000
impossible to be replicated.

754
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,599
But we can learn from

755
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:07,119
a strong and united

756
00:32:07,199 --> 00:32:08,079
team.

757
00:32:08,959 --> 00:32:09,760
Remember,

758
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,319
you are as good as anyone else.

I told you that

800
00:34:52,439 --> 00:34:53,760
my daughter is a genius.

801
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,199
You won the silver medal

802

the first time you attended the contest.

803

then who is?

It's only College Student Ice League,

instead of a formal competition.

807
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,360
Winning a silver medal is
far from being a genius.

Dad,

809
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,320
does my mom know my result?

810
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,760
Of course, she's eavesdropping.

811
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:15,360
Then how about her?

812
00:35:15,439 --> 00:35:16,399
Is she still angry?

813
00:35:16,879 --> 00:35:17,639
You don't need to care about it.

814
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,439
You just celebrate for it.

815
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,679
Dad believes that

816
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,800
you can try your best
to win the gold medal

817
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,239
in the next competition.

818
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,159
Being confident blindly

819
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:28,600
can only underestimate the opponents.

820
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:31,479
So when can I get home?

821
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,840
I want to go home.

822
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,280
We miss you too.

823
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:36,479
You just celebrate

824
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,439
at school.

825
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,800
I'll take care of the family.

826
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:39,879
When your mom is no longer angry,

827
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,760
I'll tell you to come back.

828
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:42,639
Got it. I'll hang up.

829

It sounds like

831
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,679
you know how to skate.

832
00:35:55,879 --> 00:35:57,280
It is because of my DNA.

833
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,679
I think I also

834
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,760
contribute a little bit.

835
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:02,280
You eavesdropped on my phone calls.

836
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:03,080
When did I eavesdrop

837
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:04,080
on your phone calls?

838
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,479
You have such a loud voice.

839
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:07,239
Do you want to know the

840
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,280
result of Yiyi?

841
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,080
I am not interested in it.

842
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:12,000
I'm not going to agree, anyway.

843
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:16,479
You peeled it for me?

844

00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,280
(In this year's)

862
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,679
(Australian Open, French Open
and Wimbledon...)

863
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:56,239
How can she go out for the competition?

864
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,239
Who knows?

865
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:12,719
You are great!

866
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,800
Lower your feet.

867
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,399
Take a rest.

868
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,120
I'm okay.

869
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,280
Okay, take a rest.

870
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,560
I can't jump

871
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:53,719
because I'm fat, right?

872
00:37:53,919 --> 00:37:54,800
Maybe it's time to lose weight?

873
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,000
Who's going to lose weight? Who?

874
00:37:57,639 --> 00:37:58,840
Don't do so. I am telling you.

875
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,600
Are you confused when practicing the

876
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:01,520
Quadruple Jump?

877
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,919
So many players in Single Skating team

878
00:38:03,439 --> 00:38:04,479
practice it every day.

879
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:05,560
Who can do the Quadruple Jump?

880
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,679
What's the hurry?

881
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:07,520
What's the hurry?

882
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,399
He...

883
00:38:08,879 --> 00:38:09,800
is competing with me.

884
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,879
Li Mi, you are also competitive.

885
00:38:14,479 --> 00:38:15,239
Come on. Assemble.

886
00:38:15,439 --> 00:38:16,120
Assemble.

887
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:17,360
Assemble.

888
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:18,520
Come on.

889
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,760
I have an announcement to make.

890
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:22,280
In the coming week,

891
00:38:22,399 --> 00:38:23,600
Flyer will

892
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:25,159
have a joint training session with us.

893
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,959
This is Coach Liu in Flyer.

894
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,199
This time...

895
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,239
Let's welcome him.

896
00:38:29,399 --> 00:38:31,600
- Great.
- Great.

897
00:38:32,479 --> 00:38:33,159
He's my buddy.

898
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,959
We played together since we were kids.

899
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:36,760
He's excellent.

900
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,399
Who let you move in?

901
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,639
Are you surprised?

902
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,239
The buddy is so nice.

903
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,120
Aren't there

904
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:50,159
any other dorms on campus?

905
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:50,840
No.

906
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,399
There's a bed available.

907
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:54,679
That's how the team arranged.

908
00:38:54,919 --> 00:38:55,800
I don't want to.

909
00:38:59,959 --> 00:39:01,560
From now on, let's eat, live,

910
00:39:01,879 --> 00:39:02,679
study,

911
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,760
and improve together.

912
00:39:03,959 --> 00:39:04,560
Of course!

913
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,560
No more talking, buddy.

914
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:07,399
Let me pack your things first.

915
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,439
You are so kind.

916
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:11,600
You want to live in my dorm.

917
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:12,760
Okay.

918
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,399
But let's make some ground rules.

919
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:15,439
Every dorm has

920
00:39:15,479 --> 00:39:16,639
its ground rules.

921
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,800
Let's make the premise clear first,

922
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,280
and make it easier for everyone.

923
00:39:19,479 --> 00:39:20,520
Okay, please.

924
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:21,320
First,

925
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,520
put your things

926
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:23,719
on your own position.

927
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,520
Don't sit on my bed.

928
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,280
I won't.

929
00:39:27,879 --> 00:39:28,520
Second,

930
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:29,679
clean the dorm by turns.

931
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,360
Third,

932
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,000
the rest room is served in order.

933
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:32,600
Forth,

934
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:34,080
wash your own socks in time.

935
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:34,840
Fifth,

936
00:39:34,959 --> 00:39:36,280
don't pry into other people's privacy.

937
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,280
I don't have to pry into your privacy.

938
00:39:38,879 --> 00:39:40,280
You drooled when you sleep,

939
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:41,760
always looked in the mirror,

940
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:43,000
hid snacks

941
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:43,520
under the pillow,

942
00:39:43,919 --> 00:39:44,959
and pretended to be sick
when you miss your mom.

943
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:45,639
Let me tell you...

944
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:46,800
You were cute when you were a kid.

945
00:39:46,919 --> 00:39:47,439
Why are you

946
00:39:47,479 --> 00:39:48,159
different after you grow up?

947
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:48,719
By the way,

948
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:49,879
do you think he was nice

949
00:39:49,959 --> 00:39:50,760
when he was a kid?

950
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,280
Don't be fooled by his snacks.

951
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:52,800
Let me tell you.

952
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:53,760
Weren't you

953
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,560
the one who was scared of ghosts

954
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:55,159
and hid in the ladies' room?

955
00:39:55,439 --> 00:39:56,320
Weren't you the one who

956
00:39:56,399 --> 00:39:56,800
wrote love letters to Miss Wang?

957
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,360
Dear Miss Wang,

958
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,679
I am Li Mi.

959
00:39:59,919 --> 00:40:00,719
I love you.

960
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,520
Shut up.

961
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,439
How could you do so when we just met?

962
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,000
I got you a gift.

963
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:05,959
You just wait and see.

964
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,320
I don't want it.

965
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:10,439
Open and check it out.

966
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:11,040
I doubt

967
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,439
your gift.

968
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,199
How can you doubt

969
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,159
our friendship?

970
00:40:14,399 --> 00:40:15,080
Then I have to doubt it.

971
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:16,399
Open and check it out.

972
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:16,959
I don't.

973
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:17,600
Just check it out.

974
00:40:17,959 --> 00:40:18,320
No.

975
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,439
You just open and check it out.

976
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,280
Let me see.

977
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:24,439
Don't cry.

978
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:26,520
Wait.

979
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,879
I have a gift for you.

980
00:40:32,479 --> 00:40:34,840
Bio-attack.

981
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,320
Don't hurt the innocent.

982
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,280
(Sports make dreams come true.)

983
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,959
Be steady.

984
00:42:12,879 --> 00:42:14,399
