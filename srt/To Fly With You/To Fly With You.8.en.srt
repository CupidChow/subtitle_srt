00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,990
=Episode 8=

3
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,839
Speed, speed, speed.

4
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,000
Oh my god.

5
00:01:46,279 --> 00:01:47,319
Zhengyi is doing so well

6
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,480
with the curves now.

7
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,720
She's improved

8
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,559
a great deal.

9
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,040
It won't be long before
she catches up with us

10
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,279
if she keeps going like this.

11
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,000
What is the result?

12
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,000
44.01 seconds.

13
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:10,559
How come?

14
00:02:11,119 --> 00:02:11,839
I used to be able to

15
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,440
make it within 44 seconds!

16
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,880
It's all Zhuang Yue's fault.

17
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:17,880
If she hasn't

18
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,679
wasted my time for so long,

19
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,440
my performance wouldn't

20
00:02:19,559 --> 00:02:20,279
have gone down this much!

21
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,279
Calm down.

22
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,279
I just can't!

23
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:23,000
How am I supposed to
win the champion

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,240
with performance like this?

25
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,000
Liu Sisi,

26
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,279
I wanna talk to you.

27
00:02:42,559 --> 00:02:43,440
I will have a class.

28
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,479
Just 2 minutes.

29
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,160
You will be on time for your class.

30
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,559
You started short track speed skating

31
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,039
at the age of 5, right?

32
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,000
Yes.

33
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:00,880
You got the champion

34
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,479
in the Lingbei short track
speed skating 500m contest for kids

35
00:03:02,679 --> 00:03:03,679
at the age of 7.

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,240
You joined the National Youth
Short Track Speed Skating Tournament

37
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:06,479
on behalf of the provincial team
at the age of 12,

38
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:07,720
and were runner-up

39
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:09,759
in the 1500m contest.

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,039
When you were 15,

41
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,279
you became the champion

42
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,759
in Lingbei's 1500m Short Track
Speed Skating Contest,

43
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:16,320
and in the same year took part
in the Ling Yun Cup as an exception

44
00:03:16,559 --> 00:03:18,600
in which you got a bronze medal
of short track speed skating.

45
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,320
You were the best among the candidates

46
00:03:20,839 --> 00:03:21,880
when you were enrolled

47
00:03:22,279 --> 00:03:24,000
in Wind Chaser.

48
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:26,440
You seem to know me well.

49
00:03:28,119 --> 00:03:29,720
I must know

50
00:03:30,559 --> 00:03:31,559
my own team members well

51
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,880
as the chief coach
of Wind Chaser.

52
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:35,039
But what I urgently want to

53
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,160
know now is

54
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,600
how such a good player

55
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,600
fails to

56
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,720
perform well now.

57
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:46,399
That's because
I've realized that

58
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:47,880
each person has the limit.

59
00:03:48,279 --> 00:03:49,240
No matter how hard you try,

60
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,279
it's hard to break that limit.

61
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:52,399
As for me,

62
00:03:52,559 --> 00:03:53,559
Xiaoyi is my limit.

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,880
No matter how hard I train myself,

64
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,160
I cannot outperform her.

65
00:03:57,839 --> 00:03:59,000
Have you ever thought about

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,320
breaking that limit?

67
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,000
Coordination is not
the same as obedience.

68
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:09,039
You are ruining your own future

69
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:11,039
by following her in this farce.

70
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,279
She may as well leave Wind Chaser

71
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:14,160
if she feels confident

72
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,800
or competent to do so.

73
00:04:17,119 --> 00:04:17,920
But what about you?

74
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:20,239
Xiaoyi is my partner.

75
00:04:20,559 --> 00:04:22,000
I will stand on her side

76
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,000
for both of the contest and life.

77
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,440
I've thought it through already.

78
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,559
I'm a senior student,

79
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,440
and I'll either get a job

80
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:28,359
or prepare for postgraduate
entrance examination.

81
00:04:29,119 --> 00:04:30,200
I'll not follow the career path

82
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,880
of professional athletes.

83
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,440
You mean

84
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:34,559
you want to quit?

85
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,320
You are the only one

86
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:41,559
among team members back then

87
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,000
who is still in Wind Chaser, right?

88
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,880
If you already knew

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,760
this path would lead nowhere

90
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,880
and you'd get nothing from it,

91
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,000
then why didn't you

92
00:04:49,119 --> 00:04:50,200
quit like they did early on?

93
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:56,119
Because you don't want to
reconcile to it.

94
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,880
Sisi!

95
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:27,119
Sisi!

96
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:28,440
Have you heard about it?

97
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:29,880
The new team members
have all returned for training.

98
00:05:30,119 --> 00:05:30,679
Right.

99
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:31,559
Zhuang Yue has been

100
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:32,519
talking to them one by one,

101
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,880
and they were persuaded to go back.

102
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,359
What about

103
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,679
us who did not go back for training?

104
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:38,320
Are we going to be punished?

105
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,119
If that's the case,

106
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,679
I will be scolded by my dad.

107
00:05:43,559 --> 00:05:44,760
You are such a coward.

108
00:05:47,559 --> 00:05:48,320
Xiaoyi,

109
00:05:48,679 --> 00:05:49,799
the qualification contest
will be held tomorrow.

110
00:05:50,119 --> 00:05:51,320
Are you sure we're
not going back?

111
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,920
What's point to be fearful?

112
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,119
If Zhuang Yue were to take

113
00:05:55,239 --> 00:05:56,440
those new members to join the contest,

114
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
they would get nothing

115
00:05:58,119 --> 00:05:59,440
but losing face.

116
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,799
But then the Wind Chaser

117
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,000
would also be losing face.

118
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,079
Sure.

119
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,119
I agree.

120
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,119
We can't let the Flyers

121
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,000
look down upon us

122
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,000
in the College Student Ice League.

123
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,239
Since we have a problem in our team,

124
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,119
we solve it in our team.

125
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,519
Xiaoyi,

126
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,679
what about you taking us together

127
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,559
and making an apology to Zhuang Yue?

128
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:20,359
We can't just let the Wind Chaser

129
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,320
be looked down upon.

130
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,320
Right?

131
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,760
With Zhuang Yue as a coach,

132
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,000
the Wind Chaser is nothing but a joke.

133
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,519
I'm not going back.

134
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:27,799
Indeed, I'd like to see how she's gonna
take the team to join the contest.

135
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,880
You guys take it seriously

136
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,079
for her words?

137
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,679
Save it.

138
00:06:32,679 --> 00:06:33,760
Stop wishful thinking.

139
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,880
How could you say that,

140
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:35,679
Xiaoyi?

141
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,559
Did I say it wrong?

142
00:06:37,239 --> 00:06:37,920
You can go if you like,

143
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,200
but I won't.

144
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:40,559
Xiaoyi...

145
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,880
Let me talk to her.

146
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,320
Let's go.

147
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,440
Well, Zhuang Yue seems to be tactical.

148
00:06:54,679 --> 00:06:55,559
Xiaoyi...

149
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,079
In fact,

150
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,119
Coach Zhuang has also talked to me.

151
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,559
Maybe

152
00:07:02,679 --> 00:07:04,320
we'd better go back.

153
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,239
You are going back just because
she asked you to do so?

154
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:08,519
You do what she says?

155
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:09,920
No...

156
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,519
But she is the chief coach anyway.

157
00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:13,679
And our performance has improved

158
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,119
since she joined the team.

159
00:07:15,679 --> 00:07:16,440
You totally lost your temper

160
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:17,799
in the skating rink that day,

161
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,200
but she didn't haggle over it at all.

162
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,640
Maybe

163
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,799
we should just apologize to her,

164
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,880
otherwise we won't be able to take part
in the College Student Ice League.

165
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:25,359
What are we going to do then?

166
00:07:25,559 --> 00:07:26,200
This is no "we".

167
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:28,359
I'm fine by myself without you.

168
00:07:30,359 --> 00:07:31,119
Xiaoyi,

169
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,239
what do you mean by that?

170
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:34,760
You think I can't win the champion

171
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,519
without you?

172
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,559
But we are partners, right?

173
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:40,320
Without my support,

174
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,679
you might never have got
those gold medals.

175
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,559
Let's be clear.

176
00:07:42,679 --> 00:07:44,079
Who is the one that needs help?

177
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:45,760
With your skills,

178
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,200
you would have been a nobody

179
00:07:47,239 --> 00:07:48,559
without me.

180
00:07:48,679 --> 00:07:49,760
Luo Xiaoyi,

181
00:07:50,239 --> 00:07:51,440
we have been partners for so long,

182
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,079
how can you

183
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,079
talk to me like this?

184
00:07:53,119 --> 00:07:53,799
Come on!

185
00:07:54,119 --> 00:07:55,760
Short track speed skating
is a competition of individuals.

186
00:07:55,799 --> 00:07:56,880
It has nothing to do with partnership.

187
00:07:57,239 --> 00:07:57,760
Otherwise why were those

188
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,880
medals I got

189
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,320
not shared with you?

190
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:02,200
I've done so many things for you

191
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:03,559
and now you deny them all,

192
00:08:03,679 --> 00:08:04,440
right?

193
00:08:05,239 --> 00:08:07,000
Don't pretend like
you've sacrificed everything

194
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,239
to make me succeed.

195
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,760
I don't need it.

196
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:15,760
Fine.

197
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,760
If you already knew

198
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,679
this path would lead nowhere,

199
00:08:55,239 --> 00:08:56,640
then why didn't you

200
00:08:57,239 --> 00:08:58,440
quit like they did early on?

201
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,119
Because you don't want to
reconcile to it.

202
00:09:04,119 --> 00:09:05,359
Sisi, why are you still here?

203
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:06,880
You're already

204
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,119
the top one in our team.

205
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,440
Yeah, stop training.
Let's go.

206
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,919
I'm fine. Just leave me.

207
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,640
This time

208
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:13,679
I'll definitely

209
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,559
get the gold medal for the Ling Yun Cup.

210
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,679
I'll also make it to the Asian Cup.

211
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:17,239
Well then, we'll leave you here.

212
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,440
- See you.
- See you.

213
00:09:35,479 --> 00:09:36,239
Excuse me!

214
00:09:36,599 --> 00:09:37,719
Here, come and have a seat.

215
00:09:49,479 --> 00:09:50,799
Do you know why I asked you to come?

216
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:01,440
Coach Zhuang,

217
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:02,919
there is no use

218
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:04,000
to talk to me.

219
00:10:04,359 --> 00:10:05,280
With me or without me,

220
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,119
Wind Chaser will remain unchanged.

221
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,039
I can't win medals.

222
00:10:08,599 --> 00:10:09,239
I won't make a difference

223
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,559
to the team.

224
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:13,280
That's how you

225
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,679
position yourself?

226
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,799
Your skills are good.

227
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,239
Why do you

228
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:21,159
get by like this?

229
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:23,159
Where's your passion?

230
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,119
Why shall I have the passion?

231
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:27,840
Well, Yu Bingling has the passion,

232
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:29,159
but she was also forced to quit.

233
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:38,599
Don't get me wrong, Coach Zhuang.

234
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:41,559
I have no issue with

235
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:42,599
Coach Xiao and Xiaoyi.

236
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,840
Xiaoyi is the seed player

237
00:10:45,359 --> 00:10:46,599
for the 1500m contest.

238
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,159
It's natural for Coach Xiao

239
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:49,919
to have high hopes on her

240
00:10:50,479 --> 00:10:51,039
and give her special training.

241
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:52,359
It's totally fine.

242
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,239
But for me, things are different.

243
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:56,159
No matter how hard I try,
I'm still her sparring partner.

244
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,039
I would have given up
from the very beginning

245
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:00,679
if it weren't for my parents

246
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:01,599
who would scold me
for doing so.

247
00:11:03,359 --> 00:11:04,840
You still want to win,

248
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:08,359
but just lose your faith
in Wind Chaser,

249
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,159
right?

250
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,559
Zhou Luhan,

251
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,039
you have built your basics well

252
00:11:22,359 --> 00:11:23,479
with a comprehensive skill set.

253
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,039
Your potentials go way beyond
what you have demonstrated.

254
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,840
The reason for your unstable performance

255
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,119
lies in your attitude.

256
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:33,679
Take this strike for example.

257
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,919
When others went on a strike,
you just followed.

258
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:38,039
I don't think

259
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:40,239
you feel you're doing the right thing,

260
00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:44,919
am I right?

261
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:51,840
If you accept me

262
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,840
and trust me,

263
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,280
give me a chance

264
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:55,799
and also give yourself a chance.

265
00:11:59,239 --> 00:11:59,919
The qualification contest in the team

266
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:00,919
will begin soon.

267
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:01,719
It's up to you

268
00:12:02,719 --> 00:12:03,799
to come or not.

269
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:05,599
Don't rush.

270
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,039
Think it over

271
00:12:07,599 --> 00:12:08,679
before you make the decision.

272
00:12:30,239 --> 00:12:31,039
OK.

273
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:43,740
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team
of Lingbei University)

274
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:47,840
Nice!

275
00:12:49,719 --> 00:12:50,200
Look at it!

276
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,080
Well!

277
00:12:52,599 --> 00:12:53,320
Beautiful!

278
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:57,080
Well done!

279
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:58,359
Good!

280
00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,919
Ok, enough for today.

281
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,080
Thanks for the hard work.

282
00:13:02,479 --> 00:13:03,200
You've been working hard.

283
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,200
It's already 8 o'clock.

284
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,840
Are you going back on your own?

285
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:08,960
Yes.

286
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:10,159
Send her home.

287
00:13:10,239 --> 00:13:10,719
It's not safe

288
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:11,440
for a girl to walk alone at night.

289
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:12,440
All right.

290
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,039
I'm leaving.

291
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,719
Ok.

292
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,559
Turn off all the lights.

293
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,559
- See you.
- See you.

294
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:16,559
Bye.

295
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:19,200
I hope it won't bother you.

296
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:20,840
No problem.

297
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,200
Let me buy you some
midnight snacks.

298
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,559
Better not.

299
00:13:23,599 --> 00:13:24,320
I'm on a diet.

300
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:26,799
What about juice?

301
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,479
Deal.

302
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:30,719
Let's go.

303
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,159
Coach Xiao.

304
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,960
The College Student Ice League
will start tomorrow.

305
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:38,799
Please inform Luo Xiaoyi

306
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,200
about the qualification contest
of our team.

307
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,080
If she doesn't come in person,

308
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:42,840
I'd take it as a waiver.

309
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:54,719
Fun things like this

310
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,719
are happening in our team?

311
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:56,799
In fact, they are not that strict

312
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:57,960
as you've imagined.

313
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,320
Stay longer

314
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,239
and you will know it.

315
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:02,719
Well, you've arrived.
I'm heading back then.

316
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,080
Thank you for sending me home.

317
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:05,840
No worry. It's my pleasure.

318
00:14:06,239 --> 00:14:06,799
See you.

319
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:07,799
See you tomorrow.

320
00:14:18,599 --> 00:14:19,840
I'm back.

321
00:14:24,599 --> 00:14:25,559
Why are you so happy?

322
00:14:25,719 --> 00:14:26,599
You are humming.

323
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,840
I am happy, indeed.

324
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:29,719
Tell me about it.

325
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,479
I liked the juice today.

326
00:14:35,719 --> 00:14:36,440
Where is Zhengyi?

327
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,440
The qualification contest will be held.

328
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,239
She said she was nervous and
needed to get some breath.

329
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:43,840
By the way.

330
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:45,679
I have some gifts for you.

331
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:46,559
I prepared these
a few days ago.

332
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:51,520
Facial mask?

333
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:52,479
Thank you.

334
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,440
You're welcome.

335
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,280
I'm calm.

336
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,799
I'm calm.

337
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:03,679
Have a good sleep tonight

338
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:05,000
and I'll be fine tomorrow.

339
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,280
I'm calm.

340
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,159
You don't know it?

341
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,280
The fountain near the
Faculty of Biology

342
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:09,440
works like magic.

343
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:10,679
Many people go there to
spell out their wishes.

344
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:11,559
Really?

345
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:12,400
Sure.

346
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:15,080
They say that it works
9 out of 10 times.

347
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,719
That's amazing!

348
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:18,400
I'm gonna try it someday.

349
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,039
Let's go.

350
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,039
Yeah.

351
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,380
(Lehui 24-Hour Convenience Store)

352
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,280
Excuse me?

353
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,440
Wait for a second.

354
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,280
Shen Zhengyi?

355
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:40,799
Why are you here?

356
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:42,799
Buy food?

357
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,159
Weirdo.

358
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,039
How can I help you?

359
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,039
Can I exchange for some coins?

360
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,000
What's that for?

361
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:57,679
Well, you exchanged for

362
00:15:57,799 --> 00:15:58,679
so many coins at the convenience store

363
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,280
to try the wishing fountain

364
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,200
in our faculty?

365
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,080
Just stop messing around

366
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,000
if you are not going to

367
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,039
make a wish.

368
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,280
I just want to have a look.

369
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:09,159
Do you know how to make a wish?

370
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,559
No.

371
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:14,400
Teach me then.

372
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:15,919
You didn't ask me.

373
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:18,760
How to make a wish?

374
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,400
In fact, I'm not clear about it, either.

375
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:23,280
According to what I've heard,

376
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,280
you keep these coins in your palms,

377
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:25,919
and make your wish.

378
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,039
After that,

379
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:28,000
you throw those coins

380
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:30,159
to the pool at the top.

381
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,559
That's it.

382
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:33,679
That's easy.

383
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,320
One, two, three, four, five and six.

384
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,200
One, two, three, four, five and six.

385
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,760
Ok, 6 coins for each of us,

386
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,679
and 12 coins in total.

387
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:44,919
The rest are mine.

388
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,520
We each get half of the coins,

389
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,320
so it is fair.

390
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,559
I wish I will pass

391
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,400
tomorrow's qualification contest.

392
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:57,400
Don't mind.

393
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,000
You've still got many chances.

394
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:00,280
That's an accident.

395
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:10,160
This one has gone too far.

396
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,520
Give me another chance.

397
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,119
Terribly missed the target.

00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:23,239
To those who come in late,

518
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,400
10 laps after the assessment!

519
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,000
Yes!

520
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,359
Now, start raining!

521
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:29,479
Yes!

522
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:38,400
The contest against the Flyers

523
00:23:38,479 --> 00:23:39,599
is about to start.

524
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,119
We will determine your
qualifications for the contest

525
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,119
in today's qualification contest.

526
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:42,880
The top 5 player in performance

527
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,839
will be qualified.

528
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:45,079
The track order

529
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:46,239
is arranged

530
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:46,959
based on your previous performance.

531
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:49,239
If you want to get a better track,

532
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:50,719
then work hard this time.

533
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:52,199
Go prepare yourselves!

534
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:01,239
Next time I'll definitely be
standing on that track.

535
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:08,479
Are you ready?

536
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:13,839
Set.

537
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:31,880
Keep going, Shen Zhengyi!

538
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:32,760
- Keep going!
- Keep going!

539
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,119
Shen Zhengyi, keep going!

540
00:24:41,719 --> 00:24:42,880
- Shen Zhengyi!
- Shen Zhengyi!

541
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:43,760
Shen Zhengyi!

542
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:46,599
Well done, Shen Zhengyi!

543
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:01,479
She's trying to stop
the one to the left behind her,

544
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:02,479
but she ignored the person on the right.

545
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:04,239
Shen Zhengyi, pass her!

546
00:25:04,479 --> 00:25:05,959
- Pass her!
- Pass her!

547
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:10,520
- Keep going!
- Keep going!

548
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,719
- Keep going!
- Keep going!

549
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,439
I must find the chance to pass her

550
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:24,439
in the last curve.

551
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:31,319
Now!

552
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:48,000
Shen Zhengyi!

553
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:49,199
You have won the first place.

554
00:25:53,479 --> 00:25:54,319
No way.

555
00:25:56,719 --> 00:25:57,400
It's been just a few days!

556
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:01,479
Superb!

557
00:26:01,719 --> 00:26:02,839
Lele, did you see it?

558
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:04,119
You are awesome!

559
00:26:04,199 --> 00:26:04,719
One more hug!

560
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:09,599
Next group.

561
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:13,360
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team
of Lingbei University)

562
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,360
Now I'll announce the results.

563
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,479
The top 5 players

564
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,400
will take part
in the College Student Ice League.

565
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:19,760
First,

566
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:20,560
Liu Sisi,

567
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,199
45.23 second.

568
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,359
Oh my goodness.

569
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,640
She's so great!

570
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,560
This is my last chance

571
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,439
for the Ling Yun Cup.

572
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,920
I won't leave any regret.

573
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:33,959
Second,

574
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:34,719
Wang Fang,

575
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,479
45.45 second.

576
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:39,719
Third,

577
00:26:40,239 --> 00:26:41,079
Zhu Lele,

578
00:26:41,239 --> 00:26:42,359
46.47 second.

579
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,239
Fourth,

580
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:51,520
Shen Zhengyi,

581
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,319
46.58 second.

582
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,880
Fifth,

583
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,439
Fang Nan,

584
00:27:12,239 --> 00:27:13,599
47.02 second.

585
00:27:15,239 --> 00:27:16,119
The above 5 players

586
00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:17,000
will take part in this year's
College Student Ice League

587
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:18,119
on behalf of Wind Chaser.

588
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,199
I think everyone

589
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:21,479
is clear about it.

590
00:27:22,239 --> 00:27:23,880
This time, we have

591
00:27:23,959 --> 00:27:25,239
3 new players who
have got the qualification.

592
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:26,000
In common sense,

593
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,479
those who have trained for

594
00:27:27,719 --> 00:27:29,000
longer periods of time

595
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:30,079
should perform better than
the less experienced ones.

596
00:27:30,479 --> 00:27:31,719
But that's the truth about
competitive sports.

597
00:27:31,959 --> 00:27:32,880
You progress, or you regress.

598
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:34,359
This is no shortcut

599
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:35,599
other than training yourself
as hard as you can.

600
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,599
Remember

601
00:27:36,719 --> 00:27:37,719
what I've told you today.

602
00:27:39,239 --> 00:27:41,239
Championship is never

603
00:27:41,479 --> 00:27:43,479
the sole privilege of the talented.

604
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:51,199
You are all outstanding players.

605
00:27:51,959 --> 00:27:53,079
As long as you train yourselves
hard enough

606
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:55,239
and you have confidence and resolution,

607
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,479
then you will definitely

608
00:27:56,599 --> 00:27:58,000
do better.

609
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,599
Do you have the confidence?

610
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:01,760
Yes!

611
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:02,839
Do you have the resolution?

612
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,520
Yes!

613
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:04,599
Louder.

614
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,839
Yes!

615
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:07,719
Good! Dismiss!

616
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,479
The training will continue
in the afternoon.

617
00:28:11,479 --> 00:28:12,319
Let's go.

618
00:28:14,719 --> 00:28:15,479
Coach Xiao.

619
00:28:17,719 --> 00:28:18,359
I made it!

620
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,719
I did!

621
00:28:20,239 --> 00:28:21,239
So from now on,

622
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,000
you become a formal member

623
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:22,880
of Wind Chaser.

624
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:24,119
Keep up the good work.

625
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,359
Keep going!

626
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,359
Thank you, Coach Xiao.

627
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:43,839
Coach Zhuang.

628
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:45,479
Your words really

629
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,359
cheered the team up today.

630
00:28:46,719 --> 00:28:48,239
The fighting spirit is

631
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:49,079
indispensable to
competitive sports athletes,

632
00:28:49,239 --> 00:28:50,079
especially before the game.

633
00:28:51,199 --> 00:28:52,479
But I think cheering them up alone

634
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:53,319
is not sufficient to solving the problem

635
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:54,719
of their current incompetence.

636
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,599
To win,

637
00:28:55,719 --> 00:28:56,760
they need real strength.

638
00:28:57,599 --> 00:28:58,479
Coach Xiao.

639
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:01,079
I think I've made it

640
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:02,239
very clear.

641
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:03,959
Luo Xiaoyi

642
00:29:04,479 --> 00:29:06,359
is not qualified for the Ice League.

643
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,680
Sisi,

644
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,079
it seems that Coach Zhuang

645
00:29:18,479 --> 00:29:19,199
is not going to

646
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:20,680
let Luo Xiaoyi
participate in the Ice League.

647
00:29:21,439 --> 00:29:22,439
That's her own choice.

648
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,760
She's got no one to blame.

649
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,760
But the Flyers has Yu Bingling
in their team,

650
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:27,760
you are the only one

651
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:28,920
who can compete with her

652
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,280
other than Luo Xiaoyi.

653
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,479
This time Wind Chaser

654
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:32,920
has to count on you for everything.

655
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,239
Do you really think

656
00:29:35,199 --> 00:29:36,000
I can compete with her?

657
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,239
Sure.

658
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,000
You were playing the supporter role

659
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:39,760
for Luo Xiaoyi.

660
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,000
But now the time

661
00:29:41,439 --> 00:29:42,520
to show your real capabilities

662
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:43,560
is finally coming.

663
00:29:43,959 --> 00:29:44,479
This has never

664
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,560
happened before.

665
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:46,599
Keep going!

666
00:29:47,239 --> 00:29:48,400
I believe you will make it.

667
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,270
(Pub of Times)

668
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,920
Thank you.

669
00:30:06,719 --> 00:30:07,760
How are the things going
in the team?

670
00:30:08,479 --> 00:30:09,239
As usual.

671
00:30:10,239 --> 00:30:11,160
But the candidate list
for the College Student Ice League

672
00:30:11,239 --> 00:30:11,920
has been announced.

673
00:30:12,959 --> 00:30:13,800
Like I'd expected,

674
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:15,400
you weren't there.

675
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,040
Well, I'd rather not go.

676
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,400
What's the big deal?

677
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,920
It'd be fun to see

678
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:25,040
what good results

679
00:30:25,239 --> 00:30:26,560
those imbeciles can achieve.

680
00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:28,079
Don't say that.

681
00:30:29,239 --> 00:30:29,920
We have 3 new players this time

682
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,160
enrolled.

683
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:35,920
Is Shen Zhengyi one of them?

684
00:30:38,239 --> 00:30:39,680
She's making progress fast.

685
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,040
That's the best she can do.

686
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,439
Nothing impressive like what you said.

687
00:30:49,479 --> 00:30:50,400
Just a while ago,

688
00:30:50,479 --> 00:30:51,599
she couldn't even do curve skating,

689
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,959
but she could still
persuade Coach Zhuang

690
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:53,800
to let her join the team.

Now,

692
00:30:55,439 --> 00:30:56,439
she's got herself
into the Ice League,

693
00:30:57,199 --> 00:30:58,000
and has been recognized by Coach Zhuang

694
00:30:58,079 --> 00:30:59,079
in such a short time.

695
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,680
That's quite something.

696
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,199
Wait and see.

697
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,599
Zhuang Yue will regret her decision.

698
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:14,959
I'm done.

699
00:31:15,479 --> 00:31:16,439
I'm going for training.

700
00:31:17,199 --> 00:31:17,959
Finish the meal.

701
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,160
I've got no time.

702

Just wrap it up.

Sorry.

705
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:30,599
I have had difficulties
with those postures

706
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,719
lately.

It doesn't matter.
It's not your problem.

You just need more practice.

We both passed.

She deserves a reward from you,
right?

721

727
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:05,599
come on,
give her some encouragement!

728
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,599
Stop doing that, no way.

729
00:32:07,719 --> 00:32:08,439
It's expressed spiritually.

730
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,640
You don't have to show it
in action.

731

Stop making fun of them.

732

Yes,

733

it's all spiritual.

734
00:32:13,199 --> 00:32:14,040
Spiritual encouragement?

735
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:15,040
What kind of encouragement is that?

736
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,280
He did encourage me.

737
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,239
He gave me the victory cake,

738
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,280
right?

739
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,800

They are quite different matters.

743
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:36,800
Let me encourage you
one more time.

in the same team.

00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,840
(How severe was his injury?)

860
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,600
(Will he be able to recover?)

861
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,080
(His palm muscle tendon)

862
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:28,879
(was cut,)

863
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:30,719
(causing the damage to
vascular nerves.)

864
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:32,800
(This won't affect his normal life,)

865
00:39:33,439 --> 00:39:34,439
(but he will not be able to)

866
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,719
(perform lifts in pairs skating)

867
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,840
(any longer.)

868
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,800
What are you doing?
What's going on here?

869
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:44,360
Coach Ma.

870
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:45,439
Lie down.

871
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:46,560
What if your hand gets hit?

872
00:39:46,879 --> 00:39:47,760
It's just a small cut on my hand.

873
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,560
There is nothing wrong
with my other body parts.

874
00:39:49,959 --> 00:39:51,320
It doesn't make sense
lying on the bed all the time.

875
00:39:53,479 --> 00:39:54,080
What did the doctor say?

876
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,159
When can I be discharged?

877
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:56,959
You just had the operation

878
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,000
and the anesthetic is
still working.

879
00:39:59,080 --> 00:39:59,639
Do you still want to

880
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:00,639
be discharged?

881
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,679
Did the doctor tell you

882
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:04,159
when I can recover then?

883
00:40:06,439 --> 00:40:07,280
It takes at least 100 days to recover

884
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,280
for injuries like this.

885
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,560
100 days?

886
00:40:09,959 --> 00:40:11,280
For such a small injury?

887
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:13,360
If I lie here for 100 days,

888
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,000
then I won't make it

889
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,120
to neither the Ice League
nor the Ling Yun Cup.

890
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,120
Then...

891
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:21,439
It's ok.

892
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:22,719
If you can't join the contest
this time,

893
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,639
then next time.

894
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:24,800
Where there's health,

895
00:40:24,879 --> 00:40:25,800
there's hope.

896
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,719
What about Xiao Qing

897
00:40:30,879 --> 00:40:31,879
if I can't join the contest this time?

898
00:40:32,879 --> 00:40:33,520
I'm okay.

899
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:35,360
Let's practice together after
you fully recover.

900
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:40,080
Hello, Coach Zhuang.

901
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,040
Coach Zhuang. Why are you here?

902
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:46,000
Xiao Qing,

903
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:46,800
take this.

904
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,159
Come with me.
We need to talk.

905
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:00,239
I cooked bone soup for you.

906
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,080
Let me get you some.

907
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:05,879
Thank you.

908
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,520
But I'm not in the mood.

909
00:41:09,439 --> 00:41:11,280
Fine, I'll leave it here.

910
00:41:11,879 --> 00:41:13,520
Take it when you want.

911
00:41:29,879 --> 00:41:32,360
Do you wanna call your dad?

912
00:41:32,439 --> 00:41:33,439
No.

913
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,159
But you got injured.

914
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,360
He has to know it.

915
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,000
No need to tell him.

916
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,520
It's not a big injury anyway.

917
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,080
He will have to work tomorrow.

918
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,280
It won't help calling him

919
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,159
all the way up here.

920
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,800
Can you just put yourself in his shoes?

921
00:41:49,719 --> 00:41:51,719
Ok.

922
00:41:57,879 --> 00:41:59,639
I've talked to the doctor.

923
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:01,360
He said it was not a serious injury.

924
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:03,600
But given your current situation,

925
00:42:03,919 --> 00:42:05,000
good rest is a must.

926
00:42:05,919 --> 00:42:06,800
Don't think about

927
00:42:07,159 --> 00:42:07,879
the contests.

928
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:10,000
What do you mean by
my current situation?

929
00:42:10,439 --> 00:42:11,439
What kind of situation
am I in right now?

930
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:12,600
Your situation?

931
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:13,879
Your situation is that you need a rest.

932
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,639
I've told you

933
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,000
that you need a good rest.

934
00:42:18,439 --> 00:42:19,000
Coach Zhuang,

935
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:20,639
the nurse asked us to pay the bill.

936
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,320
How is it going?

937
00:42:41,919 --> 00:42:42,919
We asked a few more experts,

938
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,600
and they have the same opinions.

939
00:42:45,919 --> 00:42:47,040
