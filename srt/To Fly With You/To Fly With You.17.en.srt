3
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:44,760
Go, go, go!

4
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,880
OK. Dismiss.

5
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,919
Thank you, coach.

6
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:14,919
Dismiss.

7
00:02:15,279 --> 00:02:16,119
You two stay for a while.

8
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,960
Fatty Shao!

9
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:21,720
What's wrong with you?

10
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,839
You've been working too hard today.

11
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:23,919
Is this hard?

12
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,160
It's nothing.

13
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:26,800
Are you okay with it?

14
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:29,360
Come on. She...

15
00:02:32,559 --> 00:02:33,320
She is waiting for you.

16
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:34,240
Shao Beisheng.

17
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,360
Let's go.

18
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,000
Well, where are you going?

19
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:41,039
Li Mi? Why are you here?

20
00:02:42,399 --> 00:02:43,600
Didn't Shao Beisheng tell you?

21
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,960
We are also here

22
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,000
for joint training.

23
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,399
Welcome!

24
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,080
Well...

25
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:49,520
I need to talk with Shao Beisheng

26
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,320
alone.

27
00:02:51,119 --> 00:02:52,839
Li Mi has just arrived.

28
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,399
I'll show him around.

29
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,839
No. I...

30
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,559
The school is quite big.
Let's look around. Come on.

31
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,440
Talk to you later.

32
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:03,119
Shao Beisheng!

33
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,399
So weird.

34
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:13,399
Master.

35
00:03:15,399 --> 00:03:16,279
Knock at the door.

36
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,199
I'll next time.

37
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,240
Master,

38
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,199
I'm here today

39
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,399
to thank you,

40
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,559
and bring you some gift.

41
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,360
I'll take it then.

42
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,240
Look. Is it good?

43
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:38,720
What happened?

44
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,050
(Zhu Lele asked Qu Zhi for advice
on the gift to some guy)

45
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,279
Who gave this to you?

46
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,000
What do you mean?

47
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,960
Who gave you this?

48
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:46,399
Zhu Lele!

49
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,160
What's... what's wrong, master?

50
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:53,119
I got up too fast.

51
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:54,320
Too fast.

52
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:55,839
- Well, have a seat.
- A little bit dizzy.

53
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,399
I'm okay. I just got up too fast.

54
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:05,399
I'm gonna ask her out tomorrow.

55
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,839
Here you are.

56
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,480
Your rose latte.

57
00:04:38,559 --> 00:04:39,920
Enjoy it.

58
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:42,480
What do you think
Shao Beisheng means by that?

59
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,799
He doesn't reply to my messages.

60
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:45,839
Every time I went to him,

61
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:46,679
he ran away from me.

62
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:47,600
Why is it so difficult for me

63
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,760
to terminate the agreement?

64
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,119
You should have told me about it.

65
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,799
I have already apologized
to you about that.

66
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:54,920
Fine.

67
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,640
I'm a very tolerant person.

68
00:04:57,239 --> 00:04:59,920
Let me break it down for you.

69
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:01,640
He must have a crush on you.

70
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,519
Don't be ridiculous.

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,399
When he

72
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,720
signed the agreement with me,

73
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,799
the first clause was that

74
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,480
I am not allowed
to have a crush on him.

75
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:09,880
How is it possible now?

76
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:11,760
This agreement was signed so early.

77
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:12,839
I think that

78
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:14,279
he has long regretted it.

79
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,079
Besides, what are you worrying about?

80
00:05:16,239 --> 00:05:16,720
Your agreement

81
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:18,079
is about to expire, isn't it?

82
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,839
He has to terminate the agreement
in due course.

83
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:20,920
It's just that I'm afraid of

84
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,200
delaying Xiao Qing.

85
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,880
What can be delayed?

86
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,799
I think that

87
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:26,880
if Shao Beisheng really likes Xiao Qing,

88
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,679
he would've already begged you

89
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,920
to terminate the agreement.

90
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,720
Am I right?

91
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,440
You mean

92
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,119
he doesn't like Xiao Qing?

93
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,320
How is it possible?

94
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,799
Xiao Qing is so beautiful.

95
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,119
And she also has a great personality.

96
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,320
If he doesn't like her,

97
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,480
who does he like then?

98
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,480
He is too picky!

99
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:46,799
No one can figure out

100
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,760
what love is.

101
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,720
Don't worry about them.

102
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:50,040
Worry about yourself instead.

103
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,440
Everything is going as usual for me.

104
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,959
I have nothing to worry about.

105
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,679
Wang Jun again?

106
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,000
He asked me to go out

107
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,200
to a technology exhibition tomorrow.

108
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:17,279
Do you like it?

109
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:20,760
No one can figure out

110
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,160
what love is.

111
00:06:45,359 --> 00:06:45,880
Why do you think

112
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,799
she has to terminate the agreement
with me now?

113
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,359
Why do you think they two

114
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,119
have a crush on each other?

115
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:58,200
Then why don't you want to

116
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:59,559
terminate the agreement with her now?

117
00:07:00,799 --> 00:07:01,799
I...

118
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,399
Just in case.

119
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,600
I heard that
the cooling-off period of love

120
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:08,440
is two months.

121
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,799
If in these two months,

122
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,640
Liu Fei suddenly comes to me

123
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,559
and I don't have a girlfriend then,

124
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,679
what should I do?

125
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,640
That's really a good excuse.

126
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,799
I'm not joking.

127
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:20,480
I'm serious.

128
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:21,640
Qu Zhi.

129
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,200
Yes, you're right.

130
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,640
Forget it. I'm tired now.

131
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,000
Please! You...

132
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,760
You haven't analyzed it for me.

133
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,440
Why exactly does

134
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,359
she suddenly want to

135
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,600
terminate the agreement?

136
00:07:36,679 --> 00:07:37,440
Bro,

137
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,839
I'm telling you.

138
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,440
There is only one reason for her

139
00:07:40,559 --> 00:07:41,239
to terminate the agreement.

140
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,239
What is it?

141
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:47,040
She's got a crush on someone.

142
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:14,959
Wang Jun.

143
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,600
Why are you here?

144
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,959
Qu Zhi told me that

145
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,080
he is also interested
in the exhibition.

146
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,679
Can't you just go there next time?

147
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,919
No, I can't.

148
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:43,599
Well, Lele,

149
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,840
I'm gonna call a cab first.

150
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:46,400
Okay.

151
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,119
Go.

152
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,159
Listen,

153
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,479
this is my first date

154
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:00,320
with a guy in my life.

155
00:09:00,479 --> 00:09:01,479
If you mess it up,

156
00:09:01,719 --> 00:09:02,679
I will...

157
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:03,599
On your first date,

158
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,280
you dress like this?

159
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:07,640
It's really tasteless of you.

160
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:08,880
I...

161
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,280
This scarf

162
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:11,799
is especially ugly.

163
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,200
You're here today to mess it up,
aren't you?

164
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,000
Go back!

165
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:18,760
What are you going to watch?

166
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,679
Technology exhibition, isn't it?

167
00:09:20,479 --> 00:09:22,080
No one knows more about technology
than I do.

168
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:23,280
Do you?

169
00:09:23,599 --> 00:09:24,119
No, you don't.

170
00:09:24,239 --> 00:09:25,400
You'll fail it as soon as you get there.

171
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,919
He'll find out that
you don't know much about it.

172
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,320
His crush on you will plummet.

173
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:32,400
Think about it.

174
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,039
I'm here to help you.

175
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,760
The cab is here.

176
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:40,039
Are you coming or not?

177
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:41,200
Let's go.

178
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,080
Watch out, fellow!

179
00:09:58,599 --> 00:09:59,239
Are you okay?

180
00:09:59,320 --> 00:09:59,799
I'm fine.

181
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,559
I'm sorry.

182
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:02,760
I didn't get you hurt, did I?

183
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,400
No, no.

184
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:10,840
Shen Zhengyi.

185
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,359
Stay there!

186
00:10:13,599 --> 00:10:14,159
Who are you?

187
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,599
I didn't get her hurt.

188
00:10:16,119 --> 00:10:16,799
What do you mean?

189
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:17,479
Who are you?

190
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:18,239
I'm sorry.

191
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:18,880
What's wrong with you?

192
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,000
What're you doing?

193
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:20,559
Sorry for what?

194
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,000
What are you doing?

195
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,760
Who is he?

196
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,520
Why did he give you water?

197
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:26,960
It's my water.

198
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,320
They are playing football there.

199
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,359
I have no idea who he is.

200
00:10:31,479 --> 00:10:32,000
Playing football?

201
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,919
I... I don't care who he is.

202
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:37,400
You have to remember

203
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,320
who you are now.

204
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,440
Don't always do something

205
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:40,479
that people may misunderstand.

206
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,200
Do you understand?

207
00:10:41,479 --> 00:10:42,159
I...

208
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,280
I have my pride.

209
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,200
You're very correct.

210
00:10:46,719 --> 00:10:47,799
But what can I do?

211
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,200
I always do something

212
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:50,200
that may make others

213
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,239
misunderstand.

214
00:10:51,719 --> 00:10:52,280
So I think

215
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,520
for the sake of your pride,

216
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,119
we should right now

217
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,280
terminate our agreement.

218
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,039
What do you think?

219
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,119
I...

220
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,239
It suddenly came to me that

221
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:01,840
I haven't fed my hamsters.

222
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,760
I gotta go. Bye.

223
00:11:04,119 --> 00:11:05,719
Give me back the water.

224
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:16,740
(Taste of Green Papaya Vietnam Cuisine)

225
00:11:17,359 --> 00:11:17,919
Lele,

226
00:11:18,239 --> 00:11:19,200
how do you think of

227
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,679
the new universe system

228
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,039
we just saw?

229
00:11:23,719 --> 00:11:24,760
I think...

230
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,320
The light is great.

231
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:31,359
Yes. That light is really cool.

232
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,320
Right.

233
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,359
Let's have Cantonese food today,

234
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:33,960
okay?

235
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:35,159
Great.

236
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,400
Cantonese food is my favorite.

237
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,400
What a coincidence! Me too!

238
00:11:38,479 --> 00:11:39,719
I like Cantonese food very much.

239
00:11:40,119 --> 00:11:41,599
I know we are the same.

240
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:43,679
Exactly.

241
00:11:50,239 --> 00:11:51,280
Take a seat.

242
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,359
Take a seat.

243
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,359
Wang Jun. Here.

244
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,719
I'm coming.

245
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,919
Order, please.

246
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,280
I'll order.

247
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,520
Scalded Broccoli,

248
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:16,799
Lily Bulbs and Celery,

249
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:19,599
Boiled Chinese Flowering Cabbage,

250
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,880
and Braised Baby Cabbage in Broth.

251
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:26,960
Yes! That's what I want!

252
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,119
Okay.

253
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,960
Please make it light.

254
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:32,039
Just a little bit oil and salt.

255
00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:32,840
Okay.

256
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,239
OK. Wait a minute.

257
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:40,239
Wang Jun,

258
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:42,479
get us some water, please.

259
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,119
After a whole afternoon,

260
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,239
we are all thirsty.

261
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:47,200
Just ask the waitress...

262
00:12:56,119 --> 00:12:57,280
Thank you for today.

263
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,840
What did I tell you?

264
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:03,200
No one knows more about love than I do.

265
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,039
Lele,

266
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,080
did you have enough for dinner?

267
00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:14,280
I noticed that you didn't eat much.

268
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:17,000
I'm keeping fit recently.

269
00:13:17,239 --> 00:13:17,960
I have to control my diet.

270
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:18,919
So I don't eat much.

271
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,760
"I'm keeping fit recently.
So I don't eat much."

272
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,880
Okay. Excuse me then.

273
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:30,919
Okay.

274
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,359
Bye.

275
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,479
Bye.

276
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,280
Why did you have your clothes changed?

277
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,880
Why are you here?

278
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,640
I'm waiting to catch the rat
that steals food.

279
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:23,719
Fabulous!

280
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,239
Slow down. No one shares.

281
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,159
I am telling you.

282
00:14:43,479 --> 00:14:44,919
It's such a terrible day.

283
00:14:45,479 --> 00:14:46,799
When we were at the exhibition
during the day,

284
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,400
I was so tired and sleepy.

285
00:14:48,719 --> 00:14:50,359
At the end of the day,
I still had to stay hungry

286
00:14:50,479 --> 00:14:51,799
and had Cantonese food without flavor.

287
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,159
I almost got fainted from hunger.

288
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,599
You deserved it!

289
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:56,200
After all, you promised him yourself.

290
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,960
It's okay to suffer a little

291
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,440
for the person I like.

292
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:02,840
It was just
a College Student Ice League.

293
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,200
You two made a real progress.

294
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:07,479
Well,

295
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:08,799
thanks to your play.

296
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,280
It was because that Wang Jun watched

297
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,200
me playing and

298
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,200
he got attracted by me.

299
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,559
Besides,

300
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:17,320
you didn't see

301
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:19,559
the way he looked
when he asked for my WeChat ID

302
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:20,640
in front of the vending machine.

303
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,559
He is so cute!

304
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,440
Vending machine?

305
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,799
He told me that day

306
00:15:28,599 --> 00:15:29,479
he ran out of money.

307
00:15:29,719 --> 00:15:30,960
Then he asked me to pay for him,

308
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,479
and added me in WeChat.

309
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:34,280
He said he would
transfer to me the money.

310
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,200
What else did he do?

311
00:15:37,599 --> 00:15:39,400
He said when I was on stage,

312
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:40,960
I looked glittering.

313
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,280
Expressing appreciation.

314
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,559
Later, he told me that

315
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,000
it was because what I put on stage

316
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,280
was too real

317
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,880
that it reminded him of

318
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,880
his bad experience in the past.

319
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,679
Showing misery to win sympathy.

320
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:56,359
And,

321
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:58,359
on the bus back,

322
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,880
I said I wanted some chocolate.

323
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,960
It was really

324
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:01,880
just a joke.

325
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:02,799
The whole box of chocolate

326
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,239
which girls around went crazy about,

327
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:06,599
was given to me.

328
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:09,520
Special treatment.

329
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,320
What are you talking about?

330
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:13,919
Nothing.

331
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:15,840
I guess

332
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,359
he didn't say he likes you,

333
00:16:17,479 --> 00:16:18,200
did he?

334
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:20,239
How do you know that?

335
00:16:21,359 --> 00:16:22,119
Nice!

336
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,400
But,

337
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:24,799
he doesn't have to say it.

338
00:16:28,359 --> 00:16:29,200
Is it good?

339
00:16:29,599 --> 00:16:30,719
He took it for me.

340
00:16:31,719 --> 00:16:32,400
This is...

341
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,280
Look at the shadow,

342
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:34,559
and the perspective.

343
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:36,280
It's full of affection.

344
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:38,000
If he has no affection for me,

345
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,080
how is it possible for him

346
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,799
to take such a good picture, right?

347
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,599
I'm aware actually

348
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,239
I'm normal.

349
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:51,520
Wang Jun

350
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,440
is the first person

351
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:53,359
in my life

352
00:16:54,119 --> 00:16:55,479
who says that I'm a person with a halo.

353
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,159
So if it is okay,

354
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,320
I hope this halo

355
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,400
can stay longer.

356
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,719
As long as he likes,

357
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:02,640
I can go to the technology exhibition

358
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,479
with him every day.

359
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:04,640
I can even

360
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,719
have Cantonese food every day with him.

361
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,599
You really like him that much?

362
00:17:40,239 --> 00:17:41,160
It was so embarrassing.

363
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:44,719
Mei,

364
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,640
when have I, Shao Beisheng,

365
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,719
been so ashamed?

366
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,400
Stop picking your feet.

367
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,000
I'm so embarrassed
that I want to pick my feet too.

368
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,920
Log in and play games with me.

369
00:17:57,479 --> 00:17:58,119
I'm not in a good mood.

370
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,199
No way.

371
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:00,719
I'm also in a bad mood.

372
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,520
Play by yourself.

373
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,880
Heartless.

374
00:18:10,479 --> 00:18:11,319
I just asked about

375
00:18:11,439 --> 00:18:12,520
Shen Zhengyi for you just now.

376
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,479
Good on you.

377
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:16,680
What do you have?

378
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,680
What do I have?

379
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:20,520
Wait until I finish this game.

380
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,520
I will play five times with you.

381
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,640
That's more like it.

382
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,199
I have asked many people,

383
00:18:31,199 --> 00:18:33,359
and Shen Zhengyi has no...

384
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:36,520
What are you talking about secretly?

385
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:38,680
Nothing.

386
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:39,839
We are talking about that tomorrow we...

387
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,599
Shen Zhengyi.

388
00:18:41,199 --> 00:18:42,079
What's wrong with Shen Zhengyi?

389
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,400
Shen Zhengyi has been too busy today.

390
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,520
She didn't go out with Shao Beisheng.

391
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:57,560
What can she be busy with?

392
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,280
I suppose, Shao Beisheng

393
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:00,520
made her mad again.

394
00:19:01,199 --> 00:19:03,400
Fatty Shao, it serves you right.

395
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:05,640
How about you beg me?

396
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:06,959
I'll teach you some tricks.

397
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:08,319
Leave it to yourself.

398
00:19:13,439 --> 00:19:14,280
You just keep being stubborn.

399
00:19:14,719 --> 00:19:15,520
You'll regret it sooner or later.

400
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:30,079
Go on.

401
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:33,959
Shen Zhengyi

402
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,280
has no crush on others.

403
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,680
Guys,

404
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,119
where is the toilet paper?

405
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,870
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team of
Lingbei University)

406
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,400
Morning.

407
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,560
Good morning.

408
00:19:58,839 --> 00:19:59,560
Good morning.

409
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,560
Morning.

410
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:02,920
Wind Chaser now is really different.

411
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,959
I used to train just for a little while,

412
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:05,959
and I started to feel exhausted.

413
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:07,000
Now no matter how tired I am,

414
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:07,959
I feel happy.

415
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,800
Why is this?

416
00:20:09,199 --> 00:20:09,880
You are

417
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:10,760
masochistic in a typical way.

418
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,640
I mean, Liu Sisi,

419
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,079
you are being masochistic yourself.

420
00:20:15,439 --> 00:20:16,280
Coach Zhuang has already

421
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,599
trained us so hard every day.

422
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,800
Then you have to abuse yourself

423
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,560
for another half an hour.

424
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,040
Can you be polite?

425
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,239
Call me sister, okay?

426
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,119
Okay, my sister.

427
00:20:24,199 --> 00:20:24,880
My sister is the best.

428
00:20:25,199 --> 00:20:26,680
Can you please help me

429
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,920
practice the 1500-meter
for one more time today?

430
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,040
Last time it was because of you

431
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,520
that I made it 2 minutes 50 seconds.

432
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,719
If I practice again this time,

433
00:20:32,239 --> 00:20:33,280
I'll defeat Shen Zhengyi.

434
00:20:34,439 --> 00:20:35,599
Let me think about it.

435
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,920
If you give me more sweet talking,

436
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,719
I can help you make it
2 minutes 49 seconds.

437
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:39,359
How do you like it?

438
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:41,119
You guys either don't skate at all,

439
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:42,439
or finish it in one minute.

440
00:20:43,719 --> 00:20:45,040
She is being jealous. Leave her alone.

441
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,280
How about this?

442
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,520
Tonight I will spend a fortune

443
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:49,719
to treat you to dinner.

444
00:20:50,199 --> 00:20:51,119
Really?

445
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:51,839
Come on!

446
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,400
I would've had less for lunch.

447
00:20:53,479 --> 00:20:53,920
Right?

448
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,920
I won't even drink water later.

449
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:55,800
I'm fine with that.

450
00:20:56,239 --> 00:20:57,319
How about

451
00:20:57,439 --> 00:20:58,800
you treat us

452
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,160
dinner and night snack together?

453
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:01,520
Right, right.

454
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:02,560
Each one of you

455
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,920
is so cruel!

456
00:21:04,439 --> 00:21:05,439
Tell me what else do you wanna have?

457
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,719
Excuse me for a minute.

458
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:44,319
I wanna have a word with you.

459
00:21:45,479 --> 00:21:46,599
The College Student Ice League is over.

460
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:48,280
Although we didn't

461
00:21:48,479 --> 00:21:49,359
win the championship,

462
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,239
I have seen

463
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,239
the spirit of hard work and cooperation

464
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,839
shown by everyone

465
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,400
on the court.

466
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,160
It's a pity that
Luo Xiaoyi failed to participate.

467
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,880
But for Ling Yun Cup afterwards,

468
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,719
Luo Xiaoyi will play with us.

469
00:22:05,239 --> 00:22:06,560
She'll work together with us.

470
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,479
Under the guidance of Coach Zhuang,

471
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:09,839
I believe,

472
00:22:10,479 --> 00:22:11,239
we, Wind Chaser,

473
00:22:11,439 --> 00:22:12,560
will play

474
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,599
a good game!

475
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,640
Xiaoyi, welcome back.

476
00:22:19,199 --> 00:22:20,160
Wait a minute.

477
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,880
Luo Xiaoyi can be back.

478
00:22:24,479 --> 00:22:25,719
But she has to examine herself

479
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,119
for what she did earlier.

480
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,439
And after she is back,

481
00:22:29,959 --> 00:22:30,560
she has to

482
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,839
obey the arrangement.

483
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,560
Can you do that?

484
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:36,560
Coach Zhuang,

485
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,079
there might be some misunderstanding.

486
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:40,479
It is Director Zhang
who invited me back.

487
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:52,199
Given the special circumstance today,

488
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,560
you take a day off.

489
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:55,119
Dismiss.

490
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:19,520
Where is my cup?

491
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,959
I'm concerned

492
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:29,280
how Coach Zhuang is doing right now.

493
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:31,239
The leader has made the order.

494
00:23:31,719 --> 00:23:33,239
What can Coach Zhuang do about it?

495
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,400
Anyway,

496
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,280
everything will be back
to the way it was.

497
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:38,040
Luo Xiaoyi is great indeed.

498
00:23:39,439 --> 00:23:41,239
If only

499
00:23:41,439 --> 00:23:42,439
we had won a gold medal...

500
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:43,680
We failed in College Student Ice league.

501
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,359
But it doesn't mean

502
00:23:44,479 --> 00:23:45,319
we'll also fail in Ling Yun Cup.

503
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,640
And I don't think Coach Zhuang

504
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,719
will compromise easily.

505
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,599
If she doesn't compromise,
she might get fired.

506
00:23:52,239 --> 00:23:53,040
How come?

507
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,640
But Luo Xiaoyi

508
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,040
went for competition without permission.

509
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,199
If it were us,

510
00:23:59,719 --> 00:24:00,800
we would've already got punished.

511
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:02,160
What about now?

512
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,640
Let alone to be punished,

513
00:24:04,239 --> 00:24:05,280
she even has someone backing her up.

514
00:24:06,239 --> 00:24:07,599
We should know
how much she's been favored.

515
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,199
Coach Zhuang isn't about to get fired,

516
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:11,800
is she?

517
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:15,079
Actually now

518
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,959
I kinda like her.

519
00:24:18,199 --> 00:24:19,359
Me too.

520
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,000
I think Wind Chaser now

521
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:24,400
is pretty good.

522
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,439
But it's not about us.

523
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,479
It is the achievement that matters.

524
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,439
Good achievement comes from practice.

525
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:30,560
Besides,

526
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,000
Coach Zhuang has told us that

527
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:33,599
all we should do
is to focus on the games.

528
00:24:33,719 --> 00:24:35,560
She'll take care of the rest.

529
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,599
Well, she is in trouble now.

530
00:24:37,719 --> 00:24:38,719
Shouldn't we help her?

531
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:52,920
I won't agree whatever you say.

532
00:24:53,439 --> 00:24:55,079
Luo Xiaoyi is indeed capable

533
00:24:55,199 --> 00:24:55,839
and talented.

534
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,119
But her biggest problem is

535
00:24:57,199 --> 00:24:58,640
lacking of organization and discipline.

536
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,760
If she is allowed to be back now,

537
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,479
it will only get worse in the future.

538
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:05,599
Look.

539
00:25:06,199 --> 00:25:07,599
She was not allowed to participate in
the College Student Ice League.

540
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,920
The leader is not happy with
our performance.

541
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,680
She went to

542
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,479
participate in

543
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:13,599
the Elite Qualification Contest,

544
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,280
and won the championship
and broke the record.

545
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,160
What shall the leader think of it?

546
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,000
Do you know how many people

547
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:21,000
want to poach her now?

548
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,280
Ling Yun Cup is to come.

549
00:25:24,479 --> 00:25:25,520
You are still giving her
the cold shoulder.

550
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,800
What if we fail Ling Yun Cup again?

551
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,839
I'm not sure

552
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:31,439
whether you can still make it or not.

553
00:25:31,719 --> 00:25:32,439
Whether I'm the chief coach or not,

554
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,920
it's not important.

555
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:35,119
But I won't allow

556
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,599
Luo Xiaoyi to destroy Wind Chaser's

557
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,560
cohesion that was just established.

558
00:25:40,479 --> 00:25:41,400
Director Zhang,

559
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,640
Luo Xiaoyi quit training.

560
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,199
She went out for the competition
without permission.

561
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:46,359
For things serious like that,

562
00:25:46,479 --> 00:25:47,400
we all indulge her.

563
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,800
For other players,

564
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,839
it is unfair.

565
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,599
I still insist that

566
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,959
if she doesn't recognize

567
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:53,640
her own problems,

568
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,319
doesn't apologize,

569
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:55,959
and doesn't disobey the arrangement,

570
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,920
I will never allow her to be back.

571
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,959
You're still so stubborn.

572
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,680
I'm telling you.

573
00:26:04,199 --> 00:26:05,079
The leader

574
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,680
has allowed her to be back.

575
00:26:08,479 --> 00:26:09,400
I invited you here.

576
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,599
I won't do nothing

577
00:26:10,719 --> 00:26:11,319
about this and let you
leave Wind Chaser

578
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,520
for this.

579
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,959
Director Zhang.
It's okay for me to leave.

580
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:16,959
But we can't change the principle.

581
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,199
- Excuse me!
- Excuse me!

582
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,119
Anything?

583
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:26,000
Director Zhang,

584
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,199
I request to participate in

585
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,239
the Short Track Speed Skating game
next month.

586
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,280
I request to participate in

587
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,520
Chris Cup,

588
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:31,760
National Short Track Speed Skating
Elite Game.

589
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:33,400
I don't wanna train today.

590
00:26:33,479 --> 00:26:34,000
Neither tomorrow.

591
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:34,880
Not the day after tomorrow.

592
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,599
I'm going to start training

593
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:36,359
three days from now.

594
00:26:36,719 --> 00:26:37,079
Excuse me!

595
00:26:37,199 --> 00:26:38,439
Stop!

596
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:39,719
You kids,

597
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:40,880
what a nonsense!

598
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:41,760
I think

599
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,880
we have a good point.

600
00:26:43,479 --> 00:26:44,719
Since we are all on the team,

601
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,199
we request to be treated equally.

602
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,719
The rights Luo Xiaoyi can enjoy,

603
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:48,839
shall also be conferred on us.

604
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,680
What's the nonsense?

605
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:53,760
Don't mess with the Director.

606
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,280
Director Zhang,

607
00:26:56,719 --> 00:26:57,359
we were

608
00:26:57,439 --> 00:26:58,439
indeed joking just now.

609
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,800
But we really have one request

610
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,000
that we'd like you to approve.

611
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,800
We request Luo Xiaoyi

612
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,400
to apologize to Coach Zhuang.

613
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:10,359
Since Xiaoyi is

614
00:27:10,439 --> 00:27:11,160
on the team,

615
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,199
she must abide by
the discipline of Wind Chaser.

616
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,520
We respect the leader,

617
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,239
and we also
have a high opinion of Luo Xiaoyi.

618
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,119
But we just request it

619
00:27:18,479 --> 00:27:20,119
to be fair to all the players.

620
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,280
Of course!

621
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:22,280
We will work hard.

622
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:23,880
The achievement in the past

623
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,280
can't represent that in the future.

624
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,280
For Ling Yun Cup,

625
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,000
we will definitely

626
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:28,239
achieve satisfactory results.

627
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,760
Enough?

628
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:43,400
I don't think you're exhausted yet.

629
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,719
To the off-ice training room.
Continue your training.

630
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,319
Yes.

631
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,479
Thank you, coach.

632
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,359
Thank you, Coach Zhuang.

633
00:27:52,479 --> 00:27:53,119
Thank you, Coach Zhuang.

634
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,479
Thank you, Director.

635
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Coach.

636
00:28:11,239 --> 00:28:12,119
Coach Zhuang.

637
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:13,280
I heard that

638
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,040
you took the team to Director Zhang.

639
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,280
They did it out of their own will.

640
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,479
What a nonsense!

641
00:28:18,959 --> 00:28:19,880
Then what did Director say?

642
00:28:20,719 --> 00:28:21,599
According to Director,

643
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,199
he agrees that
Luo Xiaoyi is not coming back for now.

644
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:27,920
I just don't get it.

645
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:29,439
Luo Xiaoyi is the best

646
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,479
in Wind Chaser.

647
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,400
The team depends on Luo Xiaoyi

648
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,280
to win the gold medal.

649
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,359
Coach Zhuang,

650
00:28:33,719 --> 00:28:34,119
why are you always

651
00:28:34,199 --> 00:28:35,280
against Luo Xiaoyi?

652
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,959
What did I do to her?

653
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:38,119
I've always treated

654
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,640
all the players equally.

655
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,800
I'd like to ask you, Coach Xiao.

656
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,079
Luo Xiaoyi quit training.

657
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:44,439
She went out for competition
without permission.

658
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,239
For things serious like this,

659
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:46,560
you just turned a blind eye?

660
00:28:46,719 --> 00:28:47,400
She can do whatever she wants

661
00:28:47,479 --> 00:28:48,920
just because she can win the gold medal?

662
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,400
Coach Xiao,

663
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,599
as long as I'm in Wind Chaser,

664
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,160
I will never

665
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:56,000
allow anyone to make an exception.

666
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:20,599
They said I am still being punished,

667
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,880
and I'm not allowed
to join the training.

668
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:26,280
Director Zhang has agreed

669
00:29:26,439 --> 00:29:27,560
my coming back, hasn't he?

670
00:29:28,719 --> 00:29:30,119
Now the team has decided that

671
00:29:30,199 --> 00:29:30,959
you have to examine yourself.

672
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:32,400
You have to apologize to Coach Zhuang.

673
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,479
Then you can come back.

674
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,160
Are you kidding me?

675
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,359
I'll go and talk to Director.

676
00:29:37,479 --> 00:29:38,280
Xiaoyi,

677
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:42,479
about your violation against the rules,

678
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:43,599
the whole team

679
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,040
has already protested to Director Zhang.

680
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,239
Traitors! They have cold feet.

681
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:52,280
Fine.

682
00:29:52,439 --> 00:29:52,920
Director Zhang can't

683
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:53,920
defend you anymore.

684
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:55,119
He is the leader,

685
00:29:55,439 --> 00:29:56,640
or he can't convince everyone.

686
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,319
How about you go to Coach Zhuang

687
00:29:58,439 --> 00:29:59,119
and make an apology?

688
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,479
It's important to be back.

689
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:04,599
You want me to apologize to Zhuang Yue?

690
00:30:05,199 --> 00:30:06,119
That's impossible.

691
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,160
How much effort did it take you

692
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:09,319
to be qualified?

693
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,000
Are you not going to
play in Ling Yun Cup?

694
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:13,439
No matter how reluctant you are,

695
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,599
I hope you can figure out

696
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,040
which is more important.

697
00:30:17,239 --> 00:30:18,319
After Zhuang Yue came here,

698
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,359
she took your position.

699
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:19,959
Because of her,

700
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:21,199
I was out of my special training.

701
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,359
If it weren't her,

702
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,319
I wouldn't have to go out

703
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,640
and play for the Elite Challenge.

704
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,800
You want me to apologize to her.

705
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,719
I can't do it.

706
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:29,719
In the College Student Ice League,

707
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,760
they didn't even win
a single gold medal,

708
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,760
did they?

709
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,239
The team still has to depend on me
for Ling Yun Cup.

710
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:35,839
She is the one who should beg for mercy.

711
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Not me.

712
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:58,530
(Director's Office)

713
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:01,880
Come in.

714
00:31:02,479 --> 00:31:03,560
Director, you are looking for me?

715
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,640
Take a seat.

716
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,160
Stop writing.

717
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,560
Coach Xiao is suspended.

718
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,719
Really?

719
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,359
Is it because of Luo Xiaoyi?

720
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,119
Yes, it is because of Luo Xiaoyi.

721
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:21,719
She doesn't want to
admit the mistakes she made.

722
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:23,359
Coach Xiao was blamed for her fault

723
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,839
and got suspended.

724
00:31:25,199 --> 00:31:25,959
How could this happen?

725
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,199
Why did you do this?

726
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:55,359
I just want to help you.

727
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:57,160
To help me?

728
00:31:57,719 --> 00:31:58,079
If you want to help me,

729
00:31:58,199 --> 00:31:59,560
you should be on my side.

730
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:01,319
Even the team didn't get me punished,

731
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,119
why did you request

732
00:32:03,199 --> 00:32:04,119
to be punished?

733
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,800
It is just because I'm on your side that

734
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,760
I did this.

735
00:32:08,479 --> 00:32:09,880
Since you won't apologize,

736
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:11,000
and other players refuse to

737
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:12,000
accept you to be back,

738
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:13,160
this is the only thing I can do.

739
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:16,079
If you are not here due to this,

740
00:32:16,479 --> 00:32:17,599
everyone will blame me

741
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:19,239
for forcing you out

742
00:32:19,239 --> 00:32:20,520
once I'm back.

743
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:25,800
Luo Xiaoyi,

744
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:28,160
I hope you can figure it out that

745
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:29,199
you don't win the champion

746
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,040
for me.

747
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,040
Why are you reconciled

748
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,199
to leave like this

749
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,319
since you have been on the team
for so many years?

750
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:44,280
I've talked with Zhengyi

751
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,040
about her training for 1500-meter game

752
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:45,599
as well.

753
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:46,479
But Coach Zhuang

754
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,479
should still be thinking about it.

755
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,719
As a coach, I hope

756
00:32:48,719 --> 00:32:49,560
you believe in Zhengyi.

757
00:32:50,479 --> 00:32:51,439
As long as you work well,

758
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,119
there is no reason for Coach Zhuang

759
00:32:53,199 --> 00:32:54,040
to disagree.

760
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:10,920
Still not answering your call?

761
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,040
How... how about this?

762
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:14,839
Call Luo Xiaoyi

763
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:15,680
and ask her about it.

764
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,920
Zhu Lele, don't talk nonsense.

765
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,560
My brother helped Luo Xiaoyi

766
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,479
for a reason.

767
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:22,760
Luo Xiaoyi has a brother

768
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:23,640
named Luo Xiaofeng.

769
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:25,479
He and my brother were good friends.

770
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:27,400
There was one time
my brother was in a bad mood.

771
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,319
They went to an undeveloped lake
for a break.

772
00:33:29,959 --> 00:33:31,640
Her brother passed away by accident.

773
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,400
My brother has been suffering
since then.

774
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,680
He vowed to

775
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,400
win the world championship
for Luo Xiaofeng

776
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,560
anyway.

777
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:39,920
You really have no idea

778
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:40,560
how far he can push himself

779
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,040
every time he is on the training.

780
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:43,760
But at last,

781
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:45,400
he didn't get the championship.

782
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:47,199
So the reason why Coach Xiao

783
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:48,479
has been so nice to Luo Xiaoyi

784
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:51,280
is that he wants to train her
to be a champion.

785
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:52,400
No more talking.

786
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,280
I have to look for my brother.

787
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:55,040
Slow down.

788
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,119
Gosh, where is he now?

789
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,680
Oh my god.

790
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,040
It turns out that Coach Xiao

791
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,840
has been suffering so much
for so long.

792
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:12,639
Why can't I control my mouth?

793
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:13,919
Under this circumstance,

794
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,040
I'm still gossiping about him.

795
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,760
Fine.

796
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,040
Coach Xiao.

797
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,199
Coach Xiao, why are you here?

798
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:41,479
We couldn't reach you.

799
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:42,840
Are you okay?

800
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,320
I'm fine.

801
00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:45,399
I can handle

802
00:34:45,479 --> 00:34:46,399
my own business.

803
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,639
Don't worry about me.

804
00:34:57,479 --> 00:34:58,320
Zhengyi,

805
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,560
do you think I'm a good coach?

806
00:35:02,959 --> 00:35:04,560
Of course you are!

807
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:05,919
You are always the first one

808
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,120
to arrive at every training session.

809
00:35:08,479 --> 00:35:09,120
Not only will you

810
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:10,399
check our protective gears,

811
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,959
but also supervise our practice

812
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:13,040
and observe the mood

813
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:14,360
of each one of us.

814
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,239
Coach Xiao, this is for you.

815
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:35,639
For me,

816
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,080
you are not only a good coach,

817
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,679
but also a good guide.

818
00:35:41,479 --> 00:35:42,520
I am really grateful to you.

819
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,919
Sometimes, I really don't know

820
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,199
how to thank you.

821
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,479
As long as you can make achievement,

822
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:51,959
for me,

823
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,199
it will be the best thing.

824
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,360
Also,

825
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,679
about the training

826
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,840
for the 1500-meter game
I've talked to you about earlier,

827
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,360
how do you like it?

828
00:36:02,919 --> 00:36:05,639
1500-meter Short Track Speed Skating?

829
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:07,479
This seems

830
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,320
too difficult for me.

831
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:10,959
It not only requires speed,

832
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,840
but also endurance

833
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,639
and tactical cooperation.

834
00:36:15,479 --> 00:36:16,399
You've done your homework?

835
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,199
My mom used to be

836
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:21,239
a player of 1500-meter
Short Track Speed Skating.

837
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,360
So I know a little bit about it.

838
00:36:23,919 --> 00:36:24,679
Your mom used to be

839
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,479
a speed skating player?

840
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:26,520
Then why didn't she

841
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,639
allow you to join a professional team?

842
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:31,080
She retired due to injury.

843
00:36:31,919 --> 00:36:33,320
Probably because of this,

844
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:36,120
she didn't want the same thing
to happen to me.

845
00:36:36,399 --> 00:36:37,239
What's your mother's name?

846
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,399
Which team was she in?

847
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,760
Wang Limin.

848
00:36:42,399 --> 00:36:44,520
I'm not really sure
what team she was in.

849
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,520
In my family,

850
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:48,120
this is like

851
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,679
a secret that can't be mentioned.

852
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,639
Although I am curious,

853
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,919
the details...

854
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:56,399
I can check it out for you.

855
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,080
You just focus on considering
taking part in the 1500-meter game.

856
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,199
Really?

857
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,320
Then I don't have to think about it.

858
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,199
Coach Xiao,

859
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:05,479
if you think I'm okay with it,

860
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,639
I believe I can make it.

861
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:25,060
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team of
Lingbei University)

862
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,040
Before the training today,
there is one thing I need to say.

863
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:30,800
Due to Coach Xiao's personal reasons,

864
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,360
he will temporarily
stop his coaching work.

865
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:36,959
Also...

866
00:37:37,479 --> 00:37:38,399
Excuse me!

867
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,760
Coach Zhuang,

868
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:53,080
I'm sorry.

869
00:37:56,679 --> 00:37:58,239
I stopped training at will,

870
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,360
disobeyed the arrangement,

871
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:02,239
talked back to you,

872
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,479
and disturbed others' training.

873
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,800
These are all wrong behaviors.

874
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:08,959
I apologize to you.

875
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,239
I will never

876
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:11,399
make the same mistake again.

877
00:38:16,399 --> 00:38:17,239
Back to the team.

878
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:21,919
One more thing.

879
00:38:26,919 --> 00:38:28,399
It was my idea to stop the training.

880
00:38:29,399 --> 00:38:31,199
It was also my idea

881
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:33,080
to sign up for the Elite
Competition for College Students.

882
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,360
They have nothing to do with Coach Xiao.

883
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,239
I hope there will be no rumors about it.

884
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,239
Thank you.

885
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,080
Thank you, Coach Zhuang.

886
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:56,919
The focus of today's training

887
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:57,959
is endurance training.

888
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,959
Okay, let's warm up.

889
00:39:09,919 --> 00:39:10,560
Yiyi,

890
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,560
how are you doing recently?

891
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:13,840
I'm fine.

892
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,639
Is my mom still mad?

893
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,120
I'm afraid to go home.

894
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:18,800
I'll take care of your mom.

895
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,000
I'll figure it out.

896
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:21,919
Is there anything you would like to eat?

897
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:23,080
I'll send it over to you.

898
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:25,239
I want my mom's cooking.

899
00:39:26,399 --> 00:39:26,840
Your mom is here.

900
00:39:26,959 --> 00:39:27,560
I gotta go.

901
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:28,239
Shen Jiacheng,

902
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,320
I'm doing the laundry.

903
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:30,479
Do you have any clothes to wash?

904
00:39:30,959 --> 00:39:32,199
Yes.

905
00:39:34,399 --> 00:39:35,399
Help me with this one.

906
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:36,840
By your hands.

907
00:39:36,959 --> 00:39:37,840
Why are you so fussy?

908
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,040
Rub a bit.

909
00:40:07,959 --> 00:40:08,879
Shen Jiacheng,

910
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,280
the laundry detergent bought that day...

911
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,159
What are you doing?

912
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,520
I...

913
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,760
I'm hungry.

914
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,719
Why do you put the food

915
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,080
into a bag?

916
00:40:23,399 --> 00:40:24,520
Who do you want to bring it to?

917
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,520
Zhengyi has been competing recently.

918
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:27,320
She must have lost weight.

919
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:29,280
I wanna bring her some.

920
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,199
Aren't you doing the laundry?

921
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,639
Not yet.

922
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,520
No wonder you're sneaking today.

923
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:41,280
That's how it goes?

924
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,320
Darling,

925
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,520
don't you miss our daughter?

926
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:48,280
If you didn't miss her,

927
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,959
you wouldn't have made
so many of her favorites.

928
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,399
I have the right to miss her.

929
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,280
I also have the right not to meet her.

930
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:55,280
Anyway.

931
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,520
I'll go see her.

932
00:40:57,399 --> 00:40:58,080
Shen Jiacheng,

933
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,399
don't you understand
what I'm talking about,

934
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,280
or don't you wanna listen to me?

935
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:02,879
Give it back.

936
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:07,399
You're going a little bit far.

937
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:08,959
You won't let our daughter back home,

938
00:41:09,399 --> 00:41:10,479
and you won't let me see her.

939
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:11,399
You can see her.

940
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:12,639
But don't take my stuff.

941
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:14,840
Wang Limin!

942
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,199
You... You...

943
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,520
Do you have to do this?

944
00:41:18,959 --> 00:41:19,639
If you have to do this,

945
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:21,879
I... I will...

946
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:22,879
What are you going to do?

947
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:25,159
What are you going to do?

948
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,080
I...

949
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,080
What?

950
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:29,959
If Yiyi can't eat it,

951
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,080
I won't eat either.

952
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:35,040
You're going on a hunger strike?

953
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,520
Yes, a hunger strike!

954
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,159
This is good.

955
00:41:56,399 --> 00:41:57,399
It is mainly because
Beisheng can eat a lot.

956
00:41:57,719 --> 00:41:58,320
I heard from my master that

957
00:41:58,399 --> 00:41:59,719
he can have 60 dumplings for one meal.

958
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,280
Wang Jun.

959
00:42:05,719 --> 00:42:06,280
Hello.

960
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:07,959
Hello.

961
00:42:08,879 --> 00:42:10,280
Are you going to get on the ice?

962
00:42:11,399 --> 00:42:12,399
Yes. Get on the ice.

963
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,879
Well, good luck then!

964
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:18,159
OK. You too.

965
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:22,600
Good luck.

966
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:23,959
Good luck.

967
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,479
Look! He is so good!

968
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:32,679
Look!

969
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,360
Look!

970
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:51,159
So handsome!

971
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,080
Come on. Let's start our training.

972
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:04,520
The arrival of Flyer

973
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:05,959
has interfered with our training.

974
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,199
What's in Coach Ma's mind?

975
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,760
What's the point of joint training?

976
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,390
