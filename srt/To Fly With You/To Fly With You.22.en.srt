3
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:38,920
I... I know

4
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,720
I was so wrong.

5
00:01:39,839 --> 00:01:40,760
But I have explained

6
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:41,519
everything

7
00:01:41,639 --> 00:01:42,319
to Xiao Qing.

8
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,279
Right, Xiao Qing?

9
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,639
Can you explain it for me?

10
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:45,959
I'm begging you.

11
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:53,279
Right.

12
00:01:53,919 --> 00:01:55,080
The confession was an accident.

13
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:56,959
So I...

14
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,519
But I accepted it

15
00:01:57,639 --> 00:01:58,760
sincerely,

16
00:02:00,919 --> 00:02:01,919
because I like you.

17
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,959
Shao Beisheng.

18
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,279
it's fine that you don't like me.

19
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,479
But you should respect me.

20
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,279
What did you promise me?

21
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,320
And what are you doing now?

22
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:20,520
I...

23
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,279
But, Xiao Qing,

24
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,639
you told me that day...

25
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,639
I was lying to you.

26
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,160
But I asked you whether you like

27
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,080
Shao Beisheng or not so many times.

28
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,600
You said you only

29
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,279
treated him as a friend.

30
00:02:31,399 --> 00:02:32,279
You don't like him at all.

31
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:33,639
Am I right?

32
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,520
Now he is confessing to you.

33
00:02:40,399 --> 00:02:41,919
What exactly do you have in your mind?

34
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,639
Tell him.

35
00:03:15,399 --> 00:03:16,399
Just friends?

36
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,960
Really?

37
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,479
I did say that.

38
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,839
But...

39
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,639
Fine.

40
00:03:50,839 --> 00:03:51,960
It turns out I'm the fool.

41
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,960
Sorry.

42
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,279
Shen Zhengyi.

43
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,320
I'm just asking you one more time.

44
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:17,519
Do you like Shao Beisheng or not?

45
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,279
Yes, I do.

46
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,440
So you have been lying to me,

47
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:31,440
right?

48
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,200
I didn't lie to you.

49
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:35,959
From the beginning, I didn't know

50
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:37,040
what the affection is.

51
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:39,079
Later I have known about it.

52
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,399
Although I like him,

53
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:41,959
when I knew

54
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,720
you were together,

55
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:44,440
I have been keeping away from him.

56
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,040
But what have you done?

57
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,040
Why did you lie to me that

58
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,279
you were together?

59
00:06:04,679 --> 00:06:05,559
Xiao Qing.

60
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:16,160
Alright. Alright.

61
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:18,359
Come on. Come on.

62
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:20,720
Stop crying.

63
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:23,600
Stop crying.

64
00:06:32,679 --> 00:06:33,920
I've only been away for a few days.

65
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,440
How did this happen?

66
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:37,679
What should I do now?

67
00:06:41,559 --> 00:06:42,959
Does Shao Beisheng know

68
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,920
you like him now?

69
00:06:46,679 --> 00:06:48,399
Then it's a little bit tricky.

70
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:49,679
Shao Beisheng and Xiao Qing

71
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,679
have already been together.

72
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,839
When Xiao Qing just asked you

73
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,279
whether you like Shao Beisheng or not,

74
00:06:53,559 --> 00:06:54,720
why did you admit it?

75
00:06:55,679 --> 00:06:56,799
They are not together.

76
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:58,920
Then...

77
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,720
What's the situation?

78
00:07:21,799 --> 00:07:23,200
You made it clear to Shen Zhengyi?

79
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,440
Yes.

80
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,320
Isn't that a good thing?

81
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,440
She made it clear to me.

82
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,440
We are just friends.

83
00:07:50,799 --> 00:07:52,920
You mean that Xiao Qing lied to you,

84
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:54,320
and you misunderstood Shao Beisheng?

85
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,320
Therefore,

86
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:56,079
that confession

87
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,279
was a mistake.

88
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:01,839
Qu Zhi didn't even tell me

89
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,720
about such a big thing.

90
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,399
It is not

91
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,839
what a friend should do.

92
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,679
Well...

93
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:15,519
You have to tell

94
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,799
Shao Beisheng about it right now.

95
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,279
How can I tell him?

96
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:19,519
Through WeChat!

97
00:08:19,679 --> 00:08:20,440
Let me help you.

98
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:22,679
I have unfriended him.

99
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,959
Add him again.

100
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,160
Just do it!

101
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:47,679
What happened?

102
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,080
She added me to Wechat.

103
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:51,719
Who?

104
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:53,440
Shen Zhengyi.

105
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:00,559
Let me add her first.

106
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:03,200
What are you doing?

107
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:05,440
Be a man!

108
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,320
She treated you only as a friend.

109
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:09,559
You have to show your attitude
with actions.

110
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,080
She can only be your girlfriend,

111
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:12,799
instead of a friend.

112
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,799
I have to add her first!

113
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:18,799
No, you can't!

114
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:19,799
Listen to me!

115
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:22,200
You can't!

116
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:24,159
Not now at least.

117
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:29,719
Lie down and sleep.

Xiao Qing.

123
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:34,960
In fact, since you were young,

124
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:36,200
you have been very outstanding,

125
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:37,559
and have your own ideas.

126
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:39,080
I've always

127
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,159
been proud of you.

128
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,080
However,

129
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,520
I also wanna tell you one thing.

130
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,039
Don't ruin your future

131
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:46,559
for someone

132
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,159
who is destined not to belong to you.

134
00:10:58,799 --> 00:10:59,719
I have other plans.

Don't worry.

136
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:12,400
The friend application hasn't
been approved yet?

137
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:15,799
Don't be discouraged.

138
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,080
He may also

139
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,679
go to bed early

140
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,239
and miss it.

141
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,080
Go over there.

142
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:31,719
How can you break the ice

143
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,679
if you don't take the initiative?

144
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:37,520
Keep a high profile.

145
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,080
You go first.

146
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,799

(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team of

150

You didn't even tell me about

151
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,039
such a big thing, right?

152
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,159
For such a big thing,

153
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:02,520
you didn't tell me,

154
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:03,520
and kept it from me.

155
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:04,919
Liar!

156
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,039
Why didn't you tell me?

157

Come back!

You think you run fast, don't you?

159

Just squat!

Squat!

00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:17,200
Say it.

Why didn't you tell me?

At first, Shao Beisheng

164
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,679
didn't allow me to tell you.

165
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,039
Later, as your grandma got sick,

166
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:24,200
I don't dare to disturb you.

167

Excuse me.

168
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,320
If Shao Beisheng doesn't
allow you to tell me,

169
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,400
you won't tell me?

170
00:12:28,239 --> 00:12:28,760
Right.

171
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,280
It was my fault.

172

What does Shao Beisheng

173

have in his mind?

174
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,919

00:12:46,119 --> 00:12:47,280
She doesn't like Shao Beisheng,
right?

179
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:48,919
That was before.

180
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:52,640
She likes him now?

181
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:54,280
She likes Shao Beisheng very much now.

182
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,119
And these days because of Shao Beisheng,

183
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:58,039
she has taken neither food nor drink,

184
00:12:58,359 --> 00:12:59,760
and has cried several times.

185
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:02,719
When I am in the dormitory

186
00:13:02,719 --> 00:13:03,719
and can't meet you,

187
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,919
I miss you a lot.

188
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:05,919
I also take neither food nor drink.

189
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:08,359
So sick.

190
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:09,640
Sick of you!

191
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,400
Come back!

192
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:14,440
Really?

193
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,760
Calm down first.

194
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,400
She likes me!

195
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:24,159
Does she really like me?

196
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,239
Come on.

197
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,400
She has taken neither food nor drink
because of me!

198
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:28,640
Excuse me!

199
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,039
She even cried for me!

200
00:13:35,239 --> 00:13:36,880
You said
Li Mi is a good-for-nothing guy.

201
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,400
What's the difference
between you and him now?

202
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:39,880
Mind your own business!

203
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,640
Where are you going?

204
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,119
Go to meet Shen Zhengyi.

205
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:51,400
Take it slow.

206
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:53,039
Be a man, please!

207
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,520
If you go to meet her now,

208
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,159
will Shen Zhengyi care about you?

209
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:57,760
Listen to me this time.

210
00:13:58,159 --> 00:13:59,119
Wait for her to come to you.

211
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,159
Play the cat and mouse game.

212
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,640
Will she really come to me?

213
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:03,760
Of course.

214
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,679
No one knows more about love than I do.

215
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,919
Then what should

216
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:14,919
I do now?

217
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,039
My bed is a little bit messy

218
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,880
and needs to be cleaned up.

219
00:14:23,359 --> 00:14:23,919
Got it!

220
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,159
Go to clean it up.

221
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,520
She likes me!

222
00:14:30,239 --> 00:14:31,520
She really likes me!

223
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,640
So confused about the love...

224
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,559
You're giving up now?

225
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,359
He hasn't added me to WeChat.

226
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,400
What can I do about it?

227
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:17,760
Without WeChat contact,

228
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,280
you still have his phone number!

229
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,799
You can text him and call him.

230
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:21,400
If it still doesn't work,

231
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,799
you just go to his dormitory
and stop him downstairs.

232
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,799
There are more methods
than difficulties.

233
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:32,359
Do you like Shao Beisheng or not?

234
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:38,359
That's it.

235
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,919
There have been no obstacles

236
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:40,760
between you two now.

237
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:41,919
Shao Beisheng has

238
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:43,359
taken 99 steps forward before.

239
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:45,039
Although the direction

240
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,159
may not be accurate,

241
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,919
he did his best.

242
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,679
Now it should be you to
take the last step.

243
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,520
What are you hesitating about?

244
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,280
Show your spirit

245
00:15:54,359 --> 00:15:55,159
during the game!

246
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,039
Okay.

247
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,359
Well...

248
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,880
Next time when I act to be

249
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,880
like an ant on a hot pan,

250
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:36,359
I know how to act.

251
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,039
If I can't receive the call from

252
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:39,239
Shen Zhengyi today,

253
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:40,919
you'll be dead.

254
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,679
That's impossible.

255
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:51,640
Why not yet?

256
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,400
It's coming soon.

257
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:56,670
(Shen Zhengyi)

258
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,680
What did I tell you?

259
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,760
What did I tell you?

260
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,640
Wait! You can't answer it now.

261
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:11,119
It looks like you're waiting for her.

262
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,560
Adjust your breathing.

263
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:14,880
One.

264
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,280
Two.

265
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,040
Three.

266
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,040
Answer it!

267
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,800
Hello.

268
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,040
It's me, Shen Zhengyi.

269
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,280
What's the matter?

270
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:37,280
I'm downstairs now.

271
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,640
Can you come downstairs?

272
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,520
I want to talk with you.

273
00:17:42,239 --> 00:17:42,800
Wait a second.

274
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,800
Put on your war robe!

275
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,160
Remember!

276
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,040
Don't say yes at once.

277
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,520
Man shall be reserved.

278
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,560
Understand?

279
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,640
Just go.

280
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,160
Be aware of your breath!

281
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,400
Don't say yes at once.

282
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:13,520
Walk! Don't run.

283
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,800
What did I say?

284
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,000
What did I say?

285
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:24,280
No one knows

286
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,800
more about love than I do.

287
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:28,040
You're looking for me?

288
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,160
What Xiao Qing said that day

289
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,640
was indeed true.

290
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:58,119
But that was

291
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,280
what I thought before.

292
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,920
Now I

293
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:12,640
like you very much.

294
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,280
Then what about Xiao Han?

295
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,520
I've always

296
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,439
had nothing for Coach Xiao

297
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,439
but respect.

298
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:53,640
I missed

299
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,640
the confession before.

300
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,520
It's actually

301
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,119
too late to reply now.

302
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,880
So, let me ask you this time.

303
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,640
Shao Beisheng.

304
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,439
Would you like to be my boyfriend?

305
00:21:34,439 --> 00:21:35,800
I wanna think about it.

306
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,000
Right.

307
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,359
Right.

308
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,520
You should give it a thought.

309
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,239
It's alright.

310
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,760
Think about it.

311
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,760
I gotta go.

312
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:50,520
Good night.

313
00:21:51,239 --> 00:21:51,680
Well...Wait!

314
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,560
I've already thought about it.

315
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,640
I do.

316
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,719
I'd love to.

317
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,680
There is no contract this time,
right?

318
00:22:22,439 --> 00:22:23,479
Of course not.

00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:43,239
Beisheng. You are so handsome!

352
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,119
Fine.

353
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:45,160
If you have the guts,

354
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:46,400
don't ask me to bring you breakfast!

355
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,680
You just put relationship
before friendship!

356
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:49,920
Are you going on a date

357
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:50,880
for dressing up like this?

358
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:52,079
No. I'll train myself.

359
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,560
Let's have breakfast

360
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:54,280
in the dormitory?

361
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:55,640
When I came back from my hometown,

362
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,599
I brought a lot of delicious food back.

363
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,599
I can't eat with you.

364
00:24:57,839 --> 00:24:58,680
I have to eat with Shao Beisheng.

365
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,800
Did you say it was not a date?

366
00:25:01,239 --> 00:25:01,920
It's not a date.

367
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:03,000
I gotta go.

368
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:06,599
You just put relationship
before friendship!

369
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:11,520
Lele.

370
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,000
Where is your perfume?

371
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:14,839
In the drawer.

372
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:16,119
Which one?

373
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:17,319
Here.

374
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:24,760
Oh my goodness.

375
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:25,560
Alright. Alright.

376
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,800
The hair already smells good enough.

377
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,880
It's too much to make people dizzy.

378
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:28,640
Okay.

379
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:29,839
Thank you.

380
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:30,560
Thank you.

381
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,280
I gotta go.

382
00:25:57,319 --> 00:25:58,040
Hello.

383
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,760
Have you eaten yet?

384
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,319
Come and eat with me.

385
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:08,680
Okay.

386
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:09,520
I haven't eaten yet.

387
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,520
Alright.

388
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,359
See you later.

389
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:12,520
I'm coming.

390
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:28,760
I should zip it up.

391
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,400
It's too cold.

392
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,880
No, I have to look handsome.

393
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:49,079
I'm freezing. I'm freezing.

394
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,319
It's such a good day.

395
00:27:21,479 --> 00:27:22,560
Why are you wearing clothes in black?

396
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,359
You look nice.

397
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,599
Why are you barelegged?

398
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,680
You are not afraid of getting
osteoarthritis?

399
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,599
And your hair

400
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,680
looks like a spider goblin.

401
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,680
Your hair looks like a centipede spirit.

402
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:36,079
- It took me...
- Wait.

403
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,640
What's that smell on you?

404
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,319
I failed to keep it under control.

405
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:49,280
You smell

406
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:50,520
like a walking soap.

407
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:51,880
Stop talking nonsense!

408
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,839
Would you like to eat or not?

409
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:54,400
I would like to eat!

410
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:56,839
Let's go.

411
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:58,040
Wait a minute.

412
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:04,920
Are you cold?

413
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:08,000
A little bit.

414
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:10,920
Well then...

415
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,040
So warm!

416
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:20,880
Let's go.

417
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:30,839
What's up?

418
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:32,079
It's our first date,

419
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,079
and you don't even let me
take your hand.

420
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:36,079
I am cold.

421
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,479
Are you cold now?

422
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:46,520
Are you cold?

423
00:29:05,199 --> 00:29:06,119
What would you like for dinner?

424
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:08,839
What would you like for dinner?

425
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,640
Anything would be okay.

426
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,439
It's not okay.

427
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:12,719
Pick a restaurant.

428
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:13,599
You...

429
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,160
What are you doing?

430
00:29:19,719 --> 00:29:20,520
What are you doing?

431
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,479
What's wrong with you?

432
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:23,319
What are you doing?

433
00:29:23,479 --> 00:29:24,359
Why are you avoiding them?

434
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:26,000
No, I'm not.

435
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:27,400
It's just

436
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:28,880
the mistake before

437
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:30,199
was so influential,

438
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,280
and everyone

439
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:32,439
knew about

440
00:29:32,719 --> 00:29:33,760
our contract of the fake couple.

441
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:34,760
So, this time,

442
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,959
let's just stay low.

443
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,040
No.

444
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,079
Why should I stay low?

445
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:38,880
I just want

446
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,199
people all over the world to know that

447
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,640
you are my girlfriend.

448
00:29:42,439 --> 00:29:42,760
So, there will be no one

449
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,800
who may be interested in you.

450
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,079
You wanna keep it as a secret?

451
00:29:48,479 --> 00:29:49,079
Stop talking nonsense.

452
00:29:49,199 --> 00:29:50,000
It's not a secret.

453
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:51,719
Just stay low a little bit.

454
00:29:54,479 --> 00:29:55,280
Fine.

455
00:29:55,479 --> 00:29:56,079
I got it.

456
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,079
Fine. I gotta go.

457
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,319
See you tonight.

458
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,760
What are you doing?
Let go of me!

459
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,599
No.

460
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,079
Come on. I'm running late.

461
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:08,839
Bye.

462
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:09,880
Focus on your training!

463
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,199
Beisheng.

464
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,359
Beisheng.

465
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,199
What are you doing?

466
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,040
What are you doing?

467
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:26,520
Nothing.

468
00:30:26,719 --> 00:30:28,319
I'm just doing some exercise.

469
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:29,839
Doing some exercise.

470
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,199
We will get going now.

471
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:32,839
Bye.

472
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,400
Bye. Bye.

473
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,970
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team of
Lingbei University)

474
00:30:40,959 --> 00:30:41,959
(This time I must break the record of)

475
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:43,400
(2 minutes 40 seconds.)

476
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,839
Nice curve!

477
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:00,680
Better than you.

478
00:31:04,239 --> 00:31:04,920
1.6 seconds!

479
00:31:04,959 --> 00:31:06,040
Great! Keep going!

480
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:08,079
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

481
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:12,599
Fighting!

482
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,920
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

483
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:21,920
(The last curve!)

484
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:23,199
(Hold on!)

485
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,319
Shen Zhengyi!

486
00:31:44,959 --> 00:31:46,479
Congratulations, you broke the
record of 2 minutes 40 seconds.

487
00:31:50,479 --> 00:31:51,599
As I broke the record of
2 minutes 40 seconds,

488
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,599
I can

489
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:53,760
attend the tactical training

490
00:31:53,959 --> 00:31:55,119
and the contests of Ling Yun Cup, right?

491
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,199
You start the tactical training
on Monday.

492
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,560
Thank you, Coach Zhuang.

493
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,479
Thank you, Coach Xiao.

494
00:32:39,239 --> 00:32:40,079
Xiao Qing.

495
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,199
I heard you were leaving Wind Chaser.

496
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,119
Isn't it what you hope for?

497
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,959
Thank you

498
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:51,959
for preparing me
the selection materials

499
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,560
and getting me assigned.

500
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,800
You will go to join the team
of Coach Jiang?

501
00:32:58,359 --> 00:32:58,920
Xiao Qing.

502
00:32:59,119 --> 00:32:59,959
Anyway,

503
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,520
I wanna sincerely

504
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,800
say sorry to you.

505
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,520
I'll explain it

506
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,479
to everyone.

507
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,520
I also hope that

508
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:08,640
this misunderstanding can be gone
as soon as possible.

509
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:11,520
I'm not that weak.

510
00:33:12,239 --> 00:33:12,920
Shao Beisheng.

511
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,040
Let's see each other on the rink
in the future.

512
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,479
I finally got admitted into

513
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:39,520
the tactical training!

514
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,680
In that case I can

515
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,079
attend 1500m race in Ling Yun Cup!

516
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,920
Can you stop it?

517
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:45,040
Since the end of training,

518
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:46,680
you have already said that
for more than 20 times.

519
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:48,599
It's me that you outperformed! You...

520
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,599
I am happy!

521
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,359
Then we'll...

522
00:33:56,479 --> 00:33:57,319
What's this?

523
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,239
Let me check it out!

524
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,199
(Dear Sheng Zhengyi, smile every day.)
Dear Shen Zhengyi.

525
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,199
Go on.

526
00:34:07,719 --> 00:34:09,760
Smile every day.

527
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,760
You smile every day.

528
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,600
Come on. Give me a smile.

529
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:16,000
It's sweet.

530
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:17,600
Well,

531
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,879
Shao Beisheng has great discernment
in his choice.

532
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,560
(WeChat history between Shao and Shen)
(Is the training over?)

533
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,239
(I'm waiting for you at the door.)

534
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,360
(It's already ten minutes.)

535
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,360
(15 minutes.)

536
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:25,320
(Are you dumping me?)

537
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,120
What's the silly face about?

538
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,679
Shao Beisheng?

539
00:34:31,479 --> 00:34:32,719
Fine. Take your happiness and

540
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,679
let's go celebrate.

541
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,600
Well... Lele.

542
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:39,600
I'm not available tonight.

543
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:40,879
How about you go celebrate yourself?

544
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,159
With Shao Beisheng?

545
00:34:45,439 --> 00:34:46,919
You just put relationship
before friendship!

546
00:34:57,399 --> 00:34:58,399
What's up?

547
00:35:00,399 --> 00:35:01,879
What's wrong with you?
Are you mad?

548
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,399
You haven't been waiting for long,
right?

549
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:06,840
23 minutes 14 seconds.

550
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:07,919
Shen Zhengyi, why didn't you

551
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,679
reply to me?

552
00:35:08,919 --> 00:35:09,600
Come on. I was training.

553
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:11,280
I was not allowed to read the message.
Bro.

554
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,000
Bro?

555
00:35:13,919 --> 00:35:14,600
Shen Zhengyi.

556
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:15,879
I'm your boyfriend now.

557
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:18,159
Give me another name.

558
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,600
Beisheng, my sweetheart.

559
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:22,719
Are you mad?

560
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,360
Are you

561
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,719
not happy because

562
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,560
I didn't reply to you?

563
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:27,719
But I was training.

564
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,120
How can I read your message?

565
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,320
If I did,

566
00:35:30,439 --> 00:35:31,919
then I wasn't focusing on training.

567
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,879
Then I am not a good player.

568
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:35,320
If I'm not a good player, I...

569
00:35:35,479 --> 00:35:35,879
I...

570
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,760
What are you doing? My sweetheart?

571
00:35:38,879 --> 00:35:39,479
Don't go!

572
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,919
Let's go. Let's go to dinner.

573
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:42,320
Don't be mad.

574
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,879
Let's have some meat.

575
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:45,840
What would you like to eat?

576
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:46,919
No! No!

577
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:47,600
If you're still pretending like this,

578
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,679
I will punch you, Shen Zhengyi.

579
00:35:48,919 --> 00:35:50,199
Would you like some fast food?

580
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,199
Shut up.

581
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,159
Would you like...

582
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,159
Is it delicious?

583
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,120
Isn't it like this every day?

584
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:09,719
Exactly.

585
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,479
I want this.

586
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:34,120
Take it.

587
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,879
I want you to feed me.

588
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:41,879
Hurry up.

589
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:48,679
Is it delicious?

590
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,239
Shen Zhengyi, you...

591
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:56,320
Shen Zhengyi.

592
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,000
Don't you know

593
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,080
I can't eat spicy food?

594
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,080
Then why did you ask me
to feed you?

595
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:06,879
You're not as nice to me
as you used to be.

596
00:37:07,879 --> 00:37:08,760
What do you want then?

597
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,199
I...

598
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:13,679
Hurry up.

599
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,080
I'm gonna take you to study
after dinner.

600
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:17,560
Study what?

601
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:23,879
Excuse me.

602
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,439
Why are you bringing me here?

603
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,000
I'm telling you.

604
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,120
Let's stay far away from the lake.

605
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,080
As long as I see the lake,

606
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,520
I'll have a psychological shadow.

607
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,760
I'm here with you.

608
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,439
Are you still afraid of
falling into the lake?

609
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,520
I'm afraid you might push me down.

610
00:37:42,439 --> 00:37:43,120
I am telling you.

611
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:45,679
This is

612
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,000
the holy place for dating in our school.

613
00:37:47,439 --> 00:37:49,000
Take a good look.
Study hard.

614
00:37:49,879 --> 00:37:51,120
We don't know much about dating, right?

615
00:37:51,879 --> 00:37:53,000
It can't be more difficult than skating.

616
00:37:53,439 --> 00:37:54,120
We'll get it soon.

617
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,000
Come here.

618
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,439
Really?

619
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,439
I can't do it.

620
00:37:58,879 --> 00:37:59,560
Come here.

621
00:38:00,399 --> 00:38:01,399
Sit down and take a look.

622
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:09,879
From now on,

623
00:38:10,439 --> 00:38:11,120
we should observe

624
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,639
the behaviors of each couple.

625
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:13,560
So that we can know

626
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:14,560
what we should do

627
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:15,639
when we are dating.

628
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:17,560
Got it.

629
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:25,320
I didn't expect that

630
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,760
Shao Beisheng could be so clingy

631
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:28,199
when he was in love.

632
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,679
But it's good though.

633
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,439
So, they won't

634
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,120
have the opportunity

635
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:32,199
to catch us.

636
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,399
You're not going to tell them yet?

637
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,479
Let's wait.

638
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,719
I haven't figured it out

639
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,600
how to tell them.

640
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,479
Her hair was made

641
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,159
like an alien.

642
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,280
Is that Shen Zhengyi?

643
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:47,159
My goodness. Shen Zhengyi?

644
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:47,639
Shen Zhengyi. Shao Beisheng.

645
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,520
Let's go over there and say hi.

646
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:49,959
Don't!

647
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:51,280
This is the holy place for dating.

648
00:38:51,399 --> 00:38:52,080
If they see us,

649
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:52,840
how are we gonna explain it?

650
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:54,840
Right.

651
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,040
Just tell them that

652
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:56,840
I am your boyfriend.

653
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:57,199
Let's go.

654
00:38:57,399 --> 00:38:58,080
Wait! Wait!

655
00:38:58,399 --> 00:38:58,840
Let's make it another day.

656
00:38:59,040 --> 00:38:59,479
Another day?

657
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,199
Which day?

658
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:02,399
I will say it someday.

659
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:03,639
But not today, okay?

660
00:39:03,919 --> 00:39:04,280
Be good.

661
00:39:04,399 --> 00:39:05,040
Let's go. Let's go.

662
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:05,639
Hurry up. Hurry up.

663
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:06,919
How about

664
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:07,760
we watch them secretly?

665
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:08,840
Let's do it another day.

666
00:39:09,399 --> 00:39:10,080
Another day.

667
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:10,600
Hurry up.

668
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:11,479
Hurry up.

669
00:39:17,399 --> 00:39:18,080
It's not right.

670
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,520
-It's a little bit wired.
-It's not right.

671
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,719
It's not right.

672
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,840
The other way.

673
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:39,199
So nasty you are.

674
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,959
My sweetheart. So nasty you are.

675
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:44,760
No, no.

676
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:50,719
How about this?

677
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,719
A little bit better.

678
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:52,959
Not bad?

679
00:39:56,399 --> 00:39:57,159
And this.

680
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,280
This. This.

681
00:39:58,639 --> 00:39:59,399
How about this?

682
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:01,159
Finally.

683
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:03,080
Right.

684
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,080
Right?

685
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:06,840
Better.

686
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:12,719
Enough?

687
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,080
Can we go now?

688
00:40:17,399 --> 00:40:18,280
