Luo Xiaoyi is an ace player

4
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,559
of our speed skating team.

5
00:01:41,279 --> 00:01:42,040
What shall we do for Asian Cup

6
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,120
if she quits?

7
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,800
If Luo Xiaoyi wouldn't attend

8
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:49,279
the Asian Cup,

9
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,800
we have to let Shen Zhengyi attend it.

10
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,480
How is it possible

11
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:53,360
for her to win just by herself?

12
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,400
She had such a huge difference

13
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,480
with Eunkyung Choi

14
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:58,800
when they skated last time during
the 7-lap chasing race.

15
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,599
If she skates

16
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,120
just by herself this time,

17
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,040
I'm afraid that she wouldn't even win

18
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,160
Yu Bingling.

19
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,440
The figure skating team achieves
great results every year,

20
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,240
while the speed skating team performs

21
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,119
poorly every time.

22
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,919
This is also the reason that
I asked you to be the coach.

23
00:02:18,679 --> 00:02:19,759
If we cannot improve the situation

24
00:02:20,559 --> 00:02:21,440
in the Asian Cup

25
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:22,559
this year,

26
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,360
the school committee
will for sure

27
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,679
dismiss the speed skating team.

28
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,119
Now Luo Xiaoyi has
withdrawn from the team.

29
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,000
How can we achieve great results?

30
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,240
Sorry, director Zhang.

31
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,240
I let you down

32
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:38,440
and I failed to help the team succeed.

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,679
How about this?

34
00:02:44,119 --> 00:02:45,039
Just talk to

35
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:46,119
Luo Xiaoyi again.

36
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,119
If it doesn't work,

37
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:49,800
ask Xiao Han to talk to her.

38
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:51,679
She was trained by Xiao Han,

39
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:53,880
and she might listen to him.

The national team is
having a special recruiting.

00:09:30,359 --> 00:09:31,520
achieves great results

173
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,119
in the golden age.

174
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,359
You've been strict with us,

175
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,719
so you don't need to

176
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,119
be softhearted now.

177
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,479
You seldom smile,

178
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,719
but I've seen

179
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,119
your brightest smile

180
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,599
when you were on the rink.

181
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,239
You smiled because of your hard work

182
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,760
and efforts.

183
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,320
Most importantly,

184
00:09:57,719 --> 00:09:59,960
it's because you love
this sports too much.

185
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,119
Luo Xiaoyi,

186
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,719
if you only give up

187
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,719
because of your pique,

188
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:06,520
you will regret

189
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,960
for the whole life.

190
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,599
Think about it well.

191
00:10:10,119 --> 00:10:12,080
We will wait for you to get back
to the team anytime.

192
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,719
Coach Zhuang.

193
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,719
Mom.

194
00:10:35,479 --> 00:10:36,239
How is your injury?

195
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,479
It's okay now. I've recovered.

196
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:38,719
Mom.

197
00:10:40,359 --> 00:10:41,760
Auntie is waiting for you over there.

198
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,119
I gotta go now.

199
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,960
Coach Zhuang.

200
00:10:47,719 --> 00:10:49,599
My mom sometimes

201
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,599
loses her temper.

202
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,760
Don't worry. I know her well.

203
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,479
Is it going to be alright?

204
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,880
Go check it out.

205
00:11:01,719 --> 00:11:02,359
How to check it out?

206
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:03,760
Let's go.

207
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,320
They won't fight, right?

208
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,000
No way.

209
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:27,880
Sorry for making you wait, Limin.

210
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,640
Are your legs alright

211
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,359
since you've been standing for a while?

212
00:11:40,359 --> 00:11:41,479
I've been used to it

213
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,479
for over 20 years.

214
00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:54,359
Sorry.

215
00:12:03,119 --> 00:12:04,239
Let's have a seat over there.

216
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,719
Can you hear?

217
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,719
Swim over and eavesdrop.

218
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,599
You would not say sorry

219
00:12:39,239 --> 00:12:40,520
in the past.

220
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,840
Of course I've changed

221
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,880
from who I used to be.

222
00:12:46,479 --> 00:12:48,119
I am not the girl who was
aggressive to everyone.

223
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,119
It seems like people can only

224
00:12:53,479 --> 00:12:55,359
know about their bad habits
when they get older.

225
00:12:59,719 --> 00:13:00,599
Right.

226
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,200
I was too self-conceited back then,

227
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,239
and I turned what I got

228
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:06,760
into thorns to others.

229
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,520
I hurt both myself and others.

230
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,599
Limin,

231
00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:14,479
actually I was very unconvinced

232
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:15,960
of the strategy planning in the team.

233
00:13:16,599 --> 00:13:18,320
So I said many words that were hurtful.

234
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,599
I have been very regretful

235
00:13:24,479 --> 00:13:25,440
over these years.

236
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,719
I keep thinking that

237
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,880
if I did not try to challenge you

238
00:13:31,719 --> 00:13:32,760
before the contest on that day,

239
00:13:34,119 --> 00:13:34,880
you might have

240
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
trusted me on that curve.

241
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,320
There is no if.

242
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:41,960
Actually many people were

243
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,119
defending you back then.

244
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
But at that time I couldn't help

245
00:13:46,119 --> 00:13:49,000
but think that you owe me.

246
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:54,840
Over these years,

247
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,080
when I recall what happened,

248
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,239
I think it is unfair for you

249
00:13:59,359 --> 00:14:00,239
if I make you take
all the responsibilities

250
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,719
just because of

251
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,000
some words you said

252
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,200
back then.

253
00:14:07,599 --> 00:14:08,479
Forget it.

254
00:14:09,479 --> 00:14:10,440
It's already past.

255
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,840
Thank you.

256
00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:19,599
I came here today for Zhengyi.

257
00:14:20,479 --> 00:14:21,320
I told you all these words

258
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,479
for Zhengyi as well.

259
00:14:25,479 --> 00:14:26,640
Zhengyi is a very potential athlete

260
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,840
for short track speed skating.

261
00:14:30,239 --> 00:14:31,880
I've been holding her up,

262
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,520
and I don't want to
hold her up anymore.

263
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,520
Zhuang Yue,

264
00:14:38,719 --> 00:14:40,080
can I trust you again?

265
00:14:42,239 --> 00:14:43,119
Of course.

266
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,239
Then I'll leave Zhengyi to you.

267
00:14:51,359 --> 00:14:52,840
With such great talent as Zhengyi has,

268
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,760
if she cannot win the championship,

269
00:14:55,719 --> 00:14:56,599
I would need to question

270
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,640
the ability of you as a coach.

271
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,840
Talent is not the only thing

272
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,599
that matters to
getting the championship.

273
00:15:02,119 --> 00:15:03,000
I just count on you.

274
00:15:03,719 --> 00:15:04,359
At least,

275
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,000
she should outshine Eunkyung Choi,

276
00:15:06,359 --> 00:15:07,479
since they have been both
trained by you.

277
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:10,640
Alright, alright.

278
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:13,359
You are still having

279
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,119
the same temper as you had years ago.

280
00:15:14,239 --> 00:15:15,359
You haven't changed at all.

281
00:15:20,599 --> 00:15:22,000
Okay. I will let you go then.

282
00:15:23,359 --> 00:15:24,119
Gotta go now.

283
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,119
Did you see?

284
00:16:02,239 --> 00:16:03,440
Are they good now?

285
00:16:06,359 --> 00:16:07,359
See me off.

286
00:16:22,719 --> 00:16:23,359
Let's go!

287
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,479
Let's go!

288
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,830
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team of
Lingbei University)

289
00:16:29,719 --> 00:16:30,479
Really?

290
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,760
Is our short track speed
skating team that bad?

291
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,840
Think about it.

292
00:16:36,479 --> 00:16:37,599
We haven't achieved

293
00:16:37,719 --> 00:16:38,520
great results these years

294
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,000
except Luo Xiaoyi.

295
00:16:41,479 --> 00:16:42,359
In addition, the short track team

296
00:16:42,719 --> 00:16:44,000
doesn't generate as much profit

297
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,239
as soccer and basketball teams,

298
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,320
meanwhile we spend so much.

299
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:48,760
Of course they wanted to dismiss us.

300
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,599
What are you guys talking about?

301
00:16:54,479 --> 00:16:55,000
Zhengyi.

302
00:16:55,479 --> 00:16:56,119
You're back.

303
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,640
You're back.

304
00:16:59,479 --> 00:17:00,320
How is your injury?

305
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:01,320
I've been a lot better.

306
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,239
Who did you guys say

307
00:17:03,479 --> 00:17:04,760
would be dismissed?

308
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,000
We heard that our short track team

309
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:12,359
is going to be dismissed.

310
00:17:13,239 --> 00:17:14,239
How is it possible?

311
00:17:14,719 --> 00:17:15,479
Even if director Zhang agrees,

312
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,839
Coach Zhuang would not agree.

313
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,319
Director Zhang only saved us

314
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:19,719
for this season.

315
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,319
If we still don't

316
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:21,880
achieve a good result

317
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,719
in the Asian Cup,

318
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,239
he would not be able to save us again.

319
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,239
Coach Zhuang.

320
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:31,000
Coach Zhuang.

321
00:17:31,199 --> 00:17:32,119
Assemble.

322
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:37,599
I have two things to announce today.

323
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,319
Luo Xiaoyi has submitted

324
00:17:40,439 --> 00:17:41,359
the application for
withdrawing from the team.

325
00:17:42,959 --> 00:17:44,079
Thus, Shen Zhengyi

326
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:44,839
is the only athlete for attending

327
00:17:45,199 --> 00:17:47,000
the 1500m in the Asian Cup.

328
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:54,000
Besides,

329
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:56,239
Coach Xiao will have a temporary leave.

330
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,640
Coach Zhuang.

331
00:17:59,119 --> 00:17:59,839
Both Luo Xiaoyi and Coach Xiao

332
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:00,640
are about to leave.

333
00:18:01,439 --> 00:18:03,479
Are we done now?

334
00:18:04,479 --> 00:18:05,239
Coach Zhuang,

335
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,479
is that news true?

336
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:09,079
Are we going to be dismissed

337
00:18:09,199 --> 00:18:10,000
if we don't achieve a good result 

338
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:11,520
in the Asian Cup this time?

339
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,439
Yes.

340
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:22,599
We will have to be dismissed

341
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,119
if we don't achieve a good result

342
00:18:24,719 --> 00:18:25,880
in the Asian Cup.

343
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,079
What are you doing?

344
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:36,119
The contest hasn't even started yet,

345
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,239
and you are already
thinking about losing?

346
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,239
What you need to do now

347
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:41,839
is not overthinking,

348
00:18:42,479 --> 00:18:44,119
but training hard

349
00:18:44,479 --> 00:18:45,439
and facing it positively.

350
00:18:46,719 --> 00:18:47,839
Coach Zhuang.

351
00:18:48,719 --> 00:18:50,959
Everyone said that
we are the worst team.

352
00:18:51,719 --> 00:18:52,839
What's the point of persisting?

353
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:54,520
Do you position yourself

354
00:18:55,439 --> 00:18:57,119
as what other people define you?

355
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:01,079
Zhu Lele.

356
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:03,359
Have you ever asked yourself

357
00:19:04,479 --> 00:19:05,839
how many years you have practiced
short track speed skating,

358
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:08,359
how many laps you have skated,

359
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:10,000
how many times you have fallen,

360
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:11,479
how many times you have cried,

361
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,079
how many times
you have injured yourself,

362
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:15,239
and how many times you have

363
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:16,079
thought about giving up?

364
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,719
But why are you still

365
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:20,760
standing here today?

366
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,599
All of you can ask yourself

367
00:19:26,719 --> 00:19:27,719
the question.

368
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:31,359
You know how hard it is to practice
short track speed skating.

369
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,119
Why do you persist to this day?

370
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,199
Because you love this sports,

371
00:19:39,239 --> 00:19:40,439
and because you believe that

372
00:19:41,239 --> 00:19:42,760
as long as you work hard,

373
00:19:43,239 --> 00:19:44,640
you will be rewarded.

374
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:47,599
But what happens now?

375
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,359
The contest hasn't even started yet,

376
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:51,959
and you are about to give up?

377
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:55,119
Do you want to give up the contest?

378
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:58,520
Is that all you can do

379
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,359
as athletes?

380
00:19:59,479 --> 00:20:00,319
Wind Chaser is a team

381
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:01,719
like this?

382
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,599
Answer me.

383
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,959
- No.
- No.

384
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:05,719
Louder.

385
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:07,479
- No.
- No.

386
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:09,359
Remember.

387
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:11,719
You are the best athletes,

388
00:20:12,199 --> 00:20:13,479
and Wind Chaser is the best team.

389
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:16,520
Fighting, Wind Chaser!
Sure win, Wind Chaser!

390
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:19,839
- Fighting, Wind Chaser!
- Sure win, Wind Chaser!

391
00:20:20,199 --> 00:20:23,000
- Fighting, Wind Chaser!
- Sure win, Wind Chaser!

392
00:20:23,239 --> 00:20:26,239
- Fighting, Wind Chaser!
- Sure win, Wind Chaser!

393
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:35,260
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team of
Lingbei University)

394
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,479
Zhengyi,

395
00:20:42,719 --> 00:20:43,880
let's have ice cream.

396
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:44,839
I will buy it for you.

397
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,479
I'm so pressured right now.

398
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:49,079
If I don't do well

399
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:50,439
in the Asian Cup,

400
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,239
the whole short track team

401
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:52,359
will be dismissed because of me.

402
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,479
Don't think that way.

403
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,079
It's your first time
attending the contest.

404
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,079
Don't give yourself too much pressure.

405
00:20:59,479 --> 00:21:00,719
If I want to save the short track team,

406
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:02,319
I cannot lose and I have to win.

407
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:04,479
But how do I compete with

408
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:07,239
Yu Bingling and Eunkyung Choi

409
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:08,599
just by myself?

410
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:13,880
How about this?

411
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:15,119
From today,

412
00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:16,119
except going to class

413
00:21:16,239 --> 00:21:17,079
and training,

414
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,119
as long as you need me

415
00:21:18,479 --> 00:21:19,640
to help serving drinks,

416
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:20,520
washing clothes, cooking,

417
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:21,520
or massaging...

418
00:21:21,719 --> 00:21:22,599
as long as you need me,

419
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,479
I will be always on call.

420
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:24,520
How does that sound?

421
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:26,199
Save it.

422
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:27,719
I will practice more
on the rink.

423
00:21:28,239 --> 00:21:28,760
You can go back first.

424
00:21:29,239 --> 00:21:29,839
I will go with you.

425
00:21:30,239 --> 00:21:31,359
It's okay. I will go by myself.

426
00:21:31,719 --> 00:21:32,359
See you.

427
00:21:33,439 --> 00:21:34,760
Be careful.

428
00:21:57,479 --> 00:21:58,359
Zhengyi.

429
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,599
Have you finished training?

430
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:06,839
Who told you that we have finished?

431
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,640
I want to practice more.

432
00:22:09,439 --> 00:22:10,839
What about you? Why are you so early?

433
00:22:12,199 --> 00:22:13,439
It's better be at the right time 
than being early.

434
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:14,839
Just in time.

435
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:16,000
Check out my training result.

436
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:16,839
Teacher Shen.

437
00:22:21,479 --> 00:22:22,239
Just go.

438
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:23,119
Just go.

439
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,240
Hurry up.

440
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,719
Watch me.

441
00:22:38,719 --> 00:22:39,599
This is just the warm-up.

442
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:40,839
I will start the show.

443
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,239
Be careful.

444
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:52,959
Shao Beisheng.

445
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:00,199
Although it helps you
complete high-quality movements

446
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:01,719
by being fast,

447
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,319
it was too dangerous for you just now.

448
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,599
I didn't control

449
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,359
the speed well.

450
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:06,479
Not to mention that

451
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:07,599
it's normal to fall during practice.

452
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:08,479
It's okay.

453
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:09,599
Let me apply it.

454
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:11,119
Give it to me.

455
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,479
You make me regret teaching you.

456
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:21,640
You don't want me to win Li Mi?

457
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:24,560
It's not like that.

458
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,439
Of course I want you to win.

459
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:34,880
What's the matter?

460
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:37,000
You don't seem happy today.

461
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:38,839
What happened?

462
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:39,880
Tell me.

463
00:23:41,239 --> 00:23:42,079
Tell me.

464
00:23:42,719 --> 00:23:43,760
What's the matter?

465
00:23:46,479 --> 00:23:47,479
I'm not unhappy.

466
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:49,000
Stop faking it.

467
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:51,239
Tell me.

468
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:59,839
Luo Xiaoyi is about to retire,

469
00:24:01,719 --> 00:24:03,239
and Coach Xiao will leave.

470
00:24:04,479 --> 00:24:05,839
If I don't achieve a good result

471
00:24:05,959 --> 00:24:07,719
in the Asian Cup this time,

472
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,599
the short track team
will have to be dismissed.

473
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,439
Coach Zhuang and everyone else

474
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,719
are treating me so well.

475
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,359
If we really get dismissed

476
00:24:17,479 --> 00:24:19,119
because I don't achieve a good result,

477
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:20,239
I will feel

478
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:21,359
so guilty.

479
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,959
But as you know,

480
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,439
the more anxious you are,
the worse you do.

481
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:32,479
The worse you do, 
the more anxious you get.

482
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,439
I don't know

483
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,719
what to do now.

484
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:38,880
Fool,

485
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,319
why do you have to

486
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:42,119
put all the stress

487
00:24:42,239 --> 00:24:43,239
on yourself?

488
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:45,119
You said earlier that

489
00:24:45,239 --> 00:24:46,439
you have so many teammates

490
00:24:46,479 --> 00:24:47,239
and you have Coach Zhuang.

491
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,760
They are all with you.

492
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:49,959
If there's anything

493
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:51,239
that you cannot solve by yourself,

494
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:52,239
you can ask them

495
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:53,640
to figure it out together.

496
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,479
Think about it.

497
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:56,839
If you didn't help me,

498
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:57,439
there's no way I can

499
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,319
figure out that

500
00:24:58,599 --> 00:24:59,280
I can improve my figure skating score

501
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:00,800
in the way of short track.

502
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:02,760
So you have to know that

503
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:03,599
at any time,

504
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:05,359
you are not fighting alone.

505
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,640
Right?

506
00:25:11,199 --> 00:25:11,959
Hello,

507
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,719
am I wrong?

508
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:26,839
You are quite right.

509
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,839
I'm not fighting alone.

510
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:33,000
Right?

511
00:25:38,959 --> 00:25:39,439
Alright.

512
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,359
Don't stress yourself out,

513
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,199
okay?

514
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,839
Thank you.

515
00:25:49,479 --> 00:25:50,119
You are welcome.

516
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:05,280
I can't imagine that

517
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,599
our short track team is

518
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,119
facing life-or-death situation.

519
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:10,280
Exactly.

520
00:26:10,959 --> 00:26:12,319
Back then, there is no hope for the team

521
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,119
because of our skills,

522
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,000
and it was destined to be dismissed.

523
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:19,319
How can you say that?

524
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:20,880
Don't you see how hard

525
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,479
Zhengyi is training every day?

526
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,000
Besides,

527
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:25,119
don't you have any

528
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,439
affection for Wind Chaser?

529
00:26:26,959 --> 00:26:27,719
Exactly.

530
00:26:28,439 --> 00:26:28,959
Weren't you the one

531
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,040
with the loud cheers

532
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:31,479
for the short track team's contests?

533
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,800
Why are you upset now?

534
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:36,079
Don't hurry to draw your conclusions.

535
00:26:36,199 --> 00:26:37,239
I'm not finished yet.

536
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,640
I said back then.

537
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,719
Back then.

538
00:26:41,439 --> 00:26:42,800
Of course I wouldn't now.

539
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:45,800
I know that

540
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:48,000
Coach Zhuang is quite strict.

541
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,719
But ever since she came,

542
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,199
even I wanted to practice hard.

543
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,760
I don't want to get dismissed

544
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:55,359
and I'm also depressed

545
00:26:55,479 --> 00:26:56,079
because there's nothing

546
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:56,880
I can do to help.

547
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,199
Exactly.

548
00:26:59,079 --> 00:26:59,719
Now all the pressure

549
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,280
is on Zhengyi.

550
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,280
She has no game experience

551
00:27:04,199 --> 00:27:05,599
and not even a teammate
to cooperate with.

552
00:27:06,439 --> 00:27:08,040
It makes me sad

553
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:09,199
to see her practicing

554
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:10,280
so hard.

555
00:27:10,719 --> 00:27:12,439
We have to think of a way.

556
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,640
Even if we cannot attend the contest,

557
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:14,959
we need to think of
a way to help Zhengyi.

558
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:15,800
We can't let her just fight alone.

559
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,280
Is there anything we can do?

560
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,280
Think about it.

561
00:27:22,959 --> 00:27:23,959
Think about it.

562
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:25,239
There must be a way.

563
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:39,040
(Video Interview invitation
of General Manager Assistant)

564
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:46,880
Sorry.

565
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,199
Sorry.

566
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,000
I misunderstood you.

567
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,760
The Asian Cup

568
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,800
will soon start.

569
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:54,800
You should come back soon
and continue with training.

570
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:56,280
Don't let this

571
00:27:56,719 --> 00:27:57,560
affect your race.

572
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:58,599
It was our fault

573
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,520
to misunderstand you.

574
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:00,719
You really don't have to retire

575
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,760
just because of this.

576
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:02,520
Exactly.

577
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:03,760
Come back and train yourself.

578
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,199
Director Liu.

579
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:12,040
Xiaoyi, it's been a while
since the last time we met.

580
00:28:13,239 --> 00:28:14,520
What would you like to drink?
I will order for you.

581
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:15,359
No, thanks. Take a seat please.

582
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,800
You mentioned that

583
00:28:23,199 --> 00:28:24,199
you have something important

584
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,000
to say.

585
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:26,239
Then I will speak frankly.

586
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,839
I heard that you are about to retire,

587
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:30,880
so I want to have a talk with you.

588
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,479
About what?

589
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:37,119
Wind Chaser really values
Shen Zhengyi now.

590
00:28:37,239 --> 00:28:38,800
However, I don't think it's reasonable.

591
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,640
I do understand

592
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,560
why you decide to retire now,

593
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,599
but it's a pity that

594
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,280
you give up the Asian Cup
at this moment.

595
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,000
Would you like to join
the Flyer team?

596
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:51,760
Are you kidding?

597
00:28:52,199 --> 00:28:53,040
The Flyer team already has Yu Bingling.

598
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,079
Why would it need me?

599
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:55,479
Flyer team always welcomes people

600
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,880
with great capabilities.

601
00:28:58,439 --> 00:28:59,119
Think about it.

602
00:28:59,479 --> 00:29:00,199
Eunkyung Choi is the strongest player

603
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,560
in the Asian Cup this year.

604
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,439
If you work with Yu Bingling

605
00:29:03,439 --> 00:29:04,079
together,

606
00:29:04,439 --> 00:29:05,119
I'm confident that

607
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,560
you two can defeat her.

608
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,800
I really didn't expect that

609
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,520
you have such plans.

610
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,119
If I join the Flyer team,

611
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,040
how would you plan
the strategic cooperation

612
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:21,560
between me and Yu Bingling?

613
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:22,760
The principle of the Flyer team

614
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,520
has always been offering the opportunity

615
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,560
to the strong one.

616
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,079
If you have the capability,

617
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,880
I will put all the resources

618
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,439
on you.

619
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,359
I can even make

620
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,359
Yu Bingling

621
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,280
assist you.

(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team of

623
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:41,800
We're almost there.

624
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:42,560
Where are we going?

625
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:43,560
Almost there.

626
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,280
Follow my steps.

627

One, two. One, two. One, two.

628
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,719
Where are you taking me?

629
00:29:51,199 --> 00:29:52,439
We're here.

630
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:54,800
Alright. Attention.

631
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:57,199
What is it?

632
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:58,000
Are you ready?

633
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,520
Why are you doing this?

634
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,560
I told you to return it.

635
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,479
It's too expensive.

636
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,640
How can I return

637
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,760
the skating blades that I bought

638
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,560
for my girlfriend?

639
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,640
I was planning to

640
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:15,239
give them to you

641
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:15,959
on a special anniversary.

642
00:30:16,479 --> 00:30:17,199
But I think that

643
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:18,439
you need them the most

644
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,800
right now.

645
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:21,560
My girlfriend can only

646
00:30:22,479 --> 00:30:23,640
wear the skating blades that I bought.

647
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:26,479
So,

648
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,040
I am Cinderella

650
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,719
Of course you are not Cinderella.

651
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,280
You are a woman warrior.

652
00:30:33,239 --> 00:30:34,000
Crystal heels can only be worn

to the ball with prince.

654
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,479
But this pair of skating blades

655
00:30:37,719 --> 00:30:39,560
can help you fight on the skating rink.

656
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,439
Zhengyi,

657
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,280
you are the hope of the whole team now.

658
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,359
I want to do my best

659
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,119
to help you.

660
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,359
So,

661
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,000
I hope that you can wear them

662
00:30:52,239 --> 00:30:53,040
when you attend the contests

663
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:53,959
or the training.

664
00:30:54,439 --> 00:30:55,640
Then you will be invincible,

665
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,319
okay?

666
00:31:00,199 --> 00:31:01,079
Thank you.

667
00:31:02,439 --> 00:31:03,319
Fighting!

668
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,040
Oh my goodness!

669
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,239
It's so sweet.

670
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:19,280
Well...

671
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,319
You can train first.

672
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:23,760
See you.

673
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,319
Bye.

674
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,800
Oh my goodness.

675
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:37,800
You two are too sweet.

676
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:42,800
What's the matter?

677
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:46,079
I will tell you something.

678
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,560
I heard that Xiaoyi

679
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,040
will transfer to the Flyer team.

680
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,800
How is it possible?

681
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:52,880
It's true.

682
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:53,599
Someone saw that

683
00:31:53,719 --> 00:31:55,439
she was meeting Director Liu 
from Flyer team.

684
00:31:55,959 --> 00:31:56,839
What else can they

685
00:31:56,959 --> 00:31:58,719
talk about at this moment?

686
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,839
If Xiaoyi really joins the Flyer team,

687
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,199
it would be even harder

688
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,520
for us to win.

689
00:32:11,199 --> 00:32:12,040
Come in.

690
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,520
Can you stop being self-willed?

691
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,880
Come back and train yourself.

692
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:20,359
Asian Cup is coming soon.

693
00:32:20,479 --> 00:32:21,439
We don't have any time left.

694
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,119
Don't you think that you are funny?

695
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:25,359
What's wrong with me?

696
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:27,520
Do you have any misunderstanding

697
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,479
about me?

698
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:29,640
There is no misunderstanding.

699
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:31,800
I hate you.

700
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,040
Alright?

701
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,959
I'll tell you the truth.

702
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,040
I will never partner

703
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:38,280
with you.

704
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,800
It doesn't matter.

705
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:41,319
You don't need to say those words.

706
00:32:41,479 --> 00:32:42,439
I know that you didn't

707
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,560
do anything with my skating blades.

708
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,239
The most important thing right now

709
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:46,000
is for us to work together

710
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,119
and defeat Eunkyung Choi.

711
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,839
If we cannot win her,

712
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,599
Wind Chaser will be dismissed.

713
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,800
What shall we do then?

714
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:53,640
I have no interest in
working together with you.

715
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:56,560
Come on. What did I ever do

716
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:57,800
to make you hate me so much?

717
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,599
Then I will tell you

718
00:33:00,719 --> 00:33:01,439
exactly.

719
00:33:01,719 --> 00:33:02,800
Ever since you came to Wind Chaser,

720
00:33:02,959 --> 00:33:03,560
you have messed

721
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:04,959
all my training plans up.

722
00:33:05,239 --> 00:33:06,280
Now I don't want to practice anymore.

723
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,239
That's what you wanted, right?

724
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:08,439
Why are you coming for me

725
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,479
hypocritically?

726
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,079
What are you talking about?

727
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:13,959
Whether it be training or contest,

728
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,000
I've never thought about

729
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,760
competing with you.

730
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,439
You are giving up

731
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,560
short track speed skating just for

732
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,280
those unnecessary misunderstanding?

733
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,040
Don't you feel some pity

734
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,239
about giving up Wind Chaser 
and the Asian Cup?

735
00:33:24,719 --> 00:33:26,199
Even if I would attend the Asian Cup,

736
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,800
it doesn't have to be with Wind Chaser.

737
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,239
Are you really joining the Flyer team?

738
00:33:31,199 --> 00:33:32,680
It's none of your business.

739
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,479
Stop it.

740
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,319
What can I do to make you

741
00:33:36,479 --> 00:33:38,040
come back and train yourself?

742
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,319
If you leave Wind Chaser,

743
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:42,599
I will come back.

744
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:49,079
Director Liu.

745
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:52,079
You are still here.

746
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,719
I heard that you wanted Luo Xiaoyi

747
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,479
to join the Flyer team.

748
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:56,880
Who said that?

749
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,319
Is it true?

750
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,599
Yes.

751
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,560
Do you have any questions

752
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,560
about the internal decision?

753
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,880
I can understand that the
team will recruit more talents,

754
00:34:05,239 --> 00:34:06,959
but why does it have to be Luo Xiaoyi?

755
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,239
You know that

756
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,040
I left Wind Chaser

757
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,040
because of her.

758
00:34:10,479 --> 00:34:11,199
Yu Bingling.

759
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,639
Do you want the Flyer team

760
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,479
to pay for your own personal matters?

761
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,320
You should know clearly

762
00:34:16,479 --> 00:34:16,879
how you have performed

763
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,080
lately.

764
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,040
That's not what I mean.

765
00:34:20,439 --> 00:34:21,040
But I cannot

766
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:21,959
attend the contest

767
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,040
together with her.

768
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,040
During the Asian Cup,

769
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,560
Eunkyung Choi is not your only rival,

770
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,520
Shen Zhengyi is also a strong rival.

771
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,840
We don't have more

772
00:34:29,959 --> 00:34:30,800
faith to rely solely

773
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:31,800
on you.

774
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:32,800
We can't afford

775
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,280
risking you competing alone.

776
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,199
Yu Bingling.

777
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,239
Calm down and think about it.

778
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,280
If Luo Xiaoyi really joins the team,

779
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:43,560
you two can cooperate

780
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,360
to make other rivals

781
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:46,439
feel pressured

782
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,479
during the final.

783
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:48,600
It's the best choice

784
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,840
both for you

785
00:34:49,959 --> 00:34:50,760
and the Flyer team.

786
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,040
We can only win

787
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,560
in this way.

788
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,560
Director Liu.

789
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:55,560
I know that I have

790
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,320
disappointed all of you

791
00:34:56,439 --> 00:34:57,760
by losing to Shen Zhengyi
in Ling Yun Cup.

792
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,560
But please believe me.

793
00:35:00,479 --> 00:35:01,199
I can win the championship

794
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,479
even without Luo Xiaoyi.

795
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,320
If you have to let her join,

796
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:05,959
I will leave.

797
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,479
You left without hesitation.

798
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,560
Everyone's been looking for you.

799
00:36:29,919 --> 00:36:30,639
Sorry.

800
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,120
I need to think

801
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,399
something through alone.

802
00:36:33,479 --> 00:36:34,639
Have you thought it through then?

803
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:57,950
(Resignation letter)

804
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,840
So your conclusion is to escape?

805
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:04,719
I'm sorry, coach Zhuang.

806
00:37:05,439 --> 00:37:06,560
You might need to put more efforts

807
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,159
on Wind Chaser from now.

808
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:08,520
Save it.

809
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:11,719
Xiao Han.

810
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:13,719
What was your purpose to join
Wind Chaser?

811
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,040
Was making Luo Xiaoyi the champion

812
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,399
your only goal?

813
00:37:16,439 --> 00:37:17,439
What about other kids?

814
00:37:17,919 --> 00:37:18,360
Shouldn't you take responsibility

815
00:37:18,439 --> 00:37:19,679
for them as well?

816
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,320
They will be very sad.

817
00:37:23,439 --> 00:37:24,560
I'm not a qualified coach.

818
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,280
I let Wind Chaser down,

819
00:37:27,399 --> 00:37:28,159
and I let everyone who trusted me down.

820
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,280
If you are really sorry,

821
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:30,360
then you should think about

822
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,879
how to become a qualified coach,

823
00:37:32,439 --> 00:37:33,239
and how to do more

824
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,360
for Wind Chaser,

825
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:35,919
instead of trying to escape.

826
00:37:41,479 --> 00:37:42,199
Xiao Han.

827
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,479
I joined Wind Chaser

828
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:46,239
just for one goal.

829
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,520
I hope that Wind Chaser

830
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,600
can become a very cohesive team.

831
00:37:52,879 --> 00:37:54,040
To achieve this goal,

832
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:56,679
I wouldn't escape no matter
what kind of difficulties

833
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,120
there might be on the way.

834
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:08,239
So, as your comrade,

835
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,120
I hope that you can stay.

836
00:38:18,959 --> 00:38:20,239
Let me get you a cup of water.

837
00:38:33,879 --> 00:38:34,600
Coach Xiao,

838
00:38:34,959 --> 00:38:35,760
we really miss you

839
00:38:35,879 --> 00:38:37,040
while you are away.

840
00:38:37,479 --> 00:38:38,760
Please come back soon.

841
00:38:39,959 --> 00:38:40,679
Coach Xiao,

842
00:38:40,959 --> 00:38:42,120
we really

843
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:43,320
want you back.

844
00:38:43,879 --> 00:38:45,320
When can you be back?

845
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,399
Are you slacking off somewhere?

846
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,199
Just kidding.

847
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,840
I know that you are tired

848
00:38:54,959 --> 00:38:55,760
and you need some rest.

849
00:38:56,399 --> 00:38:57,840
Are you done resting?

850
00:38:59,399 --> 00:39:00,040
Coach Xiao,

851
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,760
I don't know

852
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,040
why you left us.

853
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,120
Please come back soon.

854
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,879
We really need you.

855
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,000
Coach Xiao,

856
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,479
although the training has been

857
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:13,120
tiring and harsh,

858
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,560
we even sometimes wonder

859
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,120
that we might be able to

860
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,360
slack off when you are away.

861
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,959
But while you are actually away

862
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:20,679
these days,

863
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,959
we really miss you.

864
00:39:23,399 --> 00:39:25,479
Now when we think about you,

865
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,040
we remember that

866
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:27,919
you tell us to be careful

867
00:39:27,959 --> 00:39:29,399
before going on the rink every time.

868
00:39:29,879 --> 00:39:31,600
So please come back.

869
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:32,679
We really miss you.

870
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:38,800
- Coach Xiao,
- Coach Xiao,

871
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:41,679
- we will wait for you.
- we will wait for you.

872
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:01,199
The Asian Cup

873
00:40:01,479 --> 00:40:02,360
will decide the fate

874
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:04,239
of Wind Chaser.

875
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:08,919
Coach Xiao,

876
00:40:10,399 --> 00:40:11,159
are you willing to

877
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:12,239
fight together with us?

878
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,600
Coach Xiao,

879
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:23,360
the kids in Wind Chaser need you.

880
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,320
Then I will tell you

881
00:40:38,439 --> 00:40:39,159
exactly.

882
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,479
Ever since you came to Wind Chaser,

883
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,280
you have messed

884
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,479
all my training plans up.

885
00:40:42,919 --> 00:40:44,080
Now I don't want to practice anymore.

886
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:45,000
That's what you wanted, right?

887
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:46,159
Why are you coming for me

888
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,159
hypocritically?

889
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:48,879
(I cannot let Xiaoyi)

890
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:50,239
(leave Wind Chaser like this.)
