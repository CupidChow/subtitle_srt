00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,990
=Episode 5=

3
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:38,480
Why are you

4
00:01:38,559 --> 00:01:39,440
being so sneaky here?

5
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:44,199
Does it have anything to do with you?

6
00:01:44,559 --> 00:01:45,360
I am not complimenting but

7
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,519
why are you so

8
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:47,559
nosy?

9
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,800
I'm nosy?

10
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:51,160
This is where I train.

11
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,120
Besides, I am different

12
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:52,800
from who I was before.

13
00:01:53,199 --> 00:01:53,959
I don't have to be obedient

14
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,959
to you anymore.

15
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:56,440
So,

16
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,959
what are you trying to do?

17
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,559
If you don't tell me,

18
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,440
I will ask Coach Zhuang to ask you.

19
00:02:04,199 --> 00:02:04,919
Go ahead.

20
00:02:05,199 --> 00:02:05,839
Okay.

21
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:06,680
If you go,

22
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,199
Shen Zhengyi would never

23
00:02:07,279 --> 00:02:08,279
be able to get on the ice.

24
00:02:21,839 --> 00:02:23,639
Shao Beisheng asked me
to keep an eye on Coach Zhuang

25
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,440
in order to steal the key to
the Skating Rink easily at night.

26
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,800
Where is it?

27
00:02:56,399 --> 00:02:57,440
So tricky.

28
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:02,919
What are you doing?

29
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,960
You saw it?

30
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,160
Well...

31
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,839
Then,

32
00:03:20,279 --> 00:03:21,919
can you not tell anyone?

33
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,839
Please.

34
00:03:29,839 --> 00:03:30,720
My great partner.

35
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,119
I see.

36
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:35,039
How about this?

37
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,440
I'll stay to keep an eye on Coach Zhuang

38
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,720
since I've got better reason.

39
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,399
Trust me.

40
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:41,440
Why would you keep an eye on me?

41
00:04:03,679 --> 00:04:04,919
What kind of students are you?

42
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:06,479
Do you think that anyone can

43
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,800
take the key to the
Skating Rink as they wish?

44
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,160
How can you guys not know

45
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:09,880
how to behave at all?

46
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:15,000
Coach Zhuang, Coach Ma,

47
00:04:15,119 --> 00:04:16,359
we know that we made a mistake.

48
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,880
It won't happen again.

49
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,559
Hand in a paper of self-criticism

50
00:04:20,559 --> 00:04:21,480
of 5000 words per person tomorrow.

51
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,920
Isn't 5000 words too...

52
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,880
6000 words.

53
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:26,880
Um...

54
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,200
Alright, go write the paper.

55
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,119
Write it well.

56
00:04:37,119 --> 00:04:37,880
Go.

57
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:39,799
Bye, coach.

58
00:04:52,239 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm so sorry.

59
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,880
It's all my fault

60
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:55,160
and I've got you all in trouble.

61
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,679
Of course, excluding you.

62
00:04:57,239 --> 00:04:58,079
I do this for...

63
00:04:58,119 --> 00:05:00,200
A self-criticism of 6000 words.

64
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,600
I've never written so many words

65
00:05:01,679 --> 00:05:02,679
during my whole middle school years.

66
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:04,200
It's all your fault.

67
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,519
If you didn't say anything,

68
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,079
we wouldn't have to
write 1000 words more.

69
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,559
Come on. I asked because

70
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:10,640
I was trying to help us

71
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,760
plead for her leniency.

72
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:12,760
You don't know that

73
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:13,920
Coach Zhuang is very stubborn?

74
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:16,760
It's right about an old saying that

75
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:17,760
stupid teammate is worse
than a superior opponent.

76
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,519
Who are you referring to?

77
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,160
Is there another person

78
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:23,000
whose family name is Zhu?

79
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:23,959
Lele.

80
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,519
Lele, Lele.

81
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:26,720
Qu Zhi.

82
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,880
Pardon me, Xiao Qing.

83
00:05:33,559 --> 00:05:34,239
It's okay.

84
00:05:34,679 --> 00:05:35,480
So you did all these

85
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,640
for your girlfriend.

86
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:37,799
Her name is...

87
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:38,480
Shen Zhengyi

88
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,600
and she's from the
Short Track Speed Skating Team.

89
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,160
I was just trying to
help her get on the ice.

90
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,079
Actually, you are
the most innocent one.

91
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:44,679
I really don't think that

92
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,799
you have to write the
paper of self-criticism as well.

93
00:05:46,359 --> 00:05:46,920
It's fine.

94
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,600
This is also my first time
to write such a thing.

95
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:49,760
It's quite interesting.

96
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,600
Let's go.

97
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,640
Stop there.

98
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,040
Why did you want to steal the key?

99
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:00,760
Coach Zhuang,

100
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,880
I'm from Figure Skating Team.

101
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,279
Yet you are the coach
of Short Track Speed Skating.

102
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,480
Please leave me alone.

103
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:05,959
Was it for Shen Zhengyi?

104
00:06:06,359 --> 00:06:07,079
It's none of your business.

105
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,519
I am your mom.

106
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,399
Shouldn't I care about you

107
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,440
or ask about you?

108
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:14,279
Do you think that

109
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,480
you deserve this word?

110
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:17,359
When I needed you the most,

111
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:18,279
you left me alone.

112
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,359
So please keep leaving me alone

113
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:23,799
and pay attention to your team instead.

114
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:56,679
How long do you want to

115
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,880
keep distance from me?

116
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,160
Coach Ma showed me the video

117
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:07,880
of you two doing Pairs Skating.

118
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:10,359
It's better than I expected.

119
00:07:11,119 --> 00:07:12,239
I admit that you are
good at picking a partner.

120
00:07:18,119 --> 00:07:19,720
I might have acted
a little bit over before.

121
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,239
You are already a grown-up

122
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,119
and you can make your own decision.

123
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:25,760
But since you are back now,

124
00:07:25,799 --> 00:07:27,040
why can't you focus on training?

125
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,720
Did you have to act recklessly
with Shao Beisheng

126
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,200
and write thousands of words
for a paper of self-criticism?

127
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:33,079
He did it out of a good purpose though.

128
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,839
It was all for Shen Zhengyi
from your team.

129
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:37,440
Shao Beisheng tried to steal the key

130
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:38,519
for Shen Zhengyi?

131
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:42,399
That Shen Zhengyi is quite a winner?

132
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,279
Both Shao Beisheng

133
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:44,959
and you have been

134
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,920
helping her.

135
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,440
Shen Zhengyi?

136
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:52,160
She is a very persistent person.

137
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,760
As long as she sets a goal,

138
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,440
she would try her best.

139
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:57,000
Then I quite like

140
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:58,160
that kind of personality.

141
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,399
The school is just arranging

142
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,279
the dorm for me.

143
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:01,040
I will check if I can apply to

144
00:08:01,119 --> 00:08:02,440
be a roommate with her.

145
00:08:03,679 --> 00:08:04,239
Let's eat.

146
00:08:04,559 --> 00:08:05,320
I will cook for you.

147
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,440
One second.

148
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,380
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team
of Lingbei University)

149
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,760
Xiao Qing.

150
00:08:29,799 --> 00:08:30,720
Are you here waiting for me?

151
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:31,239
Yes.

152
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,359
This is for you.

153
00:08:35,239 --> 00:08:35,919
This is...?

154
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,400
Although I'm not good at writing,

155
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,359
I put lots of efforts in it.

156
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,919
It should work.

157
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,840
Why not have a look at it?

158
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,719
Now?

159
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,140
(A paper of self-criticism)

160
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:56,960
If you're afraid that

161
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,239
the handwriting is different,

162
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,520
you might have to copy it by hand.

163
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,960
I can't really help with that.

164
00:09:02,119 --> 00:09:02,679
Sorry.

165
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:03,599
Thank you.

166
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:05,000
Actually, I didn't do any

167
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,880
favor the other day.

168
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,479
How can you say that?

169
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,960
Although we didn't succeed,

170
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,799
I'm really thankful to you.

171
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:13,960
I gotta go now.

172
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,440
Coach Zhuang,

173
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:30,960
this is my letter of self-criticism.

174
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,559
Coach Zhuang, I don't have
a solid foundation

175
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,760
that matches

176
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,760
professional athletes.

177
00:09:37,239 --> 00:09:38,840
However, if I don't get on the ice,

178
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,640
I really don't know

179
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:40,719
how I can improve myself.

180
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,280
I've told you before that

181
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,239
you are not qualified to
get on the ice together

182
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,400
with them.

183
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:45,840
I know,

184
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:47,479
but would you

185
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:49,799
promise a time

186
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,599
when I can get on the ice?

187
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:56,719
Alright. Let me ask you.

188
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,440
Do you know

189
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,599
what's the most important thing
for Short Track Speed Skating?

190
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,679
Speed.

191
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,000
Speed again.

192
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:07,400
Shen Zhengyi, let me tell you.

193
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,799
You're not the only one on ice.

194
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,200
When you get a new answer,

195
00:10:12,239 --> 00:10:13,119
come find me again.

196
00:10:15,359 --> 00:10:16,559
Thank you, Coach Zhuang.

197
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,840
Wait.

198
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,679
I quit.

199
00:10:34,239 --> 00:10:35,039
What do you mean by quit?

200
00:10:37,239 --> 00:10:38,080
Are you trying to break your promise?

201
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,039
Break my promise?

202
00:10:39,119 --> 00:10:40,119
You did it first.

203
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:40,679
No, no.

204
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,039
You've been lying to me this whole time.

205
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,559
When did I lie to you?

206
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:45,239
You tried to steal the key,

207
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,440
only to make me
write the letter of self-criticism.

208
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,880
Are you proud of yourself?

209
00:10:48,239 --> 00:10:48,880
Two days.

210
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,799
Give me two days.

211
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:52,039
I swear to let you get on the ice.

212
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,239
Do not break your promise.

213
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:54,400
I don't trust you anymore.

214
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:54,919
Bye.

215
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:55,919
Shen Zhengyi.

216
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:57,599
Shen Zhengyi.

217
00:10:59,039 --> 00:10:59,840
Shen Zhengyi.

218
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:02,840
Keep the distance. Be careful.

219
00:11:04,119 --> 00:11:04,640
Fang Nan,

220
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:05,880
lower your shoulder.

221
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,280
Very good.

222
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:09,400
Zhu Lele, keep it that way.

223
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:10,880
Keep it that way.

224
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,239
Hurry up.

225
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,080
Fang Nan.

226
00:11:15,359 --> 00:11:16,119
How many times do I have to repeat it?

227
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,679
Lower, a little lower.

228
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,760
No, it won't work.

229
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:38,320
Why not?

230
00:11:39,119 --> 00:11:40,200
You can add training time for yourself,

231
00:11:40,359 --> 00:11:41,440
but she's from the speed skating team.

232
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,479
How can she train together with you?

233
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,400
No.

234
00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:44,919
I want her to use my name for training.

235
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,880
Let her get on the ice,

236
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,679
and I will wait nearby.

237
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,400
You can oversee her.

238
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:48,679
Is there any problem?

239
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:49,640
Problem?

240
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,640
Let me tell you what the problem is.

241
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,159
The problem is that

242
00:11:51,479 --> 00:11:52,960
her coach does not allow her
to get on the ice.

243
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:53,880
Besides,

244
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,760
why do I have to oversee her

245
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,840
as a coach from Figure Skating Team?

246
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,039
No. We can keep this

247
00:11:57,119 --> 00:11:57,799
between us.

248
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,679
If neither of us tells anyone,

249
00:11:58,719 --> 00:11:59,559
who would ever find out about it?

250
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,200
Don't tell me that
you are afraid of Zhuang Yue.

251
00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:07,919
I... I'm afraid?

252
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,080
Why would I be afraid of
someone of the same level as me?

253
00:12:09,239 --> 00:12:11,080
She is no threat to me.

254
00:12:11,119 --> 00:12:11,960
You are the best.

255
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:12,960
So it's settled.

256
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:13,599
Gotta go now.

257
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:14,159
No, I didn't agree.

258
00:12:14,239 --> 00:12:14,880
I cannot help you with this.

259
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:15,640
Don't involve me in it.

260
00:12:17,119 --> 00:12:17,640
You are not going to help, right?

261
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:18,359
No.

262
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:19,359
Alright.

263
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,760
I don't know whose autograph

264
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:23,080
is below

265
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:24,239
the textbook in the second drawer

266
00:12:24,359 --> 00:12:25,640
on the left.

267
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:26,760
I didn't expect that

268
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:27,919
our respected Coach Ma

269
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,000
is also a fanboy.

270
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:33,400
I don't know what you are talking about.

271
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:37,080
How dare you threaten me?

272
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:39,640
You said you won't be
in a relationship, didn't you?

273
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,039
What did Shen Zhengyi do with you?

274
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,640
For your girlfriend,
you would do this to me,

275
00:12:43,719 --> 00:12:44,320
huh?

276
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:45,960
It has nothing to do with relationship.

277
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,200
Then what is it?

278
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,520
It has something to do with
whether I like it or not.

279
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:51,400
Alright.

280
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,359
So it's a deal.

281
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,159
I will bring her there in a moment.

282
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,200
Gotta go.

283
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:55,919
You didn't have to do this.

284
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,400
I will keep a secret for you.

285
00:13:05,479 --> 00:13:06,440
How did he find out?

286
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:14,919
Nice.

287
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:16,000
You made some progress.

288
00:13:16,599 --> 00:13:17,440
Okay. Nice work today.

289
00:13:17,599 --> 00:13:17,960
That's all for today.

290
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,760
You can go back. Okay.

291
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,200
Beisheng, aren't you leaving?

292
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,280
I...

293
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,599
I... I want to have a talk
with Coach Ma.

294
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:30,400
You go home.

295
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,440
Okay.

296
00:13:32,599 --> 00:13:33,200
Rest well.

297
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,039
Okay.

298
00:13:34,119 --> 00:13:34,679
Bye.

299
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,119
- Bye.
- Bye.

300
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,719
Zhengyi, I gotta go now.

301
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,580
(Shao Beisheng)

302
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,840
I have got the skating rink ready.

303
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:20,559
I won't trust you again.

304
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,280
Come to the skating rink
in half an hour.

305
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,719
You should sharpen your blade

306
00:14:38,119 --> 00:14:38,679
in case you would slip.

307
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,559
Hi, brother Fei.

308
00:14:39,719 --> 00:14:40,159
Brother Fei.

309
00:14:40,239 --> 00:14:41,239
Seriously, the blade is too dull.

310
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,520
Wang Jun, you have been

311
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:43,679
in such good condition these days.

312
00:14:43,719 --> 00:14:44,559
Did you train a lot in secret?

313
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:45,760
No.

314
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,520
Hi, there.

315
00:15:02,239 --> 00:15:04,640
Um... I...

316
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,960
Stop looking.
She doesn't want to talk to you.

317
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:16,960
Is she from Figure Skating Team?

318
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,039
Otherwise?

319
00:15:18,479 --> 00:15:19,640
Except for those
from Figure Skating Team,

320
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,239
who would have such temperament?

321
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,000
Shao Beisheng's new partner, Xiao Qing.

322
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,760
I'm jealous of Pairs Skating as always.

323
00:15:29,239 --> 00:15:31,119
I'm jealous of Shao Beisheng

324
00:15:31,239 --> 00:15:32,479
as always.

325
00:15:33,239 --> 00:15:35,400
Hi, there.

326
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,640
You're so mean.

327
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,950
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team
of Lingbei University)

328
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:47,479
You are here.

329
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,520
How is it?

330
00:15:54,719 --> 00:15:55,559
I reserved it for you.

331
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:56,719
I didn't lie, did I?

332
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,960
Is this really okay?

333
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,080
I'm telling you. 2 hours at maximum.

334
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,679
Thank you, Coach Ma.

335
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,359
It's okay.

336
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,119
How can you only thank him?

337
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:10,080
I will die sooner or later
because of you.

338
00:16:12,719 --> 00:16:13,200
You two can start.

339
00:16:13,719 --> 00:16:14,200
I will go take a nap.

340
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,000
Clean it well when you leave.

341
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:16,719
Bye, Coach Ma.

342
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,320
Bye.

343
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,119
What are you waiting for?

344
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,599
Go change your shoes.

345
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,880
Don't skate too fast.

346
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,320
Warm up first.

347
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:43,760
What is it?

348
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:44,840
The time is valuable.

349
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,599
If I knew that
I can get on the ice today,

350
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,000
I would've brought the cotton tape.

351
00:16:48,719 --> 00:16:50,159
I just wanted to practice curves.

352
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,679
I am not complimenting

353
00:16:52,119 --> 00:16:53,320
but I cannot bear with

354
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:54,239
your curve skills.

355
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,119
Don't make sarcastic remarks there.

356
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,359
You have to overcome your fear.

357
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,520
Do you understand?

358
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,840
If I could overcome it,

359
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,159
would I be here now?

360
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,560
What are you doing?

361
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:17,160
Trust me.

362
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:23,140

365
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,880
I will skate with you for a few laps.

00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,400
Get down using my help.

367
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,239
Trust me.

368
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,800
It will work so much better

What are you two doing?

385
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,239
Shen Zhengyi,

386
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,560
I didn't allow you to get on the ice,

387
00:19:00,719 --> 00:19:01,400
so you are doing this on purpose,

388
00:19:01,479 --> 00:19:02,239
huh?

389
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:04,640
No.

390
00:19:04,959 --> 00:19:06,040
I asked her to train with me.

391
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,839
No,

392
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,479
I begged Shao Beisheng

393
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,040
to help me

394
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,479
get on the ice.

395
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,079
Coach Zhuang,

396
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,800
I just want to

397
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,439
cherish every single second
at Wind Chaser

398
00:19:24,719 --> 00:19:25,479
and practice more.

399
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,079
Did I allow you to get on the ice?

400
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:28,680
Did you think through

401
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,119
your problem that I told you about?

402
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:31,880
It seems that you are doing this

403
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:32,959
to her on purpose.

404
00:19:33,479 --> 00:19:34,119
If there is anything wrong with her,

405
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:35,439
why not just tell her directly,

406
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,160
right?

407
00:19:36,439 --> 00:19:37,719
Why wouldn't you let her get on the ice?

408
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,400
What are you doing?

409
00:19:38,479 --> 00:19:39,000
Does it solve any problem

410
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:40,400
by keeping her away
from the Skating Rink?

411
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:42,160
I'm telling you that

412
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,760
a qualified coach

413
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:44,640
would never punish

414
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,239
her own student

415
00:19:45,239 --> 00:19:46,439
like this.

416
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,880
Shao Beisheng.

417
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:49,599
You do know that I'm the coach?

418
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,479
Since I'm her coach,

419
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:52,160
I will decide when

420
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:52,719
she gets on the ice

421
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,640
and how she is trained.

422
00:19:53,719 --> 00:19:54,520
If a coach doesn't help her own student,

423
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,000
you should at least let others help her.

424
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,079
Shao Beisheng.

425
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:01,119
Shao Beisheng.

426
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,959
Who do you think you are

427
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:03,920
to challenge me here?

428
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,719
It's not like this, Coach Zhuang.

429
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,839
Shao Beisheng is not...

430
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:07,920
Shut up.

431
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,640
Shen Zhengyi,

432
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,400
are you aware of

433
00:20:10,479 --> 00:20:11,920
how serious your problem is now?

434
00:20:12,439 --> 00:20:13,040
What were you thinking

435
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:13,880
when you were on the ice?

436
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,239
Nothing but speed.

437
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,319
It does not only

438
00:20:16,439 --> 00:20:17,319
put yourself in danger

439
00:20:17,479 --> 00:20:18,199
but also

440
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,040
put others in danger.

441
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:19,520
Do you know that

442
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,520
you might not be able to

443
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,199
get on the rice again
once there's an accident?

444
00:20:28,439 --> 00:20:29,599
I'm warning you.

445
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,119
If you dare to get on the ice again,

446
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,640
just leave.

447
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:14,119
Don't your feet hurt?

448
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:24,920
I didn't even get mad.

449
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,160
What are you mad at?

450
00:21:30,439 --> 00:21:31,319
You were practicing so well,

451
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,479
but it got disturbed.

452
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,640
Sorry.

453
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:38,000
It's not your fault.

454
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,040
You've kept

455
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,119
your promise.

456
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,319
Maybe I just have bad luck

457
00:21:45,199 --> 00:21:46,719
and get you involved.

458
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,839
But Coach Zhuang was right

459
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:51,439
that I'm unprofessional

460
00:21:52,959 --> 00:21:55,160
and I never got trained properly.

461
00:21:56,479 --> 00:21:58,400
I didn't know all those about safety

462
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,319
and it does affect

463
00:22:01,479 --> 00:22:02,920
other people's training.

464
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,560
Since you like skating so much,

465
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,800
why didn't you start

466
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:17,880
professional training earlier?

467
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:23,199
Do your parents support
your Figure Skating?

468
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,280
Yeah, pretty much.

469
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,280
So jealous.

470
00:22:33,479 --> 00:22:34,719
What's there to be jealous about?

471
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:38,599
They can give me nothing

472
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,160
except for support.

473
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:43,079
They trust you unconditionally

474
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:45,319
so that

475
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,920
they can support you unconditionally.

476
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,079
I really hope that

477
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,040
my mom can support me

478
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:55,280
on practicing Short Track Speed Skating.

479
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,680
It's a shame that I have been

480
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,280
secretly training myself
this whole time.

481
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,680
You trained yourself?

482
00:23:03,719 --> 00:23:05,319
Then you've made great achievement

483
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,760
with where you are now.

484
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,199
Why doesn't she support you

485
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:13,239
to skate then?

486
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:18,760
She used to be an athlete
of Short Track Speed Skating

487
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:20,040
as well.

488
00:23:20,719 --> 00:23:21,959
Then she quit

489
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,239
because she injured herself.

490
00:23:26,959 --> 00:23:27,719
Even now

491
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,119
when it's cloudy or rainy,

492
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:31,599
her legs would still hurt.

493
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,439
Maybe because of

494
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:35,520
this reason,

495
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,359
she doesn't want me

496
00:23:38,439 --> 00:23:39,359
to follow her path.

497
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,880
She's very determined.

498
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,959
But I really want

499
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:52,760
to stay in Wind Chaser.

500
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:04,199
Zhengyi, Zhengyi,

501
00:24:04,719 --> 00:24:05,920
check out our dorm.

502
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:07,920
What's different?

503
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,400
There's a new roommate?

504
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,640
She is very nice

505
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,920
and she even has something
kind of relationship with you.

506
00:24:15,239 --> 00:24:16,319
What kind of relationship?

507
00:24:17,199 --> 00:24:17,880
Zhengyi,

508
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:19,199
you haven't collected your clothes
in the laundry.

509
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,680
I'm coming.

510
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,680
I will go collect my clothes first.

511
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,959
I will talk to you when I'm back.

512
00:24:28,199 --> 00:24:29,479
The girlfriend of your idol is here.

513
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:35,680
Excuse me, have you seen

514
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,040
my clothes in the laundry?

515
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,560
No, we haven't.

516
00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:39,680
We didn't see it.

517
00:24:43,959 --> 00:24:44,760
What are you doing?

518
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:46,000
Why would you step on

519
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,680
other people's clothes?

520
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,520
Did you write your name on it?

521
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,280
How would I know that

522
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:51,079
these clothes are yours?

523
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:52,280
Even if they are not mine,

524
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,040
you shouldn't step on

525
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:54,479
other people's clothes.

526
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,599
What are you yelling about?

527
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,280
Do you consider yourself a queen

528
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,719
just because you are
Shao Beisheng's girlfriend?

529
00:24:58,359 --> 00:24:58,760
Wait,

530
00:24:58,839 --> 00:24:59,800
what does it have anything to do

531
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,479
with me being
Shao Beisheng's girlfriend?

532
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:01,680
Nothing.

533
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,439
We just don't like you.

534
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,479
You are nothing more than

535
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:06,040
a slave girl who

536
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,439
follows Shao Beisheng everywhere.

537
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,479
You really consider

538
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,439
yourself as Shao Beisheng's girlfriend?

539
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,280
Exactly.

540
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:11,160
It's not enough that

541
00:25:11,239 --> 00:25:12,640
you got banned from ice by the coach?

542
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,479
Now Shao Beisheng has to be punished
because of you.

543
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,839
How is he punished?

544
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:18,400
I really don't know what

545
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,319
Shao Beisheng likes about you.

546
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:22,239
How can you be not good at curves

547
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:23,680
as an athlete of
Short Track Speed Skating?

548
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,280
What are you doing?

549
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,640
Xiao Qing.

550
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,680
Xiao Qing, what are you doing?

551
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:36,800
Princess Xiao,

552
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,920
you are doing it on purpose, right?

553
00:25:38,239 --> 00:25:39,439
I'm just doing

554
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,199
what you guys were doing to others.

555
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,000
Is there a problem?

556
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,520
(No wonder she looks so familiar.)

557
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:43,920
(So she's the new partner)

558
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,239
(of Shao Beisheng.)

559
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,199
Let's go.

560
00:26:13,199 --> 00:26:14,119
This tangerine is so sweet.

561
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:14,839
Where did you get it?

562
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,760
The convenience store at school.

563
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,319
Zhengyi, Zhengyi,

564
00:26:17,479 --> 00:26:18,079
come here.

565
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:19,920
Let me introduce to you

566
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:22,280
our new roommate,

567
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,560
Xiao Qing from Figure Skating Team.

568
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,520
She's also the new partner

569
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,680
of your Shao Beisheng.

570
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,119
We have seen each other.

571
00:26:27,479 --> 00:26:28,479
Seems like we are destined.

572
00:26:29,199 --> 00:26:30,040
Thank you for what happened just now.

573
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,160
Also sorry for last time when

574
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,560
you wrote a letter of self-criticism
because of me.

575
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:34,719
Sorry about it.

576
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,640
Don't worry.

577
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I heard from my brother

578
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:37,880
that you also had a hard time

579
00:26:37,959 --> 00:26:39,359
getting into Wind Chaser.

580
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,439
I want to help you as well.

581
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,800
Your brother?

582
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,760
My brother is Xiao Han.

583
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,359
So your brother is Coach Xiao.

584
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,880
Oh my god.

585
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,520
No wonder you look so pretty

586
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:50,239
and you are so charming.

587
00:26:50,439 --> 00:26:51,520
Such powerful gene

588
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,119
of you and Coach Xiao.

589
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:54,760
I've been handling

590
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:55,760
my entrance procedure,

591
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,920
so I'm here at this late time.

592
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:57,839
Oh,

593
00:26:57,959 --> 00:26:59,040
I've prepared gifts for you.

594
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:01,880
Nice to meet you all.

595
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,119
Thanks.

596
00:27:03,239 --> 00:27:03,560
How do you know that

597
00:27:03,719 --> 00:27:04,560
we love UNIFON?

598
00:27:04,719 --> 00:27:05,640
Everyone's using it.

599
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,920
Thank you, Xiao Qing.

600
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:09,319
You helped me today

601
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,439
and also brought us gifts.

602
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:12,839
Lele and I will treat you

603
00:27:13,199 --> 00:27:13,880
a meal another day.

604
00:27:14,719 --> 00:27:17,319
Welcome our new roommate!

605
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,920
I didn't expect to

606
00:27:24,199 --> 00:27:24,839
see our Prince Sheng

607
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,920
beg anyone.

608
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,479
Senior, please help me.

609
00:27:27,959 --> 00:27:29,079
I asked you to borrow me

610
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:29,760
the Skating Rink but you didn't.

611
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,760
Help me.

612
00:27:31,479 --> 00:27:32,640
That is the rule of the club.

613
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,800
Adults are not allowed

614
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,920
in teens' Skating Rink.

615
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:36,280
Who'll take the responsibility
if there's an accident?

616
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,560
I will.

617
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:38,680
I will.

618
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,520
No, it doesn't work like that.

619
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:40,839
You shouldn't get me involved

620
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:41,599
like you did

621
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,680
with stealing the key.

622
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,400
I've heard about it.

623
00:27:43,719 --> 00:27:45,199
But I admire you

624
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,560
for what you did for your girlfriend.

625
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,119
No, she's not my girlfriend.

626
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,599
Then

627
00:27:52,959 --> 00:27:54,000
can you help me

628
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:54,760
with hiring the assistant coach?

629
00:27:55,199 --> 00:27:56,319
After the teens finish skating,

630
00:27:56,439 --> 00:27:57,560
it doesn't break the rules

631
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,319
to let the assistant coach
skate on it, right?

632
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,400
No, it doesn't.

633
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,119
Exactly.

634
00:28:02,439 --> 00:28:03,359
But you are late.

635
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,920
The assistant coach has been determined

636
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,359
by the club.

637
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,640
No way.

638
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:08,880
I... I just saw the recruitment notice

639
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,680
on the bulletin board

640
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,599
at the entrance.

641
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,839
Yes, it's still there,

642
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:13,319
but it was decided

643
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,280
quickly.

644
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,680
There's nothing I can do.

645
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,599
How about this?

646
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,880
This assistant coach I have is for free.

647
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:23,719
So does the new assistant coach.

648
00:28:32,239 --> 00:28:32,880
Coach Zhuang,

649
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,199
do you have a second for a talk?

650
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:35,040
Sure.

651
00:28:36,199 --> 00:28:38,000
I think that it has been a while

652
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:38,920
since Zhengyi was banned

653
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,719
from getting on the ice.

654
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,079
Will you get her back to training?

655
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,439
- For the qualification contest...
- No way.

656
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:44,760
She hasn't been aware of

657
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,400
her own problem yet,

658
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,359
so she cannot get on the ice.

659
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,359
Do you want her

660
00:28:47,479 --> 00:28:48,280
into Wind Chaser or not?

661
00:28:48,719 --> 00:28:49,439
If I don't want it,

662
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:50,599
why would I get her a chance?

663
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:51,959
Then how about

664
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:52,880
leaving her to me?

665
00:28:53,239 --> 00:28:54,319
I can train her separately

666
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,119
after every training.

667
00:28:55,199 --> 00:28:55,560
It won't affect the training

668
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,560
of others.

669
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,079
Do you want to

670
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:01,640
train her to be another Luo Xiaoyi?

671
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,839
Since she is one of Wind Chaser,

672
00:29:05,199 --> 00:29:06,319
she should follow the rules.

673
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,560
But rules are made by people

674
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,479
and they may not be fair.

675
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,400
Why would you make it so hard?

676
00:29:12,719 --> 00:29:13,640
Come in.

677
00:29:15,239 --> 00:29:16,239
Coach Zhuang, I heard that
you're looking for me.

678
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:17,880
Hello, Coach Xiao.

679
00:29:18,719 --> 00:29:19,439
Shen Zhengyi,

680
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,760
you disobeyed the rules

681
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:21,560
to get on the ice by yourself.

682
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,199
You have to take responsibility for it.

683
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:24,800
From now on,

684
00:29:25,199 --> 00:29:26,319
you will be the assistant coach
for teens' class.

685
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:31,920
Assistant coach...

686
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:33,680
At least you can get on the ice.

687
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:35,359
You should thank Coach Zhuang.

688
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,000
Thank you, Coach Zhuang.

689
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:49,839
Assemble.

690
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:52,400
Stand still.

691
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,560
Is she the one who won last time?

692
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,439
She won brother Beisheng.

693
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:57,560
Alright.

694
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,760
Quiet.

695
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,319
Kids,

696
00:30:00,719 --> 00:30:01,880
this sister will train together

697
00:30:01,959 --> 00:30:02,680
with us from today on.

698
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:03,719
Let's welcome her.

699
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:10,800
What are you doing?

700
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,640
Didn't you hear me?

701
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,400
Welcome.

702
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,920
We will have group training today.

703
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:17,959
You can lead them to do warm-up first.

704
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:18,520
Okay.

705
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:19,280
Thank you.

706
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,479
Hello kids.

707
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,520
I'm Shen Zhengyi.

708
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:29,199
I will train together

709
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,359
with you all from now on.

710
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,000
Let's get prepared together

711
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:32,640
first,

712
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,160
okay?

713
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,239
Okay. Come on.

714
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,239
Where are you going?

715
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,959
Come back.

716
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:41,719
Well...

717
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:42,560
Well...

718
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,680
Slow down. Slow down.

719
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,000
Wait. Don't...

720
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,640
(Coach Zhuang must've
put me in teens' class)

721
00:30:56,959 --> 00:30:57,760
(to let me find)

722
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,959
(the breakthrough.)

723
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,839
(But what is it on earth?)

724
00:31:13,479 --> 00:31:14,560
Do you know how to skate or not?

725
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,800
So bad.

726
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:27,839
Why is she falling again?

727
00:31:28,719 --> 00:31:29,400
Exactly.

728
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,439
It's so funny.

729
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Get up.

730
00:31:33,719 --> 00:31:34,719
How can you train us like this?

731
00:31:34,719 --> 00:31:36,599
Brother Beisheng is much better.

732
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:37,359
Of course.

733
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:38,959
Brother Beisheng is the best.

734
00:31:38,959 --> 00:31:39,959
Exactly.

735
00:31:39,959 --> 00:31:40,959
Get up.

736
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,880
Get up.

737
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,319
What's wrong?

738
00:32:15,719 --> 00:32:16,160
Nothing.

739
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:16,920
I...

740
00:32:17,439 --> 00:32:18,280
I called Shen Zhengyi.

741
00:32:18,719 --> 00:32:19,599
I cannot find her.

742
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,079
She must be training

743
00:32:21,199 --> 00:32:22,119
the kids.

744
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,560
She may not have time
to pick up the phone.

745
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,439
What do you mean by

746
00:32:26,199 --> 00:32:26,880
training kids?

747
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:27,880
She was sent to train the teens' class

748
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,359
by Coach Zhuang.

749
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,599
Don't you know about this?

750
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,439
I do.

751
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:34,680
Of course I do.

752
00:32:37,439 --> 00:32:38,640
How... How did you know about it?

753
00:32:39,719 --> 00:32:40,760
Didn't she tell you?

754
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,479
We are roommates now.

755
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,920
Roommates?

756
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,599
What's wrong with you two?

757
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,199
You don't talk to each other?

758
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:51,959
Of course

759
00:32:52,239 --> 00:32:53,000
we do.

760
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:55,239
We are both busy with training.

761
00:32:58,319 --> 00:32:59,040
Never mind then.

762
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:00,479
Let's continue.

763
00:33:01,199 --> 00:33:01,959
Okay.

764
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,319
Shen Zhengyi,

765
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,719
you were saying that

766
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:10,479
you can't even win kids?

767
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:11,920
No way.

768
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,160
You are such a fast skater.

769
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,079
I didn't play well.

770
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,040
I was just not allowed to.

771
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:17,719
I'm telling you.

772
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,319
You won't know

773
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,040
when they would approach you

774
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,040
or when they would speed up.

775
00:33:20,439 --> 00:33:21,760
I was afraid that I would hurt them

776
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:22,599
so I had to hide.

777
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,439
Then they directly

778
00:33:23,479 --> 00:33:23,920
bumped into me,

779
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,040
so I fell.

780
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,040
It was not my fault.

781
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:27,040
It was so cruel to me that

782
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:27,959
I cannot train.

783
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,359
It was so embarrassing.

784
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,560
I bet.

785
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,239
It must be a shame.

786
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,239
I see. I see.

787
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,680
It must be that

788
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,680
you become stronger with strong people,

789
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,439
while you get weaker with weak people.

790
00:33:41,239 --> 00:33:42,400
You want to
get yourself punished, right?

791
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:43,839
Phone call, phone call.

792
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,760
(Shao Beisheng)

793
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,560
It's from Shao Beisheng.

794
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:49,359
Again.

795
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:51,319
Doesn't the Figure Skating Prince

796
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,839
need to train

797
00:33:53,319 --> 00:33:54,479
instead of calling me every day?

798
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,479
You should ask

799
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:56,280
about that yourself

800
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:57,239
to your Figure Skating Prince.

801
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,359
I will go wash my face.

802
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,880
Hello.

803
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,119
Can you have any spirit of contract?

804
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:07,959
You have to let me know

805
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,000
if anything happens.

806
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,600
Do you understand?

807
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,439
It's not a good thing anyway.

808
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,399
I didn't tell you

809
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,800
because I felt ashamed.

810
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,959
At least you should report to me.

811
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,360
Otherwise people would sense it.

812
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:19,800
Come on.

813
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,959
I'm so exhausted already every day.

814
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,280
Can't you let me pass on this?

815
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:25,280
Why are you so anxious

816
00:34:25,439 --> 00:34:26,280
over such a little thing?

817
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,959
No wonder the kids would laugh at you.

818
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,000
Then you go train them.

819
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:30,959
Let's see if you can

820
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,280
train them well.

821
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:43,550
(Lingbei University)

822
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:45,120
Hello.

823
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,719
Recruitment for Drama Club.
Please take a look.

824
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:49,760
Hello.

825
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,239
Leading actress is wanted
in the Drama Club.

826
00:34:51,439 --> 00:34:52,040
Please introduce someone

827
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,040
if you know someone who might be a fit.

828
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,000
Okay. Thank you.

829
00:34:55,439 --> 00:34:57,439
Hello. Leading actress is wanted
in the Drama Club.

830
00:34:57,719 --> 00:34:58,600
Wang Jun.

831
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:01,840
You are...

832
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:02,760
It's me.

833
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:03,840
Zhu Lele from Short Track Speed Skating.

834
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,000
We met last time

835
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,040
when you helped us
clean the training room.

836
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:07,159
Hello.

837
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,520
This is...

838
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,159
Leading actress is wanted
in the Drama Club.

839
00:35:12,919 --> 00:35:14,040
So you are from the Drama Club.

840
00:35:14,439 --> 00:35:15,360
No wonder

841
00:35:15,439 --> 00:35:16,320
you look like an artist.

842
00:35:16,959 --> 00:35:18,600
I've had a drama dream

843
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:19,199
since I was young.

844
00:35:19,439 --> 00:35:20,439
Do you think that I would fit?

845
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,360
Seems not?

846
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:24,679
No, it's not like that.

847
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,199
You are quite a fit.

848
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:29,080
Then where should I sign it up?

849
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,479
There's time and place on the poster.

850
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:32,000
You can just go there

851
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,040
on time.

852
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,280
I will dispatch some posters there.

853
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:36,719
There's detailed information on it.

854
00:35:37,439 --> 00:35:38,080
Please take a look.

855
00:35:38,919 --> 00:35:40,159
Can I help you?

856
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,280
That's OK.

857
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:46,959
How come everyone

858
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,879
looks so good in the Drama Club?

859
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:55,800
You are here.

860
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,040
Yeah.

861
00:36:06,399 --> 00:36:07,199
Brother Beisheng,

862
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,560
you haven't visited us for a while.

863
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:11,000
Yeah. I've been busy.

864
00:36:11,399 --> 00:36:12,199
We miss you a lot.

865
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:12,840
How's training lately?

866
00:36:12,919 --> 00:36:13,520
Did you make any progress?

867
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,919
- Yes.
- Of course I have.

868
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,320
Then show me later.

869
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,719
Alright. Come on.

870
00:36:18,879 --> 00:36:19,600
Brother Beisheng, look.

871
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,719
Sister Zhengyi is here.

872
00:36:21,399 --> 00:36:22,040
You are here.

873
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,000
Shen Zhengyi.

874
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,719
Why are you here?

875
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:31,959
To laugh at me?

876
00:36:32,879 --> 00:36:33,520
Brother Beisheng,

877
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,399
do you remember that

878
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,080
she is the one

879
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:36,800
who won you last time.

880
00:36:37,479 --> 00:36:38,040
I highly doubt that

881
00:36:38,439 --> 00:36:39,399
she cheated.

882
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:40,360
She doesn't know how to skate.

883
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:41,760
What are you talking about?

884
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:44,959
Everyone,

885
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,520
let me explain it to you.

886
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,800
This sister knows

887
00:36:47,919 --> 00:36:48,919
how to skate,

888
00:36:49,479 --> 00:36:50,399
but she's not used to

889
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,560
skating with you all.

890
00:36:52,479 --> 00:36:53,000
Actually, this sister

891
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,120
is a good friend of mine now.

892
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,600
So from today on,

893
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,080
please treat her well.

894
00:36:57,199 --> 00:36:58,199
Treat her the way

895
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:58,760
you treat me.

896
00:36:58,919 --> 00:36:59,520
Do you understand?

897
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:00,639
- Okay.
- Okay.

898
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:01,399
Good.

899
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,120
Brother Beisheng,

900
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:03,239
we will take good care of

901
00:37:03,439 --> 00:37:04,439
sister Zhengyi.

902
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,239
Good.

903
00:37:05,399 --> 00:37:06,040
You have the nerve to say so.

904
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,239
Who kept telling me

905
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,239
to go away the other day?

906
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:10,560
Sister Zhengyi, don't worry.

907
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:11,879
No one would ever bully you here.

908
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:12,800
Sister Zhengyi,

909
00:37:12,959 --> 00:37:13,479
we will not get in your way

910
00:37:13,719 --> 00:37:14,840
when you skate.

911
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,439
Yes.

912
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,199
We will let you pass.

913
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,560
Yes. Yes.

914
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:19,479
If you fall,

915
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:20,600
we will help you.

916
00:37:20,879 --> 00:37:22,280
When did I fall?

917
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:26,879
Are you doing it on purpose?

918
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:28,000
What do you mean by that?

919
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,479
Don't misunderstand me.

920
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,080
Okay?

921
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,080
I'm doing it for you.

922
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,439
Brother Beisheng,

923
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:33,280
is sister Zhengyi

924
00:37:33,399 --> 00:37:34,439
your girlfriend?

925
00:37:35,959 --> 00:37:37,280
- Of course.
- Of course not.

926
00:37:38,479 --> 00:37:39,120
Yes or no?

927
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:40,560
Yes or no?

928
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:41,760
- Yes.
- No.

929
00:37:41,879 --> 00:37:43,040
I have nothing to...

930
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:45,719
Start training.

931
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,639
Go training.

932
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:52,719
What are you doing?

933
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,919
Why did you joke around with kids?

934
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,040
Do you want to break the promise
by yourself?

935
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,199
It's not like we are in school now.

936
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,399
Are you that into your character?

937
00:37:59,879 --> 00:38:00,800
We need to
get into character thoroughly.

938
00:38:00,919 --> 00:38:02,159
How can you stop acting
just because they are kids?

939
00:38:10,879 --> 00:38:11,479
The qualification contest

940
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,439
is about to start soon.

941
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,239
I'm just a beginner.

942
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,040
What should I do?

943
00:38:14,439 --> 00:38:15,600
Shall I ask my brother to help you?

944
00:38:15,959 --> 00:38:17,239
Maybe you can make some progress

945
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,239
after he gives you some instructions.

946
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,159
No, no.

947
00:38:19,399 --> 00:38:20,560
He helped me a lot.

948
00:38:20,919 --> 00:38:21,879
I have to do it on my own this time.

949
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,199
Is there anything

950
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:26,719
that your brother likes

951
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,360
or any wish he has?

952
00:38:29,439 --> 00:38:30,239
Why?

953
00:38:31,479 --> 00:38:32,360
I want to pay him back.

954
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,120
He helped me get into

955
00:38:34,439 --> 00:38:35,959
the school team

956
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:37,879
and he gave me instructions

957
00:38:37,959 --> 00:38:38,959
on curve skills.

958
00:38:39,439 --> 00:38:39,959
Most importantly,

959
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,080
he is my life saver.

960
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:43,080
It almost sounds like

961
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:44,800
my brother is a god.

962
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:46,080
Exactly.

963
00:38:46,439 --> 00:38:46,879
Let me tell you.

964
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,800
He is the idol

965
00:38:47,919 --> 00:38:48,800
of our whole team.

966
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,280
Including you?

967
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,760
Of course.

968
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:54,360
What about Shao Beisheng?

969
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:55,959
Of course they are no match.

970
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,360
Shao Beisheng is

971
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,120
a narcissist.

972
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:58,879
He is arrogant,

973
00:38:59,120 --> 00:38:59,719
and...

974
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,840
Then why do you date him?

975
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,840
Maybe I like

976
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:07,719
to torture myself.

977
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:09,719
Lie.

978
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:11,159
Everything is a lie.

979
00:39:11,959 --> 00:39:13,239
I will

980
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,000
reveal the secret

981
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,439
and bring the truth under the sunlight.

982
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:22,600
How is it?

983
00:39:22,919 --> 00:39:24,360
Do I have the potential
to be an actress?

984
00:39:24,959 --> 00:39:27,320
Leading actress is wanted
in the Drama Club.

985
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:28,600
You are going to the Drama Club?

986
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,000
Since when did you

987
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:31,959
get interested in drama?

988
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:35,199
It's not drama that I'm interested in.

989
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:36,719
It's the four hot guys in the Drama Club

990
00:39:36,879 --> 00:39:38,320
that get me interested.

991
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:39,800
How are they? Good looking, right?

992
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,040
Especially Wang Jun in it.

993
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,399
Who?

994
00:39:44,879 --> 00:39:45,479
Wang Jun.

995
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,439
The gloomy prince
from Figure Skating Team.

996
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,159
As soon as I imagine being

997
00:39:50,399 --> 00:39:51,520
surrounded by these hot guys

998
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:52,280
soon,

999
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:53,919
I feel

1000
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,560
so happy.

1001
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,360
Alright, I'm done talking to you.

1002
00:39:57,879 --> 00:39:58,600
I should prepare

1003
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,120
myself now.

1004
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,399
It's over?

1005
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:31,800
How is it?

1006
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:32,760
Are you tired?

1007
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,239
What are you talking about?

1008
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,280
How can I be tired?

1009
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,000
It's good that you are not.

1010
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,679
Go somewhere with me.

1011
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,280
Where?

1012
00:40:43,879 --> 00:40:44,879
Why would I go with you?

1013
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,800
It's what you need to do

1014
00:40:46,959 --> 00:40:48,000
as a girlfriend.

1015
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:49,520
Hurry.

1016
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,159
Gotta go now.

1017
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,439
Wait. I don't want to go.

1018
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,800
Bro, bro.

1019
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,320
This is called curling.

1020
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,760
Have you ever seen it?

1021
00:41:10,479 --> 00:41:11,120
Yes.

1022
00:41:11,399 --> 00:41:12,320
But I don't understand the rules.

1023
00:41:12,399 --> 00:41:13,320
Why are you showing me this?

1024
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,719
Actually, curling has very simple rules.

1025
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,080
There are two teams

1026
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,719
and 16 stones in total.

1027
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:19,879
After they throw them,

1028
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,000
whoever gets it closer

1029
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,120
to the center of circle scores.

1030
00:41:25,439 --> 00:41:26,000
Have a look.

1031
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:29,199
Take this situation as an example.

1032
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,600
The one in the center

1033
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:35,600
is yellow and

1034
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:36,959
it's the closest to the center.

1035
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,479
Meanwhile,

1036
00:41:39,399 --> 00:41:40,600
three red stones

1037
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:41,560
take part of the outer lap

1038
00:41:41,639 --> 00:41:42,760
at more advantageous positions.

1039
00:41:43,879 --> 00:41:44,520
So

1040
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,879
the yellow stone that their team

1041
00:41:47,439 --> 00:41:48,399
is going to throw

1042
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:49,520
is very important.

1043
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,439
You are like

1044
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,520
this yellow stone.

1045
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:54,600
If you choose to

1046
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,159
head straight

1047
00:41:56,239 --> 00:41:57,280
towards the center,

1048
00:41:57,399 --> 00:41:58,120
you might hit the red ones

1049
00:41:58,239 --> 00:41:59,879
of the opponent.

1050
00:42:00,919 --> 00:42:01,760
Although you might kick

1051
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,239
the red stones out of the lap,

1052
00:42:03,399 --> 00:42:04,080
you can also

1053
00:42:04,679 --> 00:42:05,959
get rebounded to the outer lap

1054
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,719
because of counter force.

1055
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,639
However, if you think of

1056
00:42:10,399 --> 00:42:11,879
a smarter way

1057
00:42:12,919 --> 00:42:15,040
by entering and circling around it,

1058
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,040
you can better protect

1059
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,120
your own stones

1060
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:17,879
and might have

1061
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
unexpected results.

1062
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:20,520
Slow down.

1063
00:42:22,919 --> 00:42:24,080
Wait. Don't...

1064
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:30,040
Do you understand?

1065
00:42:30,439 --> 00:42:31,919
(Hit. Hide.)

1066
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,439
(Plan the routes.)

1067
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,520
Hold on.

1068
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:38,399
I get it.

1069
00:42:38,919 --> 00:42:40,040
So you are saying that

1070
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,360
the most important thing

1071
00:42:41,439 --> 00:42:42,159
for me to do right now

1072
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:43,520
is not increasing speed

1073
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,719
but learning to watch.

1074
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,679
I need to watch carefully

1075
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,800
the situation on the ground

1076
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,199
so that I can know

1077
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,320
when to speed up,

1078
00:42:50,439 --> 00:42:51,360
when to avoid,

1079
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,439
and when to cut in.

1080
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:53,320
In that way, I will not

1081
00:42:53,439 --> 00:42:54,520
be the dangerous element

1082
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,439
that people say.

1083
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,280
Right?

1084
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,320
It is right,

1085
00:43:00,439 --> 00:43:01,479
but can you get your hands

1086
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,320
away from mine?

1087
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,520
We have a contract.

1088
00:43:04,919 --> 00:43:05,959
I forgot about it.

1089
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,000
Don't think too much.

1090
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:12,959
I will try it by myself.

1091
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:16,360
Like this.

1092
00:43:19,959 --> 00:43:20,760
Kick it out like this.

1093
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,000
What are you laughing at?

1094
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,080
You are like an idiot.
