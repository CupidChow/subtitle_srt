00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,640
Hold on.

173
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,640
What did you say?

174
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,160
You look down upon amateurs?

175
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,519
I...

176
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,160
Competition, right?

177
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:17,760
Then let's do it.

178
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,600
What? Are you afraid?

179
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,359
Who's afraid?

180
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:26,399
Let's compete.

181
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:29,519
Alright, alright.

182
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:34,839
Enough, enough.

183
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,200
Stop.

184
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:39,640
Say it, what are your rules?

185
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,839
There are four cups over there.

186
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,839
Two for each of you.

187
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,519
The one who turns back first

188
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,519
and takes all the cups back

189
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:48,640
will be the winner.

190
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:49,519
Understand?

191
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:50,839
Yes.

192
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,440
Alright.

193
00:07:56,119 --> 00:07:57,200
I will play with you kids.

194
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,559
Ready!

195
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:11,679
Fighting!

196
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:25,279
King of skating rink?

197
00:08:26,119 --> 00:08:27,119
How is it?

198
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,760
(Figure Skate shoes?)

199
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:30,519
Still want to compete with me?

200
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,440
(I still have a chance to win)

201
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,880
(when competing with a figure skater.)

202
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,239
So wild?

203
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,880
Let's go!

204
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,960
Don't go.

205
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,440
I let her win.

206
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,159
Well, we are men.

207
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,520
We should let girls win, right?

208
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,919
The one from a professional team,

209
00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:34,440
are you really from Wind Chaser?

210
00:09:34,599 --> 00:09:35,440
Don't make sarcastic remarks there.

211
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:36,440
Okay?

212
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:37,799
I'm a figure skater.

213
00:09:38,239 --> 00:09:38,599
If you are so great,

214
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,919
you should compete with
our short track skaters.

215
00:09:40,359 --> 00:09:41,239
Say goodbye to this brother.

216
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:44,679
Goodbye, brother.

217
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:45,599
Wait for me.

218
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:46,159
I'll take you to

219
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,679
practice somewhere else, okay?

220
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,719
Dad, Mom?

221
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,479
Anybody home?

222
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:20,400
Happy birthday to you!

223
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:24,520
Happy birthday to you!

224
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,520
Happy birthday to you!

225
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:31,080
Happy birthday

226
00:10:31,599 --> 00:10:34,840
to our Yiyi!

227
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,280
Make a wish!

228
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,000
Alright.

229
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,000
Quick, go wash your hands
and have a piece of cake.

230
00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:52,000
Dinner time.

231
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,119
Did you go skating again today?

232
00:10:58,359 --> 00:10:59,679
Hurry up and cut the cake.

233
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,640
What did you wish for?

234
00:11:07,119 --> 00:11:09,559
Wishes won't work when you say them.

235
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,119
Dad, Mom,

236
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:14,400
I want to be in a professional team

237
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:15,919
to learn short track speed skating.

238
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:17,280
No!

239
00:11:17,479 --> 00:11:18,679
Wishes won't work when you say them,

240
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:19,559
and you still said it?

241
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,280
Today is a happy day.

242
00:11:24,719 --> 00:11:25,599
Don't mention it.

243
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:26,919
No, Mom.

244
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,359
I can say yes to anything else.

245
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:29,280
For this one,

246
00:11:29,359 --> 00:11:30,520
can't you just say yes?

247
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,320
No matter how old you are,

248
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,719
and whether you're an adult or not,

249
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,159
my answer is still no.

250
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,159
Why?

251
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,520
Alright, alright.

252
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:37,760
Today is Yiyi's

253
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,840
18th birthday.

254
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,280
It's absolutely a day

255
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,280
for celebration and joy.

256
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:42,520
You two,

257
00:11:42,599 --> 00:11:43,840
please don't argue any more.

258
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,719
Let's cut the cake first.

259
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,320
Okay?

260
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,400
This cake was made

261
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,280
by your mother

262
00:11:48,719 --> 00:11:50,200
in the bakery today.

263
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,400
Have a taste of it.

264
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,840
Come on, cut the cake.

265
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:25,599
Fei, Mei, Shuai, and Sha.

266
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,479
How about this pair of shoes?

267
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,960
Do you want me to wear them

268
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:32,159
and show you?

269
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:32,799
Then I'll

270
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,799
meet your requirement.

271
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:49,799
Perfect.

272
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:59,580
(Application form to Wind Chaser
Ice Sports Team of Lingbei University)

273
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,599
(I applied for Lingbei University)

274
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,840
(just for getting into)

275
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,119
(Wind Chaser Short Track Team.)

276

(Shen Zhengyi,)

277
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:07,799
(this is your last chance to)

278
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:08,679
(get into a professional team.)

279
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:10,000
(You have to fight for it.)

280
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:11,600
(Lingbei University)

281
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,240
There are also characteristics such as
self-representation.

282
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,320
Together with expressionism,

283
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:16,840
anti-reification aesthetics...

284
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,719
Wait.

285
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,719
What's the hurry?

286
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,719
There are four more pages

287
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,599
I have to present.

288
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,320
Come back to the class.

289
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:25,239
Let's go.

290
00:13:25,719 --> 00:13:26,840
It's too late.

291
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,000
No, it is not late.

292
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:30,960
The application for new members

293
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,960
won't end until 11:30.

294
00:13:33,359 --> 00:13:34,239
Quick, quick.

295
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,080
There are four characteristics:

296
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,960
one, Perceptual Characteristics,

297
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:41,320
two, Free Characteristics...

298
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:42,110
(Application Department)
Shao Beisheng, hello.

299
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:43,239
Here is my application form.

300
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,039
Thank you.

301
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,159
Here, give it to him.

302
00:13:45,239 --> 00:13:45,760
You can give it to me.

303
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:48,359
The time of the competition

304
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,280
is 9 o'clock tomorrow morning.

305
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,159
It will be held in this venue.

306
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:51,440
Just go in and follow the signs.

307
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:51,919
And you will find it.

308
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,039
Okay, okay, thank you.

309
00:13:53,359 --> 00:13:54,119
Let's go.

310
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:56,880
I agreed to come and seek for fun,

311
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,679
but why do I have to do all the work?

312
00:13:59,159 --> 00:13:59,799
What time is it?

313
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:00,919
It's noon.

314
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,320
It's almost the time. Let's go.

315
00:14:04,599 --> 00:14:05,919
I will buy you lunch, okay?

316
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:06,960
That's more like it.

317
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:08,200
I won't eat in the canteen.

318
00:14:08,359 --> 00:14:09,359
Wait.

319
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,400
I want to apply.

320
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,239
It's you.

321
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,880
You really want to join
the professional team?

322
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:24,479
Can't I?

323
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,719
Alright.

324
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,000
Wind Chaser is looking for a cleaner.

325
00:14:29,719 --> 00:14:30,640
I think you should try it.

326
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,479
You are lack of skills
and could be an ace.

327
00:14:32,599 --> 00:14:33,880
Why would I have to be a cleaner?

328
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,080
Lack of skills?

329
00:14:36,719 --> 00:14:37,440
Shen Zhengyi,

330
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,359
how can you run so fast?

331
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:40,840
I...

332
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,679
Shao Beisheng!

333
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:46,799
Oh my goodness!

334
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:48,440
It's the first time
I've seen a living one,

335
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,359
no, no, no, himself.

336
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,200
You're here to apply too?

337
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:56,359
I'm not here to apply.

338
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:57,440
I...

339
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,799
I've passed the special recruitment

340
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:00,080
and made into the
short track speed skating team.

341
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:02,080
Well, I've seen your race.

342
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,919
Such a shame!

343
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,039
Shame?

344
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:07,039
Don't you know him?

345
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,200
Shao Beisheng.

346
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,719
What?

347
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,559
He

348
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:13,080
is the Skating Prince

349
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,719
with both style and abilities.

350
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:14,320
Enough.

351
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,559
He is the top player of

352
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,200
Wind Chaser Figure Skating team.

353
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:23,840
What kind of top player is he?

354
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,320
Just a loser to me.

355
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,080
Loser?

356
00:15:28,479 --> 00:15:29,479
What loser?

357
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,200
No, you... I...

358
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,320
He helped others and competed with me

359
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,559
over a rink, but he lost.

360
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:37,919
So he lost.

361
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:39,440
I...

362
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,080
She's a short track skater
and I'm a figure skater.

363
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,919
There is no comparability.

364
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,400
There's indeed no comparability.

365
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,320
I'm tired of talking to you.

366
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:52,960
Hurry up. I want to apply.

367
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:55,400
You want to apply?

368
00:15:55,719 --> 00:15:56,440
OK.

369
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,520
‍ Two, one.

370
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,479
It ends now.

371
00:16:01,119 --> 00:16:01,960
We won't accept any application now.

372
00:16:02,479 --> 00:16:03,239
You did it on purpose.

373
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:03,960
When I arrived here just now,

374
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,239
it was still within the deadline.

375
00:16:05,479 --> 00:16:06,479
Deadline for application

376
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:07,239
is 11:30.

377
00:16:07,359 --> 00:16:08,880
Now, it's 11:31.

378
00:16:09,359 --> 00:16:10,239
Please leave.

379
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,479
You did it just for revenge.

380
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,200
I'll tell you the truth.

381
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,719
Your skating skills

382
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,080
cannot even pass.

383
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:16,840
Even if

384
00:16:17,119 --> 00:16:18,479
I submit the application for you,

385
00:16:18,719 --> 00:16:19,760
you're still going to be filtered out.

386
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:20,760
I haven't even tried yet.

387
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,640
What makes you say that?

388
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:23,159
What if I make it?

389
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:25,239
Then it will be an accident.

390
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:31,919
Make a bet, won't you?

391
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:33,679
Bet on what?

392
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,080
If I don't make it,

393
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:38,159
I'll promise you one thing.

394
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,559
Yes, yes, yes.

395
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:41,679
Let me be a witness.

396
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,880
While if I make it,

397
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:45,320
you have to promise me one thing.

398
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,280
Why would I bet?

399
00:16:48,719 --> 00:16:49,559
You're afraid?

400
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,679
Right.

401
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,440
You have more experience

402
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:53,520
about losing to me.

403
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:55,440
I'll bet.

404
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:57,559
Deal!

405
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,280
At 9:00 Tomorrow morning,

406
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,880
(Short Track Speed Skating Recruiting Contest)
I'll see you failed.

407
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,830
(Short Track Speed Skating
Recruiting Contest)

408
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,160
How is it?

409
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:15,160
(Wind Chaser is the pride)

410
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,920
(of Lingbei University,)

411
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,160
(and the No. 1
ice sports team nationwide.)

412
00:17:18,719 --> 00:17:19,520
(Shen Zhengyi,)

413
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,040
(if you can make it to Wind Chaser,)

414
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,040
(you can train)

415
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,359
(in this professional
skating rink every day.)

416
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,760
They are all so fast.

417
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,760
Who are you two?

418
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,400
She's here for the recruiting session.

419
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,520
Her name is Shen Zhengyi.

420
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,160
You'll be in the next group.

421
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:39,760
Be quick.

422
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,640
Be quick. Don't just stand there.

423
00:17:49,479 --> 00:17:50,040
Don't be nervous.

424
00:17:50,239 --> 00:17:51,160
Don't get nervous.

425
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,280
Why do I feel

426
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:54,280
that you're more nervous than me?

427
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,160
You don't have to do it.

428
00:17:55,479 --> 00:17:56,400
How can I not be nervous?

429
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,640
You're about to be on the track.

430
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,520
I'm telling you,

431
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,400
when you are up there,

432
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,400
just take it easy.

433
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,479
Trusting yourself is
the most important thing.

434
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,359
I see.

435
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,040
Why are there wings

436
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,040
on your shoes?

437
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,160
You drew them yourself?

438
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:08,880
Aren't they cute?

439
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:09,760
If you like them,

440
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,920
I'll draw them for you some day.

441
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:11,880
Okay.

442
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,239
Is that Coach Xiao?

443
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:20,239
Coach Xiao.

444
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,640
(Xiao Han)
(Coach of Wind Chaser Short Track Team)

445
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,160
So handsome!

446
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,280
Everyone, before getting on the ice,

447
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:31,040
remember to check

448
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:31,839
your equipment again.

449
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,560
Be safe.

450
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:50,199
Fasten it.
Otherwise, it's not safe.

451
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,239
Thank you, coach.

452
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,520
Coach Xiao Han is so gentle.

453
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:58,119
Yeah, he's so handsome.

454
00:18:58,439 --> 00:18:59,439
Director.

455
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:00,199
Coach Zheng, you're here too.

456
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:01,839
Of course I have to watch it.

457
00:19:02,199 --> 00:19:02,959
This is about

458
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,479
the future of our Wind Chaser.

459
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:07,520
Here, Coach Zheng, please.

460
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:16,760
That one

461
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,079
is Shen Zhengyi, right?

462
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,680
Go to the start.

463
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Ready.

464
00:19:59,319 --> 00:19:59,959
So fast.

465
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,040
The speed is good,

466
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:02,079
but not the skills.

467
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,439
Shen Zhengyi

468
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,319
is forceful when pushing off the ice.

469
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,439
The speed is not bad.

470
00:20:05,719 --> 00:20:06,439
But she doesn't have adequate control

471
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,680
and will be thrown off
in the next curve.

472
00:20:07,959 --> 00:20:11,239
Fighting! Fighting! Fighting!

473
00:20:12,719 --> 00:20:17,160
Fighting! Fighting! Fighting!

474
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,800
I cannot believe it.

475
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,319
Watch her moves on curves.

476
00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:24,239
Fifty percent of the tracks are curves

477
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:25,560
in short track speed skating.

478
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:27,439
One cannot master the curve skills

479
00:20:27,439 --> 00:20:29,000
without professional training.

480
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,760
Her speed on
straight track is fast,

481
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,439
so she needs superb curve skills more

482
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,439
to control the speed.

483
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,680
With current curve skills,

484
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:36,079
she can't finish the race.

485
00:20:38,439 --> 00:20:40,079
This is a terrible turn.

486
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:40,800
I told you.

487
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,400
Last lap.

488
00:20:46,439 --> 00:20:50,239
Fighting! Fighting! Fighting!

489
00:20:54,719 --> 00:20:57,800
Fighting! Fighting! Fighting!

490
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,400
Shen Zhengyi.

491
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,119
This amateur player

492
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,160
has bad curve skills.

493
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,040
What a pity, she has such great power.

494
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,800
We won like this?

495
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:13,199
Without suspense.

496
00:21:13,719 --> 00:21:14,560
Let's go.

497
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:34,439
(Shen Zhengyi, don't give up.)

498
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:35,719
(Get to the finish line.)

499
00:21:35,719 --> 00:21:42,719
Fighting! Fighting! Fighting!

500
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:45,000
Shen Zhengyi, just stop.

501
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:46,119
It's all over.

502
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:51,920
Fighting! Fighting! Fighting!

503
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,920
Well, I said I wanted to make it

504
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,920
to join Wind Chaser.

505
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,000
But now,

506
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,479
I don't even have a record.

507
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,280
There must be no hope.

508
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:21,239
Shen Zhengyi.

509
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,280
Shao Beisheng?

510
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,480
(Director Office)

511
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,280
Director,

512
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:26,400
her name is Shen Zhengyi.

513
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,719
I want to recruit her in the team.

514
00:22:30,719 --> 00:22:31,319
This is the girl

515
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,760
who fell in the race just now?

516
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,359
So what makes her so different?

517
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,560
No for now.

518
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,880
But there will be in the future.

519
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:40,239
She's just a natural

520
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:41,280
short track speed skater.

521
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,479
She is indeed lacking some

522
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,400
technical advantages now.

523
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,319
But you saw it.

524
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:46,319
She has great power,

525
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,350
(Application Form of Shen Zhengyi)
and she is talented.

526
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,640
As for the technical problems,

527
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:49,920
I'm sure I can help her get better.

528
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,839
Coach Xiao,

529
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:56,400
our Wind Chaser

530
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,560
is not holding a training course.

531
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,400
The top priority is

532
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,520
to improve

533
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,160
overall team performance.

534
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,520
At this moment,

535
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,560
you bring an amateur to the team.

536
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,640
I can't see how it

537
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,800
will help everyone.

538
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,239
Director, trust me.

539
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,400
She must be the key to change

540
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,640
Wind Chaser in the future.

541
00:23:13,239 --> 00:23:14,119
I trust you.

542
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:16,119
I've always trusted you.

543
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,079
But our Wind Chaser

544
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,119
has no time for trial and error.

545
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,839
We've wasted too much time.

546
00:23:23,719 --> 00:23:24,319
You mean that

547
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:25,839
I have been wasting our time?

548
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,839
I didn't mean that.

549
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,319
We all know your contribution

550
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:33,560
to Wind Chaser.

551
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,560
What we lack is

552
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,119
a mature athlete

553
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,800
who can go for the gold medal.

554
00:23:41,239 --> 00:23:42,560
She's just an amateur.

555
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,319
Okay, take a step back.

556
00:23:45,719 --> 00:23:46,839
If she gets in,

557
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,079
you tell me

558
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:49,599
when she'll make achievements.

559
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,119
Wind Chaser cannot wait for that.

560
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,640
Both you and I cannot wait for that.

561
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,760
If we still cannot

562
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:54,839
have good performance,

563
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,239
Wind Chaser Short Track Team

564
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,719
might be gone forever.

565
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,839
But I think she's worth the wait.

566
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,239
- You...
- What?

567
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,439
Are you unconvinced?

568
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,640
I'm telling you.

569
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,640
You are the one who wanted to bet.

570
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,439
You are also the one who lost.

571
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:11,880
You have to admit it, okay?

572
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:12,920
I've told you that

573
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,079
your curve skills are bad.

574
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,439
Don't even think about

575
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,599
getting into Wind Chaser.

576
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,040
My Black Legend.

577
00:24:35,959 --> 00:24:37,839
Your mobile phone.

578
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,000
Just wait.

579
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,479
Coach, take care.

580
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,599
Come back and see us more often.

581
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:02,800
I will.

582
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,719
Coach Xiao.

583
00:25:05,439 --> 00:25:06,239
Coach Zheng,

584
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:07,199
I didn't have a chance to ask you.

585
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:07,959
How do you feel now?

586
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,439
I am fine.

587
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,880
The doctor told me to take a good rest.

588
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,319
I cannot help

589
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:13,640
with Wind Chaser.

590
00:25:14,719 --> 00:25:15,719
I just ran into them,

591
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,560
and wanted to tell them something.

592
00:25:18,959 --> 00:25:19,839
Coach, rest assured.

593
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:20,680
We will definitely

594
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:21,680
listen to the coach

595
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:22,640
and train hard.

596
00:25:23,479 --> 00:25:24,319
Xiao Han,

597
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:25,959
I'm officially retired.

598
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,880
I'll leave Wind Chaser to you.

599
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,839
You have to shoulder

600
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,160
the responsibility as a chief coach.

601
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,599
Coach Zheng, rest assured.

602
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,319
I'll do my best.

603
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,520
You're a little fat, man.

604
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:46,760
Are you comfortable?

605
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,520
You are back.

606
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,479
What is wrong with you?

607
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,439
My... my shoes.

608
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:22,520
Who did this?

609
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:24,839
I haven't worn them yet.

610
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,479
Shen Zhengyi.

611
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:30,839
Alright, alright.

612
00:26:31,439 --> 00:26:32,680
I think your performance

613
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,760
was pretty good today.

614
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:35,239
There was just a little accident

615
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:36,359
on the curves.

616
00:26:36,439 --> 00:26:38,079
I'm sure you will get into
Wind Chaser later.

617
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:38,760
No.

618
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:39,719
The fact is

619
00:26:40,439 --> 00:26:41,479
I cannot get into Wind Chaser,

620
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,199
and got humiliated.

621
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:46,719
It was not really a humiliation.

622
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:48,079
What he did

623
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:49,000
is certainly not for

624
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,079
humiliating you.

625
00:26:50,439 --> 00:26:50,920
Why do you

626
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,119
speak for Shao Beisheng?

627
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,239
No, no, no, I'm wrong.

628
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:54,719
Never again.

629
00:27:03,719 --> 00:27:04,920
Did you see my mobile phone?

630
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,520
It's not here.

631
00:27:07,239 --> 00:27:07,959
Not there?

632
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,560
Call me.

633
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:15,000
Did you mute it?

634
00:27:15,199 --> 00:27:16,640
No. The phone rings.

635
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
It rings.

636
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,239
Listen.

637
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:28,959
Hello.

638
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,800
I lost it?

639
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,400
Someone picked up.

640
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,719
It is an uncle.

641
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,640
No. You deal with it.
You're better than me.

642
00:27:35,719 --> 00:27:36,239
Hurry, hurry.

643
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:36,760
What do I say?

644
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,800
Hey, hello.

645
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,599
Well, I lost my phone.

646
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,599
Did you pick it up for me?

647
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,000
Obviously.

648
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,359
Well...

649
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,680
Can you give it back to me?

650
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:54,640
I am...

651
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,839
I am just a college student.

652
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,839
And I don't

653
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,920
have much money.

654
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,839
I've been saving money for years

655
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:00,319
for a phone.

656
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:01,959
I need it very much.

657
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,439
Okay.

658
00:28:05,239 --> 00:28:06,079
Why do I feel the voice sounds

659
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,319
familiar?

660
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,439
No way.

661
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,880
Sounds like he's 40.

662
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:11,959
Do you know there's a
place on campus called

663
00:28:12,439 --> 00:28:13,479
botanical garden?

664
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:15,439
Okay, I'll be right there.

665
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,079
Just a moment, please.

666
00:28:16,199 --> 00:28:16,920
Thank you. I'll be right there.

667
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,560
Go, go, go, let's go.

668
00:28:18,719 --> 00:28:19,239
Let's pack things up.

669
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:29,400
No one's here.

670
00:28:31,239 --> 00:28:32,680
We agreed to meet
in botanical garden, right?

671
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:33,560
Well,

672
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,079
make a call.

673
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:39,740
(Lele)

674
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:49,000
Hello.

675
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:50,400
Hello, we are here.

676
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:51,719
Where are you?

677
00:28:52,479 --> 00:28:54,359
Well... I'm sorry.

678
00:28:54,479 --> 00:28:55,199
Here is the thing.

679
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,400
I have something to do, so I left.

680
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,479
What about my phone?

681
00:29:00,479 --> 00:29:01,520
Your phone?

682
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,959
I placed it

683
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:06,119
on the fertilizer shelf.

684
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,839
Well... This is the case.

685
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:10,560
I have goods to pick up.

686
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:11,880
And now we have to

687
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,880
pick up the goods.

688
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,160
So look for it yourselves.

689
00:29:14,239 --> 00:29:15,000
Okay?

690
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,400
Bye.

691
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,599
No.

692
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:19,280
No, what about my phone?

693
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,760
Then, shall we look for it?

694
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,839
Of course.

695
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,560
Well, just leave me alone.

696
00:29:26,959 --> 00:29:27,359
You hold the bag for me

697
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,479
and wait.

698
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,640
I can do it alone.

699
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:30,680
Rest assured.

700
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,560
How is that possible?

701
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,839
We are good friends.

702
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,280
How can I let you do it by yourself?

703
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,160
That's OK.

704
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,479
I know it all.

705
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,760
Where is it?

706
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,000
We are being fooled.

707
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,839
What?

708
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:55,560
If my phone is here,

709
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,640
how could he just

710
00:29:57,719 --> 00:29:58,280
call us?

711
00:29:59,199 --> 00:30:00,239
Right.

712
00:30:07,479 --> 00:30:08,359
Awesome.

713
00:30:18,239 --> 00:30:18,920
Hello.

714
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,040
Are you crazy?

715
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:22,239
Are you crazy?

716
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,319
Front entrance of the library,

717
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,640
and after half an hour,

718
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,479
I won't wait for you.

719
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:39,000
Shao Beisheng.

720
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:42,800
Give it back to me.

721
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,040
Give it back.

722
00:30:44,439 --> 00:30:45,599
Why did you take my phone?

723
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,239
What did you say?

724
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,199
You left it in front of the stadium.

725
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:49,920
I took it back for you.

726
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:50,880
How can you say bad words to me now?

727
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:51,599
Right.

728
00:30:51,719 --> 00:30:52,239
But,

729
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,760
we just picked up some goods,

730
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,439
so

731
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,439
we made you circle around a little bit.

732
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,359
I'm sorry.

733
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,079
I think both of you

734
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:57,800
did it on purpose.

735
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,640
Why are you so rude?

736
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,199
Go away.

737
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:03,680
I think

738
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,280
we must have

739
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,239
made a mistake.

740
00:31:05,719 --> 00:31:06,199
Think about it.

741
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,719
You weren't even thinking
straight back there.

742
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,680
She could not wait,

743
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,439
and got into the fertilizer
to find it right away.

744
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,479
If one is in a hurry,

745
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:15,560
such stupid and ditzy

746
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:16,520
things happen.

747
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,599
Right?

748
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,079
Yes, yes.

749
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:20,479
You are so right.

750
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,520
You come over here.

751
00:31:21,719 --> 00:31:22,079
What's happening?

752
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:23,000
I mean

753
00:31:23,199 --> 00:31:23,880
if there is a misunderstanding,

754
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:25,160
we can just resolve it.

755
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:25,640
Resolve it.

756
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:26,640
Don't talk anymore.

757
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:27,800
You!

758
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,680
Why did you lie to me?

759
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,400
I just stepped on your shoes.

760
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,719
You made me circle around this much.

761
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:32,760
You have the nerve to say so.

762
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,280
You forgot things.

763
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:35,160
I picked it up for you and got blamed.

764
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:35,520
Let's go.

765
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,040
Don't talk to

766
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:37,959
the person who is unreasonable.

767
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,199
Let's go.

768
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:39,959
Goodbye, Shao Beisheng.

769
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:40,640
Just go.

770
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,239
Goodbye.

771
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:42,400
Just leave.

772
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,760
Shen Zhengyi

773
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:50,119
is really talkative.

774
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:53,239
You observed her

775
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:54,560
in detail.

776
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,680
I didn't.

777
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,119
Didn't you?

778
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,520
No.

779
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:05,959
Hello, who's it?

780
00:32:06,439 --> 00:32:07,040
Hello.

781
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,040
I am the coach of
Wind Chaser Short Track Team,

782
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:09,959
Xiao Han.

783
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:16,160
Shen Zhengyi.

784
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:19,079
Hi, Coach Xiao.

785
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,040
I saw you at the
recruiting contest that day.

786
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,160
I asked the team specifically

787
00:32:23,239 --> 00:32:23,920
for your application form,

788
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,079
and contacted you.

789
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,920
I read your resume, and it says

790
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:29,959
you've never had

791
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:31,160
any professional training before.

792
00:32:31,239 --> 00:32:32,040
Is that true?

793
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:34,000
When I was little,

794
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,079
I skated on a wild lake in my hometown.

795
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:37,680
After I moved here,

796
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,839
I could skate on a regular skating rink.

797
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:42,560
Since you've been skating informally,

798
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:44,359
why do you want to be in Wind Chaser?

799
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:45,880
For credits?

800
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,239
No.

801
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,959
I like skating.

802
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:51,680
I like the feeling of

803
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:53,119
flying at high speed on ice.

804
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:54,599
It's like I could

805
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,199
fly with the wind.

806
00:32:57,119 --> 00:32:58,920
Shen Zhengyi, answer me.

807
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,920
Do you want to be in Wind Chaser?

808
00:33:01,239 --> 00:33:02,560
Yes, even in my dream.

809
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:03,920
Then from tomorrow on,

810
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,400
you come to the
Wind Chaser for training.

811
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:07,079
Really?

812
00:33:09,479 --> 00:33:10,680
Thank you, Coach Xiao.

813
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:29,800
Zhu Lele, get up.

814
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,439
How is it?

815
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:16,919
You can train here

816
00:34:16,919 --> 00:34:17,919
every day after classes.

817
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,719
So this is a professional

818
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,840
off-ice training room.

819
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,040
This off-ice training room

820
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,080
is much better than that

821
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,840
back in my sports school.

822
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,600
Hi.

823
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:40,760
Is this the one who

824
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:41,719
fell in the recruiting contest?

825
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:42,679
Yes.

826
00:34:43,439 --> 00:34:44,639
Why is she here in Wind Chaser?

827
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,080
I don't know.

828
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,639
Assemble, senior members.

829
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,280
Hello, Coach Xiao. Coach Xiao.

830
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,679
- Hello, Coach Xiao.
- Hello, Coach Xiao.

831
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:10,879
So today, I'm going to

832
00:35:10,959 --> 00:35:12,280
introduce you the new members.

833
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,280
Step into the queue
when you hear your name.

834
00:35:15,399 --> 00:35:16,159
Shen Zhengyi.

835
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,360
Here.

836
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,600
Zhu Lele.

837
00:35:23,919 --> 00:35:24,719
Here.

838
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:27,879
Fang Nan.

839
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:28,800
Here.

840
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:29,840
Wu Fei.

841
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:30,760
Here.

842
00:35:31,479 --> 00:35:32,280
Dong Jiaying.

843
00:35:32,439 --> 00:35:33,320
Here.

844
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:34,919
Xu Chenxin.

845
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:35,959
Here.

846
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:40,919
That's all the new members.

847
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,399
Hope the senior members

848
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,399
can take care of the new members.

849
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,360
Everyone helps each other.

850
00:35:44,879 --> 00:35:45,919
Now, let's warm up.

851
00:35:46,879 --> 00:35:47,679
Coach Xiao.

852
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,760
Wait.

853
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,399
Director.

854
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,000
Let me introduce someone to you.

855
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,600
(Zhuang Yue, ace coach of Short Track Team)
This is the new chief coach of Wind Chaser

856
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:00,879
Short Track Speed Skating Team,

857
00:36:01,399 --> 00:36:02,199
Zhuang Yue.

858
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,840
New chief coach?

859
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:07,840
Coach Zhuang?

860
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,120
Why would there be a new coach?

861
00:36:13,479 --> 00:36:14,520
Zhuang Yue, Coach Zhuang.

862
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,439
I'm sure you don't need
any more introduction.

863
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,320
She is experienced.

864
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,000
And she has trained the best

865
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,520
‍short track speed skaters.

866
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:24,600
I believe that under her leadership,

867
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:26,719
our Wind Chaser Short Track
Speed Skating Team

868
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:27,919
will definitely have

869
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,879
more impressive performance.

870
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,800
Please welcome her.

871
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,040
Coach Zhuang,

872
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:40,520
I'll hand it over to you.

873
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:44,719
Coach Xiao,

874
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:45,959
come with me.

875
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:52,199
Everyone, I'm Zhuang Yue.

876
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,399
From now on,

877
00:36:53,919 --> 00:36:55,639
I'm the chief coach of
Wind Chaser Team.

878
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,600
You won't like

879
00:36:57,719 --> 00:36:58,879
the way I train you.

880
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:00,679
But I am not here to

881
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,199
make you happy, anyway.

882
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:04,879
I'm here for one reason only.

883
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:07,000
That is to improve your performance.

884
00:37:07,399 --> 00:37:08,159
So,

885
00:37:08,879 --> 00:37:10,199
you don't have to waste your time

886
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:11,239
to question me.

887
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,120
Just practice it hard.

888
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,639
The training plan

889
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:16,199
would be adjusted.

890
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,159
The amount of training will increase
every two weeks.

891
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,560
We're going to add
from five sets to eight sets of

892
00:37:20,879 --> 00:37:22,399
the previous endurance and
physical training.

893
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,679
Do you understand?

894
00:37:24,919 --> 00:37:26,520
Add to eight sets?

895
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,040
Are you clear?

896
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:32,639
Yes.

897
00:37:33,439 --> 00:37:35,719
Okay, let's warm up.

898
00:37:37,919 --> 00:37:38,840
Shen Zhengyi,

899
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:41,120
come.

900
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:50,800
Hello, Coach Zhuang.

901
00:37:51,719 --> 00:37:53,320
I saw the video of the
recruiting contest,

902
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:55,000
and your curve skills can't pass.

903
00:37:55,879 --> 00:37:57,239
You are not qualified
to be a new member.

904
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,719
That was an accident.

905
00:37:59,479 --> 00:38:00,239
I know I have

906
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,120
many shortcomings now.

907
00:38:01,399 --> 00:38:02,080
But please rest assured.

908
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:03,360
I'll take it as fast as I can

909
00:38:03,439 --> 00:38:04,639
to improve my curve skills.

910
00:38:05,879 --> 00:38:06,919
Wind Chaser is a professional team,

911
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:08,159
not a training class.

912
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,639
Members who get into Wind Chaser

913
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,280
should master all the basic skills

914
00:38:11,399 --> 00:38:13,040
of short track speed skating.

915
00:38:13,479 --> 00:38:14,919
Obviously, you cannot do so.

916
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,439
If I let you get into the team,

917
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:17,320
it equals to

918
00:38:17,439 --> 00:38:18,360
putting a time bomb

919
00:38:18,439 --> 00:38:19,320
on the ice.

920
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,679
Am I clear?

921
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,679
Well, Coach Zhuang.

922
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,000
I think you should still...

923
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,159
What are you three doing?

924
00:38:27,879 --> 00:38:29,239
Penalty of ten sets of frog jumps.

925
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,760
Come on.

926
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,479
Let me discuss about

927
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,679
Shen Zhengyi with you.

928
00:38:33,959 --> 00:38:34,360
I think

929
00:38:34,439 --> 00:38:36,320
she is not suitable for Wind Chaser.

930
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:38,000
But she'll be a good athlete.

931
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,239
If Shen Zhengyi is persistent

932
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:40,919
like you said,

933
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:41,760
I believe she can

934
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:42,560
find her way

935
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:44,399
into a professional team.

936
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,280
Even not in Wind Chaser,

937
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,520
she will shine anywhere.

938
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:50,479
About Shen Zhengyi,

939
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,479
let's put that away for now.

940
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,639
Now I want you

941
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,959
to focus all on

942
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,840
cooperating with Coach Zhuang's work.

943
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:57,320
I hope that

944
00:38:58,439 --> 00:38:59,280
Coach Zhuang's joining

945
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:01,000
can bring us something new.

946
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:02,520
You both have your own strength.

947
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,479
The Wind Chaser with cooperation
between you two

948
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,719
is the most powerful ever

949
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,919
in the history.

950
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,199
I see, Director.

951
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,919
Then I am leaving.

952
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,479
Shen Zhengyi.

953
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:32,280
Coach Xiao.

954
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:36,760
Sorry.

955
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:38,280
I didn't expect

956
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,239
that it would be like this.

957
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:41,280
It's OK.

958
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,080
You've given me such
a great opportunity,

959
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:45,479
but it's me who couldn't catch it.

960
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,080
It's not your fault.

961
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:49,000
I know you've practiced

962
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,159
all these years alone.

963
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:51,040
It's quite difficult.

964
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,239
I thought when you get into Wind Chaser,

965
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,560
I can help you improve curve skills.

966
00:39:54,919 --> 00:39:55,679
But I didn't expect...

967
00:39:58,159 --> 00:39:59,320
No matter whether you are here or not,

968
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:00,399
if you have any professional questions,

969
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,520
you can talk to me anytime.

970
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:02,760
You're talented.

971
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,040
Don't give up on this sport.

972
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,080
Coach Xiao,

973
00:40:06,399 --> 00:40:07,879
if I can improve my curve skills,

974
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,879
can I get into Wind Chaser again?

975
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,239
If you can improve
your curve skills,

976
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:14,520
I will do my best

977
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:16,080
to help you get the chance.

978
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:19,420
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team
of Lingbei University)

979
00:40:30,959 --> 00:40:31,679
Good morning.

980
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:34,560
Why didn't you change into
your training uniform?

981
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:37,360
I have something to tell you.

982
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:39,040
Say it.

983
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:40,560
You might need to

984
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:41,679
find a new partner.

985
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:43,399
What do you mean?

986
00:40:44,439 --> 00:40:45,360
I am going to retire.

987
00:40:56,479 --> 00:40:57,959
So sudden?

988
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:01,479
Actually, I've been struggling

989
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:04,159
about whether to be an athlete

990
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:06,840
or study abroad.

991
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,879
Then after consideration,

992
00:41:09,879 --> 00:41:10,639
I decided to

993
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:12,639
retire.

994
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:15,840
Actually, I choose to retire

995
00:41:15,959 --> 00:41:17,159
for one big reason.

996
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:19,639
That is you.

997
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,040
Because you said that

998
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,800
you won't fall in love
with your partner.

999
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,040
Beisheng,

1000
00:41:29,439 --> 00:41:31,159
I've liked you for a long time.

1001
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,000
Now I'm

1002
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,320
retired.

1003
00:41:35,959 --> 00:41:37,280
I want to change to another identity

1004
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,280
to be with you.

1005
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,080
You just give up

1006
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:48,879
your professional career like this?

1007
00:41:48,959 --> 00:41:50,439
Don't you think it's a pity?

1008
00:41:50,879 --> 00:41:52,199
Life is more than skating.

1009
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:53,520
And I had all the gold medals

1010
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:54,600
that I wanted to get.

1011
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,280
There's nothing to regret for.

1012
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:58,959
Beisheng,

1013
00:41:59,919 --> 00:42:01,000
I've got it all figured out.

1014
00:42:01,879 --> 00:42:03,159
‍I need a new identity

1015
00:42:03,879 --> 00:42:05,360
to get close to you.

1016
00:42:10,439 --> 00:42:12,239
Liu Fei, this is the case.

1017
00:42:15,439 --> 00:42:16,360
I... I value

1018
00:42:16,399 --> 00:42:17,199
you as a partner very much.

1019
00:42:18,199 --> 00:42:19,399
I don't want you to leave.

1020
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:20,919
But now I

1021
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:21,959
really don't want to have a girlfriend.

1022
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,879
And I don't want

1023
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,520
the relationship between us

1024
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,719
to be too complicated.

1025
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,360
So I just want to

1026
00:42:29,479 --> 00:42:30,479
treat you as a partner,

1027
00:42:30,879 --> 00:42:32,040
and there will be
no other possibilities.

1028
00:42:32,439 --> 00:42:33,679
That's because you haven't tried

1029
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:34,840
any other possibilities.

1030
00:42:50,479 --> 00:42:51,120
This one, this one.

1031
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:52,120
Choose this. This is pretty.

1032
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,000
Can you leave me alone?

1033
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,040
I'm busy.

1034
00:42:57,679 --> 00:42:58,840
Liu Fei

1035
00:42:59,719 --> 00:43:00,879
skates quite well.

1036
00:43:01,399 --> 00:43:02,639
Why does she retire so sudden?

1037
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:03,959
Right?

1038
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,560
Now, people of the same level

1039
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,520
all have partners.

1040
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,120
Where can I find someone

1041
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:09,879
with a tacit understanding like Liu Fei?

1042
00:43:13,239 --> 00:43:14,120
I'd say

1043
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,360
don't worry.

1044
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,239
You, Prince Sheng, have
such a good reputation.

1045
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:19,320
Are you still worrying about

1046
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,320
finding the right partner?

1047
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,159
I have to find someone

1048
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,600
I can work with.

1049
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,199
I'm afraid that's a little difficult.

1050
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,439
Or you can join my

1051
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,280
Drama Club,

1052
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,520
