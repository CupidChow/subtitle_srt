Lingbei University)

00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,919
Come in.

5
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:08,039
Mom.

6
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,880
What are you doing here?

7
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,039
Why didn't I see you

8
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,039
at the game?

9
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,679
I ran into an acquaintance

10
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:18,399
and had a chat.

11
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,039
Why didn't you

12
00:02:21,119 --> 00:02:21,759
go celebrate with Zhengyi?

13
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,679
Why are you here?

14
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,720
Forget it.

15
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,320
She was picked up by her parents.

16
00:02:25,399 --> 00:02:26,639
She wouldn't celebrate with me.

17
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,880
Her mother must be very happy,
isn't she?

18
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,240
Yes, she is quite happy,

19
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:34,520
but not as happy as her father.

20
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,119
Her father is so happy that
he is going to cry.

21
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:42,600
Mom, what's wrong with you?

22
00:02:44,119 --> 00:02:44,880
Nothing.

23
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,440
Why do I feel

24
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,160
you are not happy at all about

25
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:48,759
Zhengyi won the gold?

26
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,240
Of course, I'm happy.

27
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,720
I'm just a little tired lately.

28
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,119
Wait a minute, mom.

29
00:03:05,399 --> 00:03:06,160
It's from Zhengyi?

30
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,520
Do her parents

31
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:13,960
know about you two?

32
00:03:15,559 --> 00:03:16,800
No.

33
00:03:17,559 --> 00:03:18,399
Mom, I'm gonna make a call.

Beisheng.

35
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,720
Tell Zhengyi for me that

36
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,240
she is the best.

37
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,399
Okay!

May I have a word before dinner?

40
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,279
In this Ling Yun Cup,

41
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,600
we, Wind Chaser,

42
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,919
have achieved very good performance.

43
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,279
The efforts of each of you

44
00:04:07,559 --> 00:04:08,440
matter.

45
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:09,960
Individual accomplishments

46
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:11,520
do not represent individual achievements

47
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:12,759
but our

48
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:14,399
whole Wind Chaser's pride.

49
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,119
Here.

50
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,200
For everyone's contribution,

51
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,440
I'd like to propose a toast
to all of you.

52
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,679
Cheers!

53

Cheers! Cheers!

54
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:26,799
Thank you, Coach Zhuang.

55
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,679
Thank you, Coach Xiao.

56
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,079
Thank you, Coach Xiao.

57
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:29,839
Keep working!

58
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,679
Thank you, Coach.

59
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:33,839
There is one more thing

60
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:34,880
to announce.

61
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,720
After this game,

62
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,799
Liu Sisi is gonna retire

63
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,399
and leave Wind Chaser.

64
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:47,040
I'll miss you.

65
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,600
Coach Xiao. Come on.

66
00:04:52,119 --> 00:04:52,799
Say something.

67
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,160
First of all, as a coach,

68
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,399
I'm particularly grateful to Liu Sisi

69
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,119
for her dedication and contribution
to Wind Chaser

70
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,640
over the past four years.

71
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,119
You are

72
00:05:04,239 --> 00:05:05,239
an integral part of our team.

73
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,959
Although the career of an athlete

74
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,920
may be short,

75
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,679
and you may feel reluctant to leave

76
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:11,760
and may have regrets,

77
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:14,079
retirement is

78
00:05:14,239 --> 00:05:15,519
just the transfer station of your life.

79
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,760
I hope that your life in the future

80
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,279
can become better and better

81
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,559
without forgetting
your original intention.

82
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,000
Sisi, say something.

83
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:28,239
There's nothing to say.

84
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,239
Come on.

85
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:30,799
- Sisi.
- Say something.

86
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,519
- Sisi.
- Say something.

87
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,239
Sisi.

88
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:40,839
These four years

89
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,000
have gone by really fast.

90
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:45,720
There are a lot of
unforgettable memories,

91
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:48,640
especially in the last period of time.

92
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:55,119
What's wrong with me?

93
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,720
It's so embarrassing.

94
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,399
Coach Xiao is right.

95
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,959
Retirement is not the end.

96
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:04,559
But to say

97
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,359
there is no regret,

98
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,519
I think that would be a lie.

99
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,760
But this is life, isn't it?

100
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,920
There are regrets

101
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,600
but we can gain growth.

102
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,959
I'm sincerely

103
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:22,600
and wholeheartedly

104
00:06:22,679 --> 00:06:25,519
grateful to Coach Zhuang, Coach Xiao

105
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:28,839
and every one of you,

106
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,279
my fellows.

107
00:06:37,239 --> 00:06:37,920
You have left me

108
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,959
the best gift.

109
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:41,200
That is the spirit of the athlete,

110
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,600
the spirit of Wind Chaser.

111
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,519
I believe,

112
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:45,920
with this spirit,

113
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,679
Wind Chaser will get better and better.

114
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:52,239
Go, Wind Chaser!

115
00:06:52,799 --> 00:06:54,440
- Go, Wind Chaser!
- Go, Wind Chaser!

116
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,600
Wind Chaser will win!

117
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:57,279
- Wind Chaser will win!
- Wind Chaser will win!

118
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:58,000
Cheers!

119
00:06:58,239 --> 00:06:59,760
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

120
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:02,920
Thank you, Coach.

121
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:04,079
Keep going!

122
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,480
What are your plans for the future?

123
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:10,079
Speaking of this,

124
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,600
I have a good news to tell you.

125
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,600
What is it?

126
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,000
(Liu Sisi got hired as HR assistant)

127
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,679
Look!

128
00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:19,480
What is it?

129
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,959
May I have your attention, please?

130
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,000
Hello, Ms. Liu Sisi.

131
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:28,640
It's my pleasure to inform you that

132
00:07:28,679 --> 00:07:31,239
you have passed your interview

133
00:07:31,239 --> 00:07:33,399
for HR assistant.

134
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,399
Congratulations

135
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:37,880
to be one of us.

136
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,239
You're so good!

137
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,359
You got a job so soon!

138
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,399
It just happened.

139
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:43,320
I happened to find it

140
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,000
on 58.com.

141
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,839
And next week,

142
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,519
I'll start my internship.

143
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,320
So soon!

144
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:51,920
You have to come back often

145
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,720
to see us.

146
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,600
I will, for sure.

147
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,160
I'll wear a wonderful make-up,

148
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,000
the most beautiful dress

149
00:07:58,119 --> 00:07:59,279
and a pair of heels,

150
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,679
looking at you being tortured
with pleasure.

151
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,440
You look at us being tortured?

152
00:08:04,799 --> 00:08:05,839
Have you ever worn heels?

153
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,239
Do you know
how slippery the Skating Rink is?

154
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,200
She may wear heels

155
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,000
on the Skating Rink with pleasure

156
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:12,880
and fall on her face.

157
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,679
Are you stupid?

158
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,480
Will she be stupid enough

159
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,959
to wear heels on the ice?

160
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:19,040
A little stupid, indeed.

161
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:20,600
Alright.

162
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:21,600
Today

163
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,079
let's celebrate that Liu Sisi

164
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,160
has a new start in life!

165
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,880
Come on! Cheers!

166
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,000
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

167
00:08:28,559 --> 00:08:29,440
Cheers!

168
00:08:41,239 --> 00:08:41,919

169
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:42,919
45.

170
00:08:43,239 --> 00:08:43,760
46.

171
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,960
48 and 49.

172
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,039
- 49!
- 49!

173
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,679
Why? Why is that?

174
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,719
7 times 7 equals 49.

175
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,000
Add some juice.

176
00:08:53,719 --> 00:08:55,200
My god! Me again?

177
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,200
Drink a pot. Come on!

178
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,080
No. No.

179
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,799
- Take it!
- Take it!

180
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:07,960
Next. Next.

181
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,960
Alright. Go on.

182
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,280
52.

183
00:09:11,479 --> 00:09:12,000
53.

184
00:09:12,359 --> 00:09:12,880
54.

185
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:15,679
56.

186
00:09:17,359 --> 00:09:18,960
7 times 8 equals 56!

187
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,640
- Coach Zhuang.
- Coach Zhuang.

188
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:23,440
Take it for me.

189
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,640
Coach Zhuang. Come on!

190
00:09:26,719 --> 00:09:27,840
Come on! Let's say Coach Zhuang!

191
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:37,799
What are you thinking?

192
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,799
Thinking about everybody.

193
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,559
All of sudden, I have to leave.

194
00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:45,479
It is really difficult for me.

195
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,359
If you miss us,

196
00:09:48,119 --> 00:09:48,840
you can

197
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:49,919
come back anytime.

198
00:09:50,119 --> 00:09:50,919
Of course, I will.

199
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:51,880
I will come back

200
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,679
to check the results of your training.

201
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,479
Suddenly I am out of the picture.

202
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,200
Looking at you,

203
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,640
suddenly I seem to have

204
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:02,479
figured out a lot of things.

205
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:05,400
About what?

206
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,000
You were very lucky

207
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:13,200
to meet Coach Zhuang
when you joined the team.

208
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:15,760
I always thought

209
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,919
you guys

210
00:10:17,359 --> 00:10:19,159
were a little closer to Coach Xiao.

211
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:22,039
We old players

212
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,039
do have more contact

213
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,159
with Coach Xiao.

214
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:27,760
But,

215
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,039
without Coach Zhuang,

216
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,679
the regret of my sports career

217
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:32,880
may be more than

218
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,039
this gold medal.

219
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:36,840
What do you mean by that?

220
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,799
It was Coach Zhuang
who made me understand

221
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,760
everyone can actually

222
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,919
become stronger.

223
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,200
It all depends on
whether you dare to fight.

224
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:50,840
Anyway. You just have to know

225
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,520
Coach Zhuang's training methods

226
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,640
are better for you.

227
00:10:57,599 --> 00:10:58,520
Let's go. Let's go back.

228
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,320
Zhengyi.

229
00:11:04,239 --> 00:11:05,119
I

230
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:06,880
have done

231
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,080
a lot of bad things to you before.

232
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:09,760
I'm sorry.

233
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,719
Seriously,

234
00:11:13,359 --> 00:11:13,960
you are

235
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:15,039
the most potential player
I've ever seen.

236
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,119
Keep trying!

237
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,960
We should not be overwhelmed

238
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:24,840
by the victory.

239
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,599
It has been three years
for Eunkyung Choi

240
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:29,280
to dominate the major
international awards.

241
00:11:29,599 --> 00:11:30,440
Enough. Enough. It's enough.

242
00:11:31,359 --> 00:11:32,000
Come on.

243
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,719
It's not that easy to win!

244
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:34,799
Come on.

245
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,840
I'm not blaming you.

246
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:36,719
But how can you say that?

247
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,640
You are boosting others' moral

248
00:11:37,719 --> 00:11:38,799
and defeating your own prestige.

249
00:11:39,239 --> 00:11:39,960
If you ask me,

250
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,520
Shen Zhengyi could be the one

251
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,520
who can beat Eunkyung Choi.

252
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,440
What are you talking about?

253
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:47,359
Don't you think so, Coach Zhuang?

254
00:11:49,599 --> 00:11:50,359
Zhu Lele is right.

255
00:11:50,599 --> 00:11:51,280
See?

256
00:11:51,719 --> 00:11:53,159
Coach Zhuang agrees with me!

257
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,000
Come on.

258
00:11:55,119 --> 00:11:56,080
She is my idol.

259
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:57,080
I have so much

260
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,679
to learn from her.

261
00:11:59,119 --> 00:11:59,840
Come on.

262
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,599
In last Asian Cup,

263
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,200
Eunkyung Choi made her record of

264
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,479
2 minutes 27 seconds.

265
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,400
Xiaoyi's best record

266
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:09,880
is 2 minutes 37 seconds.

267
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:13,880
No one can always win

268
00:12:14,599 --> 00:12:16,080
in competitive sports.

269
00:12:17,119 --> 00:12:18,520
There is still some time
before the Asian Cup.

270
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:19,880
For 1500m race,

271
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,679
personal skills are important.

272
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,039
Bur the most important thing

273
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,880
is tactical cooperation.
Keep it in your mind.

274
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:28,840
Alright.

275
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,119
I'm almost done here.

276
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,320
I don't think

277
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,440
you can enjoy yourself
when I'm here.

278
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,000
No, no, no.

279
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,760
I gotta go.

280
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,840
Don't be too late, though.

281
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:37,880
Tomorrow you gotta go training.

282
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,679
Zhou Luhan, watch yourself.

283
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,200
Okay.

284
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,440
See you.

285
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,640
- Bye, Coach Zhuang.
- Bye, Coach Zhuang.

286
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:48,559
Coach Xiao.

287
00:12:49,359 --> 00:12:50,520
Coach Xiao, are you leaving too?

288
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,359
Coach Xiao, you can't leave.

289
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,760
If you leave,

290
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:58,400
you'll leave us with no leader.

291
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,400
Am I right?

292
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:01,960
Coach Xiao,

293
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,280
please just stay for a little while.

294
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,760
Fine.

295
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,039
That means yes.

296
00:13:08,239 --> 00:13:09,239
Right?

297
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,599
OK. Let's keep playing.

298
00:13:10,719 --> 00:13:11,280
Come on!

299
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,599
Okay.

300
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,440
6.

301
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:16,840
8.

302
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,520
9.

303
00:13:17,599 --> 00:13:18,000
10.

304
00:13:18,239 --> 00:13:18,679
11.

305
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,200
12.

306
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,359
13.

307
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:22,799
15.

308
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,679
16.

309
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:27,440
I've had enough.

310
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,479
That's all you know.

311
00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:31,840
(BAO GONG)
It's so cold today.

312
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,719
Is it cold?
Luckily, I wear a lot of clothes.

313
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,320
Look at yourself.
You're wearing too little.

314
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,479
Are you cold?

315
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:37,679
No.

316
00:13:38,239 --> 00:13:38,960
Are you okay?

317
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:39,640
I'm fine. I'm fine.

318
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:40,599
Is she okay?

319
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:44,880
Shao Beisheng.

320
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,200
Zhengyi.

321
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,400
Shao Beisheng comes to pick you up.

322
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,239
Hurry!

323
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:53,880
Look at her!

324
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,679
Are you done?

325
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:55,200
She's got a boyfriend

326
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,280
- to pick her up after dinner.
- Why are you here?

327
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,039
I'm here to pick you up.

328
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,799
So sweet.

329
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,200
Why didn't you let me know?

330
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,239
Have you been waiting for a long time?

331
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,280
Not long.

332
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,479
Let's go.

333
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:08,599
I want a boyfriend too.

334
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,280
Why? Why?

335
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:11,840
We gotta go.

336
00:14:14,239 --> 00:14:15,400
Bye.

337
00:14:17,119 --> 00:14:18,200
So sweet!

338
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,679
I gotta go back.

339
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,000
Bye.

340
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,960
Xiaoyi. Bye.

341
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,880
Xiaoyi.

342
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:29,760
(BAO GONG)
Bye.

343
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,000
Then we're leaving too. Coach Xiao.

344
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,039
Coach Xiao, see you.

345
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:33,159
- Bye.
- Bye.

346
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:33,719
Be safe.

347
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:34,960
Bye.

348
00:14:37,359 --> 00:14:38,599
You have to

349
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,760
restrain yourself in the future.

350
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,880
It's not the same between
working in a company

351
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,200
and being in Wind Chaser.

352
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,320
I learned it from you.

353
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:47,080
You didn't eat much today.

354
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:48,159
It's not good for your appetite?

355
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:51,719
The celebration party tonight
is so lively.

356
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,280
You and Shen Zhengyi are the lead.

357
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,719
It is surprising that you noticed me.

358
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,840
You didn't eat much

359
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,239
but were so jealous.

360
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,440
That's true.

361
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,280
For all these years, you have been

362
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,440
the only lead.

363
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,760
Being an audience for the first time,

364
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:05,000
you aren't used to that, are you?

365
00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:07,919
Liu Sisi,

366
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,320
you're leaving.

367
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,799
And you asked me to go back together

368
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,520
just to wind me up?

369
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,440
Just because I'm leaving,

370
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:18,080
I have to tell you something now.

371
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,000
Otherwise, there'll be no chance for it.

372
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,359
Xiaoyi,

373
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:31,359
actually, I feel very sorry.

374
00:15:32,239 --> 00:15:33,840
We have been partners for so many years.

375
00:15:35,119 --> 00:15:36,679
You have won so many gold medals.

376
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:38,320
Actually, I really don't have

377
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,280
any other thoughts in my mind.

378
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,039
Maybe

379
00:15:42,239 --> 00:15:43,359
it's because you are very good.

380
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:45,599
Maybe

381
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,239
it's because I treat you as my friend.

382
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,280
I've never said that

383
00:15:52,359 --> 00:15:53,520
you're not my friend.

384
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,039
But in this Ling Yun Cup,

385
00:15:57,479 --> 00:15:58,400
without you,

386
00:15:59,719 --> 00:16:01,080
I had some kind of

387
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:02,320
ambition and courage

388
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,039
I never had before for the first time.

389
00:16:07,239 --> 00:16:08,640
It was my first time
to believe in myself

390
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,479
that I can win that championship.

391
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,159
In that case,

392
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:15,159
why did you give this opportunity to

393
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:16,119
Shen Zhengyi?

394
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,239
I didn't give it to her.

395
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:20,320
Zhengyi won the championship

396
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,320
by herself.

397
00:16:22,719 --> 00:16:25,119
And she is indeed better than me

398
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:27,640
and more promising than I am

399
00:16:28,119 --> 00:16:29,559
to win the gold for Wind Chaser.

400
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,200
It's like me watching you

401
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,280
to sprint for thousands of times.

402
00:16:39,119 --> 00:16:39,840
Are you still blaming me

403
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:41,080
for taking your opportunity?

404
00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:43,679
After this game,

405
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,159
I have figured out a lot.

406
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,320
It's because I didn't work hard enough

407
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:48,880
and didn't fight for the opportunities

408
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,440
I could've fought for.

409
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,239
It's all my own choice.

410
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:56,919
You are not the one to blame.

411
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:02,960
Sometimes, I'm grateful to Zhengyi.

412
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:05,719
From her,

413
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,680
I've learned to believe in myself.

414
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,880
If I could keep believing in myself

415
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,079
when I first got admitted into the team

416
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,680
and did my best,

417
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,079
probably now

418
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:18,439
I wouldn't have so many regrets.

419
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,800
Why do you tell me all of these
all of sudden?

420
00:17:26,239 --> 00:17:27,119
Xiaoyi,

421
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:30,880
actually, I've been jealous of you

422
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,839
and not convinced of you.

423
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,400
We all are players.

424
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,000
Everybody wants to win.

425
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,359
But we are a team.

426
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,400
Someone has to pay,

427
00:17:41,439 --> 00:17:42,479
and to sacrifice.

428
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,000
But this should not be

429
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:45,280
taken for granted.

430
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,160
I don't regret it.

431
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,800
Really.

432
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,880
I always think

433
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:01,040
you are my best friend

434
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,119
and my best model.

435
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,719
I really like you a lot.

436
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,199
I don't have the nerve to tell you that,

437
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,000
actually, I like you very much.

438
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:46,160
Sisi,

439
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:48,839
I know I usually

440
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,479
have a bad temper

441
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:51,880
and am stubborn.

442
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,239
But actually, I know that

443
00:18:56,439 --> 00:18:58,280
you are my best partner

444
00:18:59,959 --> 00:19:02,040
and my best friend.

445
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:05,599
You have done so much for me,

446
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:08,800
but I was always difficult with you.

447
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:11,400
Sometimes I feel like

448
00:19:11,479 --> 00:19:13,119
I have been going too far.

449
00:19:14,439 --> 00:19:16,000
Sorry, Sisi.

450
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,640
It's okay.

451
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,119
The Asian Cup counts on you.

452
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:25,719
Come on!

453
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:32,479
Work hard.

454
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:46,400
(Lingbei University)

455
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,560
Shen Zhengyi.

456
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:53,359
Here you are.

457
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,400
Your two breakfasts.

458
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,319
Thank you. Thank you.

459
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:57,719
Come on.

460
00:19:57,719 --> 00:19:58,359
Take it. Take it.

461
00:19:59,160 --> 00:19:59,880
Thank you.

462
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,439
Why are you so early today?

463
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:02,920
The training content

464
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,319
has been changed again.

465
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:07,719
I'm afraid that if I can't
do a good job in study during the day,

466
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,079
I'll fall behind.

467
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,680
Since the training intensity
has increased again,

468
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,800
can you handle it?

469
00:20:14,199 --> 00:20:14,880
Who do you think I am?

470
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,040
Come on. Have something

471
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,239
to replenish yourself.

472
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,760
Take it when it's warm.

473
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:25,239
Take something warm to replenish...

474
00:20:32,479 --> 00:20:33,359
Qu Zhi.

475
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:37,160
You guys had a fight?

476
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:38,680
- No.
- No.

477
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,199
You are acting like this,
and you tell me you didn't fight?

478
00:20:42,479 --> 00:20:43,520
What's the matter?

479
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:45,079
Arguing again?

480
00:20:49,479 --> 00:20:50,239
Don't ask me.

481
00:20:51,439 --> 00:20:52,239
I have something on hand.

482
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,479
Tell Professor Wang that

483
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,599
I won't go to the botanical garden.

484
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:55,839
I gotta go.

485
00:20:56,239 --> 00:20:57,160
Then where are you going?

486
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,959
Qu Zhi,

487
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,520
don't you want your credit?

488
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:06,160
What happened?

489
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,199
What did you do?

490
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,439
Did you say

491
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,319
something weird

492
00:21:09,439 --> 00:21:10,560
to get him angry?

493
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,400
No.

494
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:16,400
We broke up.

495
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,160
Excuse me.

496
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,199
When were you together?

497
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,400
Really?

498
00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:25,000
You didn't even mention that to me.

499
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:31,839
Alright.

500
00:21:33,199 --> 00:21:34,000
I'm leaving.

501
00:21:38,239 --> 00:21:38,880
Qu Zhi.

502
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:41,079
Qu Zhi.

503
00:21:42,439 --> 00:21:43,400
What is going on?

504
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,880
We got together

505
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,079
when you were

506
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,319
practicing 1500m race.

507
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,880
As for why I didn't tell you,

508
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:54,280
that's because

509
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,199
I had said in the dormitory that

510
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,560
Qu Zhi was totally

511
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,119
opposite to my ideal type.

512
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,959
I was afraid you might laugh at me

513
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,079
if I told you that I was with him.

514
00:22:03,719 --> 00:22:04,800
What are you talking about?

515
00:22:04,959 --> 00:22:06,319
How is it possible?

516
00:22:07,719 --> 00:22:08,359
If everything went well,

517
00:22:08,439 --> 00:22:10,000
why did you break up?

518
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:12,760
Remember that training

519
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,599
in which Coach Zhuang

520
00:22:13,719 --> 00:22:14,520
scolded me?

521
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:16,560
I went to him later

522
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:18,280
and hoped that he could comfort me.

523
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:19,319
It turned out he kept

524
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:20,079
preaching at me over there.

525
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,439
And we were talking over and over.

526
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:23,000
Then, I made an angry remark,

527
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,640
and he took it seriously.

528
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,920
No wonder you were

529
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:28,359
in bad mood these days.

530
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,599
What's in your mind now?

531
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:33,520
What can I do about it?

532
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:35,199
Look at me.

533
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,920
My black eyes are falling
onto the ground.

534
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,560
You regret it?

535
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,560
But

536
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,680
can regret be of any help?

537
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,800
Words

538
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,119
are like the water splashed away.

539
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:49,599
I haven't figured out what to do.

540
00:22:52,239 --> 00:22:54,439
Sometimes, we girls do make
some bad remarks

541
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,079
when we are in bade mood.

542
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:58,800
But we don't really mean it.

543
00:22:59,959 --> 00:23:00,520
Say something nice to him.

544
00:23:01,439 --> 00:23:01,839
How do you know

545
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,160
it's useless if you don't give it a try?

546
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,439
Forget it.

547
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:07,599
I wanna think about it myself.

548
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,839
I haven't figured it out.

549
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,599
Study hard.

550
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:35,479
You did a pretty good job.

551
00:23:36,719 --> 00:23:37,359
What?

552
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,680
You and Zhu Lele.

553
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:40,239
We know.

554
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,839
Don't try to draw me out.

555
00:23:43,439 --> 00:23:44,599
Your move sucks.

556
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,319
She and I...

557
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:47,319
Why did you break up?

558
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,199
Zhu Lele!

559
00:23:52,479 --> 00:23:54,319
You sneaked out
when we were in relationship.

560
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:57,479
Now we broke up,
and you tell everyone about that?

561
00:23:58,599 --> 00:23:59,760
You are wrong about her.

562
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,520
She got drawn out

563
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,119
by my terrible move.

564
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,800
Stupid.

565
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:10,239
Tell me about it.

566
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,479
Why did you break up?

567
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:14,560
What?

568
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,400
I am the one who got dumped.

569
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,560
You ask me about it?

570
00:24:19,439 --> 00:24:19,880
She's not like

571
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,880
the person who will ask to depart.

572
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,520
Can't you

573
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,760
just step back?

574
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,560
I'm not as

575
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,680
shameless as you.

576
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:33,959
Qu Zhi.

577
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,199
No personal attack!

578
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,280
Shameless.

579
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,280
You...

580
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,920
Up to you.

581
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,520
You are shameless.

582
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,160
I'm not available tonight.

583
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,520
You go for it.

584
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,000
It seems as if you are very busy.

585
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,560
It is still Qu Zhi who
can take good pictures of me.

586
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:42,760
I am only your back-up plan

587
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,839
to go through the rough period.

588
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,239
It's no shame to take the initiative

589
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,439
to apologize.

590
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:04,190
(Auditorium)

591
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:12,800
Excuse me.

592
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,079
Stand in the line.

593
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,479
Stand in the line?

594
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,959
Why?

595
00:26:17,319 --> 00:26:17,920
Are you here

596
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,199
for the recruitment of the drama club?

597
00:26:19,719 --> 00:26:21,000
We are all here for it.

598
00:26:21,239 --> 00:26:22,319
So, please stand in the line.

599
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:23,680
(Drama Club)
All of you

600
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,400
are here for the interview?

601
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,040
Yes.

602
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,560
It's been only few days
since I didn't come.

603
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,680
The drama club has become so popular!

604
00:26:32,719 --> 00:26:33,319
Excuse me.

605
00:26:33,439 --> 00:26:33,920
It seems Ye An

606
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:34,959
has a pretty good time in there.

607
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,000
Ye An?

608
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:38,119
Who is Ye An?

609
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,280
The beauty queen of
the Literature Department.

610
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,359
If she gets in,

611
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,160
we'll all be screwed.

612
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:59,440
(Drama Club)

613
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,440
Hey, hey.

614
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,439
Yes, exactly.

615
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,000
What's going on here?

616
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:15,000
Can't you see that?

617
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,800
They must have a fight.

618
00:27:17,439 --> 00:27:18,040
Next.

619
00:27:18,239 --> 00:27:19,040
What next?

620
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,640
Your drama club is
looking for new members.

621
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,880
Why didn't you tell me?

622
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:26,760
Curly Hair, tell her.

623
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,239
The member of the club
who is absent for a long time

624
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:31,280
is not qualified for discussion.

625
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,959
The president said...

626
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:36,920
I heard it!

627
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,520
When I first came to the drama club,

628
00:27:38,719 --> 00:27:40,160
nobody told me there was such a rule.
Why?

629
00:27:43,959 --> 00:27:44,640
Tell her

630
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,599
this is a rule
the president just made.

631
00:27:47,719 --> 00:27:49,520
What do you mean by that?

632
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,839
When I just came here...

633
00:27:51,199 --> 00:27:51,959
Lele, Lele.

634
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,479
P... President,

635
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:55,560
I think it's good to

636
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,280
have one more person to discuss.

637
00:27:56,479 --> 00:27:57,160
- Yes.
- Yes.

638
00:27:57,239 --> 00:27:58,119
Come here. Lele. Lele.

639
00:27:58,199 --> 00:27:58,959
Yes, exactly.

640
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,160
Here. Here. Here.

641
00:28:07,239 --> 00:28:08,479
Next one.

642
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,040
Hold on, Wang Jun.

643
00:28:12,439 --> 00:28:13,000
Leave the door open.

644
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:14,520
Beisheng, why are you here?

645
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,359
There are only five days left

646
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:16,319
before Curry's selection.

647
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,199
I'll practice more.

648
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:18,239
Gotta go.

649
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:19,800
Fine. Go for it!

650
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,040
Okay.

651
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,640
He has been working so hard.

652
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:24,880
About Curry's selection,

653
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,920
how about we give it a try?

654
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:26,800
Forget it.

655
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:28,319
Beisheng has been

656
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,400
determined to be selected.

657
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,719
Besides,

658
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,400
are you qualified?

659
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:32,959
I...

660
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,160
I'm not going because

661
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:35,439
if I really get in,

662
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:36,640
Ma will be sad.

663
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:38,839
Right. Not only Ma will be sad,

664
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,640
I will also be sad.

665
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:40,719
And I think

666
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,000
Ma has been in bad mood recently.

667
00:28:42,199 --> 00:28:43,599
If Beisheng really gets in,

668
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,079
Ma may feel sad in his heart.

669
00:28:45,199 --> 00:28:46,079
He will cry.

670
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:05,410
(Curry's selection)

671
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,839
You start the training

672
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,280
without the warm-up?

673
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,520
I did it.

674
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,479
Nonsense!

675
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:41,359
I know you.

676
00:29:42,199 --> 00:29:43,040
What if you get injured?

677
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,880
Do some warm-up exercise.

678
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:56,280
Why are you staring at me?

679
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:57,520
I'm doing the warm-up.

680
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:03,439
Time flies.

681
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:04,479
I still remember

682
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:05,479
the little you

683
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,520
when your mom just brought you here.

684
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,640
You're already so tall now.

685
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:09,280
You don't want me to leave, do you?

686
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,479
Leave now.

687
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,280
I have high blood pressure every day
because of you.

688
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,920
Two faces.

689
00:30:18,479 --> 00:30:19,280
You

690
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,520
have changed to play single skating.

691
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,199
There is not much I can teach you.

692
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,520
If you can learn from Curry,

693
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,599
I am happier than anyone else.

694
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,160
So, keep trying. Work harder.

695
00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:28,079
When you say

696
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:28,959
you are Curry's student,

697
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:29,959
how proud that'll be!

698
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,119
You don't recognize me as your student?

699
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,479
I do.

700
00:30:35,479 --> 00:30:37,040
Once a teacher, always a father.

701
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:39,520
Teacher.

702
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:40,680
Don't mess around with me.

703
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,520
Come on. Go training.

704
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,280
Don't be too nervous.

705
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:45,680
After all,

706
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,000
Xiao Qing has already
contacted Curry for you.

707
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,560
Curry also knows about

708
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,280
your current situation.

709
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,880
Thanks to Xiao Qing.

710
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,079
I'm quite sorry to her.

711
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,719
Just do it.

712
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:08,920
Thank you.

713
00:31:10,479 --> 00:31:11,239
Very good.

714
00:31:11,479 --> 00:31:12,319
I think

715
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,280
you are the best one I've seen today.

716
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:14,479
Keep being confident.

717
00:31:14,719 --> 00:31:15,199
Keep going!

718
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,239
Keep going!

719
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,199
Wait for the notice.

720
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,160
Alright.

721
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:22,319
It's all for today.

722
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:23,839
Let's make comments.

723
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,560
No comments?

724
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:32,839
Okay. Then I'll go.

725
00:31:33,199 --> 00:31:34,359
I think the boy interviewed just now

726
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,520
is the best.

727
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,400
Ask her

728
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,400
what good is about him.

729
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:41,239
What is good about him?

730
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:43,479
You tell him that

731
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,599
the boy is good-looking, good-natured,

732
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,560
and attractive.

733
00:31:47,959 --> 00:31:48,640
She told you...

734
00:31:48,719 --> 00:31:49,959
I heard it!

735
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,880
Our drama club doesn't recruit boys.

736
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:56,839
Okay. Since it's all for today,

737
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,839
let's vote.

738
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,839
I vote for Ye An

739
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:03,760
because she has great
literary attainments.

740
00:32:03,959 --> 00:32:05,400
She can make stories and also play.

741
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,920
Most importantly,
she is emotionally stable.

742
00:32:09,439 --> 00:32:09,959
I'm in.

743
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:11,000
Me too.

744
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,479
You want to continue
dressing up as a woman.

745
00:32:17,479 --> 00:32:18,199
Me too.

746
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:19,520
Okay.

747
00:32:19,959 --> 00:32:20,680
Then Ye An gets it.

748
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:21,839
That's all for today.

749
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:22,560
Dismiss.

750
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:24,000
Qu Zhi.

751
00:32:24,239 --> 00:32:25,359
If Ye An is the one,

752
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,719
what about me?

753
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,000
Where are you going now?

754
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:29,760
I...

755
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:34,439
You...

756
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,560
The beauty queen?

757
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,800
44kg?

758

(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team of
Lingbei University)

759
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,640
The school leadership attaches
great importance

760
00:33:00,199 --> 00:33:01,880
to this exchange activity
of the short track team.

761
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:03,800
Wind Chaser,

762
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,040
as one of the hosts,

763
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,359
should do the honors.

764
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,439
Don't worry.

765
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,199
I'll try my best.

767
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,959
What are you doing here?

768
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,920
(Director's Office)
Come here. Come here.

769
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,439
What's up?

770
00:33:29,479 --> 00:33:30,319
It's difficult for you this time.

771
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,359
Is this your first time to meet

772
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,040
after you left?

773
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,760
It's already the past.
It's better not to get into it.

774
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,800
I have a clear conscience.

775
00:33:40,239 --> 00:33:41,359
Even if we don't meet now,

776
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,680
we'll still run into each other
during Asian Cup.

777
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:46,640
I'm just wondering

778
00:33:46,719 --> 00:33:47,760
why

779
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:49,920
Eunkyung Choi would come to
the event like this.

780
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:51,719
It's just not her.

781
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:53,839
Eunkyung Choi?

782
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,239
Eunkyung Choi is coming...

783
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:57,239
The Eunkyung Choi I know?

786
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,920
It's the training time!

787
00:34:07,199 --> 00:34:08,280
We'll go. We'll go.

788
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,639
Bye, Coach Zhuang.

789
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:10,760

(Shen Zhengyi)

791
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,760
Every time you get angry,
you punch on the ground.

792
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:36,040
Have you ever asked how the floor feels?

793
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,080
Why are you here?

794
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:40,840
I'll come to you later, won't I?

795
00:35:41,479 --> 00:35:42,080
Someone has stood me up

796
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:43,159
for an hour.

797
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:45,199
Should I punch you?

798
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,320
It's already 5:30 pm?

799
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:49,439
Wait a minute.

800
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,600
It's already one hour?

801
00:35:55,479 --> 00:35:56,360
I was too focused,

802
00:35:56,479 --> 00:35:57,120
and I missed it.

803
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,159
Let's go.

804
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:02,280
I'm sorry.

805
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:03,520
Let's go.

806
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,040
I'm gonna take you to board games.

807
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:06,320
No.

808
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:08,080
Why not?

809
00:36:08,479 --> 00:36:09,199
Are you mad at me?

810
00:36:09,879 --> 00:36:10,679
You have been so tired.

811
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:11,760
Take a break.

812
00:36:13,479 --> 00:36:14,120
Come on.

813
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:15,199
Are you really not going?

814
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:16,399
Yes.

815
00:36:16,919 --> 00:36:18,239
Let's go play after
you finish your special training.

816
00:36:23,919 --> 00:36:25,320
But, when I finish my special training,

817
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:27,879
we have to start
a long-distance relationship.

818
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:34,479
Right.

819
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:35,679
Right.

820
00:36:36,439 --> 00:36:37,479
You just got it.

821
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,120
Your sense of crisis

822
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:40,239
came too slow.

823
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:41,800
It seems you don't care at all.

824
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,320
You really don't care?

825
00:36:45,439 --> 00:36:46,439
It turns out I'm the only one to care.

826
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,280
I feel so sad.

827
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:54,000
You don't even care about me.

828
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,080
Come on.

829
00:36:55,439 --> 00:36:56,679
It's only one year.

830
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,199
We can still see each other.

831
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,239
It's so long.

832
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:05,439
Stop it!

833
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:06,600
You...

834
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,199
It hurts.

835
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:10,919
Excuse me.

836
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,120
Why did you hit me so hard?

837
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:13,080
Are you done or not?

838
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:13,600
Come on.

839
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:14,560
It really hurts. It really hurts.

840
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,760
Really?

841
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,399
Yes.

842
00:37:16,479 --> 00:37:17,159
I didn't hit hard.

843
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:17,760
It really hurts!

844
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:18,840
Where?

845
00:37:18,959 --> 00:37:19,639
Give me a hand.

846
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,399
What did you do? You sneaked up on me?

847
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,520
You have no morale.

848
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:53,000
Who gave you this?

849
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,560
This is for you.

850
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:59,080
I made it when I missed you
this morning.

851
00:38:04,399 --> 00:38:05,399
What? You don't like it?

852
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:07,760
It's delicate.

853
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:13,560
Do you like it?

854
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,280
How come you can make this?

855
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:18,120
It's very easy.

856
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,159
I just took a few looks on the Internet

857
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:20,159
and I made it.

858
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,520
I'm telling you.

859
00:38:21,879 --> 00:38:23,159
This is the proof that

860
00:38:23,399 --> 00:38:24,840
you are not focusing on your training.

861
00:38:24,959 --> 00:38:25,439
Put it away.

862
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,040
Give it back to me if you don't want it.

863
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:26,719
Excuse me! Excuse me!

864
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,639
What are you doing?

865
00:38:28,399 --> 00:38:30,040
This reminds me of you.

866
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,600
This one?

867
00:38:36,959 --> 00:38:37,639
It's not enough.

868
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:38,600
If you wanna miss me,

869
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,919
I'll give you something else.

870
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,679
Just kidding.

871
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,040
Go back.

872
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:46,879
It's quite late.

873
00:38:47,479 --> 00:38:48,639
I can stay with you for a while.

874
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:50,000
It's okay. You're pretty tired today.

875
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:50,840
Just go.

876
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,600
Give me a hug.

877
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:09,840
Good night.

878
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:11,439
Sleep early.

879
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,199
Don't throw it away.

880
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,239

This is what I just printed out.

Everyone can read it.

896
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,520
I think it is really great.

897
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,959
This is a script I have adapted.

898
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,879
It may not be very good.

899
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:14,639
Your comments are appreciated.

900
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,679
Don't be so modest.

901
00:40:16,439 --> 00:40:17,439
I read the script yesterday.

902
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:18,800
It is way much better than mine.

903
00:40:19,439 --> 00:40:20,840
No wonder she is professional.

904
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:21,919
Full characters

905
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,399
and fluent lines.

906
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:26,239
Let's assign the roles.

907
00:40:26,479 --> 00:40:27,840
President, you play the hero.

908
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,639
There is no other choice for the heroine

909
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,280
but Ye An.

910
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,000
Of course.

911
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,040
Yes?

912
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,800
Can I?

913
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,520
President,

914
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,840
there is no other candidate.

915
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:43,760
Lele is...

916
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,760
What?

917
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,320
You are too busy to play.

918
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:07,840
What a coincidence!

919
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,040
I have had a lot of time recently.

920
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,239
And I wanna play.

921
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:21,120
(Turn Around and Embrace the Sun)
(By Ye An)

922
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:31,879
How about this?

923
00:41:32,439 --> 00:41:33,479
Let's play fair.

924
00:41:33,959 --> 00:41:34,639
I'll choose a time.

925
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,600
I'll familiarize myself with the script.

926
00:41:36,919 --> 00:41:38,040
Then let's make a time

927
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:38,840
to play.

928
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:39,679
The one who plays better

929
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,959
will be the heroine.

930
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,239
What do you think of it?

931
00:41:43,479 --> 00:41:44,439
Okay.

932
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,919
Why are you standing there?

933
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,439
What happened?

934
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:14,760
Why are you crying?

935
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,439
Did anyone bully you?

936
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,040

939
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,479
Alright. Alright.
Stop crying. Stop crying.

940
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,560
I'm gonna take revenge for you!

941

What do you think?

943
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:32,479
