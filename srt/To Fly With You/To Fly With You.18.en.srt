00:01:42,559 --> 00:01:44,319
Look! He is so good!

5
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,319
Look!

6
00:01:53,839 --> 00:01:54,839
Look!

7
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,760
So handsome!

8
00:02:05,919 --> 00:02:06,919
Come on. Let's start our training.

9
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,199
The arrival of Flyer

10
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,639
has interfered with our training.

11
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:20,880
What's in Coach Ma's mind?

12
00:02:21,279 --> 00:02:22,440
What's the point of joint training?

13
00:02:24,559 --> 00:02:25,279
It's not important.

14
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:26,520
Let's start training.

15
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,759
Fatty Shao,

16
00:03:25,399 --> 00:03:26,839
Wind Chaser is so lucky.

17
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:28,759
There is even a beauty
to train with you.

18
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,639
It's none of your business.

19
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:33,880
What's wrong?

20
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,000
The training didn't go well?

21
00:03:36,279 --> 00:03:36,960
No.

22
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,520
It went well.

23
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:46,880
Do you know

24
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,000
why you can't jump well?

25
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,440
Maybe others don't know much about it,

26
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,960
but you can't hide it from me.

27
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,759
Shao Beisheng, you are scared.

28
00:03:56,559 --> 00:03:57,639
I'm scared?

29
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,520
Are you kidding me?

30
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,320
When have I been scared?

31
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,759
Let me put it this way.

32
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,119
For Quadruple,

33
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:09,320
take-off height and center of gravity

34
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,199
are both very important.

35
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,080
Most importantly,

36
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,559
you have to be firm
when you fall on the ice.

37
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:13,759
These moves

38
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,080
shall be completed in half a second.

39
00:04:15,399 --> 00:04:16,320
So, in this process,

40
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,320
no hesitation is allowed.

41
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,320
Yes.

42
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,880
Everyone has a sense of self protection.

43
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:24,440
In the process of rotation,

44
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,320
your subconsciousness

45
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,119
tells that you might get hurt.

46
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,640
In order to complete these moves,

47
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,320
it not only depends on your techniques,

48
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,519
but also on overcoming
your survival instinct.

49
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,200
So, what you're saying is that

50
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,559
you can overcome your survival instinct,

51
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,760
but I can't.

52
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:38,720
No.

53
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,440
You were injured once.

54
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:42,760
It almost ruined

55
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,760
your professional career.

56
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:45,000
It is impossible that

57
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:46,559
it has no effect on you.

58
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,119
Nonsense.

59
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:58,320
Just keep denying.

62

(Take off from right back outside edge.)

63

(0.2 seconds.)

(it has no effect on you.)

70
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,519
(In order to complete these moves,)

71
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,320
(it not only depends on your skills,)

72
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,519
(but also on overcoming
your survival instinct.)

73
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,640
After all the talk,

74
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,880
it's all about I have to
go ahead regardless what will happen.

75
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,880
Talking about me playing
the psychological warfare.

76
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,640
He did it right away.

77
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,440
He is tougher than me.

78
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,200
(What's the point to be scared?)

79
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,320

81
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,640
thank you for helping him.

82
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,519
You're welcome, auntie.

83
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,079
I really want

84
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,119
a real game with him.

85
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,640
Good for you.

86
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,559
You have my support.

You are responsible for
pushing the piano

out of there.

91
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,359
I can play and sing.

92
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,760
You two set the existing props

93
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:00,000
a little bit romantic.

94
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:00,640
Are you okay with that?

95
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:01,760
OK. OK.

96
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:02,239
Don't worry.

97
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:02,760
I believe in you guys.

98
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:03,359
It's on us.

99
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,519
What is it?

100
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:07,480
You'll find out later.

101
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,320
Later?

102
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:10,239
Not now?

103
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,440
Do our own business.

104
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,119
Well...

105
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:16,000
What is it?

106
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:16,959
Well...

107
00:07:18,239 --> 00:07:19,720
Gong Zi, are we good?

108
00:07:20,359 --> 00:07:21,839
OK. I wanna know now.

109
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:23,839
Lele is going to confess today.

110
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,839
She asked us to help with
the atmosphere.

111
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:26,359
What?

112
00:07:27,799 --> 00:07:28,519
President.

113
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:29,920
Since you are here,

114
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:31,279
let's do it together.

115
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,760
Come on.

116
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:34,359
I don't do such a stupid thing.

117
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,679
In this case,

118
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,679
don't be so mean to me!

119
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,359
Are we still good friends?

120
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,559
What do you want me to do?

121
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,399
How about this?

122
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,160
If Wang Jun confesses to me,

123
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:56,119
you stand nearby and shout

124
00:07:56,359 --> 00:07:57,640
"Say yes! Say yes!"

125
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:58,880
Okay?

126
00:07:59,160 --> 00:07:59,920
It's a deal.

127
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:12,839
Go on.

128
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,119
You did a good job just now.

129
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,040
Yihang,

130
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,919
what happened to him?

131
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,520
What happened, bro?

132
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,440
Right. What happened?

133
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,359
What are you sighing about?

134
00:08:43,119 --> 00:08:43,440
Well,

135
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,640
help me figure it out.

136
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,919
If a girl keeps asking you

137
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,280
what you're doing,
what's that about?

138
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,520
Which girl?

139
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,119
Let me see.

140
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:52,280
No. No. It's nobody.

141
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,880
Help me figure it out.

142
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,000
She must have a crush on you.

143
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:56,640
Right.

144
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:57,679
But the problem is,

145
00:08:58,119 --> 00:08:58,880
if I

146
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,640
don't reply to her in a minute,

147
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,159
she'll get very angry.

148
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:02,640
And I have to update all the time

149
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:03,440
about what I'm doing.

150
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,679
Well,

151
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,039
with my years of experience,

152
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,760
firstly, this girl is

153
00:09:08,119 --> 00:09:08,880
manipulative.

154
00:09:09,359 --> 00:09:11,559
Secondly, she is possessive.

155
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,000
You think so?

156
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:14,919
Yes.

157
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:21,540
(Wang Jun)

158
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,479
Hello.

159
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,719
Why did no one

160
00:09:28,719 --> 00:09:30,239
tell me this in advance?

161
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:35,159
It's casual.

162
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:35,719
Fine.

163
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,080
Spontaneous.

164
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,479
Lele,

165
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,359
shall we rehearse

166
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,239
that song again?

167
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,119
That's all for today.

168
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:46,520
He's not coming.

169
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:49,119
Why?

170
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,119
He is training.

171
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,719
It can be pretty strenuous.

172
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:54,880
I can understand.

173
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,479
It's getting late.

174
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,840
Let's go home.

175
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,479
I'll go back to my dormitory.

176
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,320
Lele.

177
00:10:05,719 --> 00:10:06,760
Heart. The heart.

178
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,479
Is the lightning board finished yet?

179
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,000
Still got time for the heart?

180
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,359
What happened?

181
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,440
I have no idea.

182
00:10:30,119 --> 00:10:30,840
Don't let me down.

183
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,479
Stop calling. Hold on for one more day.

184
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,840
And we will win.

185
00:10:51,479 --> 00:10:53,119
I cooked too much noodles today.

186
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,359
I can't finish them all.

187
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,239
What should I do?

188
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,359
It smells so good!

189
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:12,239
Wang Limin,

190
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,960
I didn't expect

191
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,239
you to be

192
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,080
such a person!

193
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:18,719
What kind of person?

194
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,880
All day long,

195
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,080
you were eating and drinking yourself.

196
00:11:24,479 --> 00:11:25,359
It's already late night.

197
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,119
And you came to me

198
00:11:28,359 --> 00:11:29,520
with good-smelling noodles.

199
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,840
What are you up to?

200
00:11:33,239 --> 00:11:33,960
Alright.

201
00:11:34,479 --> 00:11:35,239
It's already cooled off.

202
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,719
Take it.

203
00:11:41,119 --> 00:11:42,359
Take it away! 

204
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:45,880
People with morale won't eat the food
handed out in contempt.

205
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:48,080
You're too old

206
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,320
to play this.

207
00:11:50,239 --> 00:11:51,719
Anyway, I've had too much tonight.

208
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,719
I can't eat it all.

209
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:54,239
Then I'll just throw it away.

210
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,359
Darling.

211
00:11:55,599 --> 00:11:56,520
Darling, please don't.

212
00:11:57,599 --> 00:11:58,200
Darling,

213
00:11:59,239 --> 00:12:00,359
if I finish all of it,

214
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,359
will you allow

215
00:12:01,599 --> 00:12:02,479
Yiyi to come back?

216
00:12:03,359 --> 00:12:04,479
I'll think about it after you take it.

217
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,640
I'll think about it.

218
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,479
Really?

219
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,840
Now you've said that.

220
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:12,640
Well,

221
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:14,479
take it or not.

222
00:12:15,239 --> 00:12:16,440
Why do I make fool of you?

223
00:12:16,479 --> 00:12:17,119
I'll take it. 

224
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,599
My darling is the best.

225
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:20,960
Darling,

226
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,000
our Yiyi

227
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:24,200
hasn't been back for
more than half a month.

228
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,880
I miss her so much.

229
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:27,640
It's not good

230
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
for you two

231
00:12:29,359 --> 00:12:30,520
to keep being like this.

232
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,320
If you wanna talk with her,
let's call her back,

233
00:12:32,479 --> 00:12:33,000
sit down,

234
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,239
and have a calm talk,

235
00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:35,200
okay?

236
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,239
Did I keep her from coming back?

237
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,880
It's she who doesn't wanna come back.

238
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,320
Then...

239
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,719
You mean

240
00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:44,359
she is allowed to come back?

241
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,479
Don't you want us to talk?

242
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,000
Okay. Let's talk.

243
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,440
You asked her to come back.

244
00:12:52,599 --> 00:12:53,479
- OK. 
- Let's talk!

245
00:12:53,719 --> 00:12:54,200
Great!

246
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:54,960
Tomorrow morning,

247
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,599
I will call her

248
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,479
and ask her to come back.

249
00:13:01,359 --> 00:13:03,080
More vinegar, please.

250
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,070
(Dad)

251
00:13:31,599 --> 00:13:32,640
Hello, dad.

252
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:48,400
Ready!

253
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,640
The dumplings are ready.
Go wash your hands.

254
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:58,919
Darling,

255
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,599
let's not be

256
00:14:00,599 --> 00:14:01,479
too strict to our daughter.

257
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:04,159
How about some strategies and tactics?

258
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:06,280
Don't go straight. Will you?

259
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,320
Our baby girl has been too scared

260
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,400
to come back.

261
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,000
Come on. Come on.

262
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,159
Dinner time.

263
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,159
Here.

264
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:20,880
Zhengyi,

265
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,039
your favorite,

266
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:23,080
three delicacies stuffed dumplings.

267
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,159
Help yourself when it's still hot.

268
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:27,559
Mom,

269
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,440
I shouldn't have quarreled
with you that day.

270
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:31,440
I'm sorry.

271
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,080
Alright. It's over.

272
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:33,880
Forget it.

273
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,440
Since you are aware of
your wrong doings,

274
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,159
I want a word with you.

275
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,000
Look.

276
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:46,440
You've already played in the game

277
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:47,880
and have also fulfilled your dream.

278
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:49,440
Should you

279
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:51,400
get back on the right track of life?

280
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:53,400
Darling.

281
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,400
Mom has seen that many athletes

282
00:14:57,919 --> 00:14:59,520
at the level of a school team

283
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,679
played in the game

284
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,520
and won silver medals.

285
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:04,559
I think

286
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:06,679
you should stop.

287
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:07,799
You really

288
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:09,280
don't have much talent.

289
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:11,679
I've just been practicing for a while.

290
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:12,799
Besides,

291
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,400
everyone agrees that
I've made rapid progress.

292
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:15,919
I don't think there is anyone

293
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:17,679
born to succeed.

294
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:19,400
As long as I practice hard by nurture,

295
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,159
I'll make it.

296
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,280
Just a few nice words,

297
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,080
and you believe it?

298
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,159
For someone like 

299
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:25,080
Eunkyung Choi, a talented

300
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:25,799
athlete,

301
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:26,919
it also took her

302
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,440
more than ten years of hard training

303
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:29,400
to make her achievement today.

304
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:31,919
Do you think you have more talent

305
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,679
or more perseverance than she does?

306
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:35,799
But I'm good too.

307
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:37,880
I had no

308
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:38,559
professional training experience before,

309
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:40,200
but I still got permitted
into Wind Chaser.

310
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:41,280
Wind Chaser

311
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:43,640
is only a low-level school team.

312
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:44,640
What's the point

313
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:45,919
to be proud of it?

314
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,039
Zhengyi,

315
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:49,760
you are now not in your best time

316
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,919
to become a professional athlete.

317
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,280
Even though you work hard

318
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,320
for a dozen years,

319
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,559
you can't make it.

320
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,799
You're at best

321
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:58,679
an amateur.

322
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,000
Even though you get permitted
into the professional team,

323
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,039
you're the one at the bottom.

324
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:04,400
Darling.

325
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:05,440
Take your dumplings.

326
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:08,799
But skating is my dream.

327
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,400
It's not a dream.

328
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,520
It's called fantasy.

329
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,559
Come down to earth.

330
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,039
You did

331
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:16,400
a good job in painting,

332
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:18,200
so just keep learning.

333
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:19,159
As for skating,

334
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:21,000
don't even think about it.

335
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:21,799
If you think

336
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:22,760
you say something bad to me,

337
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:23,919
I will flinch,

338
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:24,679
you're really

339
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,799
underestimating me.

340
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:28,280
I won't

341
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,400
give up skating anyway.

342
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,000
My baby girl.

343
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,520
Come on.

344
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:43,559
We just sat down

345
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,400
and started to have a meal of dumplings.

346
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:46,440
Do you have to hurt

347
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:47,880
your daughter's self-esteem like this?

348
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:48,880
You asked me not to go straight.

349
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:50,320
I was not straight enough?

350
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:51,400
I didn't get angry.

351
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:53,280
You call it a roundabout talk?

352
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,919
If it was me in the past,

353
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,679
I would've rushed to the school

354
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,880
and got her out of the team.

355
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,919
Darling, I think our daughter

356
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:03,559
really likes skating.

357
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:04,680
She has been working so hard,

358
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,400
and so seriously.

359
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,160
And I think

360
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,520
she is gifted.

361
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,040
Just let her give it a try.

362
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,160
I don't want her to follow my old path.

363
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,319
My leg has been in pain
for more than two decades

364
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,880
when it rains on a cloudy day.

365
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:15,920
I don't want my daughter

366
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,439
to be like me in the future.

367
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,770
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team of
Lingbei University)

368
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,680
Zhu Lele!

369
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,000
What a coincidence!

370
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:35,680
What are you doing here?

371
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,280
I'm waiting for someone.

372
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,160
Our training is long over.

373
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:40,040
There's no one left.

374
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,079
Who are you waiting for?

375
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,560
Xiao Qing.

376
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,160
Where is the other one?

377
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,439
Why isn't she with you?

378
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:49,880
Zhengyi...

379
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,160
She went home.

380
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,560
Went home?

381
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,079
She and her mother...

382
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,160
It is destined to be a reign of terror.

383
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:01,760
Lele.

384
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,560
Xiao Qing.

385
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,079
I've been waiting here for you
for a long time.

386
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:06,160
I'll leave you talk.

387
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,560
Excuse me.

388
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,199
What was Shao Beisheng talking with you?

389
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,199
He asked me about Zhengyi.

390
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,280
About Zhengyi?

391
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:18,040
I was really OK back there.

392
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,560
Ma is really bad at
candidate selection.

393
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,319
Wang Jun!

394
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:24,680
Plane!

395
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,680
Where?

396
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,920
Hello, Lele.

397
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,280
Xiao Qing.

398
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,280
Are you tired from training today?

399
00:18:39,439 --> 00:18:40,079
No.

400
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,680
If you're available tonight,

401
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:45,520
let's go to dinner.

402
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,160
I forgot my phone.

403
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,319
How about this?
I'll go back and get my phone.

404
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,640
Then I'll be here waiting for you.

405
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:55,640
Don't bother.

406
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:56,640
Well, I

407
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,319
have something else to do.

408
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,400
Don't wait for me.

409
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,040
Excuse me.

410
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,280
Bye.

411
00:19:06,439 --> 00:19:07,280
Let's go.

412
00:19:29,199 --> 00:19:29,920
(But)

413
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,560
(he doesn't have to say it.)

414
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,560
Is it good?

415
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:34,760
He took it for me.

416
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,000
This is...

417
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,319
The shadow and the perspective.

418
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,160
It's full of affection.

419
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,920
If he doesn't

420
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:42,920
fall for me,

421
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:43,920
how is it possible for him

422
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,040
to take such a good picture,

423
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:45,920
right?

424
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,070
(Zhu Lele)

425
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,680
Hello.

426
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,439
Qu Zhi, Wang Jun is ignoring me.

427
00:20:04,439 --> 00:20:06,199
Do you know where he is?

428
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,160
Come on, master.

429
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,280
What's the matter?

430
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,560
What happened?

431
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,079
What's wrong with you?

432
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:14,920
What do you mean by that?

433
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:15,920
Zhu Lele told me that

434
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:16,920
you haven't replied to her lately

435
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,560
and avoided her when you
ran into her on the road.

436
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,319
What are you thinking?

437
00:20:22,439 --> 00:20:23,079
Nothing.

438
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,079
Nonsense!

439
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,920
What's in your mind?

440
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:30,880
I don't think

441
00:20:32,199 --> 00:20:33,280
it's good for us

442
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,160
to be together.

443
00:20:38,439 --> 00:20:39,920
You swore here and

444
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,640
told me that

445
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,280
you fit each other, didn't you?

446
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,280
Yes.

447
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,920
But master, you are also aware that

448
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,760
Lele is too enthusiastic.

449
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,160
I... Sometimes I'm not smart enough

450
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,160
to figure out what
to talk with her about.

451
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,280
And what we like

452
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,680
are totally different.

453
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,520
I feel burdened

454
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,680
being with her.

455
00:20:58,079 --> 00:20:59,520
Why did you like her back then?

456
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,040
Probably it was the stage atmosphere

457
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,280
that gave me an illusion.

458
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,439
But later I realized that

459
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,280
on and off the stage,

460
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,880
she was not the same at all.

461
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,079
It's really tiring.

462
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,280
She's been like this all the time!

463
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,319
Is it your first day
to be aware of that?

464
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:18,920
Since you don't know her,

465
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,199
why

466
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,560
did you go after her casually?

467
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,760
What's wrong with you?

468
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,479
No matter on and off the stage,

469
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:26,880
she is the best!

470
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,520
She is like the sun.

471
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,160
You just don't know her.

472
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,479
(At the level of a school team,)

473
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:57,520
(you played in the game)

474
00:21:58,119 --> 00:21:59,400
(and won a silver medal.)

475
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,400
(You really don't have to
practice anymore.)

476
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:02,520
(At best,)

477
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:04,280
(you are an amateur.)

478
00:22:04,719 --> 00:22:06,160
(Even though you get admitted
into a professional team,)

479
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:08,359
(you're the one at the bottom.)

480
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:10,119
(It's not a dream.)

481
00:22:10,239 --> 00:22:11,160
(It's called fantasy.)

482
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,239
(Come down to earth.)

483
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,150
(Shao Beisheng)

484
00:22:30,199 --> 00:22:30,920
Yes?

485
00:22:31,439 --> 00:22:31,920
I heard that

486
00:22:33,199 --> 00:22:34,640
your dad asked you to go home.

487
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,520
Is everything okay?

488
00:22:39,479 --> 00:22:40,400
Nothing much.

489
00:22:42,439 --> 00:22:43,439
Can you get out now?

490
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:45,760
For what?

491
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,839
I'm downstairs.

492
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,719
You'll find out when you come down.

493
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,199
Wait a minute.

494
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:10,000
I'll get out.

495
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:13,680
My baby girl,

496
00:23:14,199 --> 00:23:14,959
what are you going to do?

497
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,920
I wanna go buy some ice cream.

498
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:17,680
I wanna have some ice cream.

499
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,640
I'll be right back.

500
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,640
Would you like some?

501
00:23:24,199 --> 00:23:25,520
Where is she going at this hour?

502
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,239
Follow her up!

503
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,760
Just for ice cream.

504
00:23:29,239 --> 00:23:30,439
What season is it now?

505
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,000
Ice cream, really?

506
00:23:32,479 --> 00:23:33,680
She's wearing pajamas.

507
00:23:34,239 --> 00:23:35,199
It should be fine.

508
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:35,760
Don't be nervous.

509
00:23:58,239 --> 00:23:59,040
Come on.

510
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:00,239
Anybody?

511
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,760
Nope.

512
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:09,040
What's the matter?

513
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,040
You just dress up like this?

514
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:11,760
Why?

515
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:14,719
What are you doing? I'm not cold.

516
00:24:15,439 --> 00:24:16,359
You'll feel cold soon.

517
00:24:16,479 --> 00:24:16,959
Put it on.

518
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:17,839
Well, where are we going?

519
00:24:17,959 --> 00:24:18,680
How come I will feel cold?

520
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,719
Let's go. I'll take you somewhere.

521
00:24:22,239 --> 00:24:23,040
Where are we going?

522
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:23,520
Is it far away?

523
00:24:23,719 --> 00:24:24,880
If it is far away,
I'll go and get changed.

524
00:24:24,959 --> 00:24:25,520
No, it's not.

525
00:24:25,719 --> 00:24:26,680
If you go upstairs,

526
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:27,719
your father won't allow you to come out.

527
00:24:27,959 --> 00:24:28,680
Let's go.

528
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:30,199
Are you so afraid of my dad?

529
00:24:31,439 --> 00:24:32,199
Almost like you.

530
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:34,439
Let's go.

531
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:36,520
Well...

532
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,880
You go that way. I go this way.

533
00:24:40,239 --> 00:24:40,920
See you at the gate.

534
00:24:47,439 --> 00:24:49,239
Here we are. Hurry up! Come on.

535
00:24:51,479 --> 00:24:52,199
Shao Beisheng!

536
00:24:52,239 --> 00:24:53,239
It's fine. Hurry up!

537
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,760
Are you doing this on purpose?

538
00:24:55,239 --> 00:24:56,160
I'm wearing like this.

539
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,439
You brought me to the mall.

540
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:01,119
You...

541
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:02,280
It doesn't work on me!

542
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:03,280
I'm done. I gotta go.

543
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,439
Why?

544
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:05,920
You look different

545
00:25:05,959 --> 00:25:06,959
by wearing like this.

546
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:08,439
Nonsense!

547
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:09,160
I don't wanna play.

548
00:25:09,479 --> 00:25:10,040
I don't wanna play!

549
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:10,959
There is no point for you

550
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:11,959
to get me here.

551
00:25:12,199 --> 00:25:13,160
I will not play.

552
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:13,760
You... You...

553
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,400
Come in. Come in.

554
00:25:14,439 --> 00:25:15,160
I'm a person with principles.

555
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:17,199
I'm telling you. It's not possible...

556
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:24,719
A doll machine for Wind Chasing Boys!

557
00:25:25,239 --> 00:25:26,520
Why haven't I seen it before?

558
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:29,040
Wait. I'll go get some game coins.

559
00:25:29,199 --> 00:25:29,520
Bye.

560
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,439
Don't bother.

561
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:36,400
Love you!

562
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,160
Wait. Take the coat for me.

563
00:25:40,479 --> 00:25:41,599
It will affect my operation.

564
00:25:43,239 --> 00:25:44,680
- Come on! 
- Come on!

565
00:25:45,479 --> 00:25:46,199

00:25:58,439 --> 00:25:59,199
Go for it! It's all yours.

572
00:26:01,199 --> 00:26:01,800
Okay.

573
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,680

There is success rate for
this kind of machine.

578
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,959
It can't be too easy for us

579
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,160
to catch the doll.

580
00:26:11,479 --> 00:26:11,920
So...

581
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,599
Let me give it a try.

582
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,280
Come on! It's the same.

583
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,199
The most important things
of catching the dolls

584
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,599
are the timing and angle.

585
00:26:19,719 --> 00:26:20,680
It's impossible. I'm telling you.

586
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,199

587

You're so awesome!

591
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:35,000
Take it.

592
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:36,359

Are you happy now?

604

When you just came out,

605
00:27:22,959 --> 00:27:23,680
your face almost came down
to the ground.

606
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,680
Were you aware of that?

607
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,640
Had a fight with your mom?

608
00:27:28,239 --> 00:27:29,000
The same old issue.

609
00:27:29,239 --> 00:27:29,839
As long as I talk to my mom

610
00:27:29,959 --> 00:27:30,760
about skating,

611
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,640
it will come to this.

612
00:27:31,959 --> 00:27:32,400
But fighting

613
00:27:32,479 --> 00:27:33,959
is not the solution
to solve the problem.

614
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,680
You should overcome firmness
by gentleness.

615
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,040
When you're back home later,

616
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,040
be nice to your mom.

617
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,680
She cares about you.

618
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:44,640
Fine.

619
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,599
Stop watching.

620
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,199
She has been out for so long.

621
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,680
Make a call!

622
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,239
No, I won't. You make it.

623
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:09,959
She was just wearing pajamas

624
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,479
to buy some ice cream.

625
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:12,680
She couldn't go too far.

626
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:13,479
Don't worry.

627
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,920
I can't be more worried.

628
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,000
The news said that

629
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,520
many kids who had disagreement
with their parents

630
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,280
ran into accident later.

631
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:22,000
Since you are aware of that,

632
00:28:22,199 --> 00:28:23,680
don't be that nasty to her!

633
00:28:23,959 --> 00:28:24,520
Look at you.

634
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,000
Now the kid has grown up

635
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,680
and has a mind of her own.

636
00:28:27,959 --> 00:28:29,640
I was not nasty to her just now.

637
00:28:30,199 --> 00:28:31,280
You totally got me wrong.

638
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:33,880
Fine. I'll go by myself.

639
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:37,479
Where have you been?

640
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,959
It took you so long to come back.

641
00:28:41,439 --> 00:28:43,520
I told my dad that

642
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,640
I... I was going to

643
00:28:44,719 --> 00:28:45,959
buy some ice cream.

644
00:28:46,719 --> 00:28:48,719
Then I ran into

645
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:50,280
a doll machine.

646
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:52,520
I just played a little while.

647
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:54,520
You just do whatever you want.

648
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,280
Your mom has been worrying about you.

649
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,599
She was afraid after she said
something to you,

650
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,760
you would run away from home.

651
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,239
Even though I wanna run away from home,

652
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:01,000
I won't dress like this.

653
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,160
I'll have a better look.

654
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:02,920
How dare you!

655
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,239
Mom.

656
00:29:06,439 --> 00:29:08,160
I don't wanna fight with you.

657
00:29:08,719 --> 00:29:09,959
I wasn't fighting with you.

658
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:10,959
I was not nasty to you either.

659
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,760
I just wanna...

660
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:13,439
Fine.

661
00:29:14,199 --> 00:29:14,959
I will get you some hot milk.

662
00:29:15,439 --> 00:29:15,959
I'm fine.

663
00:29:16,199 --> 00:29:17,040
Mom, could you please help me

664
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,599
put these in the fridge?

665
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:19,479
Thank you.

666
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,920
She...

667
00:29:25,479 --> 00:29:27,359
This is happiness!

668
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,119
Has him arrived at the dorm?

669
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,380
(Back to the dormitory?)

670
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:30,119
Master.

671
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,199
You are right.

672
00:30:35,199 --> 00:30:36,800
I don't deserve Lele.

673
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:41,079
This scarf...

674
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,599
Could you please
give it back to her for me?

675
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,000
New scarf?

676
00:31:18,479 --> 00:31:19,319
From someone?

677
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:23,800
Went on a date?

678
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:26,680
No, no.

679
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:33,839
What are you looking at?

680
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,920
Come on. Be honest.

681
00:31:37,959 --> 00:31:38,920
I am being honest!

682
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,880
When have I ever lied to you?

683
00:31:42,479 --> 00:31:43,839
Your intention is

684
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,079
so obvious.

685
00:31:47,199 --> 00:31:48,079
It is too obvious that

686
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,439
you have intention for her.

687
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:51,160
Who?

688
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:53,520
Shen Zhengyi!

689
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,920
How many times do I have to tell you?

690
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,640
We are in a relationship by agreement.

691
00:31:59,199 --> 00:31:59,760
Why can't you believe me?

692
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,520
Believe it or not,

693
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,719
I can show you the agreement.

694
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,560
Wait a minute.

695
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,959
Agreement? What agreement?

696
00:32:13,199 --> 00:32:13,760
Is she...?

697
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,319
Shen Zhengyi is his girlfriend,
isn't she?

698
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,760
Yes.

699
00:32:18,439 --> 00:32:19,280
No, she's not.

700
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,719
Shut up!

701
00:32:22,959 --> 00:32:23,680
Tell me the truth.

702
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:25,280
Why isn't she your girlfriend?

703
00:32:28,959 --> 00:32:30,479
They are in a relationship by agreement.

704
00:32:35,959 --> 00:32:37,199
Good for you! Fatty Shao.

705
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,680
What is a relationship

706
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,359
by agreement?

707
00:32:42,479 --> 00:32:43,119
Why?

708
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:45,119
You like her, but you don't dare
to confess to her?

709
00:32:45,479 --> 00:32:46,880
And you found a reason
to get close to her?

710
00:32:55,439 --> 00:32:56,479
Something like that.

711
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,319
Don't make a wild guess.

712
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,199
It's just cooperation.

713
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,000
Relationship by agreement.

714
00:33:03,479 --> 00:33:04,640
There is no other intention.

715
00:33:07,239 --> 00:33:08,319
Relationship by agreement...

716
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:12,479
Actually, I have something to tell you.

717
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:14,599
Recently there is someone in our team

718
00:33:15,239 --> 00:33:16,439
who has a crush on Shen Zhengyi.

719
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,800
Since it's a relationship by agreement,

720
00:33:18,959 --> 00:33:20,680
I'll support him
to go after her boldly.

721
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,520
How dare he!

722
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,839
Who is it?

723
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,959
Relax!

724
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:27,000
I...

725
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,439
I...

726
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,199
Anyway, she is

727
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:30,599
my girlfriend in name.

728
00:33:30,719 --> 00:33:31,719
I have my pride.

729
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:34,160
Still denying your
affection to Shen Zhengyi?

730
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:36,920
I really don't like her.

731
00:33:39,239 --> 00:33:40,719
I gotta go sleep.
I'll leave you two talk.

732
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,520
Fatty Shao.

733
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:43,760
Fatty Shao.

734
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,640
What?

735
00:33:45,719 --> 00:33:46,839
Based on my past experience,

736
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,599
I'm telling you that

737
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:48,319
it

738
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,839
only takes ten seconds to verify.

739
00:33:50,479 --> 00:33:51,319
Ten seconds to do what?

740
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:54,280
Get a chance

741
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:56,199
and look into Shen Zhengyi's eyes
for ten seconds.

742
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,199
Have a try.

743
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,839
Look into her eyes for ten seconds.

744
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,800
Ten minutes

745
00:34:00,959 --> 00:34:02,199
will be OK for us too.

746
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:03,959
Then give it a try.

747
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,719
OK, I will.

748
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,760
Why should I give it a try?

749
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,679
Only fools will try it, okay?

750
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:10,919
I'm not buying it.

751
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,479
I gotta go take a bath.

752
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,040
I'm not buying it.

753
00:34:18,479 --> 00:34:20,080
I'm too busy to mind your business.

754
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,110
(Wang Jun told me today...)

755
00:34:48,439 --> 00:34:49,199
(About Wang Jun,)

756
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,800
(how should I tell her about it?)

757
00:34:58,439 --> 00:34:59,840
(Come on. Be honest.)

758
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:00,959
(I am being honest!)

759
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:01,840
(I didn't lie to you.)

760
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,159
(Your intention is)

761
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,360
(so obvious.)

762
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:06,919
(Based on my past experience,)

763
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,520
(I'm telling you,)

764
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,239
(it)

765
00:35:08,479 --> 00:35:09,919
(only takes ten seconds to verify.)

766
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,199
What do you want?

767
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,439
Take a seat.

768
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:47,600
There is something
I wanna confirm with you.

769
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:49,239
What is it?

770
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,520
Learn from me.

771
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,399
Put your hands on the table.

772
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:56,800
What's wrong with you?

773
00:35:57,479 --> 00:35:58,919
Make your head close.

774
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,520
Have you ever played

775
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:03,479
the game, blink-to-lose?

776
00:36:04,479 --> 00:36:05,800
You've got too much time?

777
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,080
I came all the way,

778
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:08,800
and you just ask me
to play a game with you?

779
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:09,919
Right.

780
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:11,479
Don't you dare?

781
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:12,840
It's not like that.

782
00:36:12,959 --> 00:36:13,560
You have to tell me

783
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:14,120
why I

784
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:14,840
should play this game with you.

785
00:36:14,919 --> 00:36:15,639
Don't you dare?

786
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:17,600
You have to tell me why I

787
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:18,320
should play this game with you.

788
00:36:18,399 --> 00:36:19,800
Don't you dare?

789
00:36:20,399 --> 00:36:20,840
We'll just wait and see.

790
00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:21,239
I'm telling you that

791
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,040
I haven't lost this game once

792
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:22,959
since I was a child.

793
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:23,879
I'll stare at you until your eyeballs

794
00:36:23,959 --> 00:36:24,639
are out today.

795
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:25,639
Come on.

796
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,679
Three. Two.

797
00:36:29,399 --> 00:36:30,320
One. Go!

798
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,159
I knew I wouldn't lose!

799
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:15,320
It's because you are too ugly.

800
00:37:15,479 --> 00:37:16,439
I can't look at you anymore.

801
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:19,800
Just admit that you lost.

802
00:37:19,919 --> 00:37:21,560
Why do you have to say I'm ugly?

803
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,120
Why is

804
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,760
my heart beating so fast?

805
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,199
It's okay.

806
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,360
You're not ugly, not at all.

807
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,040
Why is my heart beating so fast?

808
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:50,159
It must be because of the running.

809
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,520
Running...

810
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:55,120
Calm down.

811
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:26,879
What are you laughing at?

812
00:38:27,919 --> 00:38:29,040
Qu Zhi just texted me

813
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:30,239
some of

814
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,679
the most popular diseases
among young people at present.

815
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,239
Let me read it to you.

816
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,120
No. 1 is Internet addiction symptom.

817
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,040
No. 2,

818
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:40,080
the-takeout-is-on-the-way symptom.

819
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,520
No. 3 is awesome,

820
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:43,120
bachelor delusion.

821
00:38:43,479 --> 00:38:43,959
I have to

822
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:44,800
talk about this one further with you.

823
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:45,800
it means that

824
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:47,439
one person who has been single
for a long time

825
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,080
is particularly easy to be touched.

826
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,800
A little bit kindness

827
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:51,919
will make him think that

828
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:52,840
someone may have a crush on him.

829
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:53,719
Actually,

830
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,760
there is no crush at all.

831
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,120
Isn't it funny?

832
00:38:57,439 --> 00:38:58,280
It's so funny.

833
00:39:03,959 --> 00:39:04,719
(It seems that I really can't)

834
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,120
(play his girlfriend anymore.)

835
00:39:06,479 --> 00:39:07,919
(It's too dangerous to go on like this.)

836
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:10,760
This is

837
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,040
Wang Limin's previous information.

838
00:39:12,479 --> 00:39:13,159
Thank you.

839
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,760
It was very difficult to find this.

840
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,879
But fortunately, the one

841
00:39:15,919 --> 00:39:16,760
who answered the call

842
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:17,760
was the assistant coach

843
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,719
in the provincial team in1990s.

844
00:39:18,959 --> 00:39:19,959
According to her, Wang Limin

845
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:20,560
was pretty good.

846
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,719
The team also had
high expectation for her.

847
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,919
She was expected
to play in the Asian Cup

848
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:24,639
to win the gold medal.

849
00:39:25,439 --> 00:39:26,520
Unexpectedly during the game,

850
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,479
there was an accident.

851
00:39:29,959 --> 00:39:30,919
During the Asian Cup 1996

852
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Invitational Tournament

853
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,159
1500m final,

854
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:34,800
a collision accident happened.

855
00:39:34,919 --> 00:39:36,239
Retired due to injury.

856
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:37,879
It was her and her teammate

857
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,959
who ran into each other.

858
00:39:39,479 --> 00:39:40,040
I heard that

859
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:40,959
because of this,

860
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:42,080
they two fell out with each other.

861
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:44,520
Guess who was her teammate?

862
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:45,959
Who was it?

863
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,040
It's your

864
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,000
chief coach, Zhuang Yue.

865
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,159
Zhuang Yue?

866
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:55,140
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team of
Lingbei University)

867
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,880
(Coach Office)

868
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,280
Coach Zhuang is back.

869
00:40:10,479 --> 00:40:11,159
Coach Zhuang.

870
00:40:11,919 --> 00:40:12,479
I've heard that you were

871
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,560
in our provincial team before.

872
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,239
It was in 1994.

873
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:20,639
Did you play

874
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,360
long track or short track?

875
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:25,040
1500, and 3000.

876
00:40:26,959 --> 00:40:27,840
Why? Coach Xiao today

877
00:40:27,919 --> 00:40:29,639
is particularly interested
in my experience?

878
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,159
Nothing.

879
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:31,919
I am just curious about

880
00:40:31,959 --> 00:40:33,159
what you played before.

881
00:40:46,439 --> 00:40:47,439
In the College Student Ice League,
Wind Chaser

882
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,280
played worse than last year.

883
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:48,879
Really?

884
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:49,919
The figure skating performance
is average.

885
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:50,959
The short track speed skating
performance is worse.

886
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,000
The female short track speed skating
team was completely annihilated.

887
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,399
Not even one gold medal.

888
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:55,919
But there is a black horse

889
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:56,800
which became famous named

890
00:40:57,239 --> 00:40:58,120
Shen Zhengyi.

891
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,239
Right. Shen Zhengyi.

892
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,879
No matter how good she is,
she only got the silver medal.

893
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:02,840
Still not good enough.

894
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:03,800
Here he is.

895
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:04,800
She can't compete with
the veteran players.

896
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:06,159
After all, it's because of

897
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,320
the new chief coach of their team.

898
00:41:08,439 --> 00:41:09,800
You mean the nun killer named Zhuang?

899
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:11,879
Yes. The Internet says
she is jealous of talents

900
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:12,719
and says no to the best in the team,

901
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,800
Luo Xiaoyi to play.

902
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:14,719
It is only because

903
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,800
she is not a player trained by her.

904
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,399
You must not know

905
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,280
she got suspended before.

906
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,040
This is really the case that one person

907
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:22,360
destroyed a whole team.

908
00:41:22,959 --> 00:41:23,679
Such a narrow-minded

909
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,600
and incompetent chief coach.

910
00:41:24,919 --> 00:41:25,919
It's bad luck for anyone.

911
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,000
If it's me...

912
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,360
What are you doing?

913
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:33,679
Stop!

914
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,719
Stop!

915
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,639
What a shame!

916
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:39,679
Our players

917
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,520
were training well there.

918
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,919
He suddenly came over
and hit people.

919
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:43,120
Is it right?

920
00:41:43,879 --> 00:41:44,520
He indeed did something wrong.

921
00:41:44,959 --> 00:41:45,719
Joint training!

922
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:47,719
We came here to train techniques,

923
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,679
not to fight!

924
00:41:49,159 --> 00:41:50,120
Ma, you tell me.

925
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,159
It's disgraceful or not!

926
00:41:51,399 --> 00:41:51,959
Yes, it is indeed.

927
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:52,639
Don't be mad.

928
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:53,040
Have some water. Will you?

929
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:53,760
No!

930
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,239
You! What's your name, again?

931
00:41:56,879 --> 00:41:57,360
Shao Beisheng.

932
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:58,840
Shao Beisheng, right?

933
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:00,120
Explain that to me.

934
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,959
What do you mean by
just feeling bad about him?

935
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,120
Talk!

936
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:09,840
Ma.

937
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,439
Did you teach him that?

938
00:42:13,479 --> 00:42:14,520
Apologize for what you did.

939
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,600
Shao Beisheng,
what are you waiting for?

940
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:16,879
Why should I apologize?

941
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,239
Ma,

942
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:20,919
if you can't handle this,

943
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:21,679
I'll report to the association.

944
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,800
Whether it's a notice of criticism

945
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:24,879
or a suspension,

946
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:25,840
I will ask them

947
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,280
to give the justice to my player.

948
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:28,439
Liu, you...

949
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:29,639
Let's go!

950
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,239
Liu, you...

951
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,520
It's too much.

952
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:33,840
Isn't it enough that I criticized him?

953
00:42:37,919 --> 00:42:38,800
What are you doing?

954
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:41,719
I gotta go training.

955
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,879
Come back!

956
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,520
Do you have any idea
how serious this is?

957
00:42:45,639 --> 00:42:46,600
I am telling you that if he
reports to the Skating Association,

958
00:42:46,919 --> 00:42:47,879
you'll be out for the whole
sports competition season.

959
00:42:47,959 --> 00:42:48,520
Are you aware of that?

960
00:42:48,879 --> 00:42:49,719
You can't play in Ling Yun Cup,

961
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,080
not to mention the Asian Cup.

962
00:42:51,479 --> 00:42:52,439
You will be suspended for this year.

963
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,959
Are you joking about your future?

964
00:42:56,479 --> 00:42:57,080
I'll be responsible for

965
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:58,120
what I did.

966
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:02,719
Good for you!

967
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:04,320
Who will be responsible for me?

968
00:43:05,439 --> 00:43:06,719
Anyone can slate me!

969
