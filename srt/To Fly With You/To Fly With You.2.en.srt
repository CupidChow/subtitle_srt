3
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,040
I'd say

4
00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:41,279
don't worry.

5
00:01:42,199 --> 00:01:44,160
You, Prince Sheng, have
such a good reputation.

6
00:01:44,559 --> 00:01:45,239
You need to worry about

7
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:46,239
finding the right partner?

8
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:48,080
I have to find someone

9
00:01:48,199 --> 00:01:49,519
whom I can work with.

10
00:01:52,919 --> 00:01:54,120
I'm afraid that's a little difficult.

11
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,360
Or you can join my

12
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,199
Drama Club.

13
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:00,440
Make art with me.

14
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,399
Alright.

15
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,080
You've been running for so long.

16
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,399
Just take a rest.

17
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:15,440
No.

18
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:16,960
I'm not good at curves.

19
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,520
My physical strength has to keep up.

20
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,039
It's my fault.

21
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,279
If I could have skated better,

22
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,679
I could teach you something.

23
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,440
No, it's not your fault.

24
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,360
This is my fault.

25
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:27,759
I don't know

26
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:29,119
where this chief coach comes from.

27
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:31,039
Coach Xiao has admitted you
into the team.

28
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,600
She had to make thing complicated,

29
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,440
leaving you no chance.

30
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:35,880
It's okay.

31
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:38,080
Just a curve.

32
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,279
I don't believe I cannot skate well.

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,639
You can do it.

34
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:44,000
Alright, you've been
running for so long.

35
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,800
You should eat something.

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,520
Let's go.

37
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,240
We'll go to the canteen
to eat popular ribs.

38
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,919
I'll do one more lap.

39
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:49,839
No.

40
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,800
Not before we eat.

41
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,520
Let's go.

42
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:52,800
Eat first.

43
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:54,639
It is hard to labor with an empty belly.

44
00:02:55,399 --> 00:02:56,759
Let's eat.

45
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,600
Quick! The ribs are almost sold out.

46
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,199
Is that so popular?

47
00:03:01,399 --> 00:03:03,199
This dish is very popular.

48
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,679
Well, you've had a hard day.

49
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,960
I'll line up.

50
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:09,839
And you...

51
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,279
take my bag

52
00:03:11,839 --> 00:03:12,679
and find a seat.

53
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:13,639
Just wait.

54
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,080
Be careful.

55
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:15,960
Okay.

56
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,399
The photo when you go to bed?

57
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,080
Delete the photo.

58
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,440
Did you hear me? You...

59
00:03:20,119 --> 00:03:20,880
Excuse me.

60
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:26,000
You again?

61
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,399
I want to ask you the same question.

62
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,520
You don't watch when you walk?

63
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:30,639
You ran like this,

64
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:31,960
what if you knock over someone's food

65
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,479
or crash someone?

66
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,510
(Personal profile of Shao Beisheng)

67
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,279
How can you…?

68
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:48,720
I thought

69
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,199
you were up to something.

70
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,360
It seems I was right.

71
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,839
What are you talking about? Crazy.

72
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:56,160
From now on,

73
00:03:57,119 --> 00:03:58,160
stay away from me.

74
00:03:59,399 --> 00:04:00,320
Thank you.

75
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:03,080
You stay away from me.

76
00:04:03,679 --> 00:04:05,199
Weirdo.

77
00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:08,440
What a surprise!

78
00:04:08,679 --> 00:04:09,679
Didn't you get it wrong?

79
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:10,960
I'm telling you,

80
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:12,240
I didn't get it wrong this time.

81
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:14,160
I didn't expect

82
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,399
she is such a person.

83
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,640
I know.

84
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:18,040
What?

85
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,679
Either you or she

86
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,959
must be

87
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,480
abnormal.

88
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,760
If one of us has to be abnormal,

89
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:25,880
she must be the one.

90
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:28,239
You're going to say I am
self-sentimental again?

91
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,440
I am not this time.

92
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,839
I have proof.

(Lingbei New Style column Weibo)

94
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,799
The proof that you said

95
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:38,399
is the Lingbei New Style column?

96
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,119
You know this column too?

97
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:40,959
Of course.

are under my control.

is summarized by the

of influential men in campus.

109
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,079
She always put you on top

110
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:58,959
since she opened the column.

111
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,359
She really likes you.

112
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,359
She is horrible.

113
00:05:07,119 --> 00:05:08,399
I need to stay away from her.

114
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,399
It is all your fault.

115
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,559
It's you people

116
00:05:11,559 --> 00:05:12,640
who spoil them.

117
00:05:13,559 --> 00:05:14,799
Calm down.

118
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,480
I think right now,

119
00:05:15,559 --> 00:05:16,239
you have to think about

120
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,359
how to improve your

121
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,160
curve techniques,

122
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,559
instead of pissing off about this.

123
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:24,079
It's even harder.

124
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,760
I thought it over.

125
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:28,440
It's useless

126
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:29,160
to imagine things alone.

127
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,119
I have to go to

128
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,079
professional training arena

129
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,600
to see how the professional coach

130
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,119
teaches on the spot.

131
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:36,679
But Wind Chaser

132
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,239
has been completely
confined for training.

133
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,119
What can I do?

134
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:41,920
You are right.

135
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,239
A regular skating rink

136
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:44,399
doesn't allow wearing
speed skating shoes.

137
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:45,440
Then, you can't get fast enough.

138
00:05:45,799 --> 00:05:47,160
A more professional skating rink

139
00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:48,679
has more strict management.

140
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:49,600
You can't get in.

141
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,359
Wait.

142
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,440
Do you remember

143
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,200
what the narcissist said the other day?

144
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,200
Wind Chaser is looking for a handyman.

145
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:03,839
That sounds like a joke.

146
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:04,760
And you can't

147
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:05,760
go work as a handyman

148
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,839
for getting into Wind Chaser.

149
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,760
That's lowering

150
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:08,839
your own bottom line.

151
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,160
You're superficial.

152
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:12,399
Do you know what a sweeping monk is?

153
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,480
Even if I'm just around

154
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,559
to learn skills secretly,

155
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,040
I can be the peerless master finally.

156
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,359
Then it will be easy to

157
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,600
settle the problem

160
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:32,799
I'm back again.

(Figure Skating, Shao Beisheng)

162
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,279
Shao Beisheng is so handsome.

163
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:40,000
He looks

164
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:41,519
handsome from every angle.

165
00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:43,760
How can you tell that from a photo?

166
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:46,119
Shao Beisheng, right?

167
00:06:46,679 --> 00:06:47,519
Sooner or later,

168
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,040
I'm going to impress you.

169
00:06:49,359 --> 00:06:49,920
Go sign up.

170

00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,679
you will conquer him.

172
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,839
You get into Wind Chaser

173
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:56,600
just to conquer me?

174
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,279
You wish!

Excuse me.

178
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,959
Hello, Sir. I'd like to apply for that

179
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,279
work-study position.

180
00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:13,200
Which teacher should we look for?

181
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,679
I'm the one.

182
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,000
Here, sir.

183
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,920
Our hiring notice

184
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:18,679
has been post for so long.

185
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,720
Finally, there's someone to apply.

186
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:22,040
But,

187
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,160
this position is very hard.

188
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,239
All physical work.

189
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:26,959
We're looking for a boy.

190
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:27,640
It's okay, sir.

191
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,959
You can treat me like a boy.

192
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,600
The same.

193
00:07:29,679 --> 00:07:31,079
Right. She's got abdominal muscle

194
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:31,839
and biceps.

195
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,160
Very, very hard-working.

196
00:07:33,239 --> 00:07:34,079
Alright.

197
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,760
No one signed up anyway.

198
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,760
I have no options.

199
00:07:37,119 --> 00:07:37,519
Yes.

200
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,040
So,

201
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,440
you get prepared tomorrow.

202
00:07:39,679 --> 00:07:40,200
Then…

203
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,079
Excuse me.

204
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,079
Sir.

205
00:07:42,359 --> 00:07:43,440
I also want to apply for this position.

206
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,640
What day is it today?

207
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,920
I can't believe someone would
scramble for this position.

208
00:07:46,559 --> 00:07:47,519
1.85m tall.

209
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,480
Wait, sir.

210
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:49,200
Well, we just

211
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,119
made a deal, right?

212
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,320
In fact, this student

213
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,160
has no chance.

214
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:53,519
I'm supposed to start
work tomorrow, right?

215
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,640
Is that so, Sir?

216
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:55,799
Well...

217
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,519
I still need to select a bit.

218
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,519
After all, we have to find someone

219
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:01,640
strong.

220
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,640
Well... Sir.

221
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:03,559
Please wait a sec.

222
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:05,320
We are good friends.

223
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,399
Let's go out and discuss about it.

224
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:07,519
Right, sir.

225
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,760
Wait, wait.

226
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,040
What for?

227
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:11,600
What?

228
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,119
Discuss what?

229
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,399
This student...

230
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,359
This

231
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:18,519
is a part-time job that's

232
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,839
not very lucrative to you.

233
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,559
Right.

234
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:21,720
But it's essential

235
00:08:21,799 --> 00:08:22,600
to me.

236
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:24,000
I know.

237
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,600
So...

238
00:08:24,679 --> 00:08:26,160
So, definitely no.

239
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,079
Come back.

240
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:31,760
Sir, so can I get ready

241
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:32,719
to work tomorrow?

242
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,000
Yes.

243
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,799
No, sir. I really think

244
00:08:35,119 --> 00:08:35,799
it is unfair.

245
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,559
First come,

246
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,359
first served. Right?

247
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,320
And I came first. Right?

248
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:39,880
But I...

249
00:08:40,239 --> 00:08:41,440
Well, student.

250
00:08:42,119 --> 00:08:42,599
Sorry.

251
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,919
Since this is a recruitment,

252
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,440
of course we will choose the better one.

253
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,760
And Qu

254
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,080
is surely more appropriate.

255
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:49,239
Sir. We two

256
00:08:49,359 --> 00:08:50,840
have no difference actually. See?

257
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,640
We still prefer a boy.

258
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,440
Qu,

259
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,679
since you're in,

260
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,080
you have to keep working
during this semester.

261
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,320
Rest assured, sir.

262
00:08:59,479 --> 00:09:00,440
I can make it to graduation.

263
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,719
Great!

264
00:09:02,599 --> 00:09:03,359
Great!

265
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,840
Horrible!

266
00:09:08,359 --> 00:09:08,919
I'm telling you.

267
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,119
The is the kind of boy

268
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,679
I hate most.

269
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,719
Single-fold eyelid, always grinning

270
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,440
and tricky.

271
00:09:15,719 --> 00:09:16,440
Qu Zhi.

272
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,559
How did it go? Did you get it?

273
00:09:19,479 --> 00:09:20,679
The study is so intense
in this semester.

274
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:22,039
I don't have time for a part-time job.

275
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,679
Aren't you the head of my fans club?

276
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,039
If you don't help me, who will?

277
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,359
The fans club is only responsible
for cheering you up.

278
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,359
I am not responsible for security, dear.

279
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:33,880
I'll buy you a game cosmetic.

280
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,440
Okay?

281
00:09:36,359 --> 00:09:37,640
There are lots of experiments recently.

282
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,719
I don't have much time

283
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:39,400
to play games.

284
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:41,960
I'll do it for you.

285
00:09:42,599 --> 00:09:44,719
And I'll review all night with you.

286
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,159
But doing part-time work will affect

287
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,359
my activities of Drama Club.

288
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,320
I'll play cameo roles. Okay?

289
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:54,799
Deal.

290
00:09:55,119 --> 00:09:55,799
No regret.

291
00:09:56,599 --> 00:09:57,359
Do you think I was you?

292
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,760
You regret every day.

293
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:00,479
See you're so nervous.

294
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:02,039
As soon as I signed up,

295
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,239
the teacher was impressed by

296
00:10:03,359 --> 00:10:04,960
my excellent appearance,

297
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,119
and selected me directly.

298
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,200
Why didn't you tell it earlier?

299
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,479
Are you fooling me around?

300
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,159
I knew it.

301
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,840
What happened?

302
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:15,799
It's none of my business.

303
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:18,000
I thought you were just being mean.

304
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:19,440
I didn't realize you were so dark.

305
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:20,919
What did I do to you?

306
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,159
Didn't I tell you

307
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:24,200
to stay away from me?

308
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:25,400
I will not.

309
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,760
Oh my.

310
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:35,119
What's going on here?

311
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:41,200
Anyway, you

312
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,039
have to explain to me.

313
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:43,799
It's you who have to explain.

314
00:10:44,239 --> 00:10:46,119
From the last race to Wind Chaser,

315
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:47,599
you racked your brains

316
00:10:47,719 --> 00:10:48,359
to get close to me.

317
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:49,119
Are you crazy?

318
00:10:49,359 --> 00:10:50,000
I am telling you.

319
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,119
Every step you take,

320
00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:52,320
I can see it as clearly as a crystal.

321
00:10:52,599 --> 00:10:53,640
You want me to notice you.

322
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,599
Don't even think about it.

323
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I told you directly.

324
00:10:57,119 --> 00:10:57,679
The reason why I apply for

325
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:58,159
the position

326
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,320
is that I want to be in the
Wind Chaser Short Track Team.

327
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,000
It's none of your business.

328
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,840
Pretty quick to find a reason.

329
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:05,239
The Lingbei New Style Column last time,

330
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,239
I saw it clearly.

331
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,799
Do not quibble.

332
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,359
So, you know

333
00:11:10,359 --> 00:11:11,880
my Lingbei New Style Column?

334
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,479
The column is made by you?

335
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:22,280
Right.

336
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,840
I didn't expect that one day

337
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,440
the column I opened on the forum

338
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,640
would be certified

339
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,520
by Shao Beisheng in person.

340
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,320
Please.

341
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,239
Sign for me.

342
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,880
You seem to get it wrong.

343
00:11:34,719 --> 00:11:35,559
I think so.

344
00:11:36,359 --> 00:11:37,119
Embarrassed?

345
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,559
Forget about the signature. Let's go.

346
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,080
I...

347
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,479
If you want to get in Wind Chaser
Short Track Team,

348
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,719
don't use such

349
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:52,840
sinuous approach.

350
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,760
The new chief coach hates

351
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:56,359
the opportunist like you the most.

352
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,559
How do you know?

353
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:58,640
Why do I tell you?

354
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,400
Anyway, rather than using this approach,

355
00:12:00,479 --> 00:12:01,640
you'd better just talk to her.

356
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,359
If you can get her recognition,

357
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,599
she'll admit you into the team.

358
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,359
Let's go.

359
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:07,080
I'm kind enough to remind you.

360
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,159
Believe it or not.

361
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,359
Why should I believe you?

362
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,760
I have been framed by you

363
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,760
all this semester.

364
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,359
Come on. You can take some exercise.

365
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:23,140
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team
of Lingbei University)

366
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,359
So Coach Xiao usually trains

367
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,719
Luo Xiaoyi alone in this way?

368
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:37,520
Didn't you hear it?

369
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,799
Luo Xiaoyi has

370
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,400
‍ one hour individual training time

371
00:12:39,479 --> 00:12:40,520
every day.

372
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:42,080
After all, she's the seeded player

373
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:43,200
who is most likely to win
the championship in Wind Chaser.

374
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,200
A seeded player

375
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,640
gets that kind of treatment?

376
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,960
Then, I have to work hard

377
00:12:49,359 --> 00:12:50,400
to become a seeded player.

378
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,440
- Hello, Coach Zhuang.
- Hello, Coach Zhuang.

379
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,280
Hello, Coach Zhuang.

380
00:12:53,599 --> 00:12:54,359
Hello, Coach Zhuang.

381
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,799
Coach.

382
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,159
Luo Xiaoyi

383
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,280
has been trained like this all the time?

384
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,440
Probably.

385
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,760
I heard it from someone else.

386
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,080
Talking during training.

387
00:13:11,479 --> 00:13:12,640
Penalty of ten sets of frog jumps.

388
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,440
Didn't you hear it?

389
00:13:16,719 --> 00:13:17,559
We heard it.

390
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,520
Jump!

391
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:27,640
Coach Xiao.

392
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,159
What's wrong, Coach Zhuang?

393
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,479
Today I saw

394
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:32,679
you gave Luo Xiaoyi extra training.

395
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,440
Right.

396
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,520
What's the problem?

397
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,840
What about the rest of the team?

398
00:13:37,719 --> 00:13:38,320
Coach Zhuang.

399
00:13:38,719 --> 00:13:39,440
Looks like you don't know

400
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:40,359
Wind Chaser quite a lot.

401
00:13:41,119 --> 00:13:42,200
Now no matter the Asian Cup

402
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,080
or Ling Yun Cup,

403
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:44,719
Luo Xiaoyi is the only one in the team

404
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,760
who has the hope
to win the championship.

405
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:47,719
I want to focus on

406
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,919
the key player.

407
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,119
I think I should do so.

408
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,799
As far as I know,

409
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,119
Luo Xiaoyi does have good records.

410
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,640
But the rest of the team
also has a good foundation

411
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,039
and room for improvement.

412
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,760
The reason why Director Zhang
invited me here

413
00:13:59,039 --> 00:13:59,719
is for increasing

414
00:14:00,119 --> 00:14:01,359
the whole performance of Wind Chaser,

415
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,200
instead of...

416
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,159
Go straight.

417
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,239
Do you have any problem with my

418
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,039
training plan?

419
00:14:06,599 --> 00:14:07,320
To be honest,

420
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:08,919
yes.

421
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:12,960
Coach Zhuang.

422
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,599
Although you have
just come to Wind Chaser,

423
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,719
I feel like I've been

424
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,919
supporting your work.

425
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,640
About the extra training for Luo Xiaoyi,

426
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,039
I have my own considerations.

427
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:21,400
First,

428
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,599
thank you for supporting my work.

429
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:25,039
Of course, I have no problems

430
00:14:25,119 --> 00:14:25,960
with you.

431
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,440
But, since the school has invited me,

432
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:30,159
I have to be responsible for

433
00:14:30,239 --> 00:14:31,320
all members of Wind Chaser.

434
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,520
Sorry, Coach Zhuang.

435
00:14:33,719 --> 00:14:34,799
All hopes of Wind Chaser
to win the championship

436
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,119
lie on Luo Xiaoyi alone.

437
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:38,000
I don't have to be the chief coach,

438
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:40,159
but I insist on the extra training

439
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,359
for Luo Xiaoyi.

440
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:44,239
I think either the school leader

441
00:14:44,359 --> 00:14:45,280
or Director Zhang

442
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,840
shall take the gold medal seriously.

443
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:47,760
Right?

444
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,239
I have something to do.
I have to go now.

445
00:15:14,359 --> 00:15:15,039
Beisheng.

446
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:15,960
Practicing the dance?

447
00:15:17,599 --> 00:15:18,359
You're back.

448
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,640
Can I talk to you for a minute?

449
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:24,640
Okay.

450
00:15:25,119 --> 00:15:26,239
What about the matter

451
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:27,919
I told you last time?

452
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,280
Liu Fei.

453
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,479
I really didn't even think about it.

454
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:35,479
I made that clear to you before.

455
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:37,280
I really think of you as my partner,

456
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,080
my friend.

457
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,760
I think this is a

458
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,960
pure feeling.

459
00:15:41,119 --> 00:15:42,280
It's not love.

460
00:15:42,599 --> 00:15:43,479
I know

461
00:15:44,119 --> 00:15:46,200
you're not used to 

462
00:15:46,599 --> 00:15:47,679
the change from partners to lovers.

463
00:15:48,599 --> 00:15:49,479
But I really hope

464
00:15:49,599 --> 00:15:50,880
you can think it over.

465
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,719
‍I'm willing to give you time.

466
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,200
Liu Fei.

467
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,440
Actually I have not told you that

468
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,320
I have a girlfriend.

469
00:16:01,599 --> 00:16:02,280
Shao Beisheng.

470
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,479
Don't I know you?

471
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,239
It's nice and sunny.

472
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:09,880
What's wrong?

473
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,479
Why did she

474
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,679
think that I like her?

475
00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:13,880
How do I know

476
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,919
her mind?

477
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,440
You cannot

478
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,200
reason things out with her. Right?

479
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,080
Then what should I do?

480
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,200
Talk about feelings?

481
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,400
Isn't that more troublesome?

482
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,479
I thought

483
00:16:23,599 --> 00:16:24,559
I found a good partner,

484
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:26,640
who would never talk about feelings,
which would affect the training.

485
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:28,679
How come she...

486
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,320
Do you remember

487
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,000
the one who cornered
you in the toilet door?

488
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,599
I took a lot of effort

489
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:36,479
to get rid of her.

490
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,239
Why don't you

491
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:38,960
give her a good scolding

492
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:39,760
like to the girl

493
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:40,919
who has been snapping pictures of you?

494
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,119
Be tough with her.

495
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:43,400
No, I can't do that.

496
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:44,559
We've been training together every day.

497
00:16:45,119 --> 00:16:46,640
We've been winning and
losing all these years.

498
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,440
How can I be tough with her?

499
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,400
Then how about

500
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,599
you just say yes?

501
00:16:58,239 --> 00:16:59,440
Are you crazy?

502
00:17:00,359 --> 00:17:01,159
Forget it. You cannot help me.

503
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:02,359
I can surely help you

504
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,520
with Roast Duck.

505
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:04,959
Six,

506
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,119
five,

507
00:17:06,719 --> 00:17:07,280
four,

508
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,640
three,

509
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:09,880
two,

510
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:10,839
one.

511
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,040
Oh my god.

512
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,680
I'm too tired.

513
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,040
My waist!

514
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,880
My old waist.

515
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,800
I didn't expect that

516
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:29,439
Coach Zhuang would

517
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,599
lead our team.

518
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:33,439
She's the coach of Eunkyung Choi.

519
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,800
Do you know who Eunkyung Choi is?

520
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,160
The girl who won
consecutive championships

521
00:17:39,439 --> 00:17:41,199
of Super League at her 17.

522
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,439
She is her coach.

523
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:45,439
And now she teaches in Wind Chaser.

524
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,520
I don't think she is so great.

525
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,839
But Coach Xiao

526
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,199
is going to be the chief coach.

527
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,760
She just stole the thunder of him.

528
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:57,079
Right.

529
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,680
She used to lead teams overseas.

530
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,520
I don't know.

531
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:07,880
Assemble.

532
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,160
Today, we'll talk about

533
00:18:31,239 --> 00:18:32,719
future training plan.

534
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,560
Will it be about extra training again?

535
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,319
That's too harsh.

536
00:18:38,439 --> 00:18:40,000
Zhou Luhan is absolutely right.

537
00:18:40,479 --> 00:18:41,479
From now on,

538
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,719
I will keep an eye on every one of you.

539
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,280
Zhou Luhan.

540
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,319
From this week, extra 20 minutes

541
00:18:48,719 --> 00:18:49,719
of endurance training.

542
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:51,959
Not for everyone.

543
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,160
Just for you.

544
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,439
Fine. Tell me

545
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,560
if you get tired

546
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,880
every time at the

547
00:18:58,439 --> 00:18:59,520
second half of the game.

548
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:00,839
But isn't it normal

549
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,839
to skate in a long distance?

550
00:19:02,479 --> 00:19:04,079
I read your physical report.

551
00:19:04,439 --> 00:19:05,640
You are in excellent health

552
00:19:05,719 --> 00:19:06,520
and have good skills.

553
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,359
But you have a weakness,

554
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,319
poor endurance.

555
00:19:08,479 --> 00:19:09,439
Every time you sprint,

556
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:10,839
you have no power to do so.

557
00:19:11,239 --> 00:19:12,839
So your training focus

558
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:14,119
is physical strength and endurance.

559
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:16,839
Am I clear?

560
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,560
Wang Fang.

561
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,520
From today on,

562
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,520
stop your 3000m training.

563
00:19:28,199 --> 00:19:29,199
Why?

564
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,560
Coach Zhuang,

565
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:35,439
may I ask why?

566
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:37,319
When Wind Chaser
recruits new members,

567
00:19:37,439 --> 00:19:38,119
you came in

568
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,640
second in the 500m test,

569
00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:40,439
right?

570
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,040
Before getting in Wind Chaser,

571
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,760
your strength is short distance,

572
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:46,040
right?

573
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:48,439
After getting in Wind Chaser,

574
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,760
to avoid Luo Xiaoyi's strength,

575
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:51,040
you chose long distance.

576
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,160
I don't think

577
00:19:52,239 --> 00:19:53,239
it is necessary to do so.

578
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,560
Your strength

579
00:19:54,719 --> 00:19:55,839
should be taken to the extreme.

580
00:19:56,239 --> 00:19:57,359
Understand?

581
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:02,079
Liu Sisi.

582
00:20:02,719 --> 00:20:03,439
Not bad.

583
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:05,520
Relatively even overall.

584
00:20:05,719 --> 00:20:06,359
But

585
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,959
there is a problem with the start.

586
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,800
Coach,

587
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,160
I've had enough start training,

588
00:20:10,239 --> 00:20:11,239
I don't think I should have more.

589
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:13,000
The problem is that

590
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:13,719
you've had too much start training.

591
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,719
You should train less.

592
00:20:15,719 --> 00:20:17,160
I've seen your video profile.

593
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,880
You think too much when you start.

594
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:20,640
You are under too much stress.

595
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,520
I'll figure out

596
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,640
your problem later.

597
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:23,800
It's easy.

598
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:25,800
Today, I want to talk about

599
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:27,520
Zhu Lele.

600
00:20:28,439 --> 00:20:29,640
I want to ask Zhu Lele,

601
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,000
what's your purpose to

602
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:33,000
join Wind Chaser?

603
00:20:36,439 --> 00:20:37,719
What do you mean, Coach Zhuang?

604
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:39,160
I mean,

605
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,880
you are an athlete.

606
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,000
Can you train with your head on?

607
00:20:43,239 --> 00:20:45,079
Can you be wholehearted?

608
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,520
Yes.

609
00:20:48,239 --> 00:20:49,160
One more thing.

610
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:50,800
10 seconds for

611
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,079
future assemble.

612
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:54,599
Today,

613
00:20:55,719 --> 00:20:56,520
you took 29 seconds.

614
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:58,160
So in punishment,

615
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,000
run 19 laps after land training.

616
00:21:00,239 --> 00:21:00,880
Nine…

617
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:01,880
Okay.

618
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:03,800
That's all for today's training.

619
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:04,839
Dismiss.

620
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,800
Penalty of physical
strength and running.

621
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,800
Oh god.

622
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:17,079
She deserves to be
Eunkyung Choi's coach.

623
00:21:17,439 --> 00:21:18,800
Just for two days,

624
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,239
she turned us upside down.

625
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,800
The good times are over.

626
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,160
I don't want to run.

627
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,560
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team
of Lingbei University)

628
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,280
How is it going?

629
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,760
You have been here for two days.

630
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:32,160
How do you think?

631
00:21:34,439 --> 00:21:35,680
I found some problems.

632
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,680
What do you want to know?

633
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:41,680
Of course, I want to know

634
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,800
the most critical problem.

635
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,800
It seems the problem

636
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,800
is on Luo Xiaoyi.

637
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,319
But actually it's

638
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:50,599
on Coach Xiao.

639
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:53,520
I don't think Coach Xiao

640
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,199
is like the coach of Wind Chaser.

641
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:56,800
He is more like Luo Xiaoyi's
personal trainer.

642
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,880
You saw it.

643
00:22:00,439 --> 00:22:01,199
You know,

644
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,760
if one team wants to be strong,

645
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,079
it's impossible to rely on one person.

646
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:05,760
About this,

647
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,359
I've talked to Coach Xiao.

648
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:08,920
But he

649
00:22:09,479 --> 00:22:11,760
doesn't seem to change.

650
00:22:12,479 --> 00:22:13,439
You're right.

651
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,719
Wind Chaser

652
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:16,560
cannot go on like this.

653
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:19,959
It is an established team.

654
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,680
Ever since I took it over,

655
00:22:22,959 --> 00:22:24,719
it's getting worse every year.

656
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,439
It's at the bottom for
the last three years.

657
00:22:30,719 --> 00:22:31,839
I tell you the truth.

658
00:22:32,199 --> 00:22:33,000
Do you know why

659
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,199
your contract of employment

660
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,439
is only for one year?

661
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,560
That's because this season next year,

662
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,040
if we cannot win three medals

663
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,760
on the A class tournament,

664
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,599
Wind Chaser Short Track Team
will be disbanded.

665
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,040
We have only one year.

666
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,479
There has to be something new.

667
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,839
So, I invited you to

668
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:55,280
make bold changes.

669
00:22:55,719 --> 00:22:56,719
Rest assured.

670
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,719
I will fully support you.

671
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,160
Coach Xiao

672
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,439
is very excellent.

673
00:23:02,719 --> 00:23:03,319
Without him,

674
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,439
Wind Chaser

675
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,880
will not be like this today.

676
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:09,479
So, I hope you can

677
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,000
cooperate and understand each other.

678
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,119
Because everyone

679
00:23:13,199 --> 00:23:14,479
is for Wind Chaser.

680
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,760
You rest assured.

681
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:20,400
Thank you very much

682
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:22,000
for accepting me and inviting me

683
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,160
to be the chief coach

684
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,160
when others don't.

685
00:23:26,199 --> 00:23:27,760
‍I will not fail you.

686
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,880
Not at all.

687
00:23:32,199 --> 00:23:32,920
By the way,

688
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,079
did you talk to your son?

689
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,560
Don't worry.

690
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,800
After all, it has been so many years.

691
00:23:42,479 --> 00:23:44,239
Just give some adjustment
time to your kid.

692
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,760
Rest assured.

693
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,640
I will take care of my personal affairs.

694
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,199
It will not affect my work.

695
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,439
I know.

696
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,199
You're still watching

697
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,359
the race of Eunkyung Choi.

698
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,079
You've seen this like hundreds times.

699
00:24:10,239 --> 00:24:11,160
Her curve techniques,

700
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,199
why did she do it so smoothly?

701
00:24:12,239 --> 00:24:13,520
Why can't I?

702
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,439
You can't say so.

703
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,959
We still have the speed advantage.

704
00:24:18,199 --> 00:24:18,880
Right?

705
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,920
If I keep my

706
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,079
speed advantage

707
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:23,880
and get my curve
techniques right,

708
00:24:24,239 --> 00:24:25,479
will I get better than her?

709
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:26,760
Honey.

710
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,439
I think what we should think now is

711
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:29,479
not getting better than Eunkyung Choi,

712
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,079
but getting into Wind Chaser.

713
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,640
Coach Zhuang said I am a bomb.

714
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,079
Why is

715
00:24:38,199 --> 00:24:39,640
she the chief coach of Wind Chaser?

716
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:42,479
Did Coach Xiao

717
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:43,599
say to fight for you?

718
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,880
Then I have to practice myself.

719
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,199
I can't embarrass him.

720
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,640
But how

721
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,680
can I practice it well?

722
00:24:49,479 --> 00:24:50,920
I tried to sneak into the skating rink.

723
00:24:50,959 --> 00:24:52,640
But the plan was ruined.

724
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:57,359
That narcissist Shao Beisheng

725
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,040
was right.

726
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,959
I can't just keep putting

727
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:02,359
hope on others.

728
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,920
‍I'll go straight to Zhuang Yue,

729
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:06,359
and tell her I want to be in the team

730
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:07,359
to learn curve techniques.

731
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,479
As long as she agrees,

732
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,160
I'll say yes to anything.

733
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,479
Are you crazy?

734
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,359
Coach Zhuang is that typical person

735
00:25:15,439 --> 00:25:16,359
who is so stubborn.

736
00:25:16,479 --> 00:25:17,079
If you directly go for her,

737
00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:17,920
you're sure to get yelled at.

738
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,479
Think about it.

739
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,199
If I want to be in Wind Chaser,

740
00:25:21,439 --> 00:25:22,959
I have to convince her anyway.

741
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:24,479
I might as well go directly to her.

742
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,920
Don't worry.

743
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:27,359
You just wait for me in the team.

744
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,479
Trust me.

745
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,199
I'll be in Wind Chaser for sure.

746
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,479
Picking a partner for you

747
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,640
is more difficult than
matchmaking for you.

748
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,439
Just look.

749
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,760
As soon as I get this news out,

750
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,160
my phone cannot last for half a day.

751
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:41,920
All recommendations.

752
00:25:42,199 --> 00:25:42,959
You should check

753
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:43,640
if there is anyone suitable.

754
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,599
But there are few

755
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,479
Pairs Skating players

756
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:46,599
with high techniques.

757
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,239
And they have their regular partners.

758
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:49,560
It is really difficult to choose

759
00:25:49,719 --> 00:25:51,520
from this list.

760
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:52,880
Beisheng, I'm telling you.

761
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:54,439
Don't be so picky.

762
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:55,959
Pick a partner first,

763
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,880
and build the rapport after then.

764
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,880
If you can't pick the right partner,

765
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,199
you will be absent

766
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:01,119
in the next few games.

767
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,000
Every game counts in your record.

768
00:26:03,719 --> 00:26:04,319
If you missed a few games,

769
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:05,719
your rank will be down quickly.

770
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,719
Even you are still Prince Sheng,

771
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,439
it won't work anymore.

772
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,280
I understand.

773
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,640
But Ma,

774
00:26:09,719 --> 00:26:10,959
if we just pick a partner at random,

775
00:26:11,199 --> 00:26:12,439
and take part in all the games,

776
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,199
isn't it bad that we
have bad performance?

777
00:26:16,439 --> 00:26:17,520
So what do you suggest?

778
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,640
Double Axel.

779
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:20,760
In these people,

780
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,640
I'll pick the one

781
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,640
who can do Double Axel.

782
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:26,560
You'd better skate alone.

783
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,920
Don't bother to find the partner.

784
00:26:28,199 --> 00:26:28,880
There are few players

785
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:29,880
who can do Double Axel.

786
00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:30,839
Don't be kidding.

787
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,640
I'm serious.

788
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,760
Anyway, I have this requirement

789
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:33,760
to the one to be my partner.

790
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,560
In addition to capability,

791
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,199
I don't care anything else. Okay?

792
00:26:36,959 --> 00:26:37,880
I am leaving.

793
00:26:38,439 --> 00:26:39,560
I'm counting on you.

794
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:42,880
Alright. You just passed the buck to me.

795
00:26:45,719 --> 00:26:46,760
What a hands-off boss.

796
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,079
There are two training sessions
added in the afternoon.

797
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:50,839
Yes?

798
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,280
But you've been training for so long.

799
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:53,239
You would be okay.

800
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:54,040
You're not bad, too.

801
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:55,079
That's all right.

802
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:55,839
Anyway, we've already been

803
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,959
training for so long.

804
00:26:59,040 --> 00:26:59,920
- Hello, Coach Zhuang.
- Hello, Coach Zhuang.

805
00:27:00,479 --> 00:27:01,280
- Move.
- Move.

806
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:02,719
Hello, Coach Zhuang.

807
00:27:02,959 --> 00:27:03,640
My name is Shen Zhengyi.

808
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:05,479
I don't know if you remember me.

809
00:27:05,719 --> 00:27:06,479
What's up?

810
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:09,160
It's about getting in the team.

811
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:11,599
I hope you to reconsider it.

812
00:27:11,719 --> 00:27:12,160
Didn't I make it

813
00:27:12,239 --> 00:27:13,160
clear?

814
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,160
I know I now

815
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,479
don't know the curve techniques.

816
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:16,359
But I can practice.

817
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,479
If I get it right,

818
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:18,520
could you let me join your team?

819
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:19,479
You should talk

820
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:20,400
to your coach.

821
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,280
There are too many problems

822
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,800
with your technical moves.

823
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:24,160
You cannot do it if you
keep practicing like this.

824
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,280
I have been practicing by myself.

825
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:27,359
I don't have a coach.

826
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,800
By yourself?

827
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:31,839
For how long?

828
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:34,959
More than ten years.

829
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,280
To be honest,

830
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,719
I admire your perseverance,

831
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:40,239
but I really don't have time

832
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:42,160
to train an amateur.

833
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:42,800
Sorry.

834
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:43,599
Coach Zhuang.

835
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:44,640
Just one chance.

836
00:27:44,959 --> 00:27:46,040
Please. Just one chance.

837
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:47,839
Just give me one chance.

838
00:27:48,479 --> 00:27:49,400
I, Shen Zhengyi, will show you

839
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,520
a miracle for sure.

840
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:55,599
One week.

841
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,719
Show me your miracle

842
00:27:57,839 --> 00:27:58,839
in one week.

843
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,239
Thank you, Coach Zhuang.

844
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,400
Thank you, Coach Zhuang.

845
00:28:14,719 --> 00:28:15,959
Beisheng.

846
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,800
What's wrong, Coach Zhuang?

847
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,680
What are you sighing for?

848
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,560
Nothing.

849
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:40,680
What's wrong?
What are you worrying about?

850
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,359
Don't mention it.

851
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:44,319
Your baby son.

852
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,880
My hair is falling out

853
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:47,319
just for picking a partner for him.

854
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,119
I heard that there are some people

855
00:28:50,239 --> 00:28:51,439
with good abilities in the list?

856
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,119
Do you know

857
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,119
what requirement

858
00:28:54,239 --> 00:28:55,199
your son asks for?

859
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:58,119
He wants a partner
who can do Double Axel.

860
00:28:58,359 --> 00:28:59,880
Isn't it too difficult?

861
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:03,680
This kid has been strict to himself

862
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,880
since he was little,

863
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:06,800
even to his partner.

864
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,319
It's quite good.

865
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:09,319
Set a high standard

866
00:29:09,439 --> 00:29:10,880
and show a good performance.
Shouldn't you be happy about that?

867
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,560
You two are really from one family,

868
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,199
saying the same words.

869
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,560
Did you talk to him

870
00:29:20,199 --> 00:29:21,760
this time?

871
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,439
No.

872
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,199
He seems to be avoiding me.

873
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,920
It's not his fault.

874
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,560
After all, in these years,

875
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,880
I have not taken good care of him.

876
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,439
It's normal.

877
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:38,439
After all, you were abroad.

878
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,680
And he doesn't

879
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,000
want to intrude his dad.

880
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,479
It's normal.

881
00:29:46,239 --> 00:29:47,359
Thanks to you, Ma.

882
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,479
You told me a lot about him.

883
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,640
Anyway, this time

884
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,119
I'm not leaving.

885
00:29:53,439 --> 00:29:54,640
There will be plenty of opportunities.

886
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,680
Take it slow.

887
00:29:56,239 --> 00:29:56,880
Right.

888
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,439
Take it slow.

889
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,119
I'll take my time to find him a partner.

890
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,319
Work harder.

891
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,560
Coach Xiao.

892
00:30:17,239 --> 00:30:17,880
- Coach Xiao.
- Zhengyi.

893
00:30:18,439 --> 00:30:19,680
I just went to see Coach Zhuang.

894
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:21,239
She said to give me one week.

895
00:30:21,439 --> 00:30:22,119
If I can get my curve technique

896
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:22,800
right,

897
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,000
she'll give me one more chance.

898
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:24,680
Really?

899
00:30:25,439 --> 00:30:26,199
You are so persevering.

900
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:27,199
I believe you can do it.

901
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:28,880
Thank you.

902
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:29,800
Coach Xiao.

903
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,000
But about the curve techniques,

904
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:32,439
I just have a few more questions.

905
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,680
Okay, let's talk along the way.

906
00:30:34,439 --> 00:30:35,239
Okay.

907
00:30:36,239 --> 00:30:37,680
Right, just...

908
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:49,920
Xiao Bao.

909
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,239
Xiao Bao. Are you okay? Does it hurt?

910
00:30:52,479 --> 00:30:53,160
No.

911
00:30:53,959 --> 00:30:54,640
Let me see.

912
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,800
Beisheng.

913
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,680
Get up on your own.

914
00:31:06,199 --> 00:31:07,319
I don't want to skate anymore.

915
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:10,880
Beisheng.

916
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,000
You chose this item yourself.

917
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:13,800
The process of practice

918
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,800
is just hard and tiring.

919
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:16,359
There are many falls to come.

920
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,680
So tell me.

921
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
You want to keep practicing,

922
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:20,560
or stop practicing since you are afraid.

923
00:31:21,199 --> 00:31:22,199
I'm not afraid.

924
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,319
Great!

925
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,560
Get up on your own.

926
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:31,800
You even shed tears.

927
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:32,800
Alright.

928
00:31:33,439 --> 00:31:34,119
Continue.

929
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,640
Actually, I'm a little worried, too.

930
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,000
I don't know if I can

931
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:41,680
meet the requirement

932
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,880
of Coach Zhuang in one week.

933
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,560
I have some notes on

934
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,560
practicing technical moves.

935
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:47,000
You can have a look.

936
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,119
Ask me if you have any questions.

937
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,760
Okay. Thank you, Coach Xiao.

938
00:31:51,959 --> 00:31:52,760
Xiao Bao.

939
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,479
Xiao Bao. Xiao Bao fell in the water.

940
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,400
Anyone?

941
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,280
Somebody helps him!

942
00:31:57,719 --> 00:31:58,359
Zhengyi.

943
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:01,839
Xiao Bao. Shen Zhengyi.

944
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:07,599
Anyone?

945
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,800
Come help!

946
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,040
Xiaofeng.

947
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:28,239
Come out. Stop joking, Xiaofeng.

948
00:32:34,479 --> 00:32:35,719
Xiaofeng.

949
00:32:40,439 --> 00:32:41,439
What can I do?

950
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,239
Xiao Bao. Xiao Bao.

951
00:32:51,239 --> 00:32:52,079
Xiao Bao.

952
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,760
Xiao Bao.

953
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,599
Xiao Bao.

954
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,400
Xiao Bao.

955
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,920
Shen Zhengyi.

956
00:34:01,959 --> 00:34:02,959
Grab me.

957
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:06,760
Xiao Bao, are you okay?

958
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,040
Let me check.

959
00:34:08,919 --> 00:34:09,760
Zhengyi, Zhengyi.

960
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,879
Shen Zhengyi, Zhengyi.

961
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:12,360
I'll do it.

962
00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:40,879
She's awake.

963
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,320
Great!

964
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,520
Zhengyi, Zhengyi.

965
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,600
Are you okay?

966
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:57,719
Are you okay?

967
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,239
Xiao Bao. You scared me.

968
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,239
Let me get you to the hospital.

969
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:02,639
Be careful. Okay?

970
00:35:03,399 --> 00:35:04,399
Be careful.

971
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,560
It's too dangerous.

972
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,760
I know.

973
00:35:24,919 --> 00:35:25,560
Oh my god.

974
00:35:25,919 --> 00:35:27,080
Why are you coughing so badly?

975
00:35:27,439 --> 00:35:28,040
Let me see.

976
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:30,560
Oh my god.

977
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:31,679
You have a fever.

978
00:35:32,439 --> 00:35:33,199
No.

979
00:35:33,399 --> 00:35:33,919
Yes.

980
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:35,280
You were supposed to
stay in the infirmary

981
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:36,080
longer.

982
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,439
Why are you back in such a hurry?

983
00:35:37,919 --> 00:35:38,399
Nothing.

984
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,080
I just caught a cold in the water.

985
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:42,520
I'll be fine after getting some sleep.

986
00:35:47,439 --> 00:35:48,199
This man you drew

987
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:50,280
is Coach Xiao, right?

988
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,439
The hero saved a beauty.

989
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,439
Did he give you artificial respiration?

990
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,159
No.

991
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:02,080
How many times have I told you?

992
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:03,320
No!

993
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:04,919
No is no.

994
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,679
Why are you acting so intensely?

995
00:36:06,919 --> 00:36:07,560
Are you...?

996
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:09,520
Coach Xiao is my icon.

997
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:10,560
I'm telling you.

998
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,320
If you say so again,

999
00:36:11,439 --> 00:36:12,040
I'll...

1000
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:14,199
Alright.

1001
00:36:14,919 --> 00:36:15,840
I think

1002
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:16,800
you should go to the infirmary

1003
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,520
to have a check.

1004
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,560
You might infect me

1005
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,679
if you get worse later.

1006
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:21,679
Take my advice.

1007
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:31,399
Thank you.

1008
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:33,520
In such a cold day,

1009
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:35,040
you jumped into a lake to save others?

1010
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,520
You must be kidding me again.

1011
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,280
Ask Shen Zhengyi if
you don't believe me.

1012
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,679
Why her again?

1013
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:42,399
You tell me if she's stupid.

1014
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,199
She can't swim well,

1015
00:36:44,399 --> 00:36:45,399
but had to save others.

1016
00:36:45,959 --> 00:36:46,479
After saving the person,

1017
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,760
she sank.

1018
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,280
Isn't this kind of suicidal
righteous behavior

1019
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,399
stupid?

1020
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,000
So dangerous?

1021
00:36:53,439 --> 00:36:54,679
Then how did you save her?

1022
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:55,719
Me?

1023
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,120
Talk to me. How did you save her?

1024
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,360
What else?

1025
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,199
Just get her out of the lake.

1026
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:08,600
Bro.

1027
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,719
I'm begging you.

1028
00:37:09,879 --> 00:37:11,120
Please go to the infirmary
and get some medicine.

1029
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:11,959
I don't want the droplets and bacteria

1030
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,639
that you exhale all over the dorm.

1031
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,600
No way.

1032
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,280
A tough guy never takes
medicine for a cold.

1033
00:37:20,879 --> 00:37:21,600
Go to sleep.

1034
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,639
Beisheng.

1035
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,199
Beisheng.

1036
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,959
We have

1037
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,120
such a big misunderstanding before.

1038
00:38:04,479 --> 00:38:05,719
I didn't expect that

1039
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,959
you would save me

1040
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:09,879
without hesitation.

1041
00:38:10,959 --> 00:38:12,360
Now I really don't know.

1042
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:15,639
I really don't know

1043
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,360
how to thank you.

1044
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:19,280
Nothing.

1045
00:38:19,879 --> 00:38:21,600
I just did what I have to do.

1046
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,600
Actually...

1047
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,600
Hello...

1048
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:33,879
Is Dr. Liu back yet?

1049
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,199
Dr. Liu has gone to pick up medicine.

1050
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,000
He has not come back yet.

1051
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:37,080
Please wait over there.

1052
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:37,879
Okay.

1053
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:55,840
Well...

1054
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:57,120
Has Jun come back?

1055
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,000
Not yet.

1056
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,600
What a coincidence.

1057
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,239
So unlucky.

1058
00:39:22,879 --> 00:39:23,719
What?

1059
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,760
What's your attitude?

1060
00:39:27,879 --> 00:39:28,600
Forget it.

1061
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:29,760
Considering

1062
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,120
you saved others,

1063
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,399
I don't mind it.

1064
00:39:37,879 --> 00:39:39,000
You know about it?

1065
00:39:39,399 --> 00:39:40,360
It travels so fast.

1066
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:41,760
Right.

1067
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,639
A pretty and kind girl,

1068
00:39:43,919 --> 00:39:45,560
who dares to do
the righteous thing like me,

1069
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,120
is rare after all.

1070
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,360
Do I need to award you?

1071
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,239
Not necessarily.

1072
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,520
Actually, if I think about it,

1073
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,600
it's quite embarrassing.

1074
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,840
If Coach Xiao Han hadn't saved me,

1075
00:40:01,479 --> 00:40:03,360
I would be dead.

1076
00:40:03,479 --> 00:40:04,360
What did you say?

1077
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:07,600
Things are very tortuous indeed.

1078
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,399
Well,

1079
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,000
the child did come to the rescue.

1080
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:10,959
But I

1081
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:11,959
got a cramp in my foot.

1082
00:40:12,399 --> 00:40:13,360
Thanks to Coach Xiao.

1083
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,199
He saved me

1084
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,479
without hesitation.

1085
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,719
Or, I'm telling you,

1086
00:40:16,879 --> 00:40:17,520
you can't even see

1087
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,520
me, such a pretty and lovely girl today.

1088
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:19,239
Wait.

1089
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,520
What makes you think

1090
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,959
that Xiao Han saved you?

1091
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,479
I...

1092
00:40:34,399 --> 00:40:36,120
You what?

1093
00:40:36,479 --> 00:40:37,120
I see it with my eyes.

1094
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:38,199
My left eye and right eye.

1095
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,320
As soon as I opened my eyes, I saw
the soft, gentle and handsome face

1096
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,439
of Coach Xiao Han.

1097
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,600
There aren't many

1098
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:46,360
such perfect people left.

1099
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,479
You should learn from him.

1100
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:51,600
Here.

1101
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:52,560
Here you are.

1102
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:53,479
Thank you.

1103
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,159
Thank you, Jun.

1104
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,679
Wear a mask if you have a cold.

1105
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,900
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team
of Lingbei University)

1106
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,360
The shape and posture
are also very ordinary.

1107
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,399
Just so so.

1108
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:39,959
Quite good.

1109
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,800
But the technical difficulty is too low.

1110
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,479
Skating habits are also bad.

1111
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,600
This girl won the national championship

1112
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:04,719
for single.

1113
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:05,959
She's quite an all-rounder.

1114
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,199
That's a good double jump.

1115
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,840
So stable. See?

1116
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,239
Thank you.

1117
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
What do you say? Is she good?

1118
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,199
She skates well.

1119
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:55,479
But she's too focused on techniques,

1120
00:42:56,479 --> 00:42:57,479
with no soul.

1121
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,199
You are

1122
00:42:58,239 --> 00:42:59,199
picking holes.

1123
00:43:00,439 --> 00:43:01,239
Last one, right?

1124
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:02,719
I'll leave now.

1125
00:43:02,959 --> 00:43:03,600
Wait.

1126
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,719
Just wait a moment.

1127
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:05,479
There's one more.

1128
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:06,959
You would be satisfied with this one.

1129
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:07,600
The Ace.

1130
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:08,320
Just wait.

1131
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,479
Calm down.

1132
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:22,800
Isn't that Xiao Qing?

1133
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:24,080
Why is she here?

1134
00:43:24,199 --> 00:43:24,639
It's really her.

1135
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:25,600
She has collected so many

1136
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:26,959
gold medals abroad.

1137
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,199
Why did she come back to China?

1138

Pairs Skating Championship)

Coach Ma.

1140
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,439
Sorry, I just arrived.

1141
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:34,199
It's alright.
