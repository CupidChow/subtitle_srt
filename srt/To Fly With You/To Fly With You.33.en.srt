3
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,239
Luo Xiaoyi.

4
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,559
Xiaoyi.

5
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,080
If I cooperate with Zhengyi,

6
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,080
will our odds of winning

7
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,680
be increased?

8
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:03,919
I'll put all of resources

9
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,519
on you.

10
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,440
I will let Yu Bingling

11
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:07,440
assist you.

12
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,479
Thank you for your kindness.

13
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,759
But I think Flyer is not

14
00:02:13,839 --> 00:02:15,440
so suitable for me.

15
00:02:32,839 --> 00:02:33,679
Coach Zhuang,

16
00:02:34,399 --> 00:02:35,240
Coach Xiao,

17
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:38,679
is it too late to get back to the team?

18
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,800
As long as we can defeat Eunkyung Choi,

19
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,119
I am willing to

20
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,399
accept all tactical arrangements.

21
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:10,399
Luo Xiaoyi.

22
00:03:12,119 --> 00:03:12,919
Welcome back!

23
00:03:14,119 --> 00:03:15,559
- Xiaoyi.
- Xiaoyi.

24
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:17,559
Thank you, Coach Zhuang.

25
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,119
Everything is exactly what you wanted,

26
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:54,279
so don't hold me back.

27
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,600
Thank you for coming back.

28
00:04:04,279 --> 00:04:05,559
Let's work together.

29
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:11,479
Welcome back!

30
00:04:20,119 --> 00:04:22,399
- Wind Chaser, sure win!
- Wind Chaser, sure win!

31
00:04:29,679 --> 00:04:30,399
Shen Zhengyi,

32
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,119
we have always thought that we compete

33
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,119
with the opponents in the contests,

34
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:34,119
but it's actually not.

35
00:04:34,559 --> 00:04:35,559
The one we need to compete with

36
00:04:35,679 --> 00:04:36,399
is ourselves.

37
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,920
Every time we just

38
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,839
hold on for a while,

39
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,000
maybe we will achieve different ends.

40
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:43,119
The closer we get to the finish line,

41
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:44,760
we should speed up,

42
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,679
and push off the ice more frequently.

43
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,399
When you're exhausted,

44
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,559
as long as you don't give up
every small step,

45
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,279
maybe you will be the one

46
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,480
who crosses the finish line first.

47
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,119
Work harder,

48
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,679
and always hold on!

49
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,679
Fighting!

50
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,119
Fighting!

51
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:01,480
Get out of the curve,
and raise your legs.

52
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,480
9 sec.

53
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,920
Nice!

54
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,760

55
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,920

- Fighting, Wind Chaser!

85
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You skated well just now.

86
00:07:25,559 --> 00:07:26,559
Tomorrow,

87
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,119
you're going to set out

88
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,119
for the competition.

89
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,600
As a temporary coach,

90
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,399
I will finish my work

91
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,600
by now.

92
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,160
Teacher Wang Meng, rest assured.

93
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,320
We'll try our best.

94
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,320
I believe you.

95
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,600
Before I leave,

96
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:42,760
I still have a few words

97
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,839
for you.

98
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,000
In this world,

99
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,320
some people rely on talent,

100
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:48,160
and some people rely on hard work,

101
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:50,440
but some people
with extraordinary talents

102
00:07:50,559 --> 00:07:51,440
still work very hard.

103
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,920
Eunkyung Choi is that kind of player.

104
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,040
I have seen her skating.

105
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,279
Her power

106
00:07:57,559 --> 00:07:58,880
and instant reaction

107
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,160
in the contests

108
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:00,880
are all excellent.

109
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,200
When faced with an opponent like this,

110
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:03,600
what should you do?

111
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:08,720
There is little chance of

112
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,440
defeating her alone,

113
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,720
unless she makes a mistake.

114
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,160
So we shall have

115
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:14,320
the technical and
tactical cooperation.

116
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,440
Right.

117
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,040
I think that's the point

118
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,000
you all know better than I do.

119
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,320
Coach Zhuang

120
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,279
taught Eunkyung Choi before,

121
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,399
and she knows about her well.

122
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,440
All techniques and tactics

123
00:08:22,559 --> 00:08:23,480
for this competition

124
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,399
have been developed

125
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,880
around her weaknesses.

126
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,040
Then here

127
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:27,920
I don't have to

128
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,880
place great emphasis on it,

129
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,839
but there's one thing.

130
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,440
Everything could happen

131
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,320
in the contests,

132
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,880
you have only one way

133
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,000
to face the accidental situation.

134
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:38,880
Believe in yourself.

135
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,880
Believe in your teammates.

136
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,080

00:10:53,359 --> 00:10:54,760
(Now the one who is leading)

175
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,320
(is Bai Yunmei of Xingchen,)

176
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,880
(while Eunkyung Choi)

177
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,760
(is at the end of the line.)

178
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,000
(Eunkyung Choi is very relaxed.)

179
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,440
(Right, she's so relaxed.)

180
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:03,080
(We can see)

181
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:04,320
(Eunkyung Choi keeping
her hands behind her back,)

182
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,359
(and staying at the end of the line.)

183
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,640
(It seems that she's certain)

184
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,440
(to win in this contest.)

185
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:09,200
(Right.)

186
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,559
(Here we come to the last two laps,)

187
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:11,880
(and we see)

188
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,880
(something has changed on the rink.)

189
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,080
(Right now the first one)

190
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,520
(is still Bai Yunmei.)

191
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:17,320
(Zhang Ying who was in fourth place)

192
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,760
(is now in second place.)

193
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,760
(Right, the players)

194
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,880
(are now all sprinting now.)

195
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,559
(And Eunkyung Choi)

196
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:22,640
(is still)

197
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,359
(in the same state,)

198
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:24,799
(gliding slowly and calmly.)

199
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,679
(Those who)

200
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:26,760
(know about Eunkyung Choi
would know that)

201
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:28,559
(she likes to sprint
in the latter stage.)

202
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:29,320
(Right?)

203
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,000
(But there are only two laps left,)

204
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,359
(and she is still so relaxed and calm.)

205
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:32,880
(I have to say)

206
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,559
(Eunkyung Choi has very good)

207
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,760
(psychological quality.)

208
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,239
(Right.)

209
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,000
There are two laps left,

210
00:11:37,119 --> 00:11:38,000
and she still doesn't speed up.

211
00:11:38,119 --> 00:11:38,760
Can she make it?

212
00:11:39,119 --> 00:11:39,640
She's not going to

213
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,000
consume her power at semi-final.

214
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,200
(The last lap.)

215
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,559
(Eunkyung Choi began to speed up.)

216
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,200
(She transcended two players in one go.)

217
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:49,679
(She transcended another one.)

218
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,080
(But she still keeps her hands
behind her back.)

219
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:52,679
(I think she doesn't
skate with all strength.)

220
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,960
(She transcended four players in a row.)

221
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,960
(There's one left.)

222
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,239
(She is getting closer
to the finish line.)

223
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,320
(She transcended the skater
in front of her!)

224
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,000
(2 min 34 sec.)

225
00:12:10,119 --> 00:12:10,960
(First in the group.)

226
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:12,119
(There's no obvious
movement of her arms)

227
00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:13,960
(all the way.)

228
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:14,760
(It was...)

229
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,440
(It was a crushing victory.)

230
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:17,359
(All I can say is that)

231
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,000
(her strength is so strong.)

232
00:12:19,119 --> 00:12:19,520
(Exactly.)

233
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:20,440
(We also look forward to)

234
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:21,520
(Eunkyung Choi's better performance)

235
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:23,440
(in final.)

236
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:25,559
There is a gap in strength
between players

237
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,880
in this group and Eunkyung Choi.

238
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,880
Don't be influenced by it.

239
00:12:28,239 --> 00:12:29,520
Those two teams in A and B Groups

240
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:30,239
have advanced respectively.

241
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:30,760
You two have to advance

242
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:31,760
in C Group simultaneously

243
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,760
to compete with them.

244
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,239
If you two want to
advance simultaneously,

245
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:35,440
you must keep steady,

246
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:36,200
and pay attention to work together.

247
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:38,000
And be careful to
their converging attack.

248
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,359
You two have cooperated

249
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:41,000
perfectly in the training.

250
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:41,960
Just focus on one thing.

251
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,640
Watch your pace and take your time.

252
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,520
Alright, get ready for the contest.

253
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:51,880
Later in the contest,

254
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,719
don't be nervous and be confident.

255
00:12:54,119 --> 00:12:55,440
Try to get a good place.

256
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,640
Fighting!

257
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,000
Rest assured.

258
00:12:58,119 --> 00:12:59,239
We'll do our best.

259
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,320
Fighting!

260
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:47,000
(Welcome the players in C Group)

261
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,320
(of Women's 1500m Semi-final.)

262
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,559
Let's go.

263
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,320
Fighting!

264
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,140
(Shen Zhengyi)

265
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,119
- Zhengyi, be No.1.
- Zhengyi, be No.1.

266
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,000
- Xiaoyi, be invincible.
- Xiaoyi, be invincible.

267
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,559
Shen Zhengyi!

268
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,239
- Shen Zhengyi!
- Zhengyi!

269
00:15:10,239 --> 00:15:11,239
I'm here.

270
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,280
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

271
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:16,840
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

272
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,730
(Shen Zhengyi)

273
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,000
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

274
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:22,840
- Xiaoyi, be invincible.
- Xiaoyi, be invincible.

275
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,760
Xiaoyi.

276
00:15:24,359 --> 00:15:25,440
Xiaoyi, fighting!

277
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:27,799
Xiaoyi, fighting!

278
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:43,119
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

279
00:15:45,239 --> 00:15:45,760
Sit down!

280
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:47,320
So excited when you
see the women's team.

281
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:48,200
Sit down.

282
00:15:48,359 --> 00:15:49,320
Watch your behavior!

283
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:51,760
(Shen Zhengyi)

284
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,520
Look.

285
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:54,119
Zhuang Yue wants Shen Zhengyi

286
00:15:54,359 --> 00:15:55,760
to cooperate with Luo Xiaoyi.

287
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,000
Don't be nervous.

288
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,760
I'm sure they'll work together well.

289
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,520
I know!

290
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,320
Eunkyung Choi skated

291
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,559
so easily in the semi-final.

292
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,760
She did it on purpose

293
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:04,559
to exert pressure

294
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,520
on Zhengyi and others.

295
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:08,119
That must be a lot of pressure.

296
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,760
The destiny of Short Track Speed Skating

297
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,200
depends on them.

298
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,679
You have been avoiding me for so long,

299
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,000
and finally we met.

300
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,559
Don't fail to make it to the final

301
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,880
as in Ling Yun Cup.

302
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,119
I have always wanted to

303
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,200
compete with you.

304
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,760
Me too.

305
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,119
Hope you can skate well

306
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,200
and make it to the final.

307
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:57,760
I'd love to see you two

308
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:58,760
cooperate with each other.

309
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:09,199
Cheer up, Zhengyi.

310
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,760
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

311
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,040
- Shen Zhengyi!
- Fighting!

00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,800

00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,680
- Luo Xiaoyi!
- Fighting!

315
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,439
(Go to the start.)

316
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,640
(Ready.)

317
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,079
(Everyone,)

318
00:17:36,199 --> 00:17:37,439
(now we are having the)

319
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,640
(Women's 1500m)

320
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,880
(Semi-final in C Group)

321
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,079
(of Asian Cup.)

322
00:17:41,199 --> 00:17:41,880
(The players on the rink)

323
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,760
(have already set out.)

324
00:17:43,239 --> 00:17:44,680
(Luo Xiaoyi from Wind Chaser)

325
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,560
(is the last silver medalist)

326
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,680
(of this event.)

327
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:48,560
(And she is currently)

328
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,439
(in third place.)

329
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,000
Fighting, Zhengyi.

330
00:17:50,199 --> 00:17:51,000
(And the one in the first place)

331
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:52,119
(is also from Wind Chaser.)

332
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,119
(Shen Zhengyi from Wind Chaser.)

333
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,239
(This is the first time)

334
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:56,319
(of this player)

335
00:17:56,439 --> 00:17:57,079
(attending the Asian Cup.)

336
00:17:57,319 --> 00:17:58,560
(Right now the one in second place)

337
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,520
(is Xu Man from Magic.)

338
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,439
(She is)

339
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,119
(in the middle of two)

340
00:18:02,439 --> 00:18:03,880
(players from Wind Chaser.)

341
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:05,319
(So these players do not seem to)

342
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,760
(be in a hurry,)

343
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:08,239
(and they are keeping their paces.)

344
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,839
(Let's look at the next curve.)

345
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,599
(Oh no.)

346
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,239
(Luo Xiaoyi who is in third place)

347
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:14,079
(is taking advantage of this chance)

348
00:18:14,439 --> 00:18:16,319
(to transcend from the outer track.)

349
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,199
(Nice.)

350
00:18:17,439 --> 00:18:21,359
- Fighting!

351
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:22,040
(Xu Man from Magic)

352
00:18:22,239 --> 00:18:23,119
(is right behind two players)

(of Wind Chaser.)

(Dear audience,)

355
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,520
(there are still two
laps left in the race,)

356
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,239
(and Xu man should
still have the chance.)

357
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,239
(In fact, we see that)

358
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,880
(Xu Man has started to sprint.)

359
00:18:32,239 --> 00:18:32,760
(So far,)

360
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,479
(as long as she can transcend)

361
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,359
(one player,)

362
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,599
(she can)

363
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,880
(make it to the final.)

364
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,000
(But at the same time, Luo Xiaoyi)

365
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:41,880
(is also accelerating.)

366
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,880
(Right, several players)

367
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,119
(have started the final sprint.)

368
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,280
Speed up!

(Dear audience,)

373
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:57,959
(in last half a lap,)

374
00:18:58,359 --> 00:18:59,479
(will Luo Xiaoyi try to
transcend her teammate)

375
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,040
(and get the first place in the group?)

376
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,400
(She is sprinting!)

377
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,479
(Let's see, the first one is...)

(to Women's 1500m final)

382
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,079
(are two players)

383
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,280
(from Wind Chaser,)

(Shen Zhengyi and Luo Xiaoyi.)

385
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,680
Just apply it for a while.

386
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:52,280
Your foot injury is getting worse.

387
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,800
You cannot go on skating.

388
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:57,280
It isn't that serious.

389
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,520
I don't think it hurts that much.

390
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:01,160
Have Coach Zhuang and Coach Xiao

391
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,319
known about your injury?

392
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,920
Don't tell them about it.

393
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,000
No way.

394
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,439
I can't take the responsibility.

395
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,199
Doctor Liu.

396
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,439
How about this?

397
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,439
I promise you that

398
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,760
I'll do what I can

399
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,920
in the next race,

400
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:19,280
and I definitely won't force myself.

401
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,439
You know that

402
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,680
I just came back to Wind Chaser.

403
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,000
I can't just give up the contest

404
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:28,280
after I came back.

405
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,560
And it's about to have the final.

406
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,800
If I don't attend it,

407
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:37,880
how can Zhengyi

408
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,199
deal with Eunkyung Choi alone?

409
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,520
I'm begging you.

410
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,160
Then you have to promise me,

411
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,800
as soon as you don't feel well,

412
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:53,920
stop immediately

413
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:55,160
and find me.

414
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,800
Don't force yourself.

415
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,400
Rest assured.

416
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,920
Thank you, doctor Liu.

417
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,199
Coach Xiao.

418
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,760
Coach Xiao,

419
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,000
I'm curious

420
00:21:25,439 --> 00:21:26,199
that why you would let Luo Xiaoyi

421
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:27,560
assist Shen Zhengyi.

422
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:30,319
It's not my decision this time.

423
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,400
They made their own arrangements.

424
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,800
Coach Xiao would listen to

425
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,920
comments from team members.

426
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,079
Why didn't you do that before?

427
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:38,920
I know you still care

428
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,800
about what happened in the past.

429
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,280
It turns out I was wrong.

430
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,640
I should apologize to you.

431
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,560
It has been a long time

432
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,400
since it happened.

433
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,680
I don't care anymore.

434
00:21:50,199 --> 00:21:50,920
You're about to go on the rink.

435
00:21:51,199 --> 00:21:52,000
Fighting!

436
00:21:53,199 --> 00:21:54,040
I will.

I'll do everything I can to help you.

But everything could happen

449

00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,199
(This is)

510
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,040
(her first time attending
this competition.)

511
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,319
(Before it...)

512
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,520
Don't be in a hurry.

513
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,040
(She has no records)

514
00:25:59,160 --> 00:25:59,680
(of major competition.)

515
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,680
(So a lot of people might)

516
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,880
(not know about her.)

517
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:02,599
(Indeed for us...)

518
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:04,199
- Yu Bingling, fighting!
- Yu Bingling, fighting!

519
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,079
- Yu Bingling.
- Yu Bingling.

520
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:05,760
(Two players from Wind Chaser)

521
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,800
(are following so closely.)

522
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,239
(Currently Eunkyung Choi)

523
00:26:08,239 --> 00:26:09,239
(is in fourth place.)

524
00:26:09,239 --> 00:26:10,239
(Looks like the players of Wind Chaser)

525
00:26:10,239 --> 00:26:11,239
(are playing fiercely in the beginning.)

526
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,680
(Now to the curve,)

527
00:26:12,959 --> 00:26:14,199
(Eunkyung Choi suddenly
exerts her force.)

528
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,920
Have you ever thought

529
00:26:23,199 --> 00:26:24,160
about that your performance

530
00:26:24,199 --> 00:26:24,680
has been no breakthrough at all

531
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,760
since I left?

532
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,560
(No one can transcend me.)

533
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,199
- Fighting!
- Xiaoyi!

534
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,119
- Xiaoyi, fighting!
- Xiaoyi, fighting!

535
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:41,079
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

536
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,880
(Try to consume my strength)

537
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:45,520
(and disturb my pace.)

538
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,400
(This is the tactic of Wind Chaser.)

539
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,520
Luo Xiaoyi, what are you doing?

540
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,800
Luo Xiaoyi is trying to consume

541
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,800
Eunkyung Choi's strength in advance.

542
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,640
This tactic is too dangerous.
Luo Xiaoyi!

543
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,640
(She transcended two players in a row,)

544
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,680
(and got the second place.)

545
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,680
(What a surprise, right?)

546
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,880
(Eunkyung Choi usually likes)

547
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,680
(to sprint in the latter stage.)

548
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,800
(Looks like today she)

549
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,040
(changed her way to compete.)

550
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,000
(Looks like today's final)

551
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,079
(is going to be more intense.)

552
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,280
Slow down!

553
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,199
Watch your pace!

554
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:15,920
(Another curve again.)

555
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:16,560
(I'll make you convinced)

556
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,560
(of my victory today.)

557
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,680
(I was afraid you wouldn't chase me.)

558
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,160
(But we see that)

559
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,680
(Luo Xiaoyi has accelerated)

560
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,400
(her speed of pushing off the ice.)

561
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:22,920
(Right.)

562
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,400
(We share the current situation)

563
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,400
(on the rink)

564
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,280
(right now.)

565
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,560
(Luo Xiaoyi got the first place.)

566
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,880
(Eunkyung Choi is following closely.)

567
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,400
(Shen Zhengyi is one body position)

568
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,280
(away from two people,)

569
00:27:31,439 --> 00:27:32,400
(and she is in third place.)

570
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,920
(Luo Xiaoyi's speed)

571
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,160
(seems to be slowing down.)

572
00:27:35,199 --> 00:27:35,920
Yiyi, fighting!

573
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,560
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

574
00:27:45,199 --> 00:27:46,400
(Why does Luo Xiaoyi's strength)

575
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,880
(begin to decline in third lap?)

576
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,280
(No, I have to help her.)

577
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:52,920
(Shen Zhengyi is speeding up,)

578
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,000
(and she seems to go up)

579
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:55,160
(to block the outer
track of Eunkyung Choi,)

580
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,400
(and help her teammate.)

581
00:27:59,439 --> 00:28:00,520
You should know clearly

582
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:00,839
how you have performed

583
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:01,800
in recent competitions.

584
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:02,800
We can't afford to

585
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,280
let you compete alone.

586
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,680
(I cannot lose.)

587
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,800
(Yu Bingling from Flyer)

588
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,560
(stole a march on her.)

589
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:14,000
(Yu Bingling is not so right.)

590
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,239
(Why did she start)

591
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:16,359
(to exert the strength in advance?)

592
00:28:22,439 --> 00:28:23,040
(Why didn't Yu Bingling)

593
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,199
(preserve strength anymore?)

594
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,640
(Eunkyung Choi has transcended)

595
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,680
(Luo Xiaoyi in the outer track.)

596
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,640
(What a pity!)
(Right!)

597
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,760
(Two players from Wind Chaser...)

598
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,319
(I have to go up and help Xiaoyi)

599
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,280
(hold the speed.)

600
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:33,800
(Right.)

601
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,560
(But Shen Zhengyi)

602
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,280
(was slower,)

603
00:28:35,439 --> 00:28:36,520
(and Yu Bingling stole a march on her.)

604
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,560
(Right now Yu Bingling from Flyer)

605
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,800
(is in the first place.)

606
00:28:39,199 --> 00:28:40,560
(Eunkyung Choi is in the second place.)

607
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,400
(Shen Zhengyi)

608
00:28:41,439 --> 00:28:42,400
(has transcended
her teammate Luo Xiaoyi.)

609
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,920
(So the first echelon)

610
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:44,560
(remains unchanged in the curve.)

611
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,280
(How about the second echelon?)

612
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,760
(They are also in the curve now.)

613
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,640
(I can't let them transcend anymore.)

614
00:28:57,199 --> 00:28:58,199
(Cheer up, Zhengyi.)

615
00:28:58,359 --> 00:28:59,160
(I will count on you.)

616
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,199
(Terrible.)

617
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,160
(Luo Xiaoyi fell down.)

618
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,079
(The teammate of Flyer fell down.)

619
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,040
(In order to avoid Luo Xiaoyi,)

620
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,439
Luo Xiaoyi.

621
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,040
(Wang Ying from Flyer fell down too.)

622
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,160
(What a pity!)

623
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:16,439
(In such a fierce competition,)

624
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,160
(the last three players)

625
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,400
(are almost impossible)

626
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:18,820
(to catch up.)

627
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:19,560
Is Luo Xiaoyi OK?

628
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,280
(We see three players)

629
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:20,920
(who are leading)

630
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,000
(have already transcended them.)

631
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,400
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

632
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:33,560
Fighting, Luo Xiaoyi!

633
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,880
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

634
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,560
- Fighting, Wind Chaser!
- Fighting, Wind Chaser!

635
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,280
(Luo Xiaoyi.)

636
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,920
(Luo Xiaoyi is trying to stand up.)

637
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,439
Xiaoyi.

638
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,560
(Her legs...)

639
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,800
(I think her legs got hurt.)

640
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,160
(And it looks pretty serious.)

641
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,040
(She's still racing.)

642
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,640
(We saw three players)

643
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,680
(who fell behind
because of falling down)

644
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,400
(have returned to the race one by one.)

645
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,680
(But they cannot)

646
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,800
(make a difference to the result.)

647
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,199
(Right, I can say there are)

648
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,160
(only top 3 players on the rink.)

649
00:29:55,199 --> 00:29:55,560
Oh, no.

650
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,680
There's only Yiyi left.

651
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,400
Xiaoyi.

652
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,560
Fighting, Zhengyi.

653
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,439
Fighting, Yu Bingling.

654
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,439
(The three players on the rink)

655
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,400
(are following pretty closely!)

656
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:07,160
(With your skills,)

657
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,000
(are you trying to defend me?)

658
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,280
(Shen Zhengyi is in third place.)

659
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:18,800
The last few curves

660
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,800
in 1500m

661
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,040
are critical.

662
00:30:21,439 --> 00:30:22,000
At this time,

663
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,319
you must make the most

664
00:30:23,439 --> 00:30:24,520
of your strong force

665
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:27,079
to take the vantage position.

666
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,439
Hang on, hang on!

667
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,560
(Oh no.)

668
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,239
(Eunkyung Choi)

669
00:30:35,239 --> 00:30:36,199
(is following so closely.)

670
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,280
Yu Bingling

671
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,280
has reached her limit.

672
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,800
Eunkyung Choi is still
competing with her fiercely.

673
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,400
Her pace was disturbed.

674
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,000
(We have said that
in the last few laps of 1500m,)

675
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,920
(it becomes
a race of physical strength)

676
00:30:54,199 --> 00:30:55,079
(and willpower.)

677
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:55,560
(Right.)

678
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,160
(Three players)

679
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,800
(are in very intense competition now.)

680
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,160
(Let's look at the next curve.)

681
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,439
(Now there are only four laps)

682
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,640
(to the finish line.)

683
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,640
(The situation on the rink)

684
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,079
(are changing so fast.)

685
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,400
(The situation now is that)

686
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,199
(Shen Zhengyi gets the first place,)

687
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:18,920
(Eunkyung Choi gets the second place,)

688
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,280
(and Yu Bingling gets the third place.)

689
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,800
(The three players are now
following each other so closely.)

690
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,280
(Right.)

691
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,439
(We still don't know who will win.)

692
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,199
(That's true.)

693
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,280
(Shen Zhengyi is slowing down.)

694
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,280
(Today,)

695
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,800
(indeed, she sprinted too early.)

696
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:36,520
(Right.)

697
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,760
(We always say that
the older, the wiser.)

698
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,520
(In the critical moment,)

699
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,800
(Eunkyung Choi's competition experience)

700
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:41,680
(have worked.)

701
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,560
Yiyi, fighting!

702
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,280
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

703
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,520
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

704
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,319
Beisheng.

705
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,040
- Beisheng.
- What are you doing?

706
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,760
Fighting, don't be in a hurry.

707
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,400
Slow down, find the chance.

708
00:32:26,199 --> 00:32:27,319
Zhengyi, hang on.

709
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,800
Shen Zhengyi, hold it.

710
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,400
Don't be in a hurry.

711
00:32:29,439 --> 00:32:31,280
Be careful, hold it.

712
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,439
Do we have

713
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,000
any chance of winning in the Asian Cup?

714
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:48,959
If you want to win Eunkyung Choi,

715
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,000
it is not impossible.

716
00:32:50,439 --> 00:32:51,160
You said before

717
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,280
you have so many teammates,

718
00:32:52,439 --> 00:32:53,280
and you have Coach Zhuang.

719
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,719
They're all with you.

720
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,599
So, you have to know

721
00:32:55,719 --> 00:32:56,599
at any time,

722
00:32:56,959 --> 00:32:58,280
you are not fighting alone.

723
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,800
I am Cinderella

724
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,640
wearing crystal shoes?

725
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,680
‍Of course not.

726
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,160
You are not Cinderella.

727
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,319
You're a woman warrior.

728
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:06,800
Zhengyi, do your best.

729
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,040
I believe you. Fighting!

730
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,400
You know how hard it is to practice

731
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,199
Short Track Speed Skating.

732
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,800
Why do you persist to this day?

733
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,359
You have only one way...

734
00:33:17,479 --> 00:33:18,000
Speed up.

735
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,040
to face the accidental situation.

736
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,400
Believe in yourself.

737
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,040
Believe in your teammates.

738
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,560
We work together.

739
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,160
Because you believe

740
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,520
as long as you work hard,

741
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,400
you will be rewarded.

742
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,040
You can be invincible

743
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:40,920
and sweep away all the obstacles.

744
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,520
Nothing is impossible
in the competition,

745
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,560
as long as you work hard.

746
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:46,800
- Wind Chaser, sure win!
- Wind Chaser, sure win!

747
00:33:56,439 --> 00:33:57,400
(Now!)

748
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:04,239
Last lap,

749
00:34:04,239 --> 00:34:05,040
Zhengyi, don't be in a hurry.

750
00:34:05,479 --> 00:34:07,040
You can make it.
Take the chance.

751
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,120
(Hang on and break through your limit.)

752
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,439
(To defeat you,)

753
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:20,159
(we are catching up every day.)

754
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:21,439
Shen Zhengyi.

755
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,320
Last lap, Zhengyi.

756
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:24,679
Speed up!

757
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,879
(All of us have worked hard)

758
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:29,040
(together till now.)

759
00:34:29,439 --> 00:34:31,399
(Even if it takes all my strength,)

760
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,399
(I'll try my best)

761
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:33,760
(to the last minute.)

762
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,879
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

763
00:34:39,959 --> 00:34:41,120
Hold it. Shen Zhengyi.

00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:47,000
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

765
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,679
(Believe in yourself.)

766
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:53,040
(Believe in your teammates.)

767
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,360
(Shen Zhengyi.)

768
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,399
- Nice!
- Nice!

769
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,080
(It was Shen Zhengyi who
crossed the finish line.)

770
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,600
(Amazing!)

771
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:24,000
(For the first time attending)

772
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:24,600
(the international competition,)

773
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:25,719
(she has defeated the three-time
defending champion,)

774
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:28,199
(Eunkyung Choi)

775
00:35:28,439 --> 00:35:29,239
(by an absolute superiority.)

776
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:31,560
(This is so incredible.)

777
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:32,399
(This is quite an)

778
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,040
(exciting game.)

779
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,479
(The myth of Eunkyung Choi...)

780
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,879
Zhengyi, I love you.

781
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:37,760
(Right.)

782
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,840
(This year,)

783
00:35:38,919 --> 00:35:40,840
(in Women's 1500m final of Asian Cup,)

784
00:35:40,879 --> 00:35:42,719
(we got a real dark horse.)

785
00:35:42,879 --> 00:35:44,120
(Let's once again congratulate)

786
00:35:44,439 --> 00:35:45,280

You're quite good!

791
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,120
Third place is good.

792
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,280
It is a new start.

793
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,320
Just practice more in the future.

794
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,239
Be happy! Don't cry.

795
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:08,600
You go receive the medal.

796

I'll be over there
waiting for you, okay?

Well done! Zhengyi.
