(Introductory Tutorial of Sketch)

5
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,559
The competition is coming soon.

6
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,600
I wonder how Shao Beisheng

7
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,839
is practicing.

8
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,520
(What are you doing?)

9
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,679
(Nothing.)

10
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:26,800
(Come out.)

11
00:02:31,559 --> 00:02:32,000
Lele.

12
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,880
I have to go out.

13
00:02:34,559 --> 00:02:35,559
I have to go out.

14
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,600
Be in a relationship is great.

15
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:58,590
(Did you sleep?)
(The message was not successfully sent.)

16

(You are not verified by a friend yet.)

17
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:02,919
I have been deleted.

18
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,240
Fine, Qu Zhi.

19
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,679
It's only been one day
since we met last time,

20
00:03:23,559 --> 00:03:24,639
and you become passionate.

21
00:03:29,399 --> 00:03:30,559
I love it.

22
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,199
Let's go for a walk.

23
00:03:40,559 --> 00:03:41,520
Let's go.

24
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:49,639
What about your cooperation

25
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,399
with Liu Sisi?

26
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,160
To be honest, I don't
want to assist her.

27
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,240
I have been practicing so hard

28
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:58,800
just to get a good result,

29
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,960
and prove it to my mom.

30
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,199
But if I assist her,

31
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,399
I cannot even make it to the finals.

32
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:06,759
Then what should you do?

33
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:08,919
I have no choice.

34
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:11,679
This will be the

35
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,160
last competition that Liu Sisi attends.

36
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,039
She had been assisting Luo Xiaoyi

37
00:04:15,119 --> 00:04:15,880
before.

38
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,720
So,

39
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,959
she won't make a concession this time.

40
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,119
But I can understand her, too.

41
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:22,679
The competition is coming soon.

42
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,079
You haven't come to the agreement yet.

43
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,079
That's why I'm anxious.

44
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,279
You saw it on the
College Student Ice League.

45
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,920
Yu Bingling and her teammates
were so amazing

46
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,799
in cooperation.

47
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,600
So in this 1500-meter race,

48
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,480
we certainly can't do it alone.

49
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,519
Have you discussed it with Liu Sisi?

50
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:42,320
This is not just your own business,

51
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,040
and you have to tell her

52
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,440
all your thoughts.

53
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,399
Understand?

54
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,480
But no matter who backs down,

55
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:53,000
the one would be very aggrieved.

56
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,160
It's so difficult.

57
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,160
But anyway,

58
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:04,040
I'm going to be on your side.

59
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,160
Stop talking about me.

60
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,000
How is

61
00:05:11,119 --> 00:05:12,320
your show now?

62
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,559
Follow me.

63
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:24,760
Why do you

64
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,959
take me to the rink?

65
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,119

Hello, Mom.

111
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,119
Sisi, I tell you that

112
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,479
we've already bought

113
00:09:57,479 --> 00:09:58,760
the tickets for Ling Yun Cup.

114
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:01,119
Mom and dad will be there

115
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:02,440
to cheer you up.

116
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:03,919
Your uncle and aunties

00:10:04,119 --> 00:10:05,039
also want to come.

118
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,400
I have told you not to

119
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:07,239
take it

120
00:10:07,359 --> 00:10:08,239
too seriously every time.

121
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:09,400
I can't win the gold medal anyway.

122
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:10,239
Don't say so.

123
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:10,719
Don't come to see me.

124
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:12,119
How come you can't win the gold medal?

125
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,400
Sisi.

126
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,880
Mom and dad trust you,

127
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,960

(The cooperation between you)

00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:30,880
(and you have to tell her
all your thoughts.)

135
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,159
I wanted

136
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:54,280
to talk to you about something,

137
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,719
but I didn't expect to hear

138
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:57,919
you and your parents on the phone.

139
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,359
Don't try to convince me.

140
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,679
Even if I can't win the
gold medal this time,

141
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,080
I won't be the stepping stone

142
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,359
for anyone.

143
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,000
I understand.

144
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,400
It's your last competition.

145
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:12,280
You want to take a chance,

146
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:14,119
in order to live up to your mom
and dad's expectations.

147
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,760
I understand all of these.

148
00:11:16,359 --> 00:11:17,159
What's up?

149
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,000
Want to convince me in another way?

150
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,919
Although our cases

151
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,080
are not quite the same,

152
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:29,760
we are in the similar situation now.

153
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,440
I don't know if you
have heard about that.

154
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:35,000
I had been training in Wind Chaser

155
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,479
behind my mom's back the whole time,

156
00:11:39,119 --> 00:11:40,760
because she didn't
let me learn to skate.

157
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:43,000
Later I knew about

158
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,200
the reason why she didn't
let me learn to skate.

159
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,159
She used to be an

160
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,919
excellent Short Track
Speed Skating player.

161
00:11:49,599 --> 00:11:51,080
She had to retire because of

162
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:52,960
serious injury,

163
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,479
and she also lost

164
00:11:55,599 --> 00:11:56,719
the gold medal she wanted the most.

165
00:11:57,719 --> 00:11:58,840
I want this gold medal

166
00:11:58,919 --> 00:11:59,799
so badly,

167
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,559
because I want to prove to her that

168
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,880
I won't make the mistake that she did.

169
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,679
I hope she will

170
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,239
support me a little more.

171
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:07,559
So what do you think?

172
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,880
I'm sorry.

173
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,719
I cannot assist you.

174
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:18,000
I cannot make a concession.

175
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,760
You're right.

176
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,400
Our cases are not quite the same.

177
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,200
Since I got the first gold medal

178
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:27,599
in Junior Group,

179
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,719
my parents always thought

180
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,080
I can get the world champion.

181
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:31,799
I thought so

182
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:32,840
when I just got into Wind Chaser.

183
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,479
But then I found that

184
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,280
no matter how hard I practiced,

185
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,159
I cannot even rank first

186
00:12:38,239 --> 00:12:39,080
in the team.

187
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,440
But they have still

188
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:41,880
been encouraging me,

189
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,840
and they always believe that

190
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,840
I can get the champion.

191
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,520
For all these years,

192
00:12:48,719 --> 00:12:50,200
I've been letting them down.

193
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,280
I can't practice anymore,

194
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:55,640
so I plan to retire.

195
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:58,599
This is the last competition

196
00:12:58,679 --> 00:12:59,880
before I retire.

197
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,359
Anyhow,

198
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:04,960
I don't want to have any regrets.

199
00:13:10,599 --> 00:13:11,400
So,

200
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,840
I definitely won't make a concession.

201
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:35,200
(Ling Yun race, with high morale)

202
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,440
(Faith, perseverance,
striving to be the first)

203
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,660
(6th Ling Yun Cup
National College Ice Games)

204
00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:04,119
Darling.

205
00:14:04,599 --> 00:14:06,320
Stop walking around there.

206
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,559
You make me dizzy.

207
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:08,679
Shut up.

208
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,359
You've been swiping on that tablet

209
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,320
for 2 hours.

210
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,440
Did you break it?

211
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,400
Her competition should be over

212
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:17,799
after the qualifying round,

213
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,719
and she cannot make it
to the final, right?

214
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,359
Yes, exactly.

215
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,440
She cannot make it.

216
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,039
Right,

217
00:14:23,479 --> 00:14:24,840
Zhengyi has only been in
Wind Chaser for a few days.

218
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,520
And she is not the seeded player.

219
00:14:26,719 --> 00:14:27,719
For the 1500-meter race,

220
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:28,919
I think

221
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:30,479
she can assist others at most.

222
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,799
Right, assist others.

223
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,679
Coach Xiao.

224
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,080
Coach Xiao is calling.

225
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,400
You have Coach Xiao's number?

226
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,960
I'll pick it up first.

227
00:14:46,239 --> 00:14:46,880
I'll deal with you later.

228
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,039
Hello, Coach Xiao.

229
00:14:50,359 --> 00:14:51,000
What?

230
00:14:51,719 --> 00:14:52,440
Really?

231
00:14:53,119 --> 00:14:54,400
Zhengyi made it to the final.

232
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,679
She made it to the final?

233
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:57,320
Okay, thank you!

234
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,719
- She made it to the final.
- She made it to the final.

235
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,880
Zhengyi made it to the final.

236
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:02,880
Our daughter is so amazing.

237
00:15:03,239 --> 00:15:04,280
She's my daughter.

238
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,679
Mostly because you gave her

239
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,080
such a good name.

240
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:09,960
Who said that

241
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,479
she cannot make it to the final?

242
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:13,880
I didn't.

243
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,840
Who just said she can only
assist others at most.

244
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,000
I'll cook.

245
00:15:17,599 --> 00:15:18,320
Good.

246
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,200
I'll watch a movie.

247
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,280
You're so amazing, Sisi!

248
00:15:25,599 --> 00:15:27,080
First place in group.

249
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:29,880
Thank you, Zhengyi.

250
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,159
Zhengyi, you're so great!

251
00:15:32,359 --> 00:15:33,039
So great!

252
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:34,080
I thought you won't make a concession.

253
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,039
Why did you help me out on the rink?

254
00:15:37,359 --> 00:15:39,119
We are on the same team.

255
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,880
But it's a pity

256
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,679
that Luo Xiaoyi broke the rules.

257
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:42,599
Otherwise, there will be three
players of Wind Chaser

258
00:15:42,719 --> 00:15:43,479
making it to the final.

259
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,479
Exactly.

260
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:01,119
Zhu Lele.

261
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,479
What were you doing?

262
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:06,400
Didn't you see two people

263
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,559
flanking me?

264
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:09,520
Were you walking in the back?

265
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:10,799
No.

266
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,239
I wanted to catch up,

267
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:14,039
but they blocked my path.

268
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,200
I can't catch up.

269
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,919
So are you just a bystander?

270
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,320
I highly doubt

271
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:19,640
how you got into the Wind Chaser.

272
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:21,919
I'm sorry.

273
00:16:22,359 --> 00:16:23,640
Before we play,

274
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:25,000
we haven't practiced together,

275
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,080
so I cannot cooperate well.

276
00:16:27,719 --> 00:16:28,679
I didn't mean to.

277
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:30,320
You have an excuse for skating so badly?

278
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:32,840
What a weak teammate!

279
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:34,679
Now I can't make it to
the final because of you.

280
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:39,280
Luo Xiaoyi, don't be angry.

281
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:40,960
Zhu Lele doesn't skate

282
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,760
as well as you,

283
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,119
but she certainly didn't

284
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:44,719
let you fail to make it
to the final on purpose.

285
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:50,880
Right, Xiaoyi.

286
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,239
If you can trust Lele

287
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,159
from the beginning,

288
00:16:53,359 --> 00:16:54,280
let her lead the way in the midway

289
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:54,960
to preserve your strength,

290
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,320
so you might not lose

291
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,039
in the final sprint stage.

292
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,239
What do you mean now?

293
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,560
Are you great to make it to the final?

294
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,520
So you teach me together.

295
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,079
If you weren't lucky enough

296
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,760
to be in a group with Yu Bingling,

297
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,560
could you make it to the final?

298
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:16,760
I'd like to see

299
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,079
how you can

300
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,920
win Yu Bingling in the final.

301
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,880
I didn't mean to.

302
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,079
Alright, alright.

303
00:17:30,479 --> 00:17:31,359
I'm sure you didn't mean to.

304
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,040
Let's go. You shall take a rest.

305
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,800
I didn't mean to.

306
00:17:37,199 --> 00:17:38,199
Let's sit for a while.

307
00:17:47,479 --> 00:17:48,400
Maybe we should go for a barbecue.

308
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,319
Barbecue.

309
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,199
I know a really good restaurant.

310
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,079
I know one, too.

311
00:17:51,199 --> 00:17:52,560
I'm sure we're talking
about the same one.

312
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:54,199
Hello, Coach Xiao.

313
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,319
Is there anyone else in there?

314
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:56,959
No, they're gone.

315
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,359
Ok, I see.

316
00:17:58,439 --> 00:17:59,040
Thank you.

317
00:17:59,199 --> 00:18:00,280
Coach Xiao, bye.

318
00:18:00,439 --> 00:18:01,199
Coach Xiao, bye.

319
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,560
So delicious.

320
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:05,599
We went for hot pot that day...

321
00:18:06,239 --> 00:18:07,520
Why didn't you call me?

322
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:52,439
I told you that

323
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,719
Ling Yun Cup is not

324
00:18:53,719 --> 00:18:54,800
your ultimate goal.

325
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,560
Winning or losing a game

326
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,040
doesn't mean anything.

327
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,839
Shen Zhengyi made it to the final

328
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,880
of 1500-meter race.

329
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,239
You can cultivate a new

330
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:07,439
world champion.

331
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:10,880
So you're going to give up?

332
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:19,479
Luo Xiaoyi, I am asking you.

333
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,479
I'm not going to give up,

334
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:24,920
but you are going to give up on me.

335
00:19:25,959 --> 00:19:26,800
You said Shen Zhengyi

336
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,839
is a good fit to assist me

337
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:28,920
and let us be partners.

338
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:30,119
Then where is she

339
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:31,199
when I need her?

340
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:31,959
You just need her

341
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:33,239
in the final.

342
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:37,599
Did it ever occur to you that

343
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,839
the failure today was your fault?

344
00:19:46,959 --> 00:19:47,479
Actually, I think the fact that

345
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,719
you didn't make it to the final today

346
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,040
can teach you a
very important lesson.

347
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,280
Coach Zhuang is right about something.

348
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,680
You can't get far alone.

349
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:23,800
Are you okay?

350
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:25,000
Why are you sneezing?

351
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,800
You are going to attend
the contest tomorrow.

352
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,439
Don't catch a cold.

353
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:31,880
I'm telling you.

354
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,680
With it,

355
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:33,640
I'm not afraid of anything.

356
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,000
Then you shall still take it seriously.

357
00:20:36,719 --> 00:20:37,599
Are you sure you can't

358
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:38,800
come to see my competition tomorrow?

359
00:20:39,479 --> 00:20:40,079
Don't you know?

360
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:42,239
The professor designated me and Qu Zhi

361
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:43,400
to investigate and survey
in the botanical garden.

362
00:20:44,479 --> 00:20:45,520
I have to go.

363
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:48,400
Alright.

364
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,319
If I get back

365
00:20:49,439 --> 00:20:50,160
in time,

366
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,000
I'll go and see.

367
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:52,640
If I'm not there when you're skating,

368
00:20:54,199 --> 00:20:55,280
it will watch over you for me.

369
00:20:58,839 --> 00:20:59,599
You gave me the

370
00:20:59,719 --> 00:21:01,160
lucky red rope that
your mother gave you,

371
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:02,479
what shall you do after that?

372
00:21:02,959 --> 00:21:04,160
I'm lucky with you.

373
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,839
So from now on, you shall try your best

374
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,880
to accompany me on
every competition I attend.

375
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:09,920
Okay?

376
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,719
Got it.

377
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,520
Don't worry.

378
00:21:13,959 --> 00:21:15,280
I'm going to try my best tomorrow.

379
00:21:16,719 --> 00:21:17,439
Keep going!

380
00:21:30,719 --> 00:21:31,920
I hope we're not late.

381
00:21:34,199 --> 00:21:35,199
It should be just right.

382
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,800
The traffic was terrible.

383
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,079
Look, there's no one.

384
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:42,959
I think they all went in.

385
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,880
I... I'll get off here.

386
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:45,839
You go park the car.

387
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:47,520
Stop here.

388
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,640
You get off right here?

389
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:50,760
Can you...

390
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,040
Park the car and hurry to come.

391
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,479
Alright, alright.

392
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,920
I'm the only one left this time.

393
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,719
She said she wasn't in a hurry,

394
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,239
and she is more worried than anyone now.

395
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:10,500
(6th Ling Yun Cup
National College Ice Games)

396
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,359
Shen Zhengyi, keep going!

397
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,980
(Come on, Wind Chaser!)

398
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,640
The best!

399

- Fighting!
- Fighting!

400
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,359
How's your warm-up?

401
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,319
Do you warm yourselves up?

402
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,520
I'm just going to add one point.

403
00:22:39,239 --> 00:22:39,959
You two are partners.

404
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,479
No matter what situation

405
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,479
you come across on this rink,

406
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:44,280
you have to trust each other

407
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,280
and make up the gap.

408
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:48,800
Do you

409
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,040
have confidence in the final?

410
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,680
Do you have confidence?

411
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,199
Are you ready?

412
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,040
It is alright.

413
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:04,599
- It is alright.
- Is it alright?

414
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:05,160
Pretty good.

415
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,000
- Hurry up, please have a seat.
- It's going to start.

416
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,959
Be No.1, Shen Zhengyi.

417
00:23:11,239 --> 00:23:12,040
Keep going!

418
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:13,040
Keep going!

419
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:13,479
Auntie.

420
00:23:13,479 --> 00:23:13,920
Take it for me.

421
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,520
Lele.

422
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:15,880
It's not started yet?

423
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,839
Not yet, Auntie.

424
00:23:17,239 --> 00:23:17,760
Where is Zhengyi?

425
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:18,560
Zhengyi.

426
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:19,439
She's down there.

427
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,920
The 1500-meter race

428
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:22,800
is a long race.

429
00:23:23,239 --> 00:23:24,719
You should have a plan in mind

430
00:23:24,959 --> 00:23:26,119
about the physical protection.

431
00:23:26,719 --> 00:23:27,479
Don't be disturbed

432
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:28,920
by the pace of

433
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,599
other players.

434
00:23:34,719 --> 00:23:36,040
And the Flyer

435
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,800
is characterized by teamwork.

436
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,079
You should have a plan in mind.

437
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,680
Don't be disturbed by others.

438
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,520
If you're disturbed...

439
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,160
I need you to step outside.

440
00:23:42,199 --> 00:23:42,520
1 minute.

441
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,199
Just 1 minute.

442
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,280
I need you to come out with me now.

443
00:23:44,439 --> 00:23:44,959
It's urgent.

444
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,719
Don't be nervous!

445
00:23:51,479 --> 00:23:52,079
Limin.

446
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,479
Limin.

447
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,280
What are you doing here?

448
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,280
I'm fine. I'm fine.

449
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,959
Uncle, auntie, it's about to start.

450
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:58,839
Let's go up and sit down.

451
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,439
So we can see clearly.

452
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,160
Okay, okay.

453
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:00,839
Let's go.

454
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:02,439
I'll take the bag.

455
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,040
Right here. What's going on?

456
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,160
Coach Zhuang, I wonder

457
00:24:05,239 --> 00:24:06,319
if you could be absent for this race.

458
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:07,359
I'm the chief coach.

459
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,280
How could I be absent?

460
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,000
Are you kidding?

461
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:09,599
Coach Zhuang,

462
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,439
you cannot be there for this race.

463
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,199
Tell me

464
00:24:11,479 --> 00:24:12,479
what's going on?

465
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:15,199
Zhengyi's mom is here.

466
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:17,319
Zhengyi's mom is here, so what?

467
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,760
Zhengyi's mother...

468
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:22,680
Zhengyi's mother is Wang Limin.

469
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:26,800
Now she is

470
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,119
sitting on the Wind Chaser stand.

471
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,319
(Let's welcome all
the players in the final)

(of 1500-meter race.)

473
00:24:32,959 --> 00:24:34,119
Coach Zhuang, I'll go in.

474
00:24:41,719 --> 00:24:42,520
It's about to start.

475
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,640
We can only win.

476
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,560
Do you get it?

477
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,160
Come on.

478
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:51,199
1, 2, 3, fighting!

479
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,079
Why is Coach Zhuang not coming?

480
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,319
Coach Zhuang has something urgent now,

481
00:24:55,439 --> 00:24:56,000
so she cannot come here.

482
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:56,800
Never mind, I'm here.

483
00:24:57,359 --> 00:24:58,280
You worked well together last time,

484
00:24:58,719 --> 00:24:59,160
so take it easy,

485
00:24:59,160 --> 00:24:59,839
and do the same as training.

486
00:25:00,439 --> 00:25:01,079
Do you understand?

487
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,160
Keep going!

488
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,160

You were in a hurry just now.

504
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,880
When was I in a hurry?

Okay, time's up.

Take off your clothes and get prepared.

509

As we agreed,

510
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,839

515
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,359
(the 1500-meter final of)

516
00:26:33,479 --> 00:26:34,599
(Women's Short Track Speed Skating.)

517
00:26:34,959 --> 00:26:36,560
(I'll introduce the
positions of athletes.)

518
00:26:37,719 --> 00:26:39,520
(First track, from Flyer,)

519
00:26:39,719 --> 00:26:41,920
(No.010, Yu Bingling.)

520
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,890
(Flyer, sure win!)

521
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:49,359
(Second track, from Wind Chaser,)

522
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,880
(No.024, Liu Sisi.)

523
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,690
(You are the best.)

524
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,719
(Third track, from Wind Chaser,)

525
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,319
(No.033, Shen Zhengyi.)

526
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,839
Shen Zhengyi, fighting!

527
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:07,560
Shen Zhengyi, fighting!

528
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,800
(Fourth track, from Flyer,)

529
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,839
(No.031, Wang Ying.)

530
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:23,359
(Wind Chaser won't lose.)

531
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,680
(Fifth track, from Qifeng,)

532
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:29,239
(No.012, Zhao Xiaoyu.)

533
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,920
(Sixth track, from Shengyu,)

534
00:27:31,199 --> 00:27:33,160
(No.050, Zhuo Yating.)

535
00:27:33,239 --> 00:27:34,239
(I talked to Wang Limin before,)

536
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,400
(she hasn't moved on
from what happened at that time.)

537
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,839
(So she had been opposing Zhengyi)

538
00:27:37,959 --> 00:27:39,239
(to practice short
track speed skating.)

539
00:27:39,479 --> 00:27:40,199
(If she knows)

540
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,359
(you're Zhengyi's coach,)

541
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,000
(I don't know what will happen.)

542
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:54,760
Ready.

543
00:28:03,719 --> 00:28:04,760
(Okay, the race starts.)

544
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:05,760
(Yu Bingling didn't hold her power)

545
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:06,599
(and got the first place.)

546
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,599
(Wang Ying wanted to transcend
again from the outer track,)

547
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,560
(but was firmly blocked
by Shen Zhengyi.)

548
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,400
Fighting, Shen Zhengyi!

549
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:11,479
Fighting!

550
00:28:30,479 --> 00:28:31,439
Keep it!

551
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,079
Look.

552
00:28:33,199 --> 00:28:34,280
She transcended, she transcended.

553
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:35,479
- Fighting
- Fighting.

554
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:36,719
Shen Zhengyi, fighting!

555
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:55,280
Pay attention to your speed.

556
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:07,439
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

557
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:23,599
Zhengyi has got the second place.

558
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,079
She broke their formation.

559
00:29:27,719 --> 00:29:29,479
(I have to try my best to win.)

560
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:32,880
Sisi, go forward!

561
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:37,680
(Shen Zhengyi made the place)

562
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,199
(for Liu Sisi to)

563
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:39,119
(transcend easily.)

564
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,199
Fighting!

565
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:41,000
(Shen Zhengyi is a)

566
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,040
(player with great power.)

567
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:42,920
(She speeds up so quickly.)

568
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,959
(She has an advantage in speed,)

569
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,359
(and also has a strong sense
of tactical cooperation.)

570
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,280
(She has cooperated with Liu Sisi)

571
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:47,479
(to complete a wonderful transcending.)

572
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,079
(Sisi, go forward!)

573
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:08,599
Is Zhengyi assisting the teammate?

574
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,479
Didn't you just let her
assist the teammate?

575
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,640
When did I say that?

576
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,920
(I cannot give up.)

577
00:30:30,199 --> 00:30:31,199
(Sisi's speed and endurance)

578
00:30:31,199 --> 00:30:32,199
(are inferior to those of Yu Bingling.)

579
00:30:32,479 --> 00:30:33,199
(Their distance)

580
00:30:33,199 --> 00:30:34,560
(will definitely be larger.)

581
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,359
(No way.)

582
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:36,319
(I have to go up there and help her.)

583
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:38,199
(Four laps to go.)

584
00:30:38,439 --> 00:30:39,880
(Yu Bingling is still in first place.)

585
00:30:40,479 --> 00:30:41,199
(Liu Sisi from Wind Chaser)

586
00:30:41,199 --> 00:30:41,839
(is in second place currently.)

587
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:42,839
(I'm losing my strength.)

588
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:44,199
(How can I make it?)

589
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,760
(Shen Zhengyi caught up.)

590
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:49,400
(I now go forward to)

591
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,520
(let Yu Bingling defend me.)

592
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,560
(Then Sisi will have the chance.)

593
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,000
(Flyer, sure win!)
Fighting! Fighting!

594
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,479
- Hold it, hold it!
- Nice.

595
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:01,560
The curve, pay attention to the pace.

596
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,000
Pay attention to the pace.

597
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:05,359
(Sisi cannot make it.)

598
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,479
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

599
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:17,400
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

600
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,640
Speed up and go forward.

601
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,560
(Yu Bingling's endurance is so strong.)

602
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,599
(Zhengyi.)

603
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,560
(The hope of Wind Chaser is on you.)

604
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,800
(Fighting!)

605
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,640
Go forward!

606
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,560
(Liu Sisi wants me to...)

607
00:32:06,439 --> 00:32:06,880
Sprint!

608
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,239
Wonderful, the last lap! Sprint!

609
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,199
Fighting!

610
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:19,959
(Shen Zhengyi.)

611
00:32:19,959 --> 00:32:21,000
(It was Shen Zhengyi who
crossed the line unexpectedly.)

612
00:32:21,199 --> 00:32:22,280
(Shen Zhengyi won the champion!)

613
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,079
(The tactic of Wind Chaser)

614
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:27,199
(has been so confusing!)

615
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:28,760
(We all thought Liu Sisi)

616
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,359
(would be the one for sprinting.)

617
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:29,880
(But Liu Sisi)

618
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
(just feinted.)

619
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:33,439
(Let's congratulate Wind Chaser)

620
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:34,560
(for winning the championship.)

621
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:38,660
(Female Single's 1500m Final)
(Shen Zhengyi won the champion)

622
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,280
(Female Single's 1500m Final)
(Shen Zhengyi won the champion)

623
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:03,199
Champion.

624
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,000
- We've won!
- We've won!

625
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,479
- We've won!
- We've won!

626
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,239
We made it!

627
00:33:16,239 --> 00:33:16,959
We've won!

628
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:18,239
We've won!

629
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,920
We have finally won.

630
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,280
Great!

631
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:29,839
You two acted so good

632
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,719
that I was cheated.

633
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,719
You skated really well.

634
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:40,000
You too.

635
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:42,160
Today is your

636
00:33:42,239 --> 00:33:43,160
best skating record ever.

637
00:33:43,719 --> 00:33:44,560
Thank you.

638
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,479
We've won!

639
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,880
We've won!

640
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,800
We've won!

641
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,680
Wind Chaser has won!

642
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,930
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team of
Lingbei University)

643
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,320
This is for you.

644
00:35:19,439 --> 00:35:20,360
Without you,

645
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,600
I cannot win.

646
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:25,280
There's only one winner.

647
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,840
It's yours.

648
00:35:28,399 --> 00:35:29,639
You don't have to be embarrassed.

649
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,360
I didn't help you win.

650
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,239
I just didn't want Wind Chaser to lose.

651
00:35:35,439 --> 00:35:36,840
It's for the Wind Chaser anyway.

652
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:37,719
Isn't it the same to keep it

653
00:35:37,919 --> 00:35:39,040
by you or by me?

654
00:35:48,959 --> 00:35:49,679
The gold medal of Ling Yun Cup

655
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,040
is really pretty.

656
00:35:53,479 --> 00:35:54,239
But,

657
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,159
I'm a forgetful person.

658
00:35:56,679 --> 00:35:57,840
I'll leave it to you.

659
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:02,439
Shen Zhengyi, Liu Sisi.

660
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,800
- Be careful.
- Be careful.

661
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,679
I didn't expect it...

662
00:36:16,399 --> 00:36:17,919
Sisi, I love you so much.

663
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,080
That was such a great fake move.

664
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:21,600
Actually I didn't expect it either.

665
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,040
- Right.
- We won Flyer.

666
00:36:30,399 --> 00:36:31,439
What's for dinner?

667
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:33,280
Shen Zhengyi treat us the dinner,

668
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:33,840
okay?

669
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:46,199
- Sisi.
- Sisi.

670
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,080
Don't cry, don't cry.

671
00:36:58,879 --> 00:37:00,520
Sorry, mom.

672
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,280
What are you talking about, kid?

673
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,520
You gave up your chance of winning

674
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,719
to your teammate.

675
00:37:05,479 --> 00:37:06,320
You are awesome.

676
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,080
I don't...

677
00:37:08,479 --> 00:37:09,639
I don't want to retire

678
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:11,520
without getting even one gold medal.

679
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:14,639
But I tried.

680
00:37:15,919 --> 00:37:16,600
Sisi.

681
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:18,560
It doesn't matter if
you win a gold medal,

682
00:37:19,479 --> 00:37:21,120
silver medal or bronze medal.

683
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:23,239
Even if you didn't win any medals,

684
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,959
mom and dad also think that

685
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,560
you are the best!

686
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,719
Right, your mom is right.

687
00:37:29,399 --> 00:37:30,639
With medals or not,

688
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,360
my daughter did her farewell competition

689
00:37:32,439 --> 00:37:33,000
so well,

690
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:34,120
I am proud of you for my whole life.

691
00:37:35,919 --> 00:37:37,560
But I don't...

692
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,040
It doesn't look good to cry.

693
00:37:39,479 --> 00:37:40,159
Stop crying.

694
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:40,800
Alright, kid.

695
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:41,639
Let's go home.

696
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:42,719
Mom will cook you something delicious.

697
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,280
It's okay.

698
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,719
Calm down, calm down.

699
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,000
This is the first time

700
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:54,560
that I see a real gold medal.

701
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:55,760
Slow down, be careful.

702
00:37:55,879 --> 00:37:56,840
Yiyi, you and your teammate

703
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,280
are so awesome!

704
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,159
Show your mom the gold medal.

705
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:02,040
Show it to your mom.

706
00:38:04,439 --> 00:38:05,000
Mom.

707
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,959
The decision

708
00:38:06,959 --> 00:38:07,959
of your daughter is right.

709
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,000
It's not a big deal.

710
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,439
I am telling you, Shen Zhengyi.

711
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,760
If you have an injury or something,

712
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:17,679
I'll stop you from practicing.

713
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:19,959
Could you say anything nice?

714
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:21,439
Who was shouting

715
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:22,439
in the stands?

716
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,280
It was so loud

717
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,399
that it almost deafened me.

718
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,959
Why are you garrulous right now?

719
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,000
You did it well

720
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:32,800
this time.

721
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,040
Thank you, mom.

722
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,080
Mom, I am telling you.

723
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:37,040
This gold medal doesn't mean anything.

724
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,000
For me,

725
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:38,840
your encouragement

726
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,399
is much more valuable than that.

727
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,320
Mom.

728
00:38:42,439 --> 00:38:43,679
You just came to
see me racing,

729
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,879
why are you dressed so nicely?

730
00:38:46,399 --> 00:38:47,399
You should keep an eye on her.

731
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,760
She's so pretty and gentle.

732
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:50,239
What if someone else

733
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:50,760
took her from you?

734
00:38:50,919 --> 00:38:51,399
Yes, exactly.

735
00:38:51,479 --> 00:38:52,360
I should keep an eye on her.

736
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:53,600
Alright.

737
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,239
Your ability to flatter

738
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,040
is good now.

739
00:38:57,919 --> 00:38:58,479
Of course.

740
00:38:58,479 --> 00:38:59,639
Who is the one I learned it from?

741
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,120
There is the only one

742
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:02,040
family skill we have.

743
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:04,800
Yiyi.

744
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,000
Let's go home.

745
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,239
Dad will cook

746
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,080
your favorite food

747
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:08,919
to treat you well.

748
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,399
Go home, now?

749
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,520
Your face

750
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:14,600
is so skinny now.

751
00:39:14,959 --> 00:39:15,919
Mom and dad are worried about you.

752
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:18,679
No, no.

753
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:19,959
I don't want to go home.

754
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:20,919
Do you have anything to do?

755
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:22,000
What do you want to do?

756
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:22,840
Hurry to go home.

757
00:39:22,919 --> 00:39:24,159
What are you two doing here?

758
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:24,800
Let's go.

759
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:26,679
Well...

760
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:27,800
Wait.

761
00:39:28,479 --> 00:39:29,479
Dad, hold that for me.

762
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,199
I suddenly remembered

763
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,959
I left something in there.

764
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:33,080
I'll go get it.

765
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,120
Wait for me.

766
00:39:34,879 --> 00:39:35,959
Just go and get back.

767
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,600
You just told our daughter that

768
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:39,600
I clapped my hands

769
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,439
and shouted on the stands.

770
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:41,399
Annoying!

771
00:39:41,439 --> 00:39:42,520
You're rarely that excited.

772
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,360
Why are you being so?

773
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,280
The thrill

774
00:39:45,399 --> 00:39:46,959
sometimes is good for the heart.

775
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:48,320
You...

776
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:54,719
Shen Zhengyi.

777
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,719
It's for you.

778
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:10,959
Congratulations, champion!

779
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,399
I saw you when I was

780
00:40:12,479 --> 00:40:13,040
receiving the award.

781
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:13,840
Why did you

782
00:40:13,959 --> 00:40:14,879
disappear in a second?

783
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,239
I saw your parents being there.

784
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:17,479
Tell me.

785
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:18,600
How are you going to celebrate today?

786
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,479
I'll be with you.

787
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,560
I have to celebrate with my parents.

788
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:24,320
They are here.

789
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:25,879
Never mind.

790
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,159
Then I'll wait for you tonight.

791
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,639
Not even tonight.

792
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:31,239
I'll have a victory party

793
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,520
with the girls of the
Short Track Speed Skating team.

794
00:40:33,479 --> 00:40:34,320
Come on.

795
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,879
I came all the way here

796
00:40:35,959 --> 00:40:36,560
to see you,

797
00:40:36,679 --> 00:40:37,439
you are not even there for me.

798
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,239
Tomorrow...

799
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,600
Tomorrow we can celebrate together.

800
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,639
What am I going to do today?

801
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:43,520
Today you...

802
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,280
Today you...

803
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:45,959
You have to make it up to me.

804
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,239
Yiyi.

805
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:08,560
What do you have to get?

806
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,080
What takes you so long?

807
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:11,879
Who's it?

808
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:12,679
My dad.

809
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:13,639
Your dad?

810
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,159
No, no way.

811
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:18,040
Yiyi.

812
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:19,879
What do you have to get?

813
00:41:19,959 --> 00:41:20,879
It takes that long.

814
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,159
Do you need my help?

815
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:23,959
No, no.

816
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,719
Why is your face so red?

817
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:27,560
Are you sick?
Do you have a fever?

818
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:28,840
No.

819
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:30,040
How can I have a fever?

820
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:30,760
Let's go, dad.

821
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:33,280
Where did those flowers come from?

822
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:39,000
From my fan.

823
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:40,199
From my fan.

824
00:41:40,479 --> 00:41:41,159
The fan adores me very much.

825
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:41,879
I came back to get

826
00:41:41,959 --> 00:41:42,600
these flowers.

827
00:41:43,159 --> 00:41:44,840
My daughter has fans now.

828
00:41:46,399 --> 00:41:47,239
Your mother is worried.

829
00:41:47,399 --> 00:41:48,080
Alright, alright.

830
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,159
What am I hiding from?

831
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,040
Isn't it a good chance

832
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,000
to meet her parents?

833
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,460
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team of
Lingbei University)

834
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,800
Come in.

835
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:34,919
Mom.

836
00:42:37,959 --> 00:42:38,760
What are you doing here?

837
00:42:39,239 --> 00:42:39,919
Why didn't I see you

838
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:40,919
at the final?

839
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,560
I ran into an acquaintance

840
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:45,280
and had a chat.

841
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,919
Why didn't you

842
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:48,639
go celebrate with Zhengyi?

843
00:42:48,679 --> 00:42:49,560
Why are you here?

844
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,600
Forget it.

845
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,199
She was picked up by her parents.

846
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,520
She wouldn't celebrate with me.
