=Episode 6=

3
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,680
It is right,

4
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,839
but can you get your hands

5
00:01:40,919 --> 00:01:41,680
away from mine?

6
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:42,879
We have the contract.

7
00:01:44,279 --> 00:01:45,319
I forgot about it.

8
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,360
Don't think too much.

9
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,319
I will try it by myself.

10
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:55,720
Like this.

11
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,120
Kick it out like this.

12
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,360
What are you laughing at?

13
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:07,440
You are like an idiot.

14
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:11,839
I'm in a good mood today,

15
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:12,960
so I won't argue with you.

16
00:02:13,679 --> 00:02:14,960
Come on. Let's have a race.

17
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,720
Hurry.

18
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:16,360
So

19
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:17,320
you are the red team

20
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:17,919
and I'm like this.

21
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:18,720
Hurry!

22
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,720
It's like paper wars.

23
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,160
Whatever.

24
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,160
Go ahead. Hurry up.

25
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,039
Come on.

26
00:02:27,119 --> 00:02:28,240
Ready.

27
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:32,919
3000 meters. Winner.

28
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,800
Let's watch curling instead.

29
00:02:55,279 --> 00:02:56,800
How did she surpass?

30
00:03:03,279 --> 00:03:04,440
(Increasing the range of arm swing)

31
00:03:04,679 --> 00:03:05,880
(means she is going to speed up.)

32
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,320
(She wants to surpass
the person in front of her.)

33
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,000
(Is it inner track or outer track?)

34
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,479
(She's moving towards inner track)

35
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:12,639
(and holding on to it.)

36
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:15,360
(She didn't control the
speed well during turning.)

37
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,399
(Once the radius of turning increases,)

38
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:18,839
(the inner track will be empty.)

39
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,370
(Analysis of the competition process
of other players)

40
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,039
(There's not just me)

41
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:38,039
(on the whole race course.)

42
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,839
(I shall learn how to
suppress interference)

43
00:03:40,279 --> 00:03:42,080
(and watch other people's
movement carefully.)

44
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:44,440
(Feel and judge.)

45
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:45,919
(Shen Zhengyi,)

46
00:03:46,119 --> 00:03:47,279
(you can do this.)

47
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:01,360
Are you really sure that

48
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:02,440
she has already overcome it?

49
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,839
You can tell by yourself.

50
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,160
It seems you have achieved the goal

51
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:17,359
of letting her join the teens' class.

52
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,600
From next week on,

53
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,279
let her re-start the training.

54
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,279
Got it, Coach Zhuang.

55
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:33,839
Look,

56
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,519
it's all your favorite.

57
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,760
Eat more.

58
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,160
Eat more.

59
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,440
You should eat

60
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,239
elegantly as a girl.

61
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,320
Did you starve yourself at school?

62
00:04:48,799 --> 00:04:49,440
I've consumed too much

63
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:50,880
energy for training recently.

64
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,440
Training?

65
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,600
What training?

66
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,320
I... I've been on a diet

67
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,559
with Zhu Lele.

68
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,600
Running.

69
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:04,600
And I didn't eat a lot.

70
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,920
You are not fat.

71
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,279
Why would you be on a diet?

72
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,799
She's so fat.

73
00:05:11,559 --> 00:05:12,559
But mostly it's because

74
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,480
my mom is so good at cooking.

75
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,399
Who can say no in front of

76
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,519
such delicious food?

77
00:05:16,239 --> 00:05:17,399
Look at our little girl.

78
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:18,200
She is such a sweet girl,

79
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,440
just like someone.

80
00:05:19,559 --> 00:05:20,880
Who did she get that gene from?

81
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,679
You're welcome.

82
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:22,440
You are praising yourself again.

83
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:23,279
I'm flattered.

84
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:24,920
I will go get some vinegar.

85
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,799
I will go.

86
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,079
Be careful.

87
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,119
Why are you so restless?

88
00:05:34,239 --> 00:05:35,079
Come on.

89
00:05:36,239 --> 00:05:37,000
Let me see.

90
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:39,959
No, no. It's fine.

91
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:40,959
I'm fine.

92
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:41,679
What are you hiding from?

93
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:42,920
Nothing. Mom, I'm fine.

94
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:43,839
I'm fine.

95
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,279
What's wrong with you?

96
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,799
Shen Jiacheng, come take a look.

97
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,200
What's wrong with your leg?

98
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,600
I'm fine.

99
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,519
Did anyone bully you

100
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,279
at school?

101
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,839
No. Who dares to

102
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,079
bully me?

103
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:58,279
I just always bump into the stairs

104
00:05:58,359 --> 00:05:59,959
when I go to bed

105
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,640
and my leg gets hit.

106
00:06:00,799 --> 00:06:02,119
You're lucky that it's just leg.

107
00:06:02,359 --> 00:06:03,440
What if you hit your head?

108
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:04,720
Why does this kid

109
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,160
make me worry so much?

110
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:07,279
Darling,

111
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,040
there's a medical box under our bed.

112
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,040
There's Yunnan Baiyao in it.

113
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,239
Go get some and I will apply for her.

114
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,679
How did you promise me?

115
00:06:20,119 --> 00:06:20,720
Why did you make yourself

116
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,160
hurt this much?

117
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,760
There were exceptional circumstances,

118
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:24,600
but now I can train

119
00:06:24,799 --> 00:06:25,799
on ice.

120
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,519
So shouldn't you

121
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,640
congratulate me?

122
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
How can I be happy

123
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,320
to see that your

124
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,440
leg gets hurt like this?

125
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,519
I promise that

126
00:06:32,679 --> 00:06:33,480
I will never get hurt again.

127
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,480
I will protect myself well for sure.

128
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,239
Don't worry.

129
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,000
Have some shrimps.

130
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,119
Peel a shrimp for me.

131
00:06:41,239 --> 00:06:42,279
Safety first.

132
00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:43,600
I see.

133
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,000
Drama Club.

134
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:01,080
(Drama Club)

135
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,800
Come in.

136
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,630
‍(Drama Club)

137
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:22,519
Well... Hi.

138
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,880
Have you seen F4

139
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,200
from the Drama Club?

140
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,000
That's us.

141
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:30,440
You...

142
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,440
You don't seem like F4.

143
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,160
Miss, what's wrong with us?

144
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,160
The position.

145
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,519
Right, the position is wrong.

146
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,880
Miss, does it look okay now?

147
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,880
I'm Gong Zi.

148
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,480
They call me Curly Hair.

149
00:08:07,359 --> 00:08:08,600
The ace of PE department,

150
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,600
Warrior.

151
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,160
Sorry.

152
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:14,959
Stay there, miss.

153
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,519
It seems that

154
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,559
you have our flyer.

155
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,359
You must be here to sign up.

156
00:08:20,239 --> 00:08:21,480
Aren't you going to
re-considerate it again?

157
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:24,160
Wang Jun.

158
00:08:24,679 --> 00:08:25,359
There's Wang Jun,

159
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:26,519
so there's hope.

160
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,920
Where is Wang Jun?

161
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,799
Sorry but

162
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,080
who is Wang Jun?

163
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,520
Wang Jun...

164
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,599
I don't know

165
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,520
what his nickname is.

166
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,280
He is the one who gave it

167
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:38,919
to me the other day.

168
00:08:39,239 --> 00:08:40,280
He should be the other

169
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,119
one of the Drama Club.

170
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,119
President.

171
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:45,159
Miss,

172
00:08:45,239 --> 00:08:46,400
you are talking about our president.

173
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,520
Our president is very talented.

174
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,640
From composing,

175
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:51,799
directing,

176
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:52,679
to acting,

177
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,119
he's good at everything.

178
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,599
As long as there's a show,

179
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,239
he would definitely be the first one.

180
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,000
He picks the hardest character

181
00:08:59,599 --> 00:09:01,719
and memorizes the longest script.

182
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,719
So he is the president.

183
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,000
Miss, what are you waiting for?

184
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:09,239
Come to sign here

185
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,719
and join us.

186
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,119
I'm coming.

187
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,919
Here.

188
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,200
Right, right.

189
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,719
Sign your name. That's right.

190
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,000
(Zhu Lele)

191
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,840
I will fill out the rest for you.

192
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:20,679
I will do it for you.

193
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,760
So enthusiastic.

194
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:27,479
We have a new member?

195
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:28,880
President.

196
00:09:29,239 --> 00:09:29,719
A girl.

197
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,840
Look, a girl.

198
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,559
She is new.

199
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:32,239
A girl.

200
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:47,520
What are you looking at?

201
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,679
And you even made such pose

202
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:50,320
to embarrass me.

203
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:51,239
Well...

204
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,679
you, you, you

205
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:53,400
and you.

206
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:54,640
I'm quitting the club.

207
00:09:57,599 --> 00:10:00,000
You should calm down first

208
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:01,200
and take a walk around.

209
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:03,239
We will have a discussion.

210
00:10:03,599 --> 00:10:04,200
It won't be long.

211
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,799
Alright? It won't be long.

212
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,760
I knew her before.

213
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,559
She's just an athlete

214
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:11,919
with simple mindset

215
00:10:12,359 --> 00:10:12,960
and well-developed body.

216
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,640
No offense.

217
00:10:15,119 --> 00:10:15,719
I know.

218
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,599
Anyway, she doesn't
know how to act at all.

219
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,960
Are you sure that you
are going to keep her here?

220
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:22,400
Do we have

221
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,520
other choices?

222
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:25,679
If we cannot find a new member,

223
00:10:26,119 --> 00:10:27,039
our Drama Club

224
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:28,520
will be removed by the school.

225
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,719
Although she doesn't look normal

226
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:34,400
with unstable emotion,

227
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:38,400
and even a little

228
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,960
stupid,

229
00:10:41,119 --> 00:10:42,719
she's at least a girl.

230
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:43,559
Right.

231
00:10:44,119 --> 00:10:45,440
At least she's a girl.

232
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:46,520
If we have her,

233
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,640
I would not have to
play the female character.

234
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:50,159
Besides, the show is to come soon.

235
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:50,960
Right.

236
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:51,919
So far for our recruitment,

237
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,400
she is the only one.

238
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:54,479
Right.

239
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:55,239
A girl.

240
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,159
Let's keep her here.

241
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,119
- A girl.
- A girl.

242
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,880
Have you done discussing?

243
00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:08,840
I

244
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,640
will

245
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,520
quit

246
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,479
the club.

247
00:11:13,119 --> 00:11:14,000
Why?

248
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,520
Why?

249
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,479
How could you ask me that?

250
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,000
How to call people like you guys?

251
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:21,840
Such hypocritical

252
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,919
liars.

253
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:24,840
I thought I could see F4 of Drama Club.

254
00:11:25,599 --> 00:11:26,400
Where are the hot guys?

255
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,239
Well...

256
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,520
It's us on that poster.

257
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,359
You...

258
00:11:31,119 --> 00:11:32,080
Calm down.

259
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,080
So here's the thing.

260
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:35,640
According to the rules,

261
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,719
you submitted the application form

262
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:37,400
and I confirmed it.

263
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:38,559
So you are an official member

264
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,520
of our Drama Club now.

265
00:11:39,719 --> 00:11:40,320
We do not allow

266
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:41,799
members to quit the club.

267
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:42,880
My dear.

268
00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:44,159
Application form?

269
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:45,359
Where is my application form?

270
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:46,200
Don't give it to her.

271
00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:47,320
Give me my application form.

272
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,080
My application form.

273
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:49,039
I...

274
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,159
It hurts.

275
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,000
Let go of me.

276
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,599
I will once you give it to me.

277
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,440
I will give it to you once you let go.

278
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,760
Calm down.

279
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:05,760
Think it over.

280
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:06,960
Now you need us

281
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:08,440
rather than

282
00:12:08,599 --> 00:12:09,520
we need you.

283
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,119
You need to find a right place

284
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,280
to show yourself.

285
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,359
Don't you like hot guys?

286
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,559
All the hot guys at school

287
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,559
will focus on your performance

288
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:21,239
and you will catch their eyes.

289
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:24,520
It's a lie.

290
00:12:24,599 --> 00:12:25,359
I don't believe it.

291
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:26,280
I'm not lying to you.

292
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,200
I'm inviting you sincerely

293
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:29,320
to join us.

294
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,559
We, Drama Club,

295
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,679
will make you the unique

296
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,159
leading actress
that is beloved everywhere.

297
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,599
We can offer you

298
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:37,880
the largest stage.

299
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,359
Wait, larger than this.

300
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,400
The brightest light

301
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,359
will only focus on you.

302
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:47,440
Stop.

303
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:50,880
Maybe this will be a new turning point

304
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,640
of your life.

305
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,119
Maybe you will start

306
00:12:53,359 --> 00:12:54,640
your art life from now on.

307
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,080
Never underestimate yourself.

308
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,960
Maybe you are quite a material

309
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,280
for leading actress

310
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,880
and you haven't found it out.

311
00:13:02,119 --> 00:13:02,960
However, we found out

312
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,000
the shiny point on you.

313
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:07,039
Think about it well

314
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,960
and do not make yourself

315
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,880
regret in the future.

316
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:13,679
Okay.

317
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:14,919
I announce that

318
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,000
she is the only leading actress

319
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,840
in our Drama Club.

320
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:18,760
Okay.

321
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:40,719
Lele,

322
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,880
I'm back.

323
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:45,760
Lele.

324
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,159
You're back.

325
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,359
Good news.

326
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,359
Coach Zhuang allowed
me to train on the ice.

327
00:13:54,479 --> 00:13:55,559
I can get on the ice tomorrow.

328
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,200
Really?

329
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,799
That's wonderful.

330
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,119
Baby,

331
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,559
what's wrong with you?

332
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,400
Are you sick?

333
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,400
I went to the Drama Club
for an interview today.

334
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:15,840
What happened?

335
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,799
You failed?

336
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,479
I passed.

337
00:14:23,119 --> 00:14:23,760
Come on.

338
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,599
This is not how you react

339
00:14:24,719 --> 00:14:25,520
when you see hot guys normally.

340
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:27,080
Hot guys?

341
00:14:28,359 --> 00:14:29,599
Just so so.

342
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,080
I feel that

343
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:39,159
I was deceived.

344
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,479
So this Qu Zhi is

345
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,000
the president of the Drama Club.

346
00:14:49,719 --> 00:14:50,799
But he majors in biology.

347
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,359
It must be his hobby.

348
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,320
You only have five members.

349
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,960
Can you really play a show?

350
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:56,119
Forget about it.

351
00:14:56,239 --> 00:14:58,039
I have no way to turn back.

352
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,159
Shen Zhengyi,

353
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,280
why are you so slow?

354
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,440
Can you run faster?

355
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,159
Such a turtle speed.

356
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,520
Speed up.

357
00:15:06,479 --> 00:15:06,799
Wait,

358
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,200
why does your boyfriend

359
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,840
do nothing but talk bad about you

360
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,200
or give you orders?

361
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,039
I remember that you

362
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:14,479
liked him so much that you
even stopped eating ribs.

363
00:15:15,239 --> 00:15:15,719
Sorry.

364
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:17,119
I didn't know
what I was doing at that time.

365
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:18,159
But I feel that Shao Beisheng

366
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,760
really cares about you.

367
00:15:20,599 --> 00:15:21,400
You are thinking too much.

368
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,559
Then what do you like about him?

369
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:31,440
It hurts.

370
00:15:32,479 --> 00:15:33,000
What's wrong?

371
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,799
Can you move?

372
00:15:34,479 --> 00:15:35,239
No, no.

373
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,280
Let her try on her own

374
00:15:36,359 --> 00:15:36,919
and see if she can stand up.

375
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,400
What's wrong? Are you okay?

376
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,200
It seems that
Zhengyi has sprained her feet.

377
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,039
Don't move.

378
00:15:41,359 --> 00:15:41,960
It's okay.

379
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,359
Don't move for now.

380
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,719
I will send you to the medical office.

381
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:45,880
Hurry up. Get up.

382
00:15:46,239 --> 00:15:47,280
- It's okay.
- Hurry up.

383
00:15:47,359 --> 00:15:48,039
Take a look.

384
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,039
The game is to start soon.

385
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,200
Slow down.

386
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:52,880
You can continue with training.

387
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,440
Beisheng,

388
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,000
why did someone else

389
00:15:55,119 --> 00:15:56,080
take your girlfriend?

390
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,320
It is a slight sprain.

391
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:23,440
Do you hurt

392
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,000
anywhere else?

393
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,080
No.

394
00:16:26,479 --> 00:16:27,080
OK.

395
00:16:27,719 --> 00:16:28,479
I've got another student there

396
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:29,039
being sick.

397
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,200
I have to follow to the hospital.

398
00:16:30,599 --> 00:16:31,239
Put ice here for a moment,

399
00:16:31,359 --> 00:16:32,039
and put some medicine on her.

400
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:32,640
She should be fine.

401
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:34,239
Okay. Please feel free to leave.

402
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,039
Okay.

403
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,719
Thank you.

404
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:37,440
It's fine.

405
00:16:37,479 --> 00:16:38,280
Thank you, Doctor Liu.

406
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,719
What is wrong with your hand?

407
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:48,200
Nothing. I sprained it the other day.

408
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:50,039
The day when you were training
the teens' class?

409
00:16:53,119 --> 00:16:53,719
Zhengyi,

410
00:16:54,239 --> 00:16:55,000
there's nothing more important

411
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,479
for athletes than to protect

412
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:56,919
their own bodies.

413
00:16:58,039 --> 00:16:58,640
I've got some medicine

414
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,760
that I use for sprain.

415
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,000
It's quite effective

416
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:01,799
and I will bring it to you tomorrow.

417
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:03,599
Thank you, Coach Xiao.

418
00:17:11,479 --> 00:17:12,079
Coach Xiao,

419
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,319
if I can stay

420
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,800
in Wind Chaser this time,

421
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,040
can I treat you a meal?

422
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,400
I'm really thankful to you.

423
00:17:21,239 --> 00:17:21,719
What's there to thank me for?

424
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,599
It's all part of my job.

425
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,199
If you are not here,

426
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,359
there's no way for me
to join Wind Chaser,

427
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,239
not to mention this opportunity.

428
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:30,680
Also, when I fell off into the lake
the other day,

429
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:31,760
I was lucky that you were there.

430
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,160
Otherwise I would've died.

431
00:17:33,959 --> 00:17:34,800
Lake?

432
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,719
It wasn't me who saved you.

433
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:40,719
It was Shao Beisheng
from Figure Skating Team

434
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:42,479
who saved you.

435
00:17:43,439 --> 00:17:44,079
What?

436
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:47,880
Are you okay?

437
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,439
Can I take her away

438
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,640
if she's alright?

439
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,280
Yes.

440
00:17:59,239 --> 00:17:59,880
Come on.

441
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,119
(How is it possible?)

442
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,640
(How could he be the one
who saved my life?)

443
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:28,959
Could you please always

444
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:30,119
remember who you are?

445
00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:32,719
You are my girlfriend.

446
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:34,000
You cannot mess up with

447
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:34,599
others.

448
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,520
If such things happen again,

449
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:36,400
you have to tell me first,

450
00:18:36,479 --> 00:18:37,000
understand?

451
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,560
Could you just eat less?

452
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:42,520
Carrying you on my back

453
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:43,920
is more tiring than lifting two girls.

454
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,599
What's wrong with you today?

455
00:18:51,479 --> 00:18:52,400
Why didn't you talk back?

456
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:54,319
What you said is true.

457
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,920
Why should I talk back?

458
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:00,359
Then, I'll just say one more thing.

459
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,079
You stay away from Xiao Han.

460
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,719
Understand?

461
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,680
How is that possible? He's my coach.

462
00:19:11,199 --> 00:19:13,040
I heard from Coach Xiao that

463
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,959
it was you who saved me the other day.

464
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:18,239
You just knew about that?

465
00:19:19,719 --> 00:19:20,160
Sorry.

466
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:22,359
I should have thanked you well.

467
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,719
It's fine.

468
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:25,880
I was just passing by

469
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:27,439
and that person happened to be you.

470
00:19:27,479 --> 00:19:28,400
That's why I saved you.

471
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,560
Don't imagine

472
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,439
some kind of scene

473
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,640
where the hero saves the beauty
and they fall in love with each other.

474
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:34,959
Otherwise you will get yourself trapped.

475
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,800
Just a friendly reminder.

476
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,920
I just want to thank you.

477
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,199
I don't have any other thoughts.

478
00:19:44,719 --> 00:19:45,400
Nothing else?

479
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,599
It was so cold the other day.

480
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,439
The lake was so deep.

481
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:51,920
I was risking my life to save you

482
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,400
and all you say is thank you?

483
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:55,520
Do you know that

484
00:19:55,719 --> 00:19:56,160
you were almost dying

485
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,079
when you got out of water?

486
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:59,079
Who did cardiac compression for you?

487
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,239
Who did artificial respiration for you?

488
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:01,400
Who saved you from...?

489
00:20:01,479 --> 00:20:02,400
Wait.

490
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:08,079
Artificial respiration?

491
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:11,520
How did you do it?

492
00:20:13,239 --> 00:20:14,040
How else could I have done it?

493
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:15,959
Just...

494
00:20:16,719 --> 00:20:17,280
Just...

495
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,439
Like that.

496
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,719
Shen... Shen Zhengyi,

497
00:20:27,199 --> 00:20:27,920
wait. What else could I have done

498
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,079
when you were already like that?

499
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,719
(My first kiss!)

500
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,560
I was just trying to find you.

501
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,400
Help me

502
00:20:48,479 --> 00:20:49,199
get two tickets to the music drama

503
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,239
I will send you the link.

504
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,640
What happened?

505
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,239
I failed the exam.

506
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,680
It's true this time.

507
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,760
Restrain your grief.

508
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,760
Let me teach you something new.

509
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,680
You should find something else

510
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,959
to distract yourself

511
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:04,920
when you have failed the exam.

512
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,560
Like, you can help me

513
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,520
get ticket to the music drama.

514
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:09,640
Come on.

515
00:21:09,719 --> 00:21:10,079
Really.

516
00:21:10,199 --> 00:21:11,599
I have no quota available.

517
00:21:17,439 --> 00:21:18,439
Artificial respiration?

518
00:21:19,719 --> 00:21:20,719
How did you do it?

519
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:22,239
How else could I have done?

520
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,479
Just...

521
00:21:31,439 --> 00:21:32,119
Shen... Shen Zhengyi,

522
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,280
wait. What else could I have done

523
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:34,400
when you were already like that?

524
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,719
It was so embarrassing.

525
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:39,000
Why did I

526
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:39,920
spill it out?

527
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,079
What should I do when I see her again?

528
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,680
Bro,

529
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:50,199
emergency.

530
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,239
Do me a favor.

531
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:51,719
What?

532
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:53,040
Help me get a ticket to the music drama.

533
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,880
It's super difficult to get one.

534
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:57,119
Alright.

535
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,280
Use the speed that you skate with

536
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,000
to help me get one.

537
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:01,959
What does it have anything
to do with my feet?

538
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,000
Anyway, just get one for me.

539
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,199
Get your phone.

540
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,680
I will send you the link.

Shen Zhengyi,

554
00:24:42,479 --> 00:24:43,119
see for yourself.

555
00:24:43,199 --> 00:24:44,520
What did you do this early morning?

556
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:46,439
It looks good

557
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:47,920
like this.

558
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:51,000
I had a nightmare.

559
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,160
Are you okay?

560
00:24:53,479 --> 00:24:54,839
Why are you so blushed?

561
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,920
Zhengyi, do you have a fever?

562
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,119
Do I?

563
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:04,680
Check it out.

564
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,880
(Shen Zhengyi, are you crazy?)

565
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:14,839
(Why would you have)

566
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,079
(such a scary dream?)

567
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,680
(It is artificial respiration,)

568
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,520
(rather than a kiss.)

569
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:19,479
(Calm down.)

570
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,119
It's too hot.

571
00:25:27,239 --> 00:25:27,920
Sit there.

572
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:32,119
It's hot.

573
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:42,079
This is for you.

574
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:43,680
Here you are.

575
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:44,640
Shao Beisheng.

576
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,520
Shao Beisheng.

577
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,479
Shao Beisheng.

578
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,040
What?

579
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,479
Come and sit here.

580
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,280
Together.

581
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,040
(Shen Zhengyi, calm down.)

582
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,959
(It is just an artificial respiration.)

583
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:00,959
(Nothing huge.)

584
00:26:19,719 --> 00:26:21,160
What's wrong?

585
00:26:22,959 --> 00:26:23,680
I tried to get a ticket

586
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:25,040
but I failed.

587
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:26,959
Why is it so hard to get a ticket?

588
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,160
It's a ticket to the music drama.

589
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,880
You are going to music drama?

590
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,110
‍(Two Elephants.)

591
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:37,560
Two Elephants.

592
00:26:38,239 --> 00:26:39,680
How would the actors perform that?

593
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,160
What's wrong?

594
00:26:44,959 --> 00:26:45,959
Why are you so blushed?

595
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,400
Hot.

596
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:55,800
What are you looking at?

597
00:26:56,959 --> 00:26:57,839
What are you looking at?

598
00:26:58,719 --> 00:26:59,439
If you don't look at me,

599
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,400
how do you know I'm looking at you?

600
00:27:05,439 --> 00:27:06,839
If you are allergic,
go to take the medicine.

601
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,239
Have some.

602
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,560
Go away.

603
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,119
Are you going to keep it a secret?

604
00:27:39,239 --> 00:27:40,000
What are you talking about?

605
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,520
Based on my experience

606
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:43,920
as a relationship expert,

607
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:45,040
I can conclude that

608
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,079
you two must be fighting.

609
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:48,760
Am I right?

610
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,479
No.

611
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,920
You keep it from me.

612
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,479
You didn't want to look at him today.

613
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:55,400
Did he upset you?

614
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:56,839
As far as I'm concerned,

615
00:27:57,119 --> 00:27:58,199
you are too well-tempered.

616
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,560
If I have a boyfriend like him

617
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,040
who talks to himself
all the time

618
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:01,920
and treats his girlfriend as a servant,

619
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,079
I will certainly burst out.

620
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,839
We really didn't fight.

621
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,599
I'm just

622
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,800
facing some issues

623
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,119
and I can't think it through,

624
00:28:12,719 --> 00:28:13,800
so I don't know what to do.

625
00:28:14,199 --> 00:28:14,719
See?

626
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:16,079
I know that there's something wrong.

627
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,160
Come on. Tell me about it.

628
00:28:18,479 --> 00:28:19,239
I will help you with it.

629
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,319
I made a joke.

630
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:30,920
Can you stop laughing?

631
00:28:31,239 --> 00:28:31,839
So annoying.

632
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,119
How can you not be aware

633
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:35,599
that your life-saver is your boyfriend?

634
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,839
No wonder you would get into a fight.

635
00:28:37,239 --> 00:28:38,640
We are not having a fight.

636
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,400
It's just a little awkward.

637
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,119
Actually, I can get how he feels.

638
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,280
Shao Beisheng

639
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,400
is such a proud man.

640
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:45,439
How can he not get mad?

641
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,439
Why would he get mad?

642
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,359
It is not my fault.

643
00:28:47,439 --> 00:28:48,319
I passed out at that time.

644
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,439
Wait,

645
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,599
as you say,

646
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,319
it should be Shao Beisheng

647
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,400
who is mad.

648
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,560
What are you upset about then?

649
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,599
Or

650
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,160
did anything happen between you two

651
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,839
that you didn't tell me about?

652
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,359
No.

653
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,040
I... I

654
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:04,839
just feel that
things happened out of a sudden.

655
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:07,199
I didn't expect the person
who saved my life is him.

656
00:29:07,719 --> 00:29:09,079
Although I thank him a lot
deep inside my heart,

657
00:29:09,199 --> 00:29:09,880
I don't know

658
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
how to pay him back.

659
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,520
Aren't you boyfriend and girlfriend?

660
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:14,920
What do you mean by not knowing

661
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,959
how to pay him back?

662
00:29:16,199 --> 00:29:16,880
I think that

663
00:29:17,199 --> 00:29:18,160
he is too narrow-minded.

664
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,439
Why wouldn't he just tell you?

665
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,319
Why would he just hide it from you?

666
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,359
Why would he keep it such a secret?

667
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:22,839
Isn't it normal for boyfriend

668
00:29:22,959 --> 00:29:23,880
to do something for girlfriend?

669
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,239
No.

670
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,079
There's no such thing

671
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:27,920
as liable efforts.

672
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,040
I don't want to feel indebted,

673
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,680
especially for Shao Beisheng.

674
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:40,239
Wasn't he trying to

675
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:41,479
get a ticket to the music drama?

676
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,000
Come on,

677
00:29:47,199 --> 00:29:48,000
use my phone

678
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:48,719
to get one more.

679
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,280
Same process.

680
00:29:49,479 --> 00:29:50,000
The same process.

681
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:51,839
Everyone, try your best please.

682
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,119
As long as anyone gets one,

683
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:54,760
I will treat you dinner,

684
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:55,560
whatever you want.

685
00:29:55,719 --> 00:29:56,760
Okay. No problem.

686
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:57,880
Five.

687
00:29:58,359 --> 00:29:58,839
Four.

688
00:29:59,239 --> 00:29:59,719
Three.

689
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:00,680
Two.

690
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,359
One.

691
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,839
Go ahead.

692
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:07,680
(Sold Out)

693
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:09,959
It's sold out.

694
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,119
Why are other people

695
00:30:15,199 --> 00:30:16,199
so fast?

696
00:30:16,719 --> 00:30:17,439
Did you get it?

697
00:30:17,439 --> 00:30:18,439
No.

698
00:30:18,719 --> 00:30:19,319
No.

699
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:21,199
Neither did you?

700
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:21,880
Neither did I.

701
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:23,800
Same here.

702
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,199
Too hard.

703
00:30:28,439 --> 00:30:29,359
It's so hard.

704
00:30:29,439 --> 00:30:30,000
Okay.

705
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:30,560
Sweetie,

706
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,599
breathe deeply.

707
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,319
It's so hard.

708
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,000
Breathe deeply.

709
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:42,079
It's so hard.

710
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,400
Zheng... Zhengyi, what's wrong?

711
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,640
She is crazy for love.

712
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:47,079
Crazy for love?

713
00:30:54,199 --> 00:30:55,599
Welcome.

714
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,600
(Welcome Zhu Lele)

715
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,200
Drama Club F4

716
00:30:58,479 --> 00:31:00,319
are here for you.

717
00:31:01,439 --> 00:31:02,040
Come on.

718
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:05,640
Have a seat.

719
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,560
Please.

720
00:31:09,719 --> 00:31:10,439
Here. Are you hot?

721
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,680
Here. Take a drink.

722
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:17,560
If you have something,
just say it.

723
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,079
Alright, have a seat.

724
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,359
The thing is that

725
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,319
the Drama Club is requested
by the school

726
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,959
to arrange one show each semester.

727
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:28,680
The main objective of today's meeting

728
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,880
is to discuss

729
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,760
what we should do for this semester.

730
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:38,839
What?

731
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,280
I don't know what to do either.

732
00:31:41,439 --> 00:31:42,119
You are the only

733
00:31:42,239 --> 00:31:43,239
leading actress in our Drama Club.

734
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,239
What do you want to play?

735
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:46,280
Then you are the only president

736
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:47,040
of this Drama Club.

737
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,280
What do you want me to play?

738
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,719
Since I've never seen you acting,

739
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,640
I don't know what kind of acting

740
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,199
you are good at.

741
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,000
How about this? Gong Zi,

742
00:31:58,359 --> 00:31:59,560
get me the script.

743
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,359
You can pick a few paragraphs
that you like

744
00:32:04,439 --> 00:32:06,599
or you think you're good at,

745
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:07,959
and read it to us.

746
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,400
Exactly, you can pick one.

747
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,160
Then I will go up there.

748
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:12,000
Okay.

749
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:12,760
Nice. This is nice.

750
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,520
Although it's her first time
to act on stage,

751
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,239
she seems to be at ease.

752
00:32:16,439 --> 00:32:17,040
It's a good thing.

753
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,040
It's nice.

754
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:20,199
You can start whenever you are ready.

755
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,119
Luckily, the night

756
00:32:24,239 --> 00:32:25,479
has put on a mask for me.

757
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,880
Otherwise,

758
00:32:26,959 --> 00:32:27,920
you would have seen

759
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,160
how blushed I was

760
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:30,479
for what you've heard.

761
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,160
I really want to obey the rules...

762
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,680
Well... Zhu Lele,

763
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,040
excuse me. I want to
stop you for a moment.

764
00:32:36,439 --> 00:32:37,119
The thing is that

765
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:39,800
a drama is a performance on stage

766
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,400
after all.

767
00:32:42,439 --> 00:32:43,239
It's different from

768
00:32:43,479 --> 00:32:45,319
how we talk normally

769
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,520
in daily life,

770
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:48,719
right?

771
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:52,079
Can you try to

772
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:56,040
magnify your emotions

773
00:32:56,959 --> 00:32:59,599
a little bit?

774
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:01,640
Let it out more.

775
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:05,160
Can you also add some

776
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,439
body movement

777
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,719
to match the script?

778
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,479
Have a try.

779
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:11,920
I see.

780
00:33:12,239 --> 00:33:13,040
No wonder you are the president.

781
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,680
Well... I will prepare
my mood a little while.

782
00:33:15,959 --> 00:33:16,959
Okay. No hurry.

783
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,599
Let us know if you are ready.

784
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:21,040
I think it might work.

785
00:33:21,439 --> 00:33:22,199
Let's look forward to it.

786
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:32,920
You are ready so soon?

787
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:35,079
Okay.

788
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,640
Three.

789
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,199
Two.

790
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:40,760
One.

791
00:33:41,199 --> 00:33:41,959
Action.

792
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,079
Luckily,

793
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:47,760
the night

794
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:51,040
has put on a mask for me.

795
00:33:51,479 --> 00:33:53,880
Otherwise,

796
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,319
you would have seen

797
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,319
how blushed I was

798
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,359
for what you heard.

799
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:05,680
Do you

800
00:34:07,719 --> 00:34:08,560
love me?

801
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,000
I believe so.

802
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:14,399
You will tell me

803
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,320
yes.

804
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,040
Maybe that oath you made

805
00:34:19,439 --> 00:34:21,879
is just a lie.

806
00:34:22,439 --> 00:34:23,239
People say that

807
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,360
God would laugh it away

808
00:34:26,919 --> 00:34:29,239
while hearing lovers' oath.

809
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,000
Nice. Nice.

810
00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:34,560
Nice.

811
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,520
It works.

812
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,719
Very good.

813
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,719
You don't need to cry.

814
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,600
We are just trying it out.

815
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:41,679
Yeah, I know.

816
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,040
I like it.

817
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,199
It's really good.

818
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:46,320
It's full of emotions.

819
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:47,600
So full.

820
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,520
A better idea

821
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:50,320
suddenly occurred to me.

822
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:52,679
We've done shows

823
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,840
with such strong emotions

824
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,399
every semester.

825
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,679
Exactly.

826
00:34:57,919 --> 00:34:59,600
I was thinking

827
00:34:59,959 --> 00:35:01,159
how about

828
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,760
making a completely new attempt?

829
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,959
How about performing a pantomine?

830
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:07,679
I like it.

831
00:35:07,879 --> 00:35:08,719
Good.

832
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:09,639
This is good.

833
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:10,840
It's more challenging.

834
00:35:11,399 --> 00:35:12,000
What do you think?

835
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:14,840
Then I will try it again.

836
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,239
That's all for today.

837
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,120
You can call it off today.

838
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,760
You can get down now.

839
00:35:19,879 --> 00:35:21,439
Let's sit here together

840
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,239
and have a discussion about it.

841
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:22,919
Yes.

842
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:24,080
Take a rest.

843
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:25,239
Exactly. Have some rest.

844
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,760
I feel a little reluctant

845
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,679
since it's my first time
to get on stage.

846
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,399
Let's go.

847
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:42,520
I gotta go now.

848
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,760
See you, Beisheng.

849
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,600
Morning.

850
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,040
Morning.

851
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,479
I didn't get it again.

852
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:00,679
What?

853
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,320
Two Elephants.

854
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:06,120
Two Elephants?

855
00:36:07,919 --> 00:36:09,199
The ticket to the music drama.

856
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,320
You like music drama?

857
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:14,439
It's not that I like it.

858
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,040
I'm helping Qu Zhi.

859
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:37,639
What is wrong with Zhengyi?

860
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,479
Maybe

861
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,879
it is the lowliness in love.

862
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,719
What do you mean?

863
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,639
She is trying so hard

864
00:36:48,959 --> 00:36:49,879
to help Shao Beisheng get the ticket.

865
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,919
Help Shao Beisheng get the ticket?

866
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,679
It's gone again?

867
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:10,959
I got it!

868
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:15,919
I got it.

869
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:17,959
I got it.

870
00:37:18,879 --> 00:37:19,280
Let me tell you.

871
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,520
Shao Beisheng will be moved so much.

872
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,600
Shen Zhengyi,

873
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:32,879
did you look for me?

874
00:37:33,879 --> 00:37:34,560
Here you are.

875
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,399
What?

876
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,320
Don't tell me

877
00:37:39,959 --> 00:37:40,679
it is a love letter.

878
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:42,439
What love letter?

879
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:43,280
Take it.

880
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,600
It'd better not.

881
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,320
(Ticket to the music drama)

882
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,199
What is this?

883
00:37:49,479 --> 00:37:50,719
Two Elephants.

884
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,199
Two Elephants?

885
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:55,679
Where did you get it?

886
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,320
I couldn't get it at all.

887
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:58,879
Someone gave it to me.

888
00:37:59,439 --> 00:38:00,320
I don't like it anyway,

889
00:38:00,439 --> 00:38:01,239
so you can take it.

890
00:38:01,439 --> 00:38:02,479
Come on.

891
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,199
Giving him is such a waste.

892
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,320
How about giving it to me?

893
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,080
Shut up.

894
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:09,000
Take it.

895
00:38:09,639 --> 00:38:10,239
You really don't want it?

896
00:38:10,959 --> 00:38:12,360
No, I don't like it.

897
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:13,719
You can take it.

898
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:15,080
Making the best use of it.

899
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,479
I couldn't get it
even though I wait in line every day.

900
00:38:18,959 --> 00:38:19,919
Thank you.

901
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:20,959
Happy now?

902
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,919
Alright. It's just one ticket.

903
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:26,080
Why are you so excited?

904
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,399
You don't understand.

905
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,080
It's about art.

906
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:31,760
The seat is so good.

907
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,719
Shen Zhengyi.

908
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,719
Is she a little unhappy?

909
00:38:37,879 --> 00:38:39,080
Qu Zhi.

910
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:53,199
What's wrong?

911
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:55,639
Did you give it to Shao Beisheng?

912
00:38:57,159 --> 00:38:57,919
Yes, I did.

913
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,000
How was it?

914
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,040
Was he touched?

915
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,479
He gave it to Qu Zhi.

916
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:09,239
What?

917
00:39:11,399 --> 00:39:12,560
Alright.

918
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,879
How can he do that?

919
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,439
You were trying so hard
to get it for him.

920
00:39:15,919 --> 00:39:16,919
Not to mention that it's a gift

921
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,040
from his girlfriend.

922
00:39:18,959 --> 00:39:19,679
It's okay.

923
00:39:23,399 --> 00:39:24,159
I've thought it through.

924
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,439
I've done my part

925
00:39:26,919 --> 00:39:28,199
by giving him the ticket.

926
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:29,439
He can do whatever
he likes to do with it.

927
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:30,760
It's his own business.

928
00:39:30,879 --> 00:39:32,199
It has nothing to do with me, right?

929
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:36,879
Too expensive.

930
00:39:41,919 --> 00:39:42,879
Look at you.

931
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,120
Where are you going?

932
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,479
Buy some stuff.

933
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,879
Come back quickly.

934
00:39:55,399 --> 00:39:57,320
I feel so bad.

935
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,560
What's so good about elephants?

936
00:40:06,479 --> 00:40:07,560
Zhengyi,

937
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,320
you are so generous as a girlfriend.

938
00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:11,439
Why do you have to
accommodate yourself to him?

939
00:40:14,439 --> 00:40:15,040
No,

940
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:16,479
he takes care of me well too.

941
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,560
Don't worry. I'm fine.

942
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,120
I'm just a little curious.

943
00:40:22,479 --> 00:40:23,959
Don't you two date?

944
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,919
Of course we do.

945
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,959
But you know... well...

946
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,919
he has to train

947
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,080
and study.

948
00:40:37,439 --> 00:40:38,360
He's busy and I'm busy.

949
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,560
Also, we agree that

950
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:40,879
we can't constrain each other.

951
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,040
But at least you two can eat together.

952
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,479
We did.

953
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,399
You just didn't see it.

954
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:48,439
Oh,

955
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:49,959
Shao Beisheng likes to

956
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,120
take out the scallion whenever he eats.

957
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:52,919
Not many guys do that.

958
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,600
Yeah.

959
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,919
But it's not weird.

960
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:01,840
Everyone

961
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,000
has some weird

962
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,360
little foible.

963
00:41:13,399 --> 00:41:14,159
Zhengyi,

964
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:15,199
are you really

965
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,679
his girlfriend?

966
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,080
Of course, I am.

967
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,120
You... You seem weird today.

968
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:23,479
Why do you gossip so much?

969
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,800
Stop lying.

970
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,560
First of all,

971
00:41:31,919 --> 00:41:33,679
Shao Beisheng likes scallion

972
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,959
and even I know about it.

973
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:36,320
Also,

974
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:38,120
he was trying to
get the ticket for Qu Zhi.

975
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:39,679
If you are really his girlfriend,

976
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,800
how come you don't know about it?

977
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:45,719
Well...

978
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,800
What's going on with you two?

979
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,120
We are just...

980
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,040
I won't tell anyone.

981
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:04,399
Do you not trust me?

982
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:05,560
No.

983
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:09,320
Alright. I will tell you

984
00:42:09,399 --> 00:42:10,120
but don't tell anyone.

985
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:15,360
Actually, we are not real couples.

986
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:18,879
We are just pretending to be.

987
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:20,320
Pretending to be?

988
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:31,000
What's wrong, Zhu Lele?

989
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:31,879
Shao Beisheng,

990
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,280
I always keep you on top

991
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,959
of my Lingbei New Style column.

992
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:35,800
But now

993
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,360
I think you are just a liar.

994
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,040
Do you know how much effort

995
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:39,760
Shen Zhengyi has put

996
00:42:39,879 --> 00:42:40,800
just to get this ticket for you?

997
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,520
She waited day and night

998
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,520
to get the ticket for
you without sleeping.

999
00:42:43,639 --> 00:42:44,840
She finally got it.

1000
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,479
And you just gave it away.
