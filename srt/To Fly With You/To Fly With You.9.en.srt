3
00:01:38,559 --> 00:01:39,120
Coach Zhuang,

4
00:01:39,839 --> 00:01:40,760
the nurse asked us to pay the bill.

5
00:02:00,639 --> 00:02:01,440
How is it going?

6
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,040
We asked a few more experts,

7
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,720
and they have the same opinions.

8
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,160
What do you mean?

9
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,039
I'm afraid his hand...

10
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,559
But Coach Zhuang,

11
00:02:12,839 --> 00:02:13,600
I don't think

12
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,160
he should know about it at the moment.

13
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm afraid he can't accept it.

14
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,320
You mean

15
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,080
he can't play Pairs Skating anymore?

16
00:02:24,559 --> 00:02:25,399
He is young after all.

17
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,880
If he can recuperate well,

18
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,880
he may probably recover, right?

19
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:41,639
Well, did he mention

20
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,600
which ward?

21
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,320
No. 39.

22
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,160
No. 39.

23
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,600
Did he mention how bad it was?

24
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:47,000
- I have no idea.
- Xiao Qing,

25
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:50,160
why are you here

26
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:50,880
alone?

27
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:51,880
Where is Shao Beisheng?

28
00:02:52,119 --> 00:02:53,119
He is in the ward.

29
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,160
How is he?

30
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:54,759
Where did he get hurt?

31
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,600
Is it bad?

32
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,039
He got his hand injured.

33
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:57,639
Probably

34
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,919
he can't play the game anymore.

35
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:01,399
How is it possible?

36
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:01,839
He just got injured.

37
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,720
Why can't he play the game?

38
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:04,559
Where is he?

39
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,119
Take us to him right now.

40
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:05,880
Wait.

41
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:06,720
About the fact that

42
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:07,279
he can't play anymore,

43
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,160
does he know about it?

44
00:03:08,839 --> 00:03:09,639
No, he doesn't.

45
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,479
Don't tell him for now

46
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:13,039
when we're up there.

47
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:15,119
Let's go.

48
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:15,639
OK.

49
00:03:15,839 --> 00:03:16,320
Let's go.

50
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,440
Hurry up!

51
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,030
(Outpatient)

52
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:29,160
Let me help you.

53
00:03:29,399 --> 00:03:30,039
What are you doing here?

54
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,199
It's fine. I've opened it.

55
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,720
Are you okay?

56
00:03:35,119 --> 00:03:35,759
Quite free you are.

57
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:37,440
Still have the time to check on me.

58
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:44,880
You stood us up today.

59
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,399
We agreed to check

60
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,440
whether you were pretending or not.

61
00:03:47,839 --> 00:03:48,320
Look at me now.

62
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:49,320
Am I like pretending?

63
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,600
He looks good now, doesn't he?

64
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:53,600
Yes.

65
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,639
Why?

66
00:03:55,119 --> 00:03:56,119
I'm not that sick.

67
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,000
Are you disappointed?

68
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:00,039
We are not that bored.

69
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,479
Then why are you empty handed?

70
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:06,440
We haven't got the time.

71
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:07,399
What would you like to eat?

72
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,440
I'll buy it now.

73
00:04:10,839 --> 00:04:11,759
I want some tangerine.

74
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:13,720
Let me.

75
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:14,720
It's fine.

76
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,279
Let Shen Zhengyi do it.

77
00:04:21,559 --> 00:04:22,040
I'll do it.

78
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,119
I'll do it.

79
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,600
Peel the tangerine, right?

80
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,600
Hang on a second.

81
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,440
It's a little bit...

82
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:36,720
Hurry.

83
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,440
I can peel faster than you
even with only one hand.

84
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,880
Right away.

85
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,600
Almost done.

86
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:42,920
Take a seat.

87
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:44,920
It's okay.

88
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,399
Why are you looking like this?

89
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,720
I'm fine. Really.

90
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,040
Almost done. Almost done.

91
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:52,040
Here you are. The tangerine.

92
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:55,839
How can I eat it like this?

93
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,200
Then what?
Are you expecting me to feed you?

94
00:04:59,160 --> 00:04:59,880
I get it.

95
00:05:00,119 --> 00:05:01,399
Well, the boyfriend got injured.

96
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,920
He needs his girlfriend to feed him,

97
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:03,720
so he acts coquettishly.

98
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,200
It is very reasonable.

99
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,040
Well, we will

100
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:06,720
leave you two alone.

101
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,839
We gotta go now.

102
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,440
Who is acting coquettishly?

103
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,119
I mean...

104
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:11,839
This is a whole one.

105
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,040
I can't swallow it.

106
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,040
Break it. Break it.

107
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,720
Come on.

108
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,119
Peel it.

109
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:20,880
Don't stop.

110
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,119
Come on.

111
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,440
Don't bother. I'm good.

112
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,440
Come on. Open your mouth.

113
00:05:24,559 --> 00:05:25,480
I'm good. I'm good.

114
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,920
It'll be good for you
to have some tangerine.

115
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,559
I know. I know.

116
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,000
Come on. Come on.

117
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,000
Did I do it well?

118
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,600
Enough. One is enough.

119
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,119
No, no, no.

120
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,880
You can have more.

121
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,200
Have more.

122
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,399
Okay. Enough.

123
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,119
I know.

124
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:36,440
Whatever you want to eat,

125
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,160
we'll buy it for you.

126
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,239
Take it. Come on.

127
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,320
Thank you, nurse.

128
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:56,880
It's late now.

129
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,160
How about you go back?

130
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,279
There are classes tomorrow.

131
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,839
Fine.

132
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:02,559
Take care of yourself then.

133
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,440
Stay put.

134
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:05,239
Then stay and supervise me.

135
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:07,600
I have no class tomorrow.

136
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,720
Let me stay and take care of you.

137
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,079
Don't bother.

138
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,799
I'm not so hurt

139
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:15,160
that I need special care.

140
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,239
Thanks.

141
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,799
Let's go.

142
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,839
Hold on.

143
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,920
I've changed my mind.

144
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:25,079
You stay with me.

145
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,040
Me?

146
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,959
But I... I...

147
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,040
I think it makes a lot of sense.

148
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,079
At this time

149
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:32,160
Zhengyi is needed to stay

150
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,079
and take care of him.

151
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:34,040
Right, Zhengyi?

152
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,920
But tomorrow we...

153
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,160
Yes. Tomorrow,

154
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,600
we only have project homework
to hand in.

155
00:06:37,799 --> 00:06:38,799
And you have finished it already.

156
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:39,679
So it doesn't matter.

157
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:40,720
Just stay

158
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:42,160
and take care of Shao Beisheng, OK?

159
00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:43,160
Okay.

160
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,279
Then we made the deal.

161
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:46,239
Why did you say yes for me?

162
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:47,480
What's wrong with you?

163
00:06:48,359 --> 00:06:49,399
Don't you wanna stay

164
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:50,399
and take care of me,

165
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,839
the injured one?

166
00:06:53,799 --> 00:06:54,480
So poor of him.

167
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,679
Fine. Fine.

168
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,519
How about this?

169
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,279
Xiao Qing, please stay

170
00:07:04,359 --> 00:07:05,600
and take care of him together with me.

171
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,559
OK.

172
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,839
Just go.

173
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,839
Hurry up. Go!

174
00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:17,799
Well, we're leaving now.

175
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,559
Have a good rest.

176
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:19,760
Okay.

177
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:21,839
Bye.

178
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:23,399
Well, I'm leaving too.

179
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,880
Bye.

180
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,920
Would you like some water?

181
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,679
No, not for now.

182
00:08:11,679 --> 00:08:12,399
Do you want some water?

183
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:13,920
No, I...

184
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,839
Let me get you some hot water.

185
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,839
I'm fine.

186
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,279
Xiao Qing, I've got it here.

187
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,959
Thank you.

188
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:33,919
Brother, you are here.

189
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:35,599
Coach Xiao.

190
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,599
Let me take it for you.

191
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:40,039
Thanks.

192
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,039
Let me give you some hot water.

193
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,080
Coach Xiao.

194
00:08:46,599 --> 00:08:48,039
How are you doing? Does it hurt badly?

195
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:51,919
For a man,

196
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:54,479
it's nothing.

197
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,599
Thank you.

198
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,000
Thanks to you today.

199
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:57,479
I have no idea

200
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,159
what would've happened to Xiao Qing

201
00:08:58,239 --> 00:08:59,679
to fall like this.

202
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:02,799
No worry.

203
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:03,719
She is my partner.

204
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:05,039
It's what I should do.

205
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:07,239
Anyway, thanks to you today.

206
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:08,440
If in the future

207
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:09,359
you need anything,

208
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:10,239
just say it.

209
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:14,280
Don't bother.

210
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,880
It's nothing.

211
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:17,239
I'll recover in two months.

212
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:19,679
Never mind.

213
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:22,039
Well, then.

214
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:35,320
Brother,

215
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:37,200
why did you pull me away?

216
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:39,799
Shao Beisheng's girlfriend is there.

217
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,919
If you stay there and take care of
Shao Beisheng,

218
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,799
it's not appropriate.

219
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:42,919
Why not?

220
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:43,880
He got injured because of me.

221
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,479
It is my responsibility
to take care of him.

222
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,559
Xiao Qing,

223
00:09:49,479 --> 00:09:51,039
things constantly change
on the skating rink.

224
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:52,239
It's not your subjective wish

225
00:09:52,239 --> 00:09:53,479
that got him injured.

226
00:09:54,119 --> 00:09:55,119
You don't have to blame yourself.

227
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,119
Do you know Coach Jiang Hua?

228
00:10:05,359 --> 00:10:07,239
Are you referring to
that winning coach Jiang Hua?

229
00:10:09,479 --> 00:10:10,359
She thinks highly of you.

230
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,039
I showed her your videos,

231
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:13,000
and contest materials.

232
00:10:13,359 --> 00:10:15,039
If you've got something in your mind,

233
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,719
I can help you make the contact.

234
00:10:17,719 --> 00:10:18,719
What do you mean?

235
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,799
I didn't say I will change teams.

236
00:10:21,599 --> 00:10:22,280
Xiao Qing,

237
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:23,599
Shao Beisheng

238
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:24,799
can't play Pairs Skating anymore.

239
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:26,719
But he

240
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:28,119
doesn't know about it yet.

241
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,599
He'll know it sooner or later.

242
00:10:31,479 --> 00:10:32,039
Yes!

243
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,359
For him,

244
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,599
it's probably a little bit cruel.

245
00:10:36,239 --> 00:10:36,799
But you have to

246
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,119
face the problem sooner or later.

247
00:10:38,599 --> 00:10:40,559
The only thing you can do
is to separate.

248
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:41,919
Coach Jiang

249
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:43,119
is your best choice.

250
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,039
What about Shao Beisheng?

251
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,919
He can't do it anymore.

252
00:10:49,359 --> 00:10:50,119
There might be a miracle.

253
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,119
It's hard to say.

254
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,119
There might not

255
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:52,880
be any miracle.

256
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,119
Are you going to wait all along?

257
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:04,119
He got injured because of me.

258
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:06,280
I can't leave him alone.

259
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:20,479
Please press here.

260
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:21,559
Okay.

261
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:22,880
I...

262
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:23,919
Like this?

263
00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:24,799
Yes.

264
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,599
Thank you, nurse.

265
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:31,159
Thank you, nurse.

266
00:11:40,119 --> 00:11:41,280
Why are your hands so cold?

267
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:46,239
It may be a little cold.

268
00:11:48,599 --> 00:11:49,159
How about this?

269
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:50,239
Hold on there. Hold it.

270
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,239
Your chin.

271
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:52,599
Okay. Wait a minute.

272
00:11:56,119 --> 00:11:56,799
Here.

273
00:12:07,479 --> 00:12:08,239
Feel better?

274
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:19,119
If on that day

275
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,159
I gave the last coin to you,

276
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:21,359
it won't be like this now.

277
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:23,479
What are you thinking?

278
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:25,880
My injury

279
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
has nothing to do with that thing.

280
00:12:29,719 --> 00:12:30,280
Besides,

281
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:32,359
even though I can't play in
the College Student Ice League,

282
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:33,599
and I can't play in Ling Yun Cup,

283
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:35,440
when my hand gets recovered,

284
00:12:35,719 --> 00:12:37,440
I'll still win the prizes
as much as I want.

285
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:38,599
Don't worry.

286
00:12:47,239 --> 00:12:47,919
Shao Beisheng,

287
00:12:49,239 --> 00:12:51,119
no matter what happens in the future,

288
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,159
I'll be there for you

289
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:54,119
and get you back.

290
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:03,919
What do you mean?

291
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,119
Just... Just encourage each other.

292
00:13:10,479 --> 00:13:11,359
Well...

293
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:12,280
Are you hungry?

294
00:13:12,479 --> 00:13:13,039
What would you like to eat?

295
00:13:13,119 --> 00:13:13,679
I'll buy it now.

296
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:15,919
It's fine. I'm not hungry.

297
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,359
And there is

298
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,799
bone soup someone made for me.

299
00:13:20,239 --> 00:13:21,239
You have bone soup?

300
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,039
Why didn't you drink it?

301
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:24,239
You should have a lot of them,

302
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:25,479
the nutritious food.

303
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:44,799
Here. Let me.

304
00:13:51,359 --> 00:13:51,919
Drink it.

305
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:54,159
Hurry.

306
00:13:58,239 --> 00:13:58,799
Is it good?

307
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:06,479
Here.

308
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,239
One more.

309
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:21,479
Your left hand can work.

310
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:22,719
And you asked me to feed you?

311
00:14:23,719 --> 00:14:24,799
You made the offer.

312
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:26,039
I can't say no.

313
00:14:28,479 --> 00:14:29,119
Take it yourself.

314
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,239
If you don't feed me,

315
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,039
I won't drink it.

316
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:31,919
I'm not hungry, anyway.

317
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,520
Don't be such a baby.

318
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:34,760
Hurry. Take it yourself.

319
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,280
You have to take it now.

320
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,479
It's nutritious. Hurry.

321
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:39,400
Fine.

322
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,400
I will hold the bowl for you.

323
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,520
Drink it by yourself. Okay?

324
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:45,280
Hold on.

325
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,760
What are you doing?

326
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:51,679
My back.

327
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:52,520
My back.

328
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,760
- What's wrong with your back?
- It's a little itchy.

329
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,159
But I can't reach there.

330
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:58,280
What should I do?

331
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,520
Let me help you.

332
00:15:05,479 --> 00:15:06,280
Help me.

333
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:10,640
Not here.

334
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,760
I can reach it myself.

335
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:12,599
A little bit right.

336
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,840
Right. Right.

337
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:16,400
Up. Up. Up.

338
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,280
You missed it. Down a little bit.

339
00:15:26,479 --> 00:15:27,280
OK now?

340
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:28,880
Wait a minute.

341
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,000
It suddenly comes

342
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:33,400
to the left.

343
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:47,420
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team
of Lingbei University)

344
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:55,919
Isn't there

345
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,039
any possibility to recover?

346
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,000
We asked a few more experts.

347
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:04,640
They all agreed that
it was irreversible.

348
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:16,520
Beisheng is

349
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:18,359
an ace player of our Wind Chaser.

350
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,640
Such a pity!

351
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:31,159
What's your plan next?

352
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:34,880
I mean

353
00:16:35,239 --> 00:16:36,679
since the kid can't play anymore,

354
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:39,400
we, as the adults,

355
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,479
should plan for him
as early as possible.

356
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,599
Talk to him.

357
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,280
Ask him to retire at this time.

358
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:50,280
He can have more choices.

359
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,119
He can't retire, Director.

360
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,359
He can't.

361
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,119
I can understand you.

362
00:17:06,239 --> 00:17:07,239
Beisheng is indeed a good player.

363
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,560
You've worked very hard.

364
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,800
I've seen it all.

365
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,280
However,

366
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,520
it is for his own good.

367
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:18,760
Think about it.

368
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,640
Since on this way,

369
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,000
the kid can't make it.

370
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:23,880
Why would we

371
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,880
hold him up?

372
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,359
Director, I think

373
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,400
it's too early to talk about this.

374
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,000
No, it's not.

375
00:17:29,959 --> 00:17:30,839
The sooner we talk about it,

376
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,400
the better it will be for him.

377
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,479
He is still young.

378
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,640
There are more choices

379
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,800
and opportunities for him.

380
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:38,920
Director, I don't think

381
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,640
it's necessary to talk about it.

382
00:17:40,239 --> 00:17:41,119
Unless he talks first,

383
00:17:41,239 --> 00:17:42,520
I can't make him retire.

384
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,640
What's wrong with Ma?

385
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,000
Ma,

386
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,160
it's been more than a week.

387
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,359
How is Beisheng?

388
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,800
You asked me every day.

389
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,119
If one's bones and muscles are hurt,
it takes one hundred days to recover.

390
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,239
It's impossible for him to recover
in such a short time.

391
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,400
It takes so long.

392
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,640
Shall we go to

393
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,599
visit him?

394
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,520
Don't bother.

395
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,880
If so many people go to him,

396
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,800
he'll bear more pressure.

397
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,760
How about
the College Student Ice League?

398
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,640
Can Beisheng still take part in that?

399
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:00,920
Probably.

400
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,280
When he is absent,

401
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,640
train them well.

402
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:07,800
Don't relax.

403
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:09,280
Okay. Don't worry.

404
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,400
Then I'll go training.

405
00:19:10,479 --> 00:19:11,359
Come here.

406
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,400
Can you stop

407
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,359
asking me questions?

408
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:16,160
I'm done.

409
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,480
(Doctor's Office)

410
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,280
Come in, please.

411
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:05,599
I will break through the dark clouds,

412
00:20:06,199 --> 00:20:07,560
cross the raging waves,

413
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,199
and face the wind, the rain,
and the lightning.

414
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,439
Lele,

415
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,359
I think it would be better

416
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,719
to add some actions here.

417
00:20:17,199 --> 00:20:17,800
Why not give it a try?

418
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:18,800
How?

419
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:22,680
Let me show you.

420
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:29,079
I will break through the dark clouds,

421
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,319
cross the raging waves,

422
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:37,680
and face the wind, the rain,
and the lightning.

423
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:40,719
Have a try.

424
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:42,319
Let me give it a try.

425
00:20:42,439 --> 00:20:43,199
Okay.

426
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,680
I will break through the dark clouds,

427
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,239
cross the raging waves,

428
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,239
and face the wind, the rain,
and the lightning.

429
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:17,800
Where does the music come from?

430
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,839
My ringtone.

431
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:25,199
Why don't you answer it?

432
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:27,479
I can't move.

433
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:31,119
You're stepping on my foot.

434
00:21:31,199 --> 00:21:31,839
I can't get away.

435
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,560
I'm sorry.

436
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:34,920
It's okay.

437
00:21:40,719 --> 00:21:41,439
Hello.

438
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:49,479
That was close indeed.

439
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:20,839
Well,

440
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,359
are you going to

441
00:22:21,479 --> 00:22:22,079
practice Triple today?

442
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:23,079
I feel great today.

443
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:23,959
Take a look.

444
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:25,719
Beisheng is back!

445
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,800
Beisheng.

446
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:28,439
You haven't seen me for days.
Do you miss me?

447
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,599
We do miss you.

448
00:22:31,719 --> 00:22:32,560
We miss you so much.

449
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:34,119
It's been a while.

450
00:22:34,239 --> 00:22:35,079
How's your hand?

451
00:22:35,199 --> 00:22:35,959
Right. Are you OK?

452
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
My hand is OK.

453
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:38,599
It's nothing.

454
00:22:38,719 --> 00:22:39,319
When you're not around,

455
00:22:39,479 --> 00:22:40,560
we have no confidence.

456
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:41,599
What are you doing here?

457
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:44,599
How can you discharge yourself
in such a short time?

458
00:22:45,959 --> 00:22:47,359
The doctor discharged me. So I'm here.

459
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:50,000
Go training. Go.

460
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:51,599
We gotta go now.

461
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,079
Okay.

462
00:22:52,239 --> 00:22:52,959
See you later.

463
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:55,920
Why don't you behave yourself?

464
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:56,959
Why can't you just stay in the hospital

465
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,119
for a few more days?

466
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,079
I'm not badly hurt.

467
00:23:01,199 --> 00:23:02,839
I can eat, sleep, and jump well.

468
00:23:02,959 --> 00:23:03,680
If I lie in the hospital,

469
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,560
it's a waste of

470
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:05,839
precious medical resource?

471
00:23:06,199 --> 00:23:07,000
Right?

472
00:23:10,479 --> 00:23:11,319
When you were discharged,

473
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:13,000
did the doctor say anything?

474
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,040
No.

475
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:17,000
The doctor just asked me to sleep early,

476
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:18,800
sleep well, and stay away from water.

477
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,719
Nothing else.

478
00:23:20,959 --> 00:23:21,959
Right.

479
00:23:22,199 --> 00:23:22,920
Take good care.

480
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:26,839
Fine. I gotta go.

481
00:23:27,479 --> 00:23:28,000
For what?

482
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:29,359
Back to the dormitory.

483
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:30,719
Stay put.

484
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:31,719
Don't... Don't toss around.

485
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,319
If you get injured again,
you'll get yourself into a big trouble.

486
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,959
Fine. So rambling.

487
00:23:36,199 --> 00:23:36,959
How dare you!

488
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:38,839

00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,280
Why didn't you reply my messages?

502
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,280
Why?

503
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,640
What?

504
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,119
I heard from them that you are back.

505
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:02,839
So I'm here to check on you.

506
00:26:03,719 --> 00:26:04,520
What's the point?

507
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:06,760
Well...

508
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:08,640
Well...

509
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,000
Have you eaten yet?

510
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,520
Why are you so nervous?

511
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:17,000
I'm not... not nervous.

512
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,359
I'm concerned that

513
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,359
your hand hasn't fully recovered.

514
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:22,719
What if

515
00:26:22,719 --> 00:26:23,520
you get yourself injured again?

516
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,760
What's next when I get recovered?

517
00:26:28,479 --> 00:26:29,880
If I get recovered,
can I lift dumbbells?

518
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,239
If I get recovered,

519
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,760
can I do the lifting?

520
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,400
Stop pretending for me.

521
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:26,239
I've been skating
for more than ten years.

522
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:28,640
Since I could walk,

523
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,520
I've been on the ice.

524
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,000
Beisheng.

525
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:41,560
Here.

526
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,599
Come to mommy.

527
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,479
What a good play!

528
00:27:47,479 --> 00:27:48,959
Stop. Stop. Stop.

529
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,880
Wonderful! Let mommy play with you.

530
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,400
OK?

531
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:53,239
OK.

532
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:54,760
Mommy, don't let go of my hand.

533
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,599
I'm scared.

534
00:27:55,719 --> 00:27:56,400
Don't worry.

535
00:27:56,959 --> 00:27:57,599
Mommy

536
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,880
will always be with my Beisheng.

537
00:27:59,040 --> 00:27:59,640
OK?

538
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,479
OK.

539
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,000
When I was little,

540
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:29,359
I admired my mother the most.

541
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,599
Like your mother,

542
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:32,599
she was a short track
speed skater.

543
00:28:33,959 --> 00:28:36,719
But my mother was a coach.

544
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,520
So your mother was a
short track speed skating coach.

545
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,000
When I was little,

546
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:42,760
she led

547
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,359
her team to train all day

548
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,520
on the ice.

549
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:47,160
She looked so cocky.

550
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,239
But she was too busy

551
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,599
to take care of me.

552
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:57,880
So every day in order to

553
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,160
stay with her for a while longer,

554
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,479
and spend more time with her,

555
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,760
I said I wanted to play skating.

556
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:06,880
Why didn't you

557
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,160
play the short track speed skating?

558
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,520
I intended to.

559
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:11,359
I thought I can train with my mom

560
00:29:11,719 --> 00:29:13,040
when I grow up.

561
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,760
But I didn't expect that

562
00:29:15,239 --> 00:29:16,400
the coach of figure skating said

563
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,280
I was a good player
for figure skating.

564
00:29:20,479 --> 00:29:21,400
And my mom agreed.

565
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,880
Then I went to play figure skating.

566
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,640
That coach was right.

567
00:29:31,959 --> 00:29:33,119
Since I started to play figure skating,

568
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,239
I like this sport more and more

569
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:36,640
day by day.

570
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:37,880
When I was fifteen,

571
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:40,479
I won my first gold medal.

572
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,119
As I won more and more awards,

573
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:44,839
I felt more and more that,

574
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:47,319
for me,

575
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:48,760
like eating and sleeping,

576
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
skating has become

577
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,520
a very important part of my life.

578
00:29:58,079 --> 00:29:59,160
What about your mother?

579
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,560
Did you spend more time

580
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:02,079
with you mother?

581
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:05,880
No.

582
00:30:13,959 --> 00:30:14,520
Don't talk

583
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,359
the nonsense to me.

584
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:16,719
I'm telling you.
I don't want to listen to that.

585
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:17,800
Look at you.

586
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:19,119
No mom will behave like you.

587
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,479
You left our sick child behind

588
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:21,839
and took care of your injured player.

589
00:30:22,719 --> 00:30:23,079
No.

590
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:24,319
This game is really important.

591
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,880
Fine. Important.

592
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,560
If it is important, just go!

593
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:27,359
Live your life with your games.

594
00:30:27,479 --> 00:30:27,959
Mind your own business.

595
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:28,800
I'll take care of the child.

596
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,719
Go!

597
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Mom.

598
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:35,400
Sorry, son.

599
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,760
Don't go.

600
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,520
Mom, stay with me!

601
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,000
She was at work on my birthday.

602
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,959
When I was sick,

603
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,599
she was also at work.

604
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:54,560
Every time it was my dad
to attend parents' meeting.

605
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,280
Then she divorced my dad,

606
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:00,640
and went abroad.

607
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:07,520
For me actually,

608
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,719
having a mom or having no mom,

609
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:13,160
there is no big difference.

610
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,079
I always believe that

611
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,479
for anything,

612
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,800
as long as you don't give up
in your heart,

613
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:35,359
some day

614
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:38,800
it will come true in a certain way.

615
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,479
Yeah.

616
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,319
Just like you.

617
00:31:43,719 --> 00:31:44,520
After more than ten years of practice,

618
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:46,359
you finally made it
to the professional team.

619
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:15,199
I'm almost recovered.

620
00:32:15,479 --> 00:32:17,000
I can have my stitches removed tomorrow.

621
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:34,319
(I always believe that)

622
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:36,040
(for anything,)

623
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,640
(as long as you don't give up
in your heart,)

624
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,239
(some day)

625
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:43,640
(it will come true in a certain way.)

626
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:02,479
Leave me alone.

627
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,079
You...

628
00:33:15,959 --> 00:33:16,880
What are you doing here?

629
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,239
Qu Zhi told me to

630
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,400
come straight to your room.

631
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,079
Finally, you're awake!

632
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,319
Look at this. And this.

633
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,959
These are all

634
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:29,599
inspirational books for you.

635
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:30,800
Take a look.

636
00:33:31,239 --> 00:33:31,839
Which one do you prefer?

637
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,640
Three Days to See.

638
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,760
Yes. That's right.

639
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:36,959
And these movies.

640
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,640
They are all good for you.

641
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,560
Which one do you prefer?

642
00:33:45,479 --> 00:33:46,119
Alright.

643
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:47,719
Stop it.

644
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:49,160
It doesn't work for me.

645
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:50,560
Hang on a second.

646
00:33:51,479 --> 00:33:52,839
I know you're very upset now.

647
00:33:53,319 --> 00:33:54,719
But you can't give up.

648
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:56,839
So is there anything you can do

649
00:33:56,959 --> 00:33:58,319
to allow me to play Pairs Skating?

650
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,560
No.

651
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:07,760
Good night.

652
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:18,399
Get up!

653
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,239
I'll take you somewhere.

654
00:34:19,959 --> 00:34:20,560
For what?

655
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:21,520
Get up!

656
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,520
Fine.

657
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:23,800
Let me get dressed, OK?

658
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,000
Hurry up!

659
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,800
Why are you taking me here?

660
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:34,840
Hurry up.

661
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,800
Don't you think

662
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:37,760
it feels like skywalking

663
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:39,840
when

664
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,320
walking on that rainbow bridge?

665
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:41,840
Hurry.

666
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,080
So?

667
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,000
So?

668
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:46,760
So let's start.

669
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,120
Start what?

670
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,159
Isn't it obvious? This runway.

671
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:52,719
You asked me to change into sportswear

672
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,800
so that I could run with you?

673
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,320
Yeah.

674
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,320
Are you afraid of heights?

675
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,479
I...

676
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,000
Do I look like I'm afraid of heights?

677
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,719
Well, it is your hand that got injured.

678
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,760
Your feet didn't.

679
00:35:07,479 --> 00:35:08,080
No.

680
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,600
It's been a while

681
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,840
since I did exercise last time.

682
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,320
I feel pain all over my body.

683
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,080
I can't make it.

684
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,399
Let's sit for a while.

685
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,479
I think it's quite good to

686
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,280
take a sun bath.

687
00:35:27,479 --> 00:35:28,479
Muscle soreness?

688
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,760
Come here. I'll give you a massage.

689
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:32,040
Here?

690
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,399
It hurts!

691
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,600
OK. OK. Take it easy.

692
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,120
Muscle soreness? Here.

693
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,320
Is it here?

694
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,520
Muscle. Where are the muscles?

695
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,000
Alright, alright.

696
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:52,280
Running requires music.

697
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,840
I need music.

698
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:03,879
OK. Let me check out

699
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
your taste of music.

700
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,040
Are you okay now?

701
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,199
The theme song of the Wind Chasing Boys?

702
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,800
What? You also like it?

703
00:36:13,479 --> 00:36:14,520
This is my favorite animation.

704
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,399
What a coincidence!

705
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:17,840
It is my favorite animation too.

706
00:36:18,479 --> 00:36:18,959
I know.

707
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,760
Your phone case is the same as mine.

708
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,600
Cut the crap! Hurry up!

709
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:26,560
Come on.

710
00:36:27,399 --> 00:36:28,120
OK.

711
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,040
Last request.

712
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:34,080
Say

713
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:35,520
the classic lines of the Wind Chaser.

714
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,080
I will not surrender.

715
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:40,040
I will not give up.

716
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:40,959
No.

717
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,320
You have to follow the original version.

718
00:36:43,879 --> 00:36:44,879
I will not surrender.

719
00:36:44,879 --> 00:36:45,879
I will not give up.

720
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:48,919
Quickly.

721
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:56,399
I will not surrender.

722
00:36:56,479 --> 00:36:57,600
I will not give up.

723
00:36:58,399 --> 00:36:59,159
Enough?

724
00:36:59,439 --> 00:37:00,399
Not loud and clear enough.

725
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,479
Loud and clear?

726
00:37:05,439 --> 00:37:06,639
I'll give you loud and clear.

727
00:37:07,439 --> 00:37:08,560
I'll give you the original version.

728
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:09,399
I will make you scared.

729
00:37:17,399 --> 00:37:19,639
Shao Beisheng is a big fool.

730
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:22,040
Freak! Narcissist!

731

How is it going?

741
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:19,879
Why are you all sitting here?

742
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,399
Didn't I ask you

743
00:38:20,479 --> 00:38:21,199
to apply for the venue?

744
00:38:22,919 --> 00:38:23,840
Forget it.

745
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,399
So the school didn't approve it.

746
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,120
It got approved!

747
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:41,199
President,

748
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,080
rest assured

749
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:43,120
to let three of us do the job.

750
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,679
Good for you.

751
00:38:46,919 --> 00:38:47,399
President,

752
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,239
you have no idea.

753
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,479
There is also

754
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:50,760
the popular band in our school

755
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,360
who made the application.

756
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:53,360
They have sheer numbers.

757
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,679
But we three fought so hard

758
00:38:55,879 --> 00:38:57,159
to get the venue.

759
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:58,800
You're so good!

760
00:38:59,439 --> 00:39:00,679
They also assured the school leader that

761
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,159
on the day of performance,

762
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,919
it can reach 90% attendance.

763
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,520
And then?

764
00:39:06,879 --> 00:39:08,439
We of course assured that

765
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,639
our attendance

766
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,679
can reach 100%.

767
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:13,800
Good gracious!

768
00:39:14,399 --> 00:39:15,040
The leader heard us,

769
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,159
and he made the decision at once

770
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,840
to give the venue to our club.

771
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,639
What if we can't make it?

772
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,520
If we can't reach

773
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,000
100% attendance,

774
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,399
our club

775
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,879
will dismiss on the spot.

776
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,040
Well...

777
00:39:38,879 --> 00:39:39,760
Let's go over the script.

778
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,560
So awesome you are!

779
00:39:52,879 --> 00:39:53,959
Good job!

780
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,680
(Return and Love)

781
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,800
Beisheng,

782
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,679
I want to talk to you.

783
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,159
For what?

784
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:17,280
Let's find a place,

785
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,360
sit down and have a talk.

786
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:21,439
Don't bother.

787
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Just over there.

788
00:40:31,959 --> 00:40:33,040
Beisheng,

789
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,280
there's something I've been
thinking about for a long time.

790
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:39,199
I decided to tell you.

791
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:46,679
The doctor said

792
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:49,199
your hand

793
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,320
couldn't do the lifting anymore.

794
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:54,320
You told me this.

795
00:40:54,399 --> 00:40:55,959
Aren't you afraid that I can't bear it?

796
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,280
I'm afraid.

797
00:40:59,919 --> 00:41:01,679
But I'm more afraid of that

798
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:03,919
you're kept in the dark,

799
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,639
and take a hopeless road.

800
00:41:06,919 --> 00:41:07,800
Beisheng,

801
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,840
don't run away from difficulties.

802
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,360
As long as we face it,

803
00:41:11,479 --> 00:41:13,479
we will figure out how to solve it.

804
00:41:14,399 --> 00:41:15,320
Don't worry.

805
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:16,919
Mom will be with you.

806
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,879
You finally realized
you should be with me.

807
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,479
I needed it before.

808
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,800
But I don't need it now.

809
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:32,840
I knew it all along.

810
00:41:33,919 --> 00:41:35,000
I'll take care of it myself.

811
00:41:35,439 --> 00:41:36,479
Don't worry about me.

812
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,719
Brother,

813
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,840
where are you taking me?

814
00:42:19,479 --> 00:42:20,919
You'll find out when you're there.

815
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,479
Where exactly are you taking me?

816
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,719
Tell me.

817
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,399
I'm taking you to meet Coach Jiang.

818
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,560
Stop.

819
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,800
You shall meet her,

820
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,280
and have a talk.

821
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,280
Maybe you'll change your mind.

822
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,520
I won't meet her.
