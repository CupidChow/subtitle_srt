00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,990
=Episode 29=

3
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,120
Well,

4
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:39,680
what am I supposed to look at?

5
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:45,919
Why isn't it there?

6
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,080
What isn't there?

7
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,839
Aren't the flowers right here?

8
00:01:49,639 --> 00:01:50,319
Stand still.

9
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:52,000
What are you doing?

10
00:01:52,639 --> 00:01:53,440
Shao Beisheng, come back.

11
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,519
You are all wet.

12
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:56,120
Come on, come back.

13
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:56,879
Come back.

14
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,360
Don't... don't get wet.

15
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,480
Is it too far?

16
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,239
What is too far?

17
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,000
It is not there.

18
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,040
What is it?

19
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,480
How come?

20
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,680
But every time I do the experiment,

21
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,599
it will be there.

22
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,000
What's there?

23
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,559
You didn't see the flowers?

24
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,680
It's right here.

25
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,920
Wait. What's up?

26
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:16,199
The rainbow.

27
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,240
I was going to confess my love to you

28
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,679
under the rainbow.

29
00:02:31,839 --> 00:02:33,440
Are you silly?

30
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,399
With the sunlight,

31
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,279
how can we see a rainbow?

32
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,399
It can be seen.

33
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:39,360
Yesterday, I...

34
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,440
I have tested it yesterday.

35
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,520
It can be seen today.

36
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:42,520
Yes. Yes.

37
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,839
And the timing is just right.

38
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,080
Why isn't it there?

39
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:46,639
Alright. Alright.

40
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:48,320
It's fine.

41
00:02:49,279 --> 00:02:49,960
There's no need for confession.

42
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,520
We are

43
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:51,720
already together.

44
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,160
Don't rush.

45
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,119
Let's go.

46
00:02:55,399 --> 00:02:56,320
Let's take a walk.

47
00:02:56,399 --> 00:02:57,520
Maybe it will be there

48
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:58,600
when we come later, okay?

49
00:02:59,039 --> 00:02:59,800
Let's go.

50
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:01,080
Let's go.

51
00:03:01,679 --> 00:03:03,080
We are already together.

52
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,520
But I still owe you

53
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,800
an official confession, right?

54
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,960
I think confession...

55
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,119
No way.

56
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,119
Though I screwed it up,

57
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:23,960
I still have something to

58
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:24,919
tell you.

59
00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:28,679
Shen Zhengyi.

60
00:03:29,679 --> 00:03:30,800
We pretended to be a couple before.

61
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,960
Although we were pretending,

62
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,320
I was so happy.

63
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,039
Now I find out that

64
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,360
maybe I started to like you

65
00:03:40,559 --> 00:03:41,679
from that time.

66
00:03:45,839 --> 00:03:46,559
We've been through

67
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:47,399
a lot.

68
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,759
We have misunderstandings and argument.

69
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:53,119
Of course, there are more happy things.

70
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,399
And I think

71
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:00,440
it's good for us

72
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,360
to be together now.

73
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,279
However,

74
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,839
maybe we will have to

75
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,479
go through more difficulties
in the future.

76
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:12,279
Shen Zhengyi.

77
00:04:13,839 --> 00:04:15,320
Will you go through all these with me?

78
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,640
Will you be my girlfriend?

79
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,000
The shampoo recommended by our daughter

80
00:04:59,119 --> 00:04:59,480
is great,

81
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,679
but it is used up soon.

82
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,799
We have run out of it again?

83
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:03,559
The new one is in the closet.

84
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:04,720
You find it yourself.

85
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:06,239
Is it Adolph?

86
00:05:07,119 --> 00:05:08,160
Why do you wash your hair

87
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,200
in the day?

88
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,959
Wear the same clothes as your daughter.

89
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,559
Use the same

90
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,959
shampoo as your daughter.

91
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,320
Young person

92
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,559
likes something fragrant.

93
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,200
Why are you following her?

94
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:21,279
We need to keep up with our daughter.

95
00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:22,200
Right?

96
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:23,959
This is great.

97
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,160
It's so late!

98
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,040
Why doesn't she come back?

99
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,519
It's all your fault.

100
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,040
You agreed Yiyi to
be in a relationship so early.

101
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:36,040
It's just her freshman year.

102
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,000
Nowadays, you cannot

103
00:05:38,239 --> 00:05:39,640
disagree with anything that

104
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:40,760
the kid has decided.

105
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:41,959
Moreover,

106
00:05:42,239 --> 00:05:43,040
I think that boy

107
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,640
is quite handsome.

108
00:05:45,559 --> 00:05:46,839
And he truly likes

109
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:48,720
our Yiyi.

110
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,760
You just

111
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,160
like such superficial things.

112
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:53,880
We have to

113
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,119
check out his background,

114
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,440
like his growth environment,

115
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,839
and the job of his parents.

116
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,359
What if Yiyi got bullied

117
00:06:00,799 --> 00:06:01,839
by him?

118
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:02,519
Got bullied?

119
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,600
Only you

120
00:06:04,679 --> 00:06:05,320
would think so.

121
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,040
It's good that Zhengyi

122
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,559
doesn't bully others.

123
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,239
But it is the first time

124
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:11,920
Yiyi falls in love.

125
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,399
We have to check it out for her.

126
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,559
Check it out?

127
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,920
You can walk her to school

128
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,359
or accompany her on a date?

129
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:22,320
Moreover,

130
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,279
if you object to it,

131
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,320
she will become more rebellious,

132
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,399
and tell you nothing.

133
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,640
You might as well
let it be.

134
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,239
She will tell us in time

135
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,399
if something happens,

136
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:31,839
then we'll comfort her timely.

137
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:32,959
Moreover,

138
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:34,320
after two months,

139
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:35,679
if they don't get along with each other,

140
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,000
they may just break up.

141
00:06:37,559 --> 00:06:38,920
You don't have to be the bad guy.

142
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,959
I just don't like it.

143
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,040
Alright.

144
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,239
Your daughter has grown up.

145
00:06:48,119 --> 00:06:49,359
There is your new outfit in that room.

146
00:06:49,679 --> 00:06:50,320
You can try it on.

147
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,160
No, I am not in mood.

148
00:06:56,359 --> 00:06:57,160
Then how about

149
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,519
buying you

150
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,399
an outfit

151
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,559
that is the same as

152
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,679
Zhengyi's?

153
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:06,679
Darling.

154
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,959
Maybe we should

155
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:10,359
buy the couple outfits.

156
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,480
Forget it.

157
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:12,920
We are too old to do so.

158
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,440
I'll go wash my hair.

159
00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:19,359
Hello.

160
00:07:19,679 --> 00:07:21,559
(Limin, Zhuang Yue has returned home.)

161
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:23,920
Hello.

162

(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team of
Lingbei University)

163
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,320
I'm going to the east gate now

164
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,040
to take the parcel.

165
00:07:27,119 --> 00:07:28,519
My mom knew I don't
go home for the holidays,

166
00:07:28,679 --> 00:07:29,200
so she sent lots of delicious food

167
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,440
to me.

168
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,440
Zhengyi's mother.

169
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,279
No way.

170
00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:36,480
I can't recognize the wrong person.

171
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:38,600
Zhengyi went home for holidays.

172
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,280
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team of
Lingbei University)

173
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,800
What is her mother doing here?

174
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:47,040
Are you satisfied with
today's arrangement?

175
00:07:48,239 --> 00:07:48,760

Live Action Role Playing game,

177
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,399
I am satisfied with the confession
and other arrangement.

178
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:53,839
What's wrong with
Live Action Role Playing game?

179
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,359
Live Action Role Playing
game is so interesting.

180
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,920
As a high-end

181
00:07:57,559 --> 00:07:58,440
Live Action Role Player,

182
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,880
I want to know how the last statement

183
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:00,559
was for the day?

184
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,399
Was it awesome?

185
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,640
You had the nerve to tell me that.

186
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,160
We've played for three hours.

187
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,679
You wrote a dozen drafts

188
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,359
just to prove that I was the murderer.

189
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,799
Why were you so serious?

190
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,040
So are you the murderer?

191
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:11,880
Yes, I am. So what?

192
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:12,760
Right, you're...

193
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,839
I am, so what?

194
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:15,200
You're going to accuse me?

195
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:16,519
I am.

196
00:08:16,559 --> 00:08:17,519
I am.

197
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,040
I'm telling you.

198
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,920
There is always only one truth.

199
00:08:22,239 --> 00:08:23,959
Justice may be three hours late,

200
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:24,880
but it'll never be absent.

201
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,079
Hello, Lele.

202
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,719
My mom is in Wind Chaser?

203
00:08:37,239 --> 00:08:38,039
I'll ask her.

204
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,760
Your mom is in Wind Chaser?

205
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,080
Why is she going there?

206
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:44,880
Now we're having the holidays.

207
00:08:45,239 --> 00:08:46,400
I guess there are just the coaches.

208
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:47,960
Call your mother.

209
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,039
Nobody answered.

210
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,039
Call the uncle.

211
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,760
Hurry up.

212
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,000
Hello, dad.

213
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:04,440
Where are you?

214
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,919
My mom's not with you?

215
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,359
Fine.

216
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,640
Zhengyi, you just go back.

217
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:13,919
I have to go to the school.
I have something to attend to.

218
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,000
Leave me alone.

219
00:09:16,479 --> 00:09:17,840
Where are you going?

220
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,400
(She's the chief coach)

221
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,400
(of Wind Chaser.)

222
00:09:24,719 --> 00:09:25,719
(So many years have passed.)

223
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,200
(I think both of you should)

224
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,440
(be reconciled with each other.)

225
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:51,799
Limin.

226
00:09:57,359 --> 00:09:58,559
It's been a long time since we met.

227
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,200
If I can,

228
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:06,760
I don't want to

229
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,159
see you anymore in my life.

230
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:09,880
If I know

231
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,559
you are Shen Zhengyi's coach,

232
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,159
I will even lock her in the house

233
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,039
rather than let her
get into Wind Chaser.

234
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,359
Limin.

235
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,679
I think there's something
you are wrong about.

236
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:21,320
Could you listen to me?

237
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,679
Why aren't you surprised?

238
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,000
So you have known the fact that

239
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,919
Zhengyi is my daughter for a long time?

240
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:28,479
No.

241
00:10:29,359 --> 00:10:31,200
I just found out on Ling Yun Cup.

242
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,880
Did Zhengyi know it?

243
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,239
Did she know what happened between us?

244
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,039
Don't worry.

245
00:10:36,599 --> 00:10:37,760
The kid didn't know anything.

246
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,000
You tell me not to worry?

247
00:10:39,119 --> 00:10:40,159
How can I not worry?

248
00:10:40,359 --> 00:10:41,159
You are her coach.

249
00:10:41,239 --> 00:10:42,479
That's why I'm worried.

250
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:44,119
You must stay away from my kid.

251
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:50,359
Auntie.

252
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,000
What are you doing here?

253
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,719
I come to do something for Zhengyi.

254
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,559
Zhuang Yue.

255
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:57,919
I won't let Zhengyi

256
00:10:58,039 --> 00:10:59,080
train with you.

257
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,200
We're not going to attend
the competition either.

258
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,000
She has to attend the competition.

259
00:11:05,359 --> 00:11:06,320
Limin.

260
00:11:07,479 --> 00:11:08,239
You and I both know about

261
00:11:08,479 --> 00:11:09,599
the Asian Cup.

262
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,119
It's the first time Zhengyi

263
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,559
will participate in such an important
international competition.

264
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,960
For the kid,

265
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,159
this competition is very important.

266
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,280
Don't let

267
00:11:17,359 --> 00:11:18,320
anything between us

268
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,840
hold the kid back, okay?

269
00:11:20,599 --> 00:11:21,640
You mean that

270
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,960
her athletic career will be over

271
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:26,000
if Zhengyi leaves you?

272
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,559
I have responsibility to
what happened in the past.

273
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,719
I'm so sorry.

274
00:11:30,599 --> 00:11:31,080
You can blame me

275
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:32,239
or hate me,

276
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,359
but don't affect the kid's future, okay?

277
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,840
To be honest,

278
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,440
for all these years,

279
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:44,880
I have felt bad too.

280
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:47,080
Don't be so hypocritical here.

281
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:48,840
Remember

282
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:50,119
what I just told you.

283
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,200
Auntie, auntie.

284
00:11:51,479 --> 00:11:52,200
Could you allow my mom

285
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,719
to explain what happened back then?

286
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,080
Your mom?

287
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,599
She's your mom?

288
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,520
Auntie.

289
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,320
So you guys know everything,

290
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,159
and keep it secret from

291
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,479
me and Shen Zhengyi?

292
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:09,400
Auntie.

293
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,919
Would you please let my mother explain?

294
00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:12,359
Zhengyi.

295
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,320
Zhengyi.

296
00:12:15,599 --> 00:12:16,320
Let's go home.

297
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,559
Coach Zhuang.

298
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:19,520
So the one who

299
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,080
got my mom injured and retired

300
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,960
is you, right?

301
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,119
Zhengyi.

302
00:12:26,599 --> 00:12:27,479
There were a lot of things back then.

303
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:28,159
She cannot...

304
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:28,880
You've known everything all along.

305
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,119
Why didn't you tell me?

306
00:12:30,479 --> 00:12:31,520
Zhengyi.

307
00:12:33,359 --> 00:12:33,840
There are things

308
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,559
I can't explain to you

309
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,640
in a minute.

310
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,479
But the one who

311
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,559
got your mom injured and retired

312
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,960
is me, indeed.

313
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:51,880
Zhengyi.

314
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,479
Mom.

315
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,039
Why didn't you explain?

316
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:14,359
You accelerated to change the track

317
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:15,440
in order to

318
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,760
block the players in the back, right?

319
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,520
You have been wronged,

320
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:20,400
right?

321
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:24,159
I explained to her

322
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,640
twenty years ago,

323
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,159
she didn't want to believe it.

324
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:30,440
But it was

325
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,880
over twenty years ago.

326
00:14:32,359 --> 00:14:33,960
She was seriously injured,

327
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,039
and had to retire at that time,

328
00:14:35,359 --> 00:14:36,280
so she didn't listen to
what other people said.

329
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,840
I think it's understandable.

330
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,320
But now,

331
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,640
after all these years,

332
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:41,919
maybe

333
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:44,039
she can be calm

334
00:14:44,599 --> 00:14:45,640
to listen to you.

335
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:50,719
Do you think this explanation

336
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:51,840
is meaningful?

337
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,640
It can't change the result.

338
00:14:59,479 --> 00:15:01,119
Actually, I was also at fault for that.

339
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,679
I was so young and assertive then.

340
00:15:06,479 --> 00:15:07,840
I told her something hurtful

341
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,159
before I went on the rink.

342
00:15:09,719 --> 00:15:10,960
I understand that she didn't

343
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,599
want to believe me.

344
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,440
I'm an athlete too.

345
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:20,359
If it

346
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,880
happened to me,

347
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,320
I'm sure I would be just like her.

348
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,719
An athlete

349
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:27,719
got injured and retired

350
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:29,359
because of one accident,

351
00:15:30,239 --> 00:15:31,799
and her whole life has changed.

352
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:35,320
What can I do to make up

353
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,679
for her pain?

354
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:38,799
Mom.

355
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,960
If she feels

356
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:44,400
more comfortable

357
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,520
to hate me,

358
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,640
then I can accept her

359
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,960
hatred of me for her whole life.

360
00:15:53,239 --> 00:15:53,919
Really.

361
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,840
Mom.

362
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,520
If hatred of you

363
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:05,479
is really the solution,

364
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,760
I believe Zhengyi's mother

365
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:07,679
will not

366
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,039
hold the grudge till now.

367
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:11,960
Isn't it?

368
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,320
Alright, Darling.

369
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,239
Yiyi.

370
00:16:45,599 --> 00:16:46,760
You both calm down.

371
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,479
I'll cook you dinner.

372
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:49,599
Don't be mad.

373
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,440
We will make you withdraw
from the team tomorrow.

374
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,640
Don't train with Zhuang

375
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:54,599
anymore.

376
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,880
Darling, you calm down.

377
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,880
Don't be so blunt.

378
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,400
I am very calm.

379
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,000
Because you don't know

380
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,440
what that Zhuang

381
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:01,880
really is.

382
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:02,880
I'm telling you.

383
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,919
All she does is using you

384
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,280
as a stepping stone.

385
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,959
She's not really going
to be nice to you.

386
00:17:07,239 --> 00:17:08,359
I won't let you train with her.

387
00:17:09,479 --> 00:17:09,959
Mom.

388
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:10,719
I have trained with

389
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,199
Coach Zhuang

390
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,400
for a while.

391
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,560
I should know who

392
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:17,640
she is.

393
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,560
She kept telling me

394
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,680
to have teammates

395
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,560
and team spirit

396
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,199
in mind.

397
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,920
She has team spirit?

398
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,359
If she has team spirit,

399
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:28,479
why could I have hurt my leg like this?

400
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,640
You asked your dad

401
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,439
how miserable I was in the hospital?

402
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,239
Tell her.

403
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:33,479
You tell her.

404
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,880
Just tell her.

405
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,199
I didn't forget.

406
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,000
So now you all trust her,

407
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:40,239
instead of me?

408
00:17:40,439 --> 00:17:41,640
I trust you.

409
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,319
I definitely trust you.

410
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,640
But I was also thinking

411
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,319
if it could be

412
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,839
as what Shao Beisheng said.

413
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:47,760
There are

414
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,239
some misunderstandings because

415
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,319
you didn't talk things out.

416
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,880
No misunderstanding.

417
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:53,640
I still remember what

418
00:17:53,719 --> 00:17:54,719
she told me

419
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,760
before I went to the rink.

420
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,280
Zhuang Yue,

421
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,599
remember to preserve

422
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,719
your strength when leading.

423
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,920
You don't have to teach me.

424
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,680
When we're on the rink,

425
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:06,800
the person who has the ability wins,

426
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,719
and we both have chances
for winning the gold medal.

427
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,880
Zhuang Yue wanted to

428
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,599
strive for the first at the beginning.

429
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,400
Mom, just calm down.

430
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,560
Don't be so impulsive.

431
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,280
What else are you trying
to explain for her?

432
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,560
Do you have any idea

433
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,560
as to why you cannot train now?

434
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,640
Just because of her.

435
00:18:24,719 --> 00:18:25,920
She did this to me back then.

436
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:27,920
I'm afraid that you would
make the same mistake I did.

437
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:31,280
Why do you trust her so much?

438
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,920
Because she's your coach,

439
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,319
and her son is your boyfriend.

440
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,439
You don't have to think about

441
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:36,880
my feeling.

442
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,640
Do you know what it calls?

443
00:18:39,199 --> 00:18:41,000
It's called ungratefulness.

444
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:43,119
I am just saying not to...

445
00:18:43,239 --> 00:18:44,079
Darling, darling.

446
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:45,800
Darling.

447
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:46,439
Darling.

448
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,599
Just calm down, okay?

449
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:49,160
You walk away, and leave me alone.

450
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,439
You take care of your daughter.

451
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:51,920
When your daughter

452
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,760
got tricked,

453
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:53,560
then you'll know.

454
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,800
You tell her to be

455
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,719
with Shao Beisheng,

456
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:56,880
and to be with Zhuang Yue.

457
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,160
Loudness is not necessarily persuasive.

458
00:18:58,239 --> 00:18:59,160
Don't come to find me again.

459
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,000
Keep your voice down.

460
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,319
You take care of your daughter.

461
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,719
(I'm downstairs.)

462
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,079
Hello, Zhengyi.

463
00:19:38,199 --> 00:19:39,079
Can you come downstairs for a second?

464
00:19:39,199 --> 00:19:40,280
I need to talk to you.

465
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:43,800
I'm going to bed.

466
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:45,119
Let's talk about it

467
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,280
on the phone.

468
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,520
Don't... don't.

469
00:19:49,959 --> 00:19:51,000
I think I cannot say it clearly

470
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:51,719
on the phone.

471
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,839
Can we talk about this in person?

472
00:19:53,479 --> 00:19:54,160
I'm waiting for you downstairs.

473
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,520
It is very cold,

474
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,439
just go back.

475
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,239
You are still mad at me,

476
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,479
right?

477
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,359
Zhengyi.

478
00:21:35,239 --> 00:21:36,800
I really didn't mean
to keep it secret from you.

479
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:39,959
Actually, I just knew it

480
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,280
last week.

481
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,880
You know how important this means

482
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,800
to me and my families.

483
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,280
Why didn't you

484
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:51,560
tell me at the first moment?

485
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:54,199
I didn't want to keep it
secret from you.

486
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,160
Neither my mother nor I

487
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:56,319
tried to keep it secret from you.

488
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:56,800
But we...

489
00:21:56,959 --> 00:21:58,119
we were afraid it
would affect your race,

490
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,599
so we prepared to tell you this

491
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,400
after the Asian Cup.

492
00:22:04,719 --> 00:22:06,479
Don't get mad, okay?

493
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:09,199
So what did your mom say?

494
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,880
Actually, my mom didn't

495
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,520
want to take over auntie's track.

496
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:14,880
She tried to block

497
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,319
the player coming from the back.

498
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,479
But she didn't expect that

499
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:18,599
auntie also changed the track suddenly,

500
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,839
so they had the collision.

501
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,479
She really didn't mean it.

502
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,520
But my mom told me that

503
00:22:27,719 --> 00:22:28,680
Coach Zhuang

504
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,520
didn't want to

505
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:30,479
assist her

506
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:31,439
at the very beginning.

507
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,199
Zhengyi.

508
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:34,760
They used to be partners.

509
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,160
Even if my mom wanted

510
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:36,959
a gold medal so much,

511
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:37,680
she couldn't risk

512
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,680
hurting her teammates,

513
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,760
right?

514
00:22:45,439 --> 00:22:46,199
So,

515
00:22:47,479 --> 00:22:49,079
don't you believe my mom?

516
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:51,400
What's the point of my trust?

517
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:54,560
My mom is the one who was involved,

518
00:22:54,719 --> 00:22:55,959
and my mom is the one who got injured.

519
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:57,000
She doesn't believe her.

520
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:58,239
She doesn't listen to her explanation.

521
00:22:58,359 --> 00:22:59,439
What am I supposed to do?

522
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,959
What's the point of my trust?

523
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,439
Of course there is the point, Zhengyi.

524
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:03,319
Of course.

525
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,359
If there is one person

526
00:23:06,439 --> 00:23:07,199
who could help your mother

527
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,119
step out of the shadows,

528
00:23:08,199 --> 00:23:09,199
then it would be you.

529
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,000
But you have to trust me.

530
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,319
Then tell me

531
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,479
what I can do?

532
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,439
One is my coach.

533
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,160
One is my mom.

534
00:23:15,239 --> 00:23:16,280
What do you want me to do?

535
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:17,160
Alright.

536
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,280
Alright, alright.

537
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,560
Alright.

538
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:34,760
Let's not think about it too much, okay?

539
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:37,560
Just follow auntie's instructions.

540
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:39,119
After all, this is

541
00:23:39,199 --> 00:23:40,239
the issue in her mind
for more than 20 years.

542
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:41,439
It cannot be solved

543
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,560
in one day.

544
00:23:46,479 --> 00:23:48,239
Alright, alright.

545
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:02,160
We work together

546
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,439
to get over it,

547
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,439
okay?

548
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:09,920
Alright.

549
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:11,640
It is my fault.

550
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,800
It is your fault.

551
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,319
I am wrong.

552
00:24:17,439 --> 00:24:18,719
Why didn't you tell me?

553
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:19,880
It's all your fault.

554
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:20,880
I should have told you earlier.

555
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:34,439
I am so angry.

556
00:24:34,479 --> 00:24:35,239
Don't be angry.

557
00:24:36,239 --> 00:24:37,040
Don't be angry.

558
00:24:42,719 --> 00:24:44,239
But I still don't understand why

559
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:45,880
auntie suddenly knew

560
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,040
about it.

561
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:49,560
I don't know.

562
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,439
Today,

563
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,959
my mom's teammate

564
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:54,000
called her.

565
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,400
Teammate?

566
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,079
Why?

567
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,760
Have they been in touch?

568
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:02,800
I'm not clear about it, either.

569
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,079
She called my mom all of a sudden,

570
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:08,040
and suggested about a compromise,

571
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,880
so my mom went to find Coach Zhuang.

572
00:25:16,439 --> 00:25:17,000
Alright.

573
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,359
Come on.

574
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:33,439
Alright, alright.

575
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:35,280
Let dad do it.

576
00:25:35,959 --> 00:25:36,520
It's okay.

577
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,119
You go to your room
and pack your things.

578
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:42,760
Tomorrow you have to go back to the team

579
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:44,000
for training.

580
00:25:45,239 --> 00:25:46,719
But my mom doesn't...

581
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,959
Don't worry about it.

582
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,319
Just go to your room

583
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,239
and pack your things.

584
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,560
Be good.

585
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:57,119
Thank you, dad.

586
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,920
You've got my clothes dirty.

587
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,000
Just go, just go.

588
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:02,319
Pack your things.

589
00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:05,119
Alright, just go.

590
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:06,719
Come on.

591
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:07,959
Just go.

592
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:36,920
Darling.

593
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,479
I told Yiyi to pack things

594
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,599
and get back to school.

595
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,640
She can get back to school,

596
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,119
but she can't get back to Wind Chaser.

597
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,119
You shall be concerned
about our daughter.

598
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:49,479
She's just got into
the professional team,

599
00:26:49,959 --> 00:26:51,160
and she will attend the Asian Cup.

600
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:52,640
Don't screw it up

601
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:54,079
because of the coach.

602
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,680
She has no future with Zhuang Yue.

603
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,599
Maybe she can change the coach.

604
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,199
Even if I

605
00:27:01,479 --> 00:27:02,640
don't watch sports news regularly,

606
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,359
I know that

607
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,239
Zhuang Yue is a coach for
cultivating champions.

608
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,839
She coached an

609
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,160
especially good player called...

610
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:09,880
Eunkyung Choi.

611
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,839
Stop it.

612
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,520
There are plenty of good coaches.

613
00:27:18,239 --> 00:27:19,800
I think Coach Xiao is nice.

614
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,599
I think that

615
00:27:22,239 --> 00:27:23,920
you're not afraid that our daughter

616
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,560
has no promising future with Zhuang Yue.

617
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,479
You're afraid she's so promising.

618
00:27:27,959 --> 00:27:28,599
Therefore,

619
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:30,520
for every gold medal Zhengyi gets,

620
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:32,640
for every new record Zhengyi sets,

621
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,160
the part of the achievement

622
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,719
should be credited to Zhuang Yue.

623
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,439
You can't accept that,

624
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,199
right?

625
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:39,520
Nonsense.

626
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:42,439
Alright, alright.
Don't do that to me.

627
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,839
You're confused.

628
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:46,800
Which side are you on?

629
00:27:47,239 --> 00:27:48,520
Do the opposite of what I say.

630
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,839
Do the opposite of what I say.

631
00:27:50,959 --> 00:27:52,479
You're on the kid's side right now.

632
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,119
Go, go sleep in the living room.

633
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,839
So annoying.

634
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,839
Then I'll sleep in the living room.

635
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:01,800
I can watch the tablet there.

636
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:09,479
What time does your training start?

637
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,239
I'll drop you off after breakfast.

638
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,239
Will it be late?

639
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:17,680
No, thanks.

640
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,239
I'm not going back today.

641
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,599
I took a leave of absence
from Coach Xiao.

642
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,719
I'll stay home with you
for a few more days.

643
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,920
Mom, your leg hurts these days,

644
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:27,959
so you just take a rest,

645
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:28,880
and leave the chores

646
00:28:29,719 --> 00:28:30,880
to me and my dad.

647
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,359
Don't bother.

648
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,800
I'm okay.

649
00:28:34,439 --> 00:28:35,719
The daughter is worrying about you.

650
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,400
I have

651
00:28:37,479 --> 00:28:38,520
no such treatment.

652
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:40,680
Alright.

653
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:42,160
Both of you get some rest.

654
00:28:42,959 --> 00:28:44,880
I'm here to book the
professional cleaning.

655
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,319
It's so convenient,
we can make a reservation anytime.

656
00:28:47,479 --> 00:28:48,119
Look.

657
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,240
(Online Booking for Cleaning)

658
00:28:50,959 --> 00:28:52,199
Then, let's make a reservation
this afternoon.

659
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,439
Okay?

660
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,599
Okay, then this afternoon.

661
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:58,920
Have breakfast.

662
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,760
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team of
Lingbei University)

663
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:19,839
I cannot do it anymore. I cannot.

664
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,119
I have to take a rest.

665
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,400
Oh my goodness!

666
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:23,599
I am exhausted.

667
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,319
Lele.

668
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:26,880
Why didn't Zhengyi
come to training today?

669
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:28,760
She...

670
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:30,119
She had a family thing.

671
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,719
She has to stay at home
for a few more days.

672
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:32,880
What happened?

673
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,439
Well, I don't know exactly.

674
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,719
And you don't have to ask.

675
00:29:38,439 --> 00:29:39,920
Why don't you practice
in the training?

676
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,359
Do you all think you're
the number one in the world?

677
00:29:42,719 --> 00:29:43,520
10 sets as a penalty.

678
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,199
Coach Zhuang.

679
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,719
I need to tell you something.

680
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,439
Zhengyi asked me for leave today,

681
00:29:59,719 --> 00:30:01,119
and she said she couldn't come
to train for a few days.

682
00:30:01,479 --> 00:30:02,599
Do you know the reason?

683
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:05,280
I know.

684
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,680
You've heard about it, right?

685
00:30:11,959 --> 00:30:12,760
Indeed,

686
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:14,239
the Asian Cup is coming.

687
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,439
If she is absent for one day,

688
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,680
it will cause a loss to her
during the period.

689
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:17,920
I really hope

690
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:18,920
you can solve this issue

691
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,800
as soon as possible.

692
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:21,880
Rest assured.

693
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:23,119
I will figure it out
as soon as possible.

694
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,359
What are you doing here?

695
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:27,959
Too fast.

696
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,280
Don't fool me.

697
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:34,760
Mom.

698
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:36,040
Where are you going?

699
00:30:37,719 --> 00:30:39,599
Shen Zhengyi has been absent
for the whole day,

700
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:41,040
I have to talk to her.

701
00:30:42,239 --> 00:30:42,680
This competition

702
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,800
is so important to her.

703
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,199
Mom.

704
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:44,800
I just wanted

705
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,760
to talk about it.

706
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:46,800
It's not that Zhengyi

707
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,040
doesn't trust you.

708
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:48,680
She has to take care of

709
00:30:48,719 --> 00:30:49,640
her mother's feelings.

710
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,800
So she just wants to wait

711
00:30:50,959 --> 00:30:51,880
for her mom to calm down,

712
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:53,199
then she'll be back to training.

713
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,959
But the absence in training

714
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:56,680
at this point

715
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,040
will affect her competitive skills.

716
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,439
If it still doesn't work,

717
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:01,880
I'll go find Wang Limin

718
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:03,520
to say sorry to her.

719
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,400
I'll do whatever works,

720
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,439
as long as it doesn't interfere
with Shen Zhengyi's race.

721
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,400
No way, Mom.

722
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,599
If you go to see auntie now,

723
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,880
you'll irritate her even more.

724
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,119
Or, you just

725
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,280
leave it to me.

726
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,920
You?

727
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:24,239
Zhengyi.

728
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,400
Coach Xiao,

729
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,800
why are you here?

730
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,160
Will you sketch?

731
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,199
You came to see me for...

732
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,760
Would you like to talk with me?

733
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:38,800
You're trying to persuade
me to go back, right?

734
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,719
Let's go sit over there and talk.

735
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:43,800
Okay.

736
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:00,760
So that's what happened.

737
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,839
Now I do not know

738
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,880
what to do.

739
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:05,520
I'm sorry, Zhengyi.

740
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,000
I didn't care enough about you

741
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,199
when you need help the most,

742
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,920
I feel really bad about it.

743
00:32:11,439 --> 00:32:12,040
It's okay.

744
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,719
Zhengyi.

745
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,479
I know how you feel.

746
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,400
On one side is your own mother,

747
00:32:17,719 --> 00:32:18,319
on the other side is

748
00:32:18,439 --> 00:32:19,280
your most trusted coach

749
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,920
and your boyfriend's mother.

750
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,560
You're difficult

751
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,680
to be in the middle, right?

752
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:30,599
If...

753
00:32:33,479 --> 00:32:33,959
If your mom

754
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:35,359
just can't accept Coach Zhuang

755
00:32:35,439 --> 00:32:36,439
as your coach,

756
00:32:37,439 --> 00:32:38,160
I can take full responsibility

757
00:32:38,239 --> 00:32:39,079
for your training.

758
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:40,079
So your mom

759
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:41,319
won't oppose you.

760
00:32:43,239 --> 00:32:44,479
I don't know.

761
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:47,160
But if I do so,

762
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,880
Coach Zhuang will be in a tough spot.

763
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,239
There's no other way.

764
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,959
Are you going to give up your training

765
00:32:57,599 --> 00:32:58,680
and Asian Cup?

766
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,040
(Asian Cup, go!)

767
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:34,430
(Asian Cup, go!)

768
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,880
Who's it?

769
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:49,599
Hi, auntie.

770
00:33:51,239 --> 00:33:52,040
Zhengyi is not at home.

771
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,479
No, auntie.

772
00:33:54,479 --> 00:33:56,079
I have a few words to say to you.

773
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:57,959
Just a few words.

774
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,160
You are Zhuang Yue's son.

775
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:02,680
I don't blame you for
standing by her side.

776
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,439
But if you come to persuade me

777
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,400
for Zhuang Yue,

778
00:34:05,719 --> 00:34:06,920
don't waste your time.

779
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:07,839
Auntie.

780
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,199
First, I want to

781
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,760
say sorry to you
on behalf of my mother.

782
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:11,840
For many years,

783
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,679
she has always felt

784
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,679
that she's sorry to you.

785
00:34:14,479 --> 00:34:15,080
It's true.

786
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,760
In fact, she really wanted

787
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,120
the gold medal in the
competition back then.

788
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,520
But there's no way she could

789
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:21,879
hurt you because of the gold medal.

790
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:22,639
She was speeding up

791
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:23,560
to block

792
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,159
the opponents in the back.

793
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,560
I hope if you two have time,

794
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:29,280
you can find a place

795
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:30,159
to talk it out

796
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,840
and resolve the misunderstanding.

797
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:34,600
I...

798
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:36,399
Are you done?

799
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:38,840
Yes.

800
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,439
Auntie, I...

801
00:35:03,879 --> 00:35:04,840
Shao Beisheng.

802
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,040
Why are you here?

803
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:08,959
I'm here for you.

804
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:11,080
You saw my mom?

805
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,399
She scolded you?

806
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:15,560
No.

807
00:35:16,479 --> 00:35:17,760
Auntie was very kind.

808
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:20,159
As you don't go to practice today,

809
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,399
my mom is worrying that it

810
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,280
will affect the Asian Cup.

811
00:35:22,959 --> 00:35:23,560
Don't worry.

812
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:24,800
Rest assured.

813
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:26,280
I'll figure it out myself.

814
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:31,600
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team of
Lingbei University)

815
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,399
Assemble.

816
00:35:41,479 --> 00:35:42,239
Excuse me!

817
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,040
Shen Zhengyi.

818
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,199
From now on,

819
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:56,719
you'll train with Coach Xiao.

820
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:58,080
Back to the team.

821
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:01,879
Okay.

822
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,280
Next,

823
00:36:03,879 --> 00:36:05,080
we'll do endurance training.

824
00:36:05,439 --> 00:36:08,120
Group B, come with me
to jump the rope ladder.

825
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:10,800
Hurry up. Hurry up.

826
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,560
Group A, pull the cloth bag.

827
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:13,879
Shen Zhengyi, warm up.

828
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,520
Lele.

829
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,239
What's going on?

830
00:36:20,919 --> 00:36:21,439
Why didn't Coach Zhuang

831
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,760
train Zhengyi suddenly?

832
00:36:23,919 --> 00:36:25,080
Doesn't the coach frequently

833
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:26,600
change the training
plan before the competition?

834
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:27,560
It's normal.

835
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:28,959
Come on.

836
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,360
(Striving, Perseverance)

837
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,120
Zhengyi, Lele.

838
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:34,719
We gotta go.

839
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:35,879
- Bye.
- Bye.

840
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,840
Bye.

841
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,040
I didn't expect that

842
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:43,760
such a coincidence

843
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,919
could happen to the two of you.

844
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,280
So now Shao Beisheng and you

845
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,520
become contemporary

846
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:50,600
Romeo and Juliet.

847
00:36:51,439 --> 00:36:52,280
Anyway, both of us

848
00:36:52,439 --> 00:36:53,600
are on the same side.

849
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,760
We need to comfort

850
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:55,719
my mom first,

851
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,439
and then we'll figure out ways to

852
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,639
resolve her misunderstanding.

853
00:36:59,959 --> 00:37:01,000
So what you guys came up with

854
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,560
is to ask Coach Xiao to teach you?

855
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,840
Just the first step, the first step.

856
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:12,399
I have a few words to Zhengyi.

857
00:37:13,479 --> 00:37:14,280
Bye, Coach Zhuang.

858
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:15,320
Bye.

859
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,199
I'm glad you're back.

860
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,199
I'm sorry, Coach Zhuang.

861
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,919
My mother still has a grudge.

862
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,199
So I can only

863
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,879
train with Coach Xiao.

864
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:32,919
You don't have to apologize to me.

865
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:35,639
I should be the one who shall
express my gratitude.

866
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:38,080
Thanks for trusting me.

867
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,719
Of course,

868
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:42,840
you have to take care of

869
00:37:42,919 --> 00:37:43,879
your mom's feeling.

870
00:37:44,479 --> 00:37:45,360
That's fine.

871
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,080
Train with Coach Xiao well.

872
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:50,479
I just want to tell you that

873
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,360
Coach Xiao has developed a

874
00:37:52,439 --> 00:37:53,320
training plan.

875
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,320
If you think it's too intense,

876
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:57,320
and too boring,

877
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,560
don't just stick it out.

878
00:37:58,879 --> 00:38:00,239
You can tell me, okay?

879
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,000
Okay.

880
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:04,280
Fighting!

881
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,000
Thank you, Coach Zhuang.

882
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:05,760
Okay.

883
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,720
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team of
Lingbei University)

884
00:38:31,879 --> 00:38:32,600
Last three.

885
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:33,879
Fighting!

886
00:38:34,439 --> 00:38:35,040
Three.

887
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,000
Awesome.

888
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:36,959
Two more, come on.

889
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,159
Two.

890
00:38:39,479 --> 00:38:40,159
Last one.

891
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,360
Okay.

892
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,520
Are you okay?

893
00:38:52,919 --> 00:38:53,840
My leg just hurts.

894
00:38:53,919 --> 00:38:54,520
I'll just take a break.

895
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,239
Drink something warm after exercising.

896
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,520
Thank you, Coach Xiao.

897
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,800
Here, I'll make you relax.

898
00:39:14,479 --> 00:39:15,360
Just endure it.

899
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:32,719
When can I get such

900
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,679
one-on-one training?

901
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,919
So jealous.

902
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:41,840
What's wrong with you?

903
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,320
It hurts. It hurts.

904
00:39:45,439 --> 00:39:46,679
It hurts. It hurts.

905
00:39:47,399 --> 00:39:49,120
Excuse me,
I have to go to the rest room.

906
00:39:55,919 --> 00:39:56,679
The outfit is nice.

907
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,040
I'll send you the link later.

908
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:01,879
It's that late.

909
00:40:03,439 --> 00:40:04,320
You guys, hurry up.

910
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:05,080
Or later,

911
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:06,120
the canteen will be closed.

912
00:40:06,399 --> 00:40:07,120
Right away.

913
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:17,439
Zhengyi, how is your leg?

914
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,520
Nothing. Caused by training.

915
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,360
Why isn't Lele with you today?

916
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,479
Lele went to

917
00:40:23,919 --> 00:40:25,080
have dinner with Qu Zhi.

918
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,360
Do you want to

919
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,199
have dinner with us?

920
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:28,639
No, you guys go ahead and have dinner.

921
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:29,959
I'll go take a shower.

922
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,399
Zhengyi, don't you have dinner with us?

923
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,080
No, you just go.

924
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,600
So poor.

925
00:40:58,439 --> 00:40:59,159
Mr. Zhao.

926
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,439
Shao.

927
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,679
What are you doing?
Why don't you go home?

928
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,120
I am waiting for Shen Zhengyi.

929
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,040
There's no one up there
and the doors have been locked.

930
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:06,760
There is no one?

931
00:41:07,919 --> 00:41:08,439
Are you

932
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:09,600
at odds with your girlfriend?

933
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:10,919
No.

934
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:12,280
Alright, then I'll leave.

935
00:41:12,439 --> 00:41:13,199
Okay.

936
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,800
