=To Fly With You=

2
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,990
=Episode 28=

3
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,480
You still bother to...

4
00:01:59,279 --> 00:02:00,040
Lele.

5
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:02,919
Why are you crying?

6
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:04,680
It has nothing to do with you.

7
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,559
Both of you are liars!

8
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:08,919
So annoying.

9
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,360
I'm... sorry.

10
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:14,600
I have told you
it has nothing to do with you.

11
00:02:14,679 --> 00:02:16,039
What are you sorry for?

12
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,360
Well...

13
00:02:19,279 --> 00:02:20,360
You had a fight with Qu Zhi?

14
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:23,039
No, we broke up.

15
00:02:25,399 --> 00:02:25,919
Is there any misunderstanding

16
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:26,919
between you two?

17
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,000
No misunderstanding.

18
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,600
Now he just thinks

19
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:33,360
I don't know about acting
as much as the beauty queen does.

20
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:35,240
I'm not as beautiful as she is.

21
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,720
And I'm not as educated as she is.

22
00:02:37,279 --> 00:02:38,119
He just doesn't want me.

23
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,160
It's not possible.

24
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:40,479
He told me before that

25
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:41,919
you are the best,

26
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,240
no matter on the stage and
off the stage.

27
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,919
Don't comfort me.

28
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,360
Really.

29
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:47,479
Why do I have to lie to you about this?

30
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,919
And that day he also said

31
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,479
a lot of nice words about you.

32
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,839
Well, what else did he say?

33
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,039
He said...

34
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,679
He said you are like the sun.

35
00:02:58,919 --> 00:02:59,720
He said the people who don't like you

36
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,399
are in the closet.

37
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,720
135.

38
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,720
136.

39
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:33,559
13...

40
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,720
You slack off when
there is no supervision.

41
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,600
Who is slacking off?

42
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:46,479
Don't ask me to play with you,

43
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,160
I'm telling you.

44
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:48,600
I haven't finished the tasks

45
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,559
Coach Xiao gave me.

46
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:50,600
He asked me to jump 200 times.

47
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,039
I have only done

48
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,160
137 so far,

49
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,360
and I can't do it anymore.

50
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,080
Get up!

51
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,600
Let's play a game.

52
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,679
I don't wanna play with you.

53
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,600
I'm already like this.

54
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:01,839
Get up!

55
00:04:03,119 --> 00:04:03,679
I promise

56
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,720
this game

57
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:06,160
can help you finish the tasks

58
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,360
and make you less tired.

59
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,399
What game?

60
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,279
I'll jump with you.

61
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,839
Rock, scissors, paper.

62
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,039
The one who loses jumps once.

63
00:04:14,679 --> 00:04:15,240
Why should I

64
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:15,919
play this game with you?

65
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:16,799
I may as well...

66
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:18,359
Come on. Maybe

67
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:19,359
you can keep winning,

68
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,239
and I'll jump all the time.

69
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:21,799
You can watch me jump

70
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,799
and you'll be very happy.

71
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,600
Right?

72
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,839
Come on.

73
00:04:28,679 --> 00:04:29,799
That's true.

74
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,720
Come on. Come on.

75
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm telling you.

76
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,040
I have never

77
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,040
lost in the game of rock-scissors-paper.

78
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,119
Better be.

79
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,320
Where do we start?

80
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,239
From here.

81
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,119
Start from here

82
00:04:43,679 --> 00:04:44,720
and turn back, okay?

83
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,239
Come on.

84
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,600
Rock, scissors, paper.

85
00:04:51,679 --> 00:04:52,279
I'm done.

86
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,600
Come on.

87
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,359
Maybe in the second round, you can...

88
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm done.

89
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,279
Maybe in the second round, I will lose.

90
00:04:56,679 --> 00:04:57,239
Right?

91
00:04:59,239 --> 00:05:00,600
Come on. Rock...

92
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,679
Jump! You lost!

93
00:05:01,799 --> 00:05:02,239
No. One more time.

94
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:02,720
Why not?

95
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:03,600
One more time. Hurry up!

96
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,359
You shameless!

97
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,799
I am. Come on.

98
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:07,559
Come on.

99
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,040
Rock, scissors, paper.

100
00:05:11,359 --> 00:05:12,000
Then I'll cheat once too.

101
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:13,359
- OK. Let's get started.
- OK.

102
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,799
Rock, scissors, paper.

103
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,160
You will play nothing but rocks.
Such an honest person.

104
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:20,399
Hurry.

105
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,040
138.

106
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:24,559
- Come on.
- OK. 138.

107
00:05:25,239 --> 00:05:26,720
Rock, scissors, paper.

108
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,720
Got you.

109
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,239
Why would I

110
00:05:31,559 --> 00:05:33,239
play this game with you?

111
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,600
I'm pissed off! Come on!

112
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,399
Paper!

113
00:05:38,799 --> 00:05:39,399
How about this?

114
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,239
I want a new rule.

115
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,920
A new rule, now?

116
00:05:42,239 --> 00:05:44,040
If I catch up with you,

117
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,359
you have to give me a kiss.

118
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,239
What rule is this?

119
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:51,720
We haven't been dating for a long time.

120
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:52,839
You're busy with training every day.

121
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:54,600
Let's treat the training this time

122
00:05:55,239 --> 00:05:56,000
as a date

123
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,239
and treat the date as training.

124
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,239
How do you like it?

125
00:06:00,119 --> 00:06:00,679
Fine.

126
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,720
I'm gonna jump.

127
00:06:02,119 --> 00:06:02,920
You won't catch up with me anyway.

128
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:07,480
What are you doing?

129
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,600
Why did you swing your arms?

130
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,799
Why did you swing your arms?

131
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,920
I didn't say I would do the leapfrog.

132
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,600
Well...

133
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,000
You cheated too! You cheated!

134
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,079
Come on.

135
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:17,480
Fine. Come on. Be serious.

136
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,279
Don't move.

137
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,359
Done.

138
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:20,160
Alright. Come on.

139
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,600

149
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:01,600
We made it.

150
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,239
I highly doubt you did it on purpose.

151
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,399
You got me lose all the time.

152
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,959
I've overfulfilled the task.

153
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,160
My legs got so sore.

154
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,480
You've been working so hard.

155
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,480
Be gentle. Be gentle.

156
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:15,839
You've been training so hard.

157
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,040
Can you really handle it?

158
00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:19,679
What else can I do?

159
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,480
I'm the weakest

160
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:22,920
in skills and endurance.

161
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:24,040
As for endurance,

162
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:24,839
as long as you work hard,

163
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:26,239
there will be results.

164
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:28,040
So I have to work hard.

165
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,239
I'm so envious that you know

166
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,040
where to go.

167
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,839
Not like me.

168
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,239
I really feel

169
00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:36,040
I can't break through

170
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:37,040
my bottleneck.

171
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,399
Why? Diet doesn't work?

172
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,279
I have lost weight.

173
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:43,839
But it seems that

174
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:47,160
the outcome is trivial.

175
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:50,480
If you can

176
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,160
achieve the speed in
short track speed skating,

177
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,320
after the take-off,

178
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,040
I'm sure you can jump
higher and further.

179
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,160
It seems to make sense.

180
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,640
But I'm not sure

181
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,600
what will happen
if I put it into practice.

182
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,399
Let's think about it later.

183
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:10,839
Drink some water. Here.

184
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,600
Let me give you a massage.

185
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,959
If you feel the soreness, it'll work.

186
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:28,600
Here. It's here.

187
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:29,480
You...

188
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:32,400
It hurts.

189
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,280
It hurts.

190
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,599
It hurts!

191
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:47,599
Help!

192
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:49,599
The chair. Hurry!

193
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,719
Lele. The chair.

194
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,280
Oh my god.

195
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,840
What happened to you?

196
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,039
Let me give you a massage.

197
00:08:59,479 --> 00:08:59,919
What happened?

198
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:00,840
My legs hurt.

199
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,080
My leg. My leg.

200
00:09:02,359 --> 00:09:02,960
What happened?

201
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:04,159
I've been climbing stairs all night.

202
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,520
My legs are already gone.

203
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:07,280
So poor of you.

204
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:08,719
You are sweating.

205
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:09,960
Go take a shower

206
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:10,840
with the amino acid mud

207
00:09:11,479 --> 00:09:12,840
and give it a deep cleaning

208
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:14,239
(Letter of Resignation)
to allow the pores to breathe freely.

209
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,280
What's this?

210
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,520
Letter of resignation.

211
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:20,960
You wanna leave the club?

212
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:23,159
Why? You were still practicing

213
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,239
in the last couple of days.

214
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:26,479
Forget about it.

215
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,400
I got beaten by the beauty queen.

216
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,599
Lost the female lead role?

217
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,599
How about your ex-boyfriend?

218
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:40,599
That's why I prepared

219
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,359
for the last shot.

220
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,719
How?

221
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,359
I'm gonna outfox him.

222
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,060
(Letter of Resignation)

223
00:09:57,119 --> 00:09:58,400
Let's start since everyone is here.

224
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,119
President, there is one missing.

225
00:10:01,119 --> 00:10:02,880
Lele hasn't been here for two days.

226
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,960
She won't draw props for us?

227
00:10:07,119 --> 00:10:08,640
We can't make props without her?

228
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,760
If she quits,

229
00:10:11,119 --> 00:10:11,840
shall we

230
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,039
also dismiss?

231
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,400
I know myself.

232
00:10:19,239 --> 00:10:19,640
I know

233
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,239
the club

234
00:10:20,359 --> 00:10:21,239
doesn't need me anymore.

235
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,479
Since you are so reluctant

236
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,359
to see me,

237
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,400
there is

238
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,359
no point for me to stay.

239
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,760
This is my letter of resignation.

240
00:10:29,119 --> 00:10:30,039
- Lele.
- Lele.

241
00:10:48,359 --> 00:10:49,520
Fine. I got it.

242
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:50,840
You can leave.

243
00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:52,000
President.

244
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:52,960
Come on.

245
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:09,119
- Lele.
- Lele.

246
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,280
President,

247
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,719
Lele was just

248
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,640
waiting for you to ask her to stay.

249
00:11:18,359 --> 00:11:19,119
Her heart is not here.

250
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,400
How to keep her?

251
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,760
She won't stay.

252
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,359
Will we rehearse or what?

253
00:11:31,239 --> 00:11:33,000
Yes. Yes.

254
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:36,960
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team of
Lingbei University)

255
00:11:43,719 --> 00:11:44,599
Lower yourself a little bit.

256
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:49,159
Don't slack off.

257
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:52,599
What's wrong with you?

258
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,479
What's wrong, Shen Zhengyi?

259
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:54,880
I got a cramp.

260
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,000
Cramp?

261
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,119
Left leg?

262
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,760
Hold against her.
Give her a massage.

263
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,719
What happened?

264
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,239
Got a cramp right at the beginning
of the training?

265
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,640
Not enough warm-up

266
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,760
or you're too tired?

267
00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:12,640
Sorry.

268
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,119
I didn't do much warm-up.

269
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,640
I'm telling you, Shen Zhengyi.

270
00:12:16,479 --> 00:12:17,520
Don't be proud because

271
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,479
you've just made some achievement.

272
00:12:19,119 --> 00:12:20,640
There are so many people
better than you.

273
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,640
You don't even work hard on the warm-up.

274
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,640
Take a break over there.

275
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,640
Ten sets of leapfrog later!

276
00:12:30,239 --> 00:12:31,000
Why are you standing here?

277
00:12:31,239 --> 00:12:31,880
Keep going!

278
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,520
Ten sets of leapfrog.

279
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:35,119
What are you looking at?

280
00:12:36,119 --> 00:12:36,960
- Let me help.
- Zhu Lele.

281
00:12:38,719 --> 00:12:39,599
What uniform are you wearing?

282
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,880
You're everywhere.

283
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,359
Let me.

284
00:12:45,719 --> 00:12:46,520
Be careful.

285
00:12:47,119 --> 00:12:48,239
Help her stretch her muscles.

286
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,440
Relax.

287
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,359
Thank you.

288
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:02,280
It's fine.

289
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,880
Come in.

290
00:13:16,359 --> 00:13:17,159
Mom.

291
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,479
I knew you would be still working.

292
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,520
I'm done.

293
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,119
You still practise at this hour?

294
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,520
You have to have a good rest.

295
00:13:28,239 --> 00:13:28,840
I'm okay.

296
00:13:29,119 --> 00:13:30,000
Compared with Zhengyi,

297
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:31,039
this is not late.

298
00:13:31,359 --> 00:13:32,520
Shen Zhengyi is still practicing?

299
00:13:33,359 --> 00:13:34,640
She is still practicing the endurance.

300
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,719
Endurance practice?

301
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,880
She's been working
with Xiao Han these days

302
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,960
on endurance practice

303
00:13:41,119 --> 00:13:42,119
and been working very late every day.

304
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,479
It seems like she got pumped up.

305
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,000
What's wrong?

306
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,400
Nothing.

307
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,599
I am too careless.

308
00:13:54,119 --> 00:13:54,719
Mom,

309
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,239
is this a picture of you
when you were young?

310
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,479
Your teammate looks so familiar.

311
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,840
She is Zhengyi's mother, isn't she?

312
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:08,760
- I...
- Yes, she is.

313
00:14:09,119 --> 00:14:10,479
So, you're teammates.

314
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:12,359
What a coincidence!

315
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,359
Why didn't you tell Zhengyi?

316
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,520
Don't tell her.

317
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:18,400
What do you mean?

318
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,520
Zhengyi's mother

319
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:26,880
used to be

320
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
a short track speed skating player.

321
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,520
She retired because of injury.

322
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:31,960
I know that.

323
00:14:32,599 --> 00:14:33,119
Zhengyi told me

324
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,239
her mother

325
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,039
had an accident in a game

326
00:14:36,359 --> 00:14:37,359
and got hit by her teammate.

327
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:46,599
So you are the teammate.

328
00:14:50,359 --> 00:14:51,960
That accident was indeed

329
00:14:52,479 --> 00:14:53,880
because of me.

330
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,880
I have been very guilty.

331
00:14:57,119 --> 00:14:57,520
After all,

332
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,400
there was a crisis of trust

333
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,280
between us.

334
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,520
As her teammate and partner,

335
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:06,359
I didn't win her trust,

336
00:15:06,599 --> 00:15:08,000
but made her misunderstand me.

337
00:15:11,599 --> 00:15:12,039
I don't get it.

338
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:12,880
If it was a misunderstanding,

339
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,000
can we just figure it out?

340
00:15:15,719 --> 00:15:16,640
You silly boy.

341
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,159
If I could do that,

342
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,239
I've already done it.

343
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,119
For an athlete,

344
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,159
it was too much for her

345
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,359
to retire due to injury.

346
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:31,159
But

347
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,880
I really can't tell Zhengyi?

348
00:15:35,719 --> 00:15:37,159
I don't think it is good to
keep it from her.

349
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,119
Besides, maybe

350
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,520
after she knows,

351
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,239
the misunderstanding

352
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,880
between you two can be solved.

353
00:15:42,239 --> 00:15:43,119
Beisheng,

354
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,039
there are many things

355
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:47,520
not as simple as you think.

356
00:15:49,359 --> 00:15:50,640
Do you know

357
00:15:51,119 --> 00:15:52,520
what Asian Cup means

358
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:54,599
to Shen Zhengyi?

359
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,719
This is the first international event

360
00:15:58,119 --> 00:15:59,760
in her life.

361
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,159
So, I don't want

362
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:02,880
anything to

363
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,520
affect her training.

364
00:16:05,719 --> 00:16:06,400
But don't worry.

365
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,119
When Asian Cup is over,

366
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,880
I will find a chance

367
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
to tell her.

368
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:47,159
Lele,

369
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,119
can I borrow

370
00:16:48,239 --> 00:16:49,119
your hair dryer, please?

371
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,359
What's wrong with you?

372
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,760
I got the wrong one.

373
00:17:05,719 --> 00:17:06,520
Well, sweetie.

374
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,839
Are you okay?

375
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,400
Those get-back-together stories
in the novels

376
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,719
are all fake.

377
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,040
And I was so stupid to learn from them.

378
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,520
What should I do?

379
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:22,400
I've done everything I can figure out.

380
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,520
What does he want from me?

381
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:27,000
It's okay, dear.

382
00:17:27,239 --> 00:17:27,880
It's all his fault.

383
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,880
Let's forget about him.

384
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:30,880
It's all his problem.

385
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:31,959
He

386
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:32,959
is black,

387
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:34,400
dry,

388
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,119
and skinny.

389
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:36,239
He only has single-fold eyelids

390
00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:38,119
and talks too much.

391
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,359
He's not your type.

392
00:17:39,479 --> 00:17:40,040
Don't like him any more.

393
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,119
Let's change to another one, OK?

394
00:17:41,959 --> 00:17:43,599
Don't mention it anymore.

395
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,719
Alright, alright.

396
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,760
Okay. I'm done. I'm done.

397
00:17:47,239 --> 00:17:48,719
It's OK.

398
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,680
So annoying.

399
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,400
(Zhengyi has started to)

400
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:00,640
(prepare for the Asian Cup.)

401
00:18:01,479 --> 00:18:02,599
(It would be a crucial game)

402
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,479
(in her professional life.)

403
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:05,760
(I don't want)

404
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:08,000
(anything to affect her training.)

405
00:18:10,239 --> 00:18:10,640
Right.

406
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,359
It's me to apply for the fieldwork.

407
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:16,479
Please feel free to contact me.

408
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:18,000
Okay.

409
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:19,359
Bye.

410
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,119
You're going to the fieldwork?

411
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,040
With Professor Li.

412
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,640
When? For how long?

413
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,280
After the rehearsal of the club's play.

414
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,040
I'll be there for
the whole vacation.

415
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,640
Did you tell Zhu Lele?

416
00:18:38,239 --> 00:18:38,959
No.

417
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:39,760
Such an important plan,

418
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,239
you don't tell your girlfriend?

419
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,760
Ex-girlfriend.

420
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,760
I have a question for you.

421
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:50,239
Go ahead.

422
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:53,479
For example, if you have

423
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:55,479
something very important,

424
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,719
and it

425
00:18:58,479 --> 00:18:59,640
will affect your girlfriend.

426
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,520
Let's assume now

427
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,359
Zhu Lele is your girlfriend.

428
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,760
It would affect her.

429
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,959
But

430
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:05,760
if you tell her,

431
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,359
it may affect her.

432
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:08,880
Are you still going to tell her?

433
00:19:09,239 --> 00:19:10,640
What are you hiding from Shen Zhengyi?

434
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,760
No, it's just an assumption.

435
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,760
Trust is fragile.

436
00:19:19,479 --> 00:19:20,359
Once it is broken,

437
00:19:20,719 --> 00:19:22,119
it is very difficult to rebuild it.

438
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,719
There's no point to regret.

439
00:19:25,719 --> 00:19:27,160
But what if it is out of goodwill?

440
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,359
The essence of it is still deception.

441
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,839
You're not in love with someone else,
are you?

442
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:38,760
Go away! No.

443
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:41,880
Really?

444
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:54,820
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team of
Lingbei University)

445
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,280
(Coach Office)

446
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,119
What's wrong, Coach Zhuang?

447
00:19:58,359 --> 00:19:58,959
Why is there

448
00:19:59,160 --> 00:19:59,959
extra training on endurance
for Shen Zhengyi?

449
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,760
She is poor at endurance.

450
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,880
That's why she needs
extra training on that.

451
00:20:03,239 --> 00:20:04,359
Why did you keep it from me?

452
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,599
You should be aware clearly that

453
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:06,760
it'll lead to sports injury

454
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,599
to the athlete

455
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,760
with highly intensive
endurance training

456
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,520
within a short period of time.

457
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,760
Don't worry about it.

458
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,040
The practice for her

459
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:14,599
is within

460
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,719
the limit of her body.

461
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,000
And 1500m's

462
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:17,719
tactical cooperation

463
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,880
requires specific training.

464
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,880
Is that specific training?

465
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:22,760
It's selective training.

466
00:20:23,239 --> 00:20:24,040
Did you tell Shen Zhengyi

467
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,359
your purpose of the training?

468
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,959
Your specific training intends to

469
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:29,599
let her lead

470
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,520
and assist Luo Xiaoyi

471
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,760
in Asian Cup, right?

472
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:34,280
Luo Xiaoyi's recent performance

473
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:34,839
has remained

474
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:36,119
within 2 minutes 35 seconds.

475
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,280
She is the best match in strength

476
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,520
with Eunkyung Choi.

477
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:39,239
If Shen Zhengyi

478
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:40,000
can assist Luo Xiaoyi,

479
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:41,040
I think it is

480
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:42,239
the best tactical arrangement
to win the championship.

481
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,640
Don't avoid my question.

482
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,719
I'm asking you

483
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
when you are going to tell Zhengyi.

484
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:46,959
Right before the game?

485
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:48,520
If you tell her that
she has to assist Luo Xiaoyi,

486
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,479
how will she feel?

487
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:50,760
How will she play the game?

488
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:52,880
Coach Xiao,

489
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,119
what's the most important thing

490
00:20:54,239 --> 00:20:55,040
in short track speed skating?

491
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,000
Tactical cooperation, isn't it?

492
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:56,719
What's the most important thing about

493
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:57,640
tactical cooperation?

494
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:58,880
It's trust.

495
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,040
Once there is a trust crisis

496
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,599
between teammates,

497
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,239
there will be

498
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,520
major accident during the game.

499
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:06,280
I'm telling you that

500
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,599
I have been through things like this.

501
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:10,160
So, I will not allow

502
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:10,640
this to happen again

503
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,719
in my team.

504
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,520
Stop training right now!

505
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,239
Do you get it?

506
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:14,280
Coach Zhuang,

507
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:16,640
what Wind Chaser needs now

508
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,760
is a champion team.

509
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,040
It needs a gold medal.

510
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,239
Without this gold medal,

511
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:21,359
Wind Chaser can't make it anymore.

512
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,640
It isn't only your team!

513
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,640
Fine.

514
00:21:30,719 --> 00:21:31,880
Let me tell you today.

515
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:35,040
I'm the chief coach of Wind Chaser.

516
00:21:35,719 --> 00:21:36,880
I'm the one to tell

517
00:21:37,239 --> 00:21:38,040
how Wind Chaser should develop.

518
00:21:38,959 --> 00:21:40,000
From today on,

519
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,880
you are not allowed to interfere with

520
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,520
any training of
Luo Xiaoyi and Shen Zhengyi.

521
00:21:44,239 --> 00:21:45,239
Get it?

522
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,640
What's up?

523
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:09,760
Are you really gonna
learn short track skating?

524
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,640
Come on. Show me your speed.

525
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,959
I really don't get it.

526
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:17,520
How can short track speed skating

527
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,880
help your figure skating?

528
00:22:19,719 --> 00:22:20,880
I had a discussion with Ma.

529
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,000
We think

530
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:23,239
you've made great sense.

531
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,239
What did I say?

532
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:27,959
Actually, for the quality

533
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:29,160
of our jumping moves,

534
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,359
a very important factor

535
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:31,599
is to improve

536
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,000
the acceleration

537
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:33,760
in transitional moves.

538
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,239
You said before

539
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,239
if I could have the acceleration
in short track skating,

540
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:38,000
I can definitely

541
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:38,959
jump higher and further.

542
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,359
I think

543
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:42,280
this can help me break through.

544
00:22:43,239 --> 00:22:44,760
So, you want to

545
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,040
improve the quality of your moves

546
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,760
with the skills for short track skating.

547
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,599
Exactly.

548
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,160
So, can you teach me,

549

550
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:56,760

Coach Zhuang said

587
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,400
I've had enough training these days

588
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,119
and no more training

589
00:24:46,239 --> 00:24:46,800
is needed with Coach Xiao.

590
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:47,479
Really?

591
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,239
That means

592
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:49,400
we can go on a date tomorrow?

593
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,959
I still feel a little bit strange.

594
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,400
I was planning to

595
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:56,160
bone up on training with Coach Xiao
during the vacation.

596
00:24:58,239 --> 00:24:59,000
I'm not complaining,

597
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,479
but I think Xiao Han's plan

598
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:01,239
is a little bit too much.

599
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:02,640

Don't give it another thought.

602
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,119
Coach Xiao just wants to

603
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:08,119
help me improve my endurance
as soon as possible.

604
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,119
I think no matter what he does,

605
00:25:10,199 --> 00:25:11,640
he must be like Coach Zhuang

606
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,520
and wishes me well.

607
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,119
If someone has goodwill to you,

608
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,640
but he

609
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,160
keeps something from you.

610
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,760

611

That's okay if it's not you.

613
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,359

I am the female lead,

654

00:26:57,479 --> 00:26:58,359
play the male lead.

656
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,400
It is not possible.

660

there is only one choice
to be his heroine.

(you are also someone special.)

696
00:29:17,199 --> 00:29:18,160
(I didn't think and
was talking in anger.)

697
00:29:18,719 --> 00:29:19,680
(Were you being blind too?)

698
00:29:20,439 --> 00:29:21,119
(Come and comfort me.)

699

Okay.

762
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,800
(I got something for you from vip.com)

763
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,800

766
00:32:33,239 --> 00:32:34,479
I'll go get something downstairs.

767
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,119
Excuse me?

768
00:32:41,239 --> 00:32:43,000
Lovers clothes, seriously?

769
00:32:43,479 --> 00:32:44,040
Why?

770
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:45,680
Qu Zhi told me that girls like it.

771
00:32:45,719 --> 00:32:46,479
So, I bought it.

772
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:47,719
Wearing lovers' clothes

773
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,160
is to announce our relationship

774
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,040
to the whole world.

775
00:32:50,479 --> 00:32:51,439

777
00:32:52,439 --> 00:32:53,239
I'll manage to

778
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,199
wear it with you.

779
00:32:54,719 --> 00:32:55,479
But, why is this clothes

780
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,439
so big?

781
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,160
Of course, it is the fashion wear

782
00:32:58,239 --> 00:32:59,119
which is loose.

783
00:32:59,719 --> 00:33:00,640
I'm almost at your house.

784
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:01,959
Get changed and

785
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:02,719
come down.

786
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:05,000
Okay.

787
00:33:23,959 --> 00:33:24,479

789
00:33:26,239 --> 00:33:27,199
my scissors?

790
00:33:28,959 --> 00:33:30,239
Check the coffee table

791
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,760
or the tea box.

792
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,680
Okay.

793
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,160
Help me hang the clothes.

794
00:33:36,719 --> 00:33:38,040
Okay. Okay.

795
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,439
Hi, dad.

796
00:33:45,719 --> 00:33:46,239
My baby girl.

797

00:33:49,719 --> 00:33:51,160

799
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,160
Same as usual.

800
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:53,160
I have an appointment later.

801
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:53,920
I'm going out.

802
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,880
Good luck to you.

803
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,560
You left me alone?

804
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,640
You are so mean.

805
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,239
Darling, I'm back.

806
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:11,520
You're doing the laundry?

807
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,560
I bought you some new clothes.

808
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,479
Have a try.

809
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:15,719
If it's not right for you,

810
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:16,639
I will make an appointment
for door-to-door exchange.

811
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:18,239
It's on the couch.

812
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,639
Okay. Okay.

813
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:26,959
So fashionable.

814
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,239
Let me try.

815
00:34:33,959 --> 00:34:34,879
The quality is so great!

816
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,040
Bye.

817
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:47,280
Darling, the trash can is full.

818
00:34:47,439 --> 00:34:48,439
I'm gonna get it empty.

819
00:35:02,959 --> 00:35:03,639
Mom,

820
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:07,399
where is my sweater?

821
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:10,479
Are you

822
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,959
part of this house or not?

823
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:13,439
Your dad asks me for everything.

824
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,919
You also ask me for everything.

825
00:35:15,479 --> 00:35:16,399
It's just... I just put my sweater

826
00:35:16,479 --> 00:35:17,560
right here.

827
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:19,239
Ask your dad.

828
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:21,800
Where is my dad?

829
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,600
The tuberose,

830
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,239
I'm singing for you.

831
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,479
Shen.

832
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:31,600
Are you going out?

833
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,040
Yes.

834
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:32,879
Shen.

835
00:35:33,399 --> 00:35:34,639
You look good today.

836
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:36,479
You seem to find your own youth again.

837
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,520
The first sentence is good enough.

838
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:39,479
The second one is not necessary.

839
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:40,199
Fine.

840
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:40,959
We're not old.

841
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:41,600
Not old. Not old.

842
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,520
We're middle-aged, middle-aged.

843
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,040
You're wearing lovers' clothes?

844
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,239
It's great. It's great.

845
00:36:04,439 --> 00:36:05,479
Nice to meet you, uncle.

846
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:34,840
Dad, would you like some water?

847
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,679
Don't be so serious.

848
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:38,439
It has to be serious.

849
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,040
Both of you, tell me.

850
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,679
What's this all about?

851
00:36:43,959 --> 00:36:45,040
- Classmates...
- Boy...

852
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,239
Tell me the truth.

853
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,439
- Boyfriend.
- Classmates.

854
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:55,560
You've decided to piss me off,

855
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,520
haven't you?

856
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:58,879
Alright.

857
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,120
You scared him.

858
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,840
Here. Have some fruit

859
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,679
and some drink.

860
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,360
Say it.

861
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:08,760
What is true?

862
00:37:08,919 --> 00:37:10,080
What is fake?

863
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,040
Uncle,

864
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,239
Lingbei University is true.

865
00:37:15,919 --> 00:37:17,199
Doing part-time job together is fake.

866
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,280
It's true that we are teammates
in Wind Chaser.

867
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,040
Pure friendship is fake.

868
00:37:22,919 --> 00:37:24,120
But it's true that I've never been

869
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:24,879
in a relationship.

870
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,199
It's also true that I am 1.8m tall.

871
00:37:26,479 --> 00:37:26,879
My weight...

872
00:37:26,959 --> 00:37:28,120
Nobody wants to know your height.

873
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,520
It's because you're taller than me,

874
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:29,879
isn't it?

875
00:37:29,879 --> 00:37:30,879
You wanna piss me off, don't you?

876
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,439
But uncle,

877
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,560
it's true that I like Zhengyi.

878
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,399
So much sweet talk

879
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,560
with empty promises.

880
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,320
Tell me.

881
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,199
What do your parents do?

882
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:50,719
Are they aware of that

883
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,399
you and Yiyi are seeing each other?

884
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,600
My dad is a journalist.

885
00:37:54,959 --> 00:37:55,760
My mom is...

886
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,560
My mom

887
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:03,560
knows that I'm seeing Zhengyi.

888
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:05,239
She also likes Zhengyi very much.

889
00:38:06,439 --> 00:38:07,040
Darling, darling.

890
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,080
Did you hear that?

891
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:08,879
Well...

892
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,959
Yiyi has met his mother.

893
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:13,320
What... What's going on here?

894
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,159
Shen.

895
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:15,639
Now that he is here,

896
00:38:15,719 --> 00:38:16,679
he is the guest.

897
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:17,280
Don't make it like

898
00:38:17,399 --> 00:38:18,560
interrogating a prisoner.

899
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,679
When you came to my home
for the first time,

900
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,280
my dad didn't treat you like this.

901
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,159
Shao,

902
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,760
stay for dinner.

903
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:27,479
No. No.

904
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:28,800
We have something else to do.

905
00:38:28,959 --> 00:38:30,360
We gotta go now.

906
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:31,560
Let's go. Hurry up.

907
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,520
You're very welcome to come often.

908
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:35,479
Thank you, untie.

909
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,479
Why are you looking at me?

910
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:45,159
Wanna stay for dinner?

911
00:38:47,719 --> 00:38:48,719
Could you please

912
00:38:49,439 --> 00:38:50,760
give the sweater back to me?

913
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:03,919
What's wrong?

914
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,080
Are you that afraid of my dad?

915
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,679
I was just worried that

916
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,439
I couldn't leave
good impression to them.

917
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,760
My dad just looks mean.

918
00:39:10,919 --> 00:39:11,879
You will get it later.

919
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,159
Besides, my mother's

920
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:14,520
attitude is pretty clear.

921
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:17,120
I didn't expect that

922
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:18,879
for the first time in my life,

923
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,159
it was your father who
I wore lovers' clothes with.

924
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,360
I think you two are a good match.

925
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,879
It looks great, doesn't it?

926
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,520
You're still laughing.

927
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:26,040
I'm so pissed off!

928
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:26,800
What are you doing?

929
00:39:26,919 --> 00:39:27,520
I can't see.

930
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,560
I'll take you to a good place.

931
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:31,679
Be careful.

932
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,840
Wait, what's going on?

933
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,800
I won't tell you.
We're almost there.

934
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,840
We often come here, don't we?

935
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,239
Why are you covering my eyes?

936
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,080
So mysterious.

937
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:41,159
We're almost there.

938
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:43,199
Watch your steps. Don't fall down.

939
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,040
Where are we going?

940
00:39:46,919 --> 00:39:47,679
We're almost there.

941
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:48,479
Well...

942
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,000
Ten more steps.

943
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,320
10, 9, 8, 7, 6,

944
00:39:51,439 --> 00:39:53,959
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

945
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:54,959
- Are we there yet?
- Okay.

946
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,959
Here we go. 3, 2, 1.

947
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:06,879
Is it good?

948
00:40:07,919 --> 00:40:08,719
You just made it?

949
00:40:08,919 --> 00:40:09,479
Yes.

950
00:40:13,959 --> 00:40:14,560
Where are you going?

951
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:16,159
Don't move. Stand here.

952
00:40:17,479 --> 00:40:18,280
Not done yet.

953
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,239
Look up here.

954
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:21,959
Don't move.

955
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:22,800
Why?

956
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,719
Looking at the sky?

957
00:40:25,439 --> 00:40:26,159
- Well...
- Stop talking.

958
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:28,959
Count down to 5 seconds.

959
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:30,560
Hurry. 5...

960
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:31,840
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

961
00:40:39,399 --> 00:40:40,879
It has started watering.

962
00:40:40,959 --> 00:40:41,679
Hurry up! Let's go!

963
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,320
Don't move. Don't move.

964
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:42,719
Let's go.

965
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,159
Keep your head there.

966
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:44,439
But why?

967
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,800
I'll get wet.

968
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:47,560
Well,

969
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:49,120
what am I supposed to look at?

970
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,199
Why isn't it there?

971
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,360
What isn't there?

972
00:40:56,719 --> 00:40:58,120
Aren't the flowers right here?

973
00:40:58,919 --> 00:40:59,600
Stand still.

974
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,280
What are you doing?

975
00:41:01,919 --> 00:41:02,719
Shao Beisheng, come back.

976
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,800
You are all wet.

977
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,399
Come on, come back.

978
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:06,159
Come back.

979
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,639
Don't... don't get wet.

980
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,760
Is... is it too far?

981
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:10,520
What is too far?

982
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,280
It is not there.

983
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:12,320
What is it?

984
00:41:12,879 --> 00:41:13,560
How come?

985
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:14,840
But every time I do the experiment,

986
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,760
it will be there.

987
00:41:15,879 --> 00:41:16,360
What's there?

988
00:41:16,479 --> 00:41:17,120
You didn't see the flowers?

989
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:18,239
It's right here.
