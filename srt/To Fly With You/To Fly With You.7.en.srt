=Episode 7=

3
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:47,279
What's wrong, Zhu Lele?

4
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,160
Shao Beisheng,

5
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:49,559
I keep you on top

6
00:01:49,639 --> 00:01:51,239
of my Lingbei New Style column.

7
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:52,080
But now

8
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,639
I think you are just a liar.

9
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:55,319
Do you know how much effort

10
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,040
Shen Zhengyi has put

11
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,080
just to get this ticket for you?

12
00:01:57,559 --> 00:01:58,800
She waited day and night

13
00:01:58,879 --> 00:01:59,800
to get the ticket for
you without sleeping.

14
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:01,120
She finally got it.

15
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,760
And you just gave it away.

16
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,239
Actually,

17
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:07,919
we are in a partnership.

18
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,440
But it was written in his contract

19
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,360
that I cannot tell

20
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,440
others about this.

21
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,600
So I have no other choice.

22
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:14,839
You didn't tell.

23
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,039
I guess that on my own.

24
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:18,720
Rest assured.

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,759
I'll keep it a secret.

26
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,320
Thank you.

27
00:02:22,119 --> 00:02:24,720
No, I have to thank you instead.

28
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,240
I'll tell you a secret too.

29
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,119
What is it?

30
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:32,160
I like Shao Beisheng.

31
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,679
I've actually met him

32
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:41,919
on the competition.

33
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:44,360
And I saw his very confident

34
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,919
and impressive performance,

35
00:02:46,839 --> 00:02:48,520
which is attractive to me.

36
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,000
Then I went back

37
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,919
to watch all of

38
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,039
his videos.

39
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:53,160
I think

40
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,520
I quite like him.

41
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,759
When I heard that

42
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,119
he was looking for a new partner,

43
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,279
I went back immediately.

44
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,839
I believe that being with Shao Beisheng,

45
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,320
I can get better records.

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,520
To be honest,

47
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:05,960
I was worried

48
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:06,880
if it was too impulsive

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,119
to do so,

50
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:11,119
but during the time I've spent with him,

51
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,240
I began to

52
00:03:12,679 --> 00:03:14,039
like him more and more.

53
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,160
Thank you, Zhengyi.

54
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,399
You told me this today

55
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,880
and it can drop the stone

56
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,839
in my heart.

57
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,720
I can be brave to pursue

58
00:03:23,839 --> 00:03:25,000
the one I like.

59
00:03:47,559 --> 00:03:48,160
Do you know how difficult

60
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,080
Shen Zhengyi

61
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,000
got the ticket for you?

62
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,679
She waited day and night

63
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:52,600
to get the ticket for
you without sleeping.

64
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:54,039
She finally got it.

65
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,800
And you just gave it away.

66
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,720
Two Elephants.

67
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,800
Is the musical good?

68
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,199
Of course.

69
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,559
It gave me a lot of inspiration.

70
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,880
I want to act out a play with

71
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,880
singing and dancing too.

72
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,119
The name would be

73
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,200
One

74
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,279
Pig.

75
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,839
Since it is good,

76
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,559
give me the ticket fee.

77
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:37,959
Shen Zhengyi, Shen Zhengyi,

78
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,440
you wanted to repay him.

79
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:40,839
It turned out
he didn't feel grateful at all.

80
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,119
One thousand yuan went into nothing.

81
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:44,160
You can only

82
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:45,359
eat steamed buns for three meals a day.

83
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:47,839
What a pity!

84
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:53,559
Zhengyi,

85
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,359
you told me this today

86
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,040
and it can drop the stone

87
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,160
in my heart.

88
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,880
I can be brave to pursue

89
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,119
the one I like.

90
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,920
Delicious.

91
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,820
(Shao Beisheng)

92
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:25,359
Hello.

93
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,399
In the dorm?

94
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:27,920
Yes, what?

95
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:29,359
Go downstairs.

96
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,200
I'm in a bad mood.

97
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:32,079
Can I not go down there?

98
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,079
No.

99
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,600
Just one minute. I will wait.

100
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:47,359
What is it?

101
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,559
The ticket fee.

102
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:50,040
No need.

103
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,440
Qu Zhi gave it to me.

104
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,640
He saw the musical,

105
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,000
and it is natural to pay you the fee.

106
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,040
Take it.

107
00:05:56,559 --> 00:05:57,480
Take it.

108
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,160
As for you,

109
00:06:02,799 --> 00:06:04,359
if you want to repay me
for saving your life,

110
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:06,200
can you please do what I want?

111
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,200
Then what do you want?

112
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,870
(Bounce Factory)

113
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,160
So the thing you want

114
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:18,799
is to let me

115
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,200
play the trampoline with you?

116
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:21,160
Yes!

117
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:22,679
But not entirely.

118
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,040
What do you mean?

119
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,559
What's this?

120
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,119
Watch me.

121
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,320
It is so simple.

122
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:42,600
As long as we can get the first prize,

123
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,239
I can get

124
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:45,200
the figure I want.

125
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,640
No way.

126
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:50,040
You can't even get up that high.

127
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:51,200
Neither can I.

128
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:51,920
Exactly.

129
00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:52,760
So I will throw you

130
00:06:53,359 --> 00:06:53,920
up there.

131
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:54,799
Don't worry.

132
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,880
I'm the best at lifting.

133
00:06:56,239 --> 00:06:57,399
No, no, bro.

134
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,200
I have a fear of height.

135
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:58,640
Or,

136
00:06:58,799 --> 00:06:59,839
well, I throw you.

137
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,559
I'm strong, too.

138
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,320
I throw you, okay?

139
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,079
Don't even think about it.

140
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:04,519
The photo of the one who gets thrown
up there and gets the prize

141
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,720
will be posted on the Honor Wall.

142
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,880
I can't afford that.

143
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,119
I can't afford that, too.

144
00:07:08,239 --> 00:07:09,600
I don't want to be up there.

145
00:07:10,799 --> 00:07:11,519
Well, it's not up to you.

146
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,239
1, 2.

147
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,679
Go.

148
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:20,040
You've made it.

149
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:20,640
You've made it.

150
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,320
Shao Beisheng, I'll kill you.

151
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,079
Wait, wait.

152
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,600
Wait.

153
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,040
Too horrible, no, you...

154
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:25,480
Staff.

155
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,119
Where's the staff?

156
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:26,839
Put me down.

157
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:27,559
I want to go home.

158
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,040
The staff's not here.

159
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,359
You, you hang in there.

160
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:31,679
Put me down.

161
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,440
I don't want...

162
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,839
I don't want to be here.

163
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,279
It's too horrible.

164
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,480
The staff's not here.

165
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:38,679
You hang in there.

166
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:39,839
Just a second.

167
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,559
Don't take photos of me now.
I'm so ugly.

168
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,160
Just hang in there.

169
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:43,959
Stop taking photos. I'm so ugly.

170
00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:45,160
No.

171
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:46,880
I'm falling.

172
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,760
Beautiful!

173
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm really falling.

174
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,600
Slow down.

175
00:08:04,239 --> 00:08:05,160
Are you okay?

176
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,640
Shao Beisheng, I'm telling you.

177
00:08:07,799 --> 00:08:08,519
I'll get the figure.

178
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,480
Now you give me

179
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:10,720
the phone.

180
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:43,239
Are you happy now?

181
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
That ugly photo of me

182
00:08:45,119 --> 00:08:46,400
has to be there forever.

183
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:48,479
Thanks to you,

184
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:49,760
you helped me fulfill my dream.

185
00:08:50,359 --> 00:08:51,359
So just forget the

186
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,119
life-saving thing.

187
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:54,280
And that photo of you isn't ugly at all.

188
00:08:57,479 --> 00:08:58,320
I got you a copy of the photo

189
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,080
on the Honor Wall

190
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,320
for memory.

191
00:09:00,719 --> 00:09:01,960
I don't want it, I...

192
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,400
Thanks.

193
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,960
Too ugly.

194
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:34,599
I thought we were supposed
to rehearse today.

195
00:09:36,239 --> 00:09:36,960
What happened?

196
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,559
You have the nerve
to ask me what happened?

197
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,440
I thought I was supposed
to be the leading lady

198
00:09:40,599 --> 00:09:41,280
and draw all the handsome guys'

199
00:09:41,359 --> 00:09:42,080
attention?

200
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,320
And now,

201
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,599
you want me to be a pig.

202
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:46,919
No.

203
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,840
This is anthropomorphic.

204
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,080
Or I'll change one for you.

205
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:51,200
Let me think.

206
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,640
A cat?

207
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,280
A dog?

208
00:09:57,719 --> 00:09:58,239
No, no.

209
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:00,239
What do you want to act as?

210
00:10:01,119 --> 00:10:01,679
Well...

211
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,520
What?

212
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,000
Can't I just be a person?

213
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,559
Okay.

214
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:07,880
As long as you agree,

215
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,320
I'll give you a Snow White

216
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,239
with seven dwarfs.

217
00:10:10,599 --> 00:10:11,280
I'll be a dwarf for you.

218
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,760
Then okay.

219
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:14,840
Let's go then.

220
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:15,840
It's not okay now.

221
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,520
What is it now?

222
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,520
Our teacher asked me

223
00:10:18,599 --> 00:10:19,440
to make a sketch just now.

224
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,039
I have to find a model.

225
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:23,599
Me.

226
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,119
I can be a model for you.

227
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,760
Absolutely professional.

228
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,080
Am I okay?

229
00:10:40,719 --> 00:10:41,359
Yes.

230
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,239
Let's go.

231
00:10:42,479 --> 00:10:43,159
Let's go.

232
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,239
Take it off.

233
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,679
Take it off?

234
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,239
What are you going to draw?

235
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,520
A figure drawing.

236
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:02,640
I need you to take off your coat.

237
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,200
It's not quite right.

238
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,479
What's not right?

239
00:11:08,719 --> 00:11:09,599
You promised

240
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:10,440
to help me with the homework, right?

241
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,400
I promised to help you
with your homework.

242
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,320
But I didn't promise you to...

243
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,440
Take off.

244
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:44,760
For arts!

245
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,159
What are you doing?

246
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,919
Why are you yelling so loud?

247
00:11:50,239 --> 00:11:51,280
Didn't you tell me to take it off?

248
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:52,919
I told you to take off your coat.

249
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:54,880
I didn't tell you to take
off your underwear.

250
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:55,719
I thought one has to

251
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,919
take off like this in figure drawings?

252
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:01,919
I just need to draw a part.

253
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,440
Which part?

254
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,119
Hand.

255
00:12:09,359 --> 00:12:10,080
Well...

256
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:15,000
Why didn't you say it earlier?

257
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,119
In what pose and how?

258
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,520
Whatever pose would be okay.

259
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,520
Like this. Is it okay?

260
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:30,679
Change one.

261
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:31,559
Didn't you say

262
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:32,559
whatever is okay?

263
00:12:42,359 --> 00:12:43,080
This one.

264
00:12:43,479 --> 00:12:44,320
Simple enough, right?

265
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:45,960
Okay.

266
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,840
As long as you can hold this position

267
00:12:48,119 --> 00:12:48,880
without moving.

268
00:12:49,239 --> 00:12:50,200
As long as you can make it.

269
00:12:51,719 --> 00:12:52,919
For how long?

270
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,280
Don't shake.

271
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,479
I cannot hold it anymore.

272
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,200
For how long?

273
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,479
Still long time to go.

274
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,479
Maybe

275
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,880
you can shift your focus for a bit.

276
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,239
I didn't expect that

277
00:13:53,479 --> 00:13:54,599
you can be serious sometime.

278
00:13:57,479 --> 00:13:58,479
Do you like drawing?

279
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:01,479
Just so so.

280
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:02,679
You like Short Track Speed Skating more?

281
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,679
Not really.

282
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,520
You're so peaceful.

283
00:14:08,719 --> 00:14:09,760
Because for persons like me,

284
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,119
it's dangerous

285
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,880
to say I like something.

286
00:14:13,599 --> 00:14:14,479
What kind of person are you?

287
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,039
No talents.

288
00:14:19,479 --> 00:14:20,280
No charisma.

289
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,679
No strength.

290
00:14:22,479 --> 00:14:23,200
So,

291
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,359
everything I do

292
00:14:24,719 --> 00:14:25,880
will be very ordinary.

293
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:27,559
If I say I don't like it,

294
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:29,280
someone would compliment
me as a peaceful person.

295
00:14:30,599 --> 00:14:32,239
If I say I like it,

296
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,919
I'll be

297
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,239
the stupid bird with no strength.

298
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:42,919
You can draw.

299
00:14:43,359 --> 00:14:44,320
When our drama club performs in public,

300
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,400
draw some props for us.

301
00:14:46,479 --> 00:14:47,239
No problem.

302
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,119
Just pay me the money.

303
00:14:48,719 --> 00:14:50,000
Don't do that to me. It is not gracious

304
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,799
to mention money.

305
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:13,000
Ready!

306
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
- Come on!
- Come on!

307
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,280
Zhou Luhan,

308
00:15:20,359 --> 00:15:21,239
you're not getting any speed.

309
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,799
Pay attention to your skating rhythm.

310
00:15:24,359 --> 00:15:25,119
One.

311
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,719
Two.

312
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:29,400
One.

313
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,359
Fully stretch in every movement.

314
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:32,640
Two.

315
00:15:34,119 --> 00:15:35,080
One.

316
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Get down a bit.

317
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:38,400
Two.

318
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,359
Keep going.

319
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,919
One.

320
00:15:43,719 --> 00:15:44,760
Shen Zhengyi, great!

321
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:47,599
Two.

322
00:15:49,719 --> 00:15:50,520
Great!

323
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,880
I want to follow the
training of Coach Xiao too.

324
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:54,919
Shen Zhengyi is getting

325
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,919
better and better today.

326
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:56,840
Keep going.

327
00:15:57,599 --> 00:15:58,479
One.

328
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:00,440
Two.

329
00:16:02,599 --> 00:16:03,880
Zhou Luhan, push off the ice.

330
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,719
Pay attention to
the quality of pushing off the ice.

331
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,080
Luhan!

332
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:13,039
What's going on?

333
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:22,640
How is it?

334
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,679
Don't move, don't move.

335
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:24,239
It's too dangerous.

336
00:16:24,239 --> 00:16:24,880
Luhan,

337
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,960
can you move your legs yourself?

338
00:16:28,239 --> 00:16:28,840
Yes.

339
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:30,440
Stand up.

340
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,840
Be careful.

341
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,239
Be careful.

342
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,479
Do you have anywhere

343
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:36,239
that is still uncomfortable?

344
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,440
My leg pains.

345
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:39,960
And I feel dizzy and want to puke.

346
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,479
You strained your muscle.

347
00:16:41,719 --> 00:16:42,200
Take a break.

348
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:42,960
We'll train later.

349
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:44,719
Let's go!

350
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,719
Keep training.

351
00:16:47,599 --> 00:16:48,280
Slow down.

352
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,640
Are you okay?

353
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:50,799
I was scared to death.

354
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:51,599
I think

355
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:52,559
you have exercised too much,

356
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,719
causing the physical discomfort

357
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:55,119
and muscle weakness.

358
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,200
Be careful.

359
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,159
I cannot really

360
00:17:01,239 --> 00:17:02,640
take any more of
this amount of training.

361
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,560
Zhou Luhan,

362
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:07,959
short-term centralized training
before the contest

363
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,040
will be a lot harder than this.

364
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,160
It's already too much for you now?

365
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,439
If this is the case,

366
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,880
don't even think about attending
the College Student Ice League.

367
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,800
Why can't she attend?

368
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,520
Coach Zhuang,

369
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,439
the abilities of each athlete

370
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,479
are different.

371
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,839
If you don't care about abilities,

372
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,880
but just power up the intension,

373
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:22,880
isn't such kind of training

374
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,800
a little lazy?

375
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,400
I think you should consider

376
00:17:25,479 --> 00:17:26,359
teaching according to aptitude.

377
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,079
I can do so.

378
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,920
But the rules of the game won't

379
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,119
change according to aptitude.

380
00:17:31,239 --> 00:17:31,959
You're the next.

381
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:32,640
Get ready.

382
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,880
Wang Fang, get some
ice and put it on her.

383
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:46,599
I think that Zhuang Yue

384
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,880
is just here to hold a post.

385
00:17:48,239 --> 00:17:49,079
Her level is so low.

386
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,959
Luhan is hurt by her.

387
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,040
And she said that about her.

388
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:54,560
Just train first.

389
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:57,119
Next one.

390
00:18:08,479 --> 00:18:09,319
Ready!

391
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,040
Last lap,

392
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:37,400
get down, get down.

393
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,479
Come over here.

394
00:18:58,199 --> 00:18:58,800
Luo Xiaoyi,

395
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,160
45.48 seconds.

396
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:01,760
Liu Sisi, 46 seconds.

397
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:02,400
What is my record?

398
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,400
I didn't finish. Just wait a minute.

399
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,839
46.03 seconds.

400
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:05,599
Yang Yang,

401
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,040
46.45 seconds.

402
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:07,880
Yang Sirun,

403
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,439
46.84 seconds.

404
00:19:09,719 --> 00:19:11,199
I'll read it again
if you didn't hear it well.

405
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,199
Luo Xiaoyi,

406
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,439
45.48 seconds.

407
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,319
Liu Sisi,

408
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,599
46.03 seconds.

409
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:16,439
Yang Yang,

410
00:19:16,439 --> 00:19:17,400
46.45 seconds.

411
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,439
Yang Sirun, 46.84 seconds.

412
00:19:20,239 --> 00:19:20,880
Liu Sisi,

413
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,199
you had a good rhythm today.

414
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,040
Next time, hold it down.

415
00:19:27,439 --> 00:19:28,359
I quit.

416
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:32,760
We do basic trainings every day,

417
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:33,560
again and again.

418
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:35,040
Do you think it's useful

419
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:35,880
to do such trainings?

420
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,079
How could Luo Xiaoyi

421
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:39,400
dare to talk to Coach Zhuang like this?

422
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,640
You've only been practicing
for a few days.

423
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:42,520
How can you say it's useless?

424
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,560
It's simple.
Let's check out the results.

425
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:46,160
After following your training,

426
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:47,319
my record is way worse than

427
00:19:47,439 --> 00:19:48,199
when I followed the training

428
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:49,359
of Coach Xiao.

429
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:50,640
I never got into within

430
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,640
45 seconds again.

431
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:52,920
I require that Coach Xiao

432
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,160
should do special trains to me.

433
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,760
Do you have any question to

434
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,040
my training?

435
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,000
After I got into the team,

436
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:01,719
all members

437
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:02,880
are improving,

438
00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:03,880
and only you are getting worse.

439
00:20:04,199 --> 00:20:04,920
Have you ever thought about

440
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,920
your problem?

441
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:07,680
I am getting worse.

442
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,760
Don't you have

443
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:10,239
any responsibility as a chief coach?

444
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:11,400
Then I'll tell you again today.

445
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,319
I'm the chief coach.

446
00:20:12,439 --> 00:20:13,560
I have my own schedule.

447
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:17,959
Pick up the helmet

448
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:18,680
and be prepared for the training.

449
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,880
I won't listen to you anymore.

450
00:20:20,959 --> 00:20:22,520
I, Luo Xiaoyi, don't agree

451
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,280
with the training of
the new chief coach.

452
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,599
From today on,

453
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:26,719
I won't train anymore.

454
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:33,880
How about you?

455
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:35,599
Are you still going to train like this?

456
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,760
Sorry, I won't train either.

457
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,280
Luo Xiaoyi, what are you doing?

458
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,199
Go back for training.

459
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:49,959
I have to fight for my rights.

460
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,560
I heard that

461
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,079
Zhuang Yue promised

462
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:54,880
this year she's going to help
Wind Chaser get the gold medal.

463
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,599
Without me,

464
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,520
not to mention the gold medal,

465
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,079
Wind Chaser cannot even get the medal.

466
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,359
I'll see what's she going to do?

467
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,400
Say it again.

468
00:21:02,439 --> 00:21:03,119
Get back to the training.

469
00:21:03,199 --> 00:21:04,800
I won't do it as long as she is here.

470
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:09,319
Sorry, coach.

471
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:27,680
Next one.

472
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:34,199
Luo Xiaoyi,

473
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,199
you did so. What do you think

474
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:40,400
Coach Zhuang's going to do?

475
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:43,520
My record is getting worse so much.

476
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,520
I just want her like this.

477
00:21:45,959 --> 00:21:47,000
Why did your record get worse?

478
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:47,920
You really

479
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,839
think I don't know anything?

480
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:51,520
I don't want to follow her training.

481
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:52,599
Luo Xiaoyi,

482
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,119
you are wasting your time

483
00:21:54,199 --> 00:21:55,160
for every day you quit.

484
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,079
How much time do you have?

485
00:21:56,479 --> 00:21:57,520
Am I the one who
doesn't want to practice well?

486
00:22:05,439 --> 00:22:05,839
But quitting

487
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,959
cannot help with any problem.

488
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:08,160
Can't you grow up?

489
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:08,880
No.

490
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:10,400
If you keep doing this,

491
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,079
Coach Zhuang

492
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,079
won't let you attend the
College Student Ice League.

493
00:22:12,959 --> 00:22:13,880
Why?

494
00:22:14,479 --> 00:22:15,079
I have prepared for the
College Student Ice League

495
00:22:15,239 --> 00:22:15,959
for so long.

496
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:16,959
Why wouldn't she let me attend?

497
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,839
Because she's the chief
coach of Wind Chaser.

498
00:22:20,479 --> 00:22:21,119
If you still want to

499
00:22:21,199 --> 00:22:21,920
attend the College Student Ice League,

500
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:22,959
you must apologize to her.

501
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,520
No way.

502
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:41,359
Don't be sad, Luhan.

503
00:22:41,719 --> 00:22:42,439
Here, have a drink.

504
00:22:49,199 --> 00:22:49,959
Today,

505
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:50,880
you all saw it.

506
00:22:51,439 --> 00:22:52,040
Anyway,

507
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,599
I'm sure I'm on Xiaoyi's side.

508
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:54,920
Think about it.

509
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:56,400
In the past College Student Ice League,

510
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,800
the players to the competition would
be chosen among the senior members.

511
00:22:58,079 --> 00:22:58,880
After Zhuang Yue came,

512
00:22:58,959 --> 00:23:00,000
there is a qualification contest now.

513
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,439
Make us compete with newbies?

514
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,479
What did she mean

515
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,599
by saying that to Luhan today?

516
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,880
Anyway, I was not comfortable

517
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,800
with her words.

518
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,439
I think she wants to
tear everything down

519
00:23:12,719 --> 00:23:13,680
and rebuild it again

520
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,439
since she is new here.

521
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,479
This kind of person

522
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,079
has no consideration
for the Wind Chaser.

523
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,160
In my opinion,

524
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,640
she doesn't have the abilities,

525
00:23:19,959 --> 00:23:20,560
or,

526
00:23:20,959 --> 00:23:21,959
she is just trying to train new people

527
00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:23,680
to replace all of the senior members.

528
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:24,880
Otherwise, why did she

529
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,239
ask Coach Xiao to teach newbies?

530
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,680
And she made some kind of

531
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,760
sweeping approach to us.

532
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:32,439
We got into the team

533
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,520
together with Xiaoyi.

534
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,520
You two will

535
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:35,760
stand on her side, right?

536
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:42,199
Here.

537
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,359
I take that as a yes.

538
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,599
Cheers.

539
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:51,079
We can't quit training alone.

540
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,800
We have to stop those newbies.

541
00:23:53,239 --> 00:23:56,079
In this way, it will have
the biggest effect.

(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team
of Lingbei University)

543
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:02,959
Coach Xiao,

544
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,439
let's have a chat.

545
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:06,520
Please.

546
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:13,160
Luo Xiaoyi quit training.

547
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,680
What do you think of it?

548
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:17,719
She's really quite naive about this.

549
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,280
But her performance

550
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:20,280
is getting worse lately.

551
00:24:20,479 --> 00:24:21,520
I can understand that she is emotional.

552
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:23,599
I think you should know

553
00:24:23,719 --> 00:24:24,920
why her performance is getting worse.

554
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:27,079
I've read through

555
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:28,040
her training records.

556
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,319
Each competition record

557
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:31,680
is not as good as that in training.

558
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,439
Why is that?

559
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,520
Because she trained alone.

560
00:24:34,959 --> 00:24:35,760
No rivals,

561
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,959
no competition environment,

562
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:38,400
and no interference.

563
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:39,800
She was just like

564
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,800
in a vacuum space

565
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:42,199
to get the greatest record.

566
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,280
But this record is useless.

567
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,119
It cannot stand the test in competition.

568
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,359
You mean,

569
00:24:46,439 --> 00:24:47,439
Luo Xiaoyi's training records

570
00:24:47,479 --> 00:24:48,680
cannot stand the test.

571
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,400
OK.

572
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,040
I won't discuss the training plans

573
00:24:58,119 --> 00:24:59,400
with you now.

574
00:24:59,959 --> 00:25:00,560
Coach Zhuang,

575
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,560
the College Student Ice League
is about to start soon.

576
00:25:02,479 --> 00:25:03,319
Are you going to

577
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,119
let them

578
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,359
keep quitting the training?

579
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,359
So do you mean

580
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:08,479
I should accept their threat

581
00:25:09,439 --> 00:25:10,119
and let them back?

582
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:11,479
This is not what I mean.

583
00:25:11,959 --> 00:25:13,000
But mutual hostility
and mutual resistance

584
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:14,520
between the coach and the players

585
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,079
won't bring benefits to Wind Chaser.

586
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:17,560
Coach Xiao,

587
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,040
I'll be honest with you.

588
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:21,760
Why did the team members

589
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,800
do so today?

590
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:24,800
Because you were

591
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,000
too generous to them.

592
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,040
An athlete does not cherish

593
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:30,199
the chance to play

594
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:31,959
and just gives up easily.

595
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,839
Luo Xiaoyi is so self-centered,

596
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,359
and she triggered others to

597
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,239
quit training when she
can't get special training.

598
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,280
What is it?

599
00:25:40,479 --> 00:25:41,160
This is to destroy

600
00:25:41,199 --> 00:25:42,680
team cohesion.

601
00:25:43,239 --> 00:25:44,079
Coach Xiao,

602
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:45,359
it has crossed

603
00:25:45,479 --> 00:25:46,319
the line.

604
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,479
If I take a step back,

605
00:25:47,959 --> 00:25:49,560
Wind Chaser won't get improvement.

606
00:25:52,479 --> 00:25:53,760
So it's my problem then.

607
00:25:54,239 --> 00:25:55,040
I didn't mean that.

608
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,119
I'm just hoping we can train...

609
00:25:58,199 --> 00:25:58,760
Director.

610
00:25:59,079 --> 00:25:59,599
You're chatting?

611
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,199
I want to talk to you.

612
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,119
OK.

613
00:26:03,439 --> 00:26:04,160
Then I'll go out for a bit.

614
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:05,160
OK.

615
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,359
Director, have a seat.

616
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,160
No, no.

617
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,640
Just a few words.

618
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,560
I heard that

619
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,079
someone objected to your training plan

620
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:15,959
and refused to train.

621
00:26:17,719 --> 00:26:18,599
Some members are dissatisfied and

622
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,640
triggered others to quit training.

623
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,280
But I'll take care of it.

624
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,880
Then I know who they are.

625
00:26:26,439 --> 00:26:27,719
I also think there's no problem

626
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,719
in your training plans.

627
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,439
But this brings negative effects

628
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,199
to you.

629
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,719
I believe you.

630
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,640
But it doesn't mean that others

631
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:34,439
will do so too.

632
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,920
So I'm here to ask you

633
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:38,760
if you will take a step back.

634
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,280
Director Zhang,

635
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:43,040
if a team wants to improve

636
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:43,880
and grow up,

637
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,000
there must be

638
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:46,239
all kinds of problems.

639
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:47,479
I think we don't have to avoid them

640
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,839
and pretend they are not here.

641
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,560
If I take a step back today,

642
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:52,560
there will be still problems

643
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,719
happening to other members.

644
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,680
If they always quit training,

645
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,119
I can't lead the team anymore.

646
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,760
That's a good point. I support you.

647
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,199
But three days later,

648
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,520
it will be the qualification contest for
College Student Ice League.

649
00:27:05,439 --> 00:27:06,680
If this thing cannot be solved

650
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,760
in three days,

651
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:10,640
it's hard for you and me to explain.

652
00:27:11,479 --> 00:27:12,199
Don't worry.

653
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,959
I have a clear plan in mind.

654
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,760
Today there will be no training.
Just go back.

655
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,319
No training? Who said that?

656
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,880
I am telling you now.

657
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,239
What are you doing now?

658
00:27:31,479 --> 00:27:32,199
You quit training,

659
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,359
and even don't
want anyone else to train?

660
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,199
All members in the team quit training.

661
00:27:35,479 --> 00:27:36,560
Understand? All members.

662
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,680
Our plan cannot be ruined

663
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,760
just because of you.

664
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:41,000
The qualification contest
is about to start soon.

665
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:42,199
I don't care what your plan is.

666
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:44,800
You have no foundation.

667
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:46,160
So what's the difference
with one less training day?

668
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,439
I don't know

669
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,000
what you are thinking now.

670
00:27:49,479 --> 00:27:50,479
You are athletes after all.

671
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,479
I never saw you guys so motivated

672
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:52,439
in the training.

673
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,280
Now you're so active

674
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,439
to quit training.

675
00:27:54,719 --> 00:27:55,439
I said, no training.

676
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,280
It means no.

677
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,359
Go back.

678
00:27:57,479 --> 00:27:58,520
I should listen to you
about when I can train?

679
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,079
Why would I...?

680
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:00,280
What are you doing?

681
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:01,079
You have to fight with us?

682
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,239
Yes, be cooperative.

683
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:03,040
Why would I cooperate with you?

684
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:03,839
What are you doing?

685
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:13,880
Anyone who wants to train, follow me.

686
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,400
For those who don't want to train,

687
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,400
I won't force you.

688
00:28:37,959 --> 00:28:38,560
Zhu Lele,

689
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,319
why don't you pick up the phone?

690
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:58,000
OK, it's time.

691
00:28:58,719 --> 00:28:59,560
Let's start training.

692
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:00,640
Coach Zhuang,

693
00:29:00,719 --> 00:29:02,119
they're not here yet.

694
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,439
You don't have to wait.
You can start training yourself.

695
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,119
There is only me,

696
00:29:11,239 --> 00:29:12,760
and you still want to train me?

697
00:29:14,439 --> 00:29:16,400
Opportunity is only
for those who need it.

698
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:18,079
Get started!

699
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,400
Thank you, Coach Zhuang.

700
00:29:21,199 --> 00:29:22,520
But the qualification contest for
College Student Ice League

701
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,640
is about to start.

702
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,079
They don't even show up for training.

703
00:29:26,199 --> 00:29:27,000
What shall we do?

704
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,160
You need to worry about yourself.

705
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,839
Start!

706
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:44,719
You said there was only
one person in the whole team

707
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,880
to train today?

708
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:47,719
Yes.

709
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,000
And do you know

710
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:49,800
who is it?

711
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,199
It's your girlfriend,

712
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,839
Shen Zhengyi.

713
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,439
I never thought I'd

714
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,199
see such a big scene

715
00:29:57,319 --> 00:29:59,479
where all the members
quit training in my life.

716
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,280
Do you know

717
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:03,359
how embarrassing it was

718
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,880
with only Shen Zhengyi and Coach Zhuang

719
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,560
on the skating rink?

720
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:14,079
Well, how did she react?

721
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,119
Shen Zhengyi, you know her.

722
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,439
She's so serious when she's training.

723
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,000
What could possibly affect her?

724
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:21,599
No, I mean,

725
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:23,359
the coach.

726
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,400
Coach Zhuang?

727
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,199
She looked calm and peaceful,

728
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,560
but in her heart,

729
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,079
she must be very nervous and terrified.

730
00:30:35,719 --> 00:30:36,400
Really?

731
00:30:36,479 --> 00:30:37,239
Absolutely.

732
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,439
Think about it.

733
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,880
She's only here for a few days.

734
00:30:40,719 --> 00:30:41,880
Then the leader of
Short Track Speed Skating Team

735
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:43,280
told everyone to

736
00:30:43,959 --> 00:30:45,479
quit training and be against her.

737
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,079
For such a big deal,

738
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,560
she'll probably have to worry.

739
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,319
No more talking.

740
00:30:50,479 --> 00:30:51,319
I have to continue to write the script.

741
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,520
Singing

742
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,920
while soaring into the air,

743
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,880
to welcome the thunder.

744
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,119
About the Short Track
Speed Skating Team,

745
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,000
I need you to keep an eye on it.

746
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:11,040
OK.

747
00:31:11,719 --> 00:31:12,719
You are so worried about Shen Zhengyi,

748
00:31:13,479 --> 00:31:14,800
and still said it's partnership.

749
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:15,880
Who cares...?

750
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,800
I, well...

751
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,319
That's a good show.

752
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:26,760
The seagull spoke hesitantly.

753
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:29,479
Go away.

754
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,599
And then it soared into the air.

755
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:42,460
(Application form)

756
00:31:42,479 --> 00:31:43,280
Why do you suddenly let me

757
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,319
attend the elite tournament?

758
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,319
The only way to qualify for

759
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:47,239
the Asian Cup is to play

760
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,319
in the elite tournament.

761
00:31:50,479 --> 00:31:51,119
I refuse.

762
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,359
Luo Xiaoyi,

763
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:55,199
what do you want?

764
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,040
I told you to say sorry to Zhuang Yue,

765
00:31:58,119 --> 00:31:58,680
and you refused.

766
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,560
I asked you to attend
the elite tournament,

767
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:00,719
and you refused, too.

768
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:01,359
You really don't want to

769
00:32:01,479 --> 00:32:02,280
skate anymore?

770
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,599
Maybe you should quit the team.

771
00:32:06,439 --> 00:32:08,280
I don't have the confidence
to win the championship.

772
00:32:09,199 --> 00:32:10,239
People who compete in elite tournament

773
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:11,239
are all good.

774
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,319
If I lose this one,

775
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,000
I have nothing left.

776
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,439
It will be embarrassing.

777
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,880
You don't even have the confidence to

778
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,680
win the championship
of elite tournament,

779
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,520
not to mention the Asian Cup.

780
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:19,920
Fine.

781
00:32:20,719 --> 00:32:21,599
Since you're not willing to attend it,

782
00:32:21,719 --> 00:32:22,439
I won't force you.

783
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:24,520
I am in.

784
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:31,760
OK?

785
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,640
OK.

786
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,760
But you cannot use
the internal skating rink.

787
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:37,439
I'll find a rink
outside the school for you.

788
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,040
So, are they all back?

789
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:04,839
Just one.

790
00:33:06,199 --> 00:33:06,800
Who is it?

791
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,239
Shen Zhengyi.

792
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,560
See?

793
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,439
In such critical moment,

794
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,359
support from the family is huge.

795
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:14,000
These little girls

796
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:14,680
really went too far.

797
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,719
What are you going to do?

798
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,479
I never thought that

799
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,800
there will be so much resistance.

800
00:33:23,959 --> 00:33:24,920
What did Director Zhang say?

801
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,800
Director Zhang is under
quite big pressure too.

802
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:28,719
After all, the whole team quit.

803
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,439
As for the school leaders,

804
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,520
it's hard for him to explain.

805
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,640
Nowadays, these kids

806
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,920
don't look like we used to be.

807
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,599
When we made mistakes back then,

808
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,640
the coach punished us

809
00:33:38,199 --> 00:33:39,319
and we had to beg the coach.

810
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,040
Now they're all like princesses

811
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:43,199
at home.

812
00:33:46,479 --> 00:33:47,199
But I think

813
00:33:47,439 --> 00:33:48,560
you shouldn't put yourself

814
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,560
in a passive situation.

815
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,160
Just take one step back.

816
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:52,479
No way.

817
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,599
In order to change the current
situation of this team,

818
00:33:55,239 --> 00:33:56,439
I will never take a step back.

819
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,599
I just think

820
00:34:00,479 --> 00:34:01,479
as long as the green hills last,

821
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,040
there'll always be wood to burn.

822
00:34:03,439 --> 00:34:04,239
Think about it.

823
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,359
Who did you return to
the Wind Chaser for?

824
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,359
For Shao Beisheng, right?

825
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:09,600
They are entirely different.

826
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,040
In order to be in the Wind Chaser,

827
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,800
I have to lose my principle?

828
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,040
Do you think I'm that kind of person?

829
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,040
No, no, no.

830
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,439
But to be honest,

831
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,760
the athletes nowadays

832
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:27,520
are totally different

833
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:28,639
from what we used to be.

834
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:31,919
At that time, we didn't

835
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,439
quite understand

836
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,120
whether we love it or not.

837
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,879
But kids these days

838
00:34:36,959 --> 00:34:37,560
are different.

839
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:39,120
They know too much information.

840
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,159
They are living under good conditions,

841
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,360
and have nothing to worry about.

842
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,639
Why did they make it to today

843
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:44,879
though it is so hard?

844
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:47,360
They love skating.

845
00:34:47,439 --> 00:34:48,439
Yes.

846
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:49,840
Think about it.

847
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,520
If we stopped training at that time,

848
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,199
we'd be so panic.

849
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,040
So I believe

850
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:56,560
these kids

851
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,719
are more anxious than we are.

852
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,719
Of course.

853
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,560
Coach Zhuang, Coach Ma.

854
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:04,320
You're back.

855
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:10,879
They will come back for sure.

856
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,439
But Short Track Speed
Skating Team cannot wait.

857
00:35:15,879 --> 00:35:16,679
Although

858
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:19,000
there are only two days left
to the deadline

859
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:19,800
that Director Zhang gave me.

860
00:35:20,439 --> 00:35:21,600
But I have faith

861
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,919
in these kids.

862
00:35:28,479 --> 00:35:29,239
Go ahead with your own things.

863
00:35:30,959 --> 00:35:31,719
I'm just worrying too much.

864
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,120
You did this for whom to see?

865
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,280
Someone like you

866
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,679
cannot get into Wind Chaser
even with more training.

867
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,360
It's not your call.

868
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,639
Don't think you've flattered Zhuang Yue,

869
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,760
and you can stay in the team.

870
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,399
She's already in jeopardy herself now.

871
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:01,639
Even if you stay,

872
00:36:01,919 --> 00:36:03,239
do you think you can play College
Student Ice League all by yourself?

873
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:04,760
Don't be ridiculous.

874
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,879
Would you please be realistic?

875
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,800
The reality is

876
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,280
now you all quit training.

877
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,639
So I don't have to

878
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:12,719
attend the qualification contest.

879
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,800
I can directly represent the Wind Chaser

880
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,760
to play in the College
Student Ice League.

881
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,840
Why did the happiness

882
00:36:18,879 --> 00:36:19,879
come so suddenly?

883
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:21,800
Thank you.

884
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:23,479
Thank you for your good intentions.

885
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:34,719
This, this.

886
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:35,080
This, this.

887
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:35,840
Catch this, catch this.

888
00:36:35,919 --> 00:36:36,360
It's alone now.

889
00:36:36,479 --> 00:36:37,239
Go, go, go, the grass, the grass.

890
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,199
Hit it.

891
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:38,959
Here, here, here.

892
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,159
- Hit it!
- Where?

893
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:41,800
I am out of LP.

894
00:36:43,439 --> 00:36:44,679
Why are you playing so bad?

895
00:36:44,959 --> 00:36:45,800
I'm really pissed off.

896
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:47,000
Hit, hit, hit.

897
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,760
Why didn't you pick up the phone

898
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,760
and go to the training?

899
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,199
Those senior members don't let us train.

900
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:55,439
They said if we go,

901
00:36:55,959 --> 00:36:57,439
we'll have bad luck in the future.

902
00:36:58,239 --> 00:36:59,719
Are you that scared of them?

903
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:01,280
Not exactly.

904
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,399
We don't want to

905
00:37:02,479 --> 00:37:03,479
be so hard on them.

906
00:37:03,919 --> 00:37:04,639
Besides,

907
00:37:04,919 --> 00:37:06,479
everyone hates Coach Zhuang,

908
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:07,879
and likes Coach Xiao more.

909
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:08,760
Don't you?

910
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
You can't decide who

911
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,239
will be our coach even you like him.

912
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,560
The qualification contest
will be held next week.

913
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:14,800
And also the College Student
Ice League after that.

914
00:37:14,879 --> 00:37:15,800
You want to quit them all?

915
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,439
I still want to attend.

916
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,600
That's it.

917
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,040
You're all wasting

918
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,919
your own training time.

(Seagull)

920
00:37:40,879 --> 00:37:42,520
The finished script

921
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,399
was sent to the chat group.

922
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:45,239
This time, our leading actor is

923
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,199
the seagull.

924
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,679
Do you have any different opinion

925
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,760
or advice?

926
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:49,840
No.

927
00:37:51,159 --> 00:37:52,719
What about our leading lady?

928
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,919
Not a person, anyway.

929
00:37:58,399 --> 00:37:59,879
It's okay. It's better than a pig.

930
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:01,399
I'm listening.

931
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,840
Then I'll say it again

932
00:38:03,919 --> 00:38:04,760
about the story.

933
00:38:04,919 --> 00:38:05,520
Well...

934
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:06,479
There is a seagull

935
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:09,600
constantly catching up the sun.

936
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,520
Leader,

937
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,840
is this seagull

938
00:38:11,879 --> 00:38:13,000
called Kuafu?
[*Kuafu is a mythological figure]

939
00:38:15,439 --> 00:38:16,439
Its friends and relatives

940
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,080
warned it

941
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:19,679
not to dream anymore.

942
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:20,879
The seagull is impossible

943
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,120
to catch up with the sun.

944
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:24,120
The seagull is supposed to stay

945
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:25,879
in the waters it knows well.

946
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:26,719
The seagull should

947
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,840
fly in flocks.

948
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,560
But our leading actor
doesn't listen to them.

949
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,080
It flew away from the main flock.

950
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,719
It kept flying and flying.

951
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:39,040
You're all wasting

952

your own training time.

953
