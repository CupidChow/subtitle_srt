3
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,040
Brother,

4
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,160
where are you taking me?

5
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,239
You'll find out when you're there.

6
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:03,800
Where exactly are you taking me?

7
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:05,040
Tell me.

8
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,720
I'm taking you to meet Coach Jiang.

9
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:11,880
Stop.

10
00:02:12,119 --> 00:02:12,720
You shall meet her,

11
00:02:12,839 --> 00:02:13,320
and have a talk.

12
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:14,320
Maybe you'll change your mind.

13
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,839
I won't meet her.

14
00:02:16,399 --> 00:02:17,119
Brother.

15
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:17,919
When you are arranging

16
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:18,759
such things for me,

17
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,399
could you at least ask me?

18
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:21,880
I just want you to meet her.

19
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,119
Stop the car.

Xiao Qing.

Xiao Qing.

23
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,080
I'll say it again.

24
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:40,880
I won't leave Shao Beisheng

25
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,759
at this moment.

(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team

28
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,839
Coach Zhuang.

29
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,800
You should inform me in advance

30
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,919
if you want to
tell Shao Beisheng about it.

31
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,360
He's already known it.

32
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,080
We always thought

33
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,080
he could not take a blow,
and hide it from him.

34
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,639
He's actually stronger

35
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:09,720
than I thought.

36
00:03:11,839 --> 00:03:12,399
Did he talk about

37
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,759
his future plan to you?

38
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,679
Do you know

39
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,520
what the director said to me?

40
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,279
He wants Shao Beisheng to retire.

41
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,000
Did you agree?

42
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:25,559
Of course not.

43
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:26,639
How could I agree to that?

44
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,240
But Coach Zhuang,

45
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,600
if he doesn't retire,

46
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,080
what can he do in the future?

47
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,199
What time is it?

48
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,360
Why don't you wake me up?

49
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,279
No classes today.

50
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,080
Then where are you going?

51
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,160
Leave me alone.

52
00:04:00,559 --> 00:04:01,479
Are you going to receive training?

53
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,520
You have not recovered.

54
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,320
We'll do the weight training today.

55
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:17,079
Later, Beisheng takes...

56
00:04:18,679 --> 00:04:19,320
Ma,

57
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,600
Beisheng is not here today.

58
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,079
I know.

59
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,279
I just want to talk to everybody

60
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,760
about this.

61
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:27,399
Well...Beisheng has to

62
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,679
take a while to recover.

63
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:29,880
He might not

64
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:30,880
go back for training in the near future.

65
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,320
Wang Jun will take the lead to warm up.

66
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:37,399
Xiao Qing, you...

67
00:04:37,679 --> 00:04:38,959
I'll work on my physical fitness.

68
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:40,959
Okay.

69
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:44,359
Right, warm up now.
Let's do the training!

70
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,000
Keep on training!

71
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,920
I heard that Shao Beisheng
cannot skate anymore.

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,720
Really?

73
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:54,519
Didn't he hurt his hand?

74
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,679
Why can't he skate anymore?

75
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,480
He cannot lift as his hand hurt.

76
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,000
Then what about Xiao Qing?

77
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,160
Focus on training!

78
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:02,239
What are you talking about?

79
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,760
Keep on training.

81
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,359
Hello, your spoon.

82
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,000
Thanks.

83
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:31,720
It might be easier with this.

84
00:05:33,359 --> 00:05:34,000
Actually, I can use the chopsticks

85
00:05:34,359 --> 00:05:35,200
with my left hand.

86
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:37,880
Thank you for inviting me to meal.

87
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:39,079
I should.

88
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,239
I've always wanted to have a chance

89
00:05:40,359 --> 00:05:41,359
to thank you.

90
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,119
How is your hand recovering?

91
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,119
Quite good.

92
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,160
It's just not very flexible.

93
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,239
So what are you going to do next?

94
00:06:00,239 --> 00:06:00,920
Coach Xiao, you know

95
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,359
my hand cannot work, right?

96
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,440
It's okay. Just say it.

97
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,519
Xiao Qing insists that

98
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,200
she should

99
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,440
take full responsibility
for your injury.

100
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,720
She told me that

101
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:24,079
she must wait for a miracle to happen.

102
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,959
I don't know how to persuade her.

103
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,320
I understand.

104
00:06:33,679 --> 00:06:34,320
Don't worry.

105
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:36,519
I won't hold her up.

106
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,320
Let's eat.

108
00:07:20,119 --> 00:07:21,640
What's up? What are you doing here?

109
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,519
You said, Shao Beisheng,

110
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,880
is such a narcissist.

111
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:30,079
He cannot practice now.

112
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,760
He must be so upset.

113
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,200
What would I do to make him feel better?

114
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,440
Don't think about it now.

115
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:40,920
Let's clean up first.

116
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,959
I'll think about it
with you after cleaning.

117
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:54,839
Zhengyi,

118
00:07:56,679 --> 00:07:57,679
I was looking for you.

119
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:59,279
Can you contact Shao Beisheng?

120
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,279
I cannot contact him.

121
00:08:01,799 --> 00:08:02,799
You cannot contact him?

122
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,839
No one answers the phone.

123
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:23,000
He messaged me earlier and said

124
00:08:23,679 --> 00:08:24,839
he cannot partner with me anymore.

125
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,200
He also let me seize the opportunity,

126
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,640
and then he has not
replied to my message,

127
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,559
or answered the phone.

128
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:30,320
What did he mean?

129
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,640
Is he really going to retire?

130
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,640
Don't worry.

131
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,239
I don't think

132
00:08:36,359 --> 00:08:37,880
he will give up so easily.

133
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:40,479
Try calling him again.

134
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,799
Shen Zhengyi.

135
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,239
Didn't you see him?

136
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:52,320
Is he in the skating rink?

137
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,000
No.

138
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,039
He hasn't come for these two days.

139
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:55,359
But he went out early
and came back late.

140
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,719
Where did he go?

141
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,080
You are his roommate.

142
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,320
Did you ask us?

143
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,840
I'm busy with the rehearsal
of the play these days.

144
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,599
So I didn't pay much attention to him.

145
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:10,799
He replied to my message.

146
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,080
What did he say?

147
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:16,359
He said that he took a walk to relax,

148
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,479
and tell us not to worry.

149
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,239
All right.

150
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,760
We are just worrying too much.

151
00:10:15,719 --> 00:10:16,599
You're back.

152
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,520
What's up?

153
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:22,960
You eat the haw flakes.

154
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,119
You'd better not eat them.

155
00:10:26,119 --> 00:10:27,359
Don't you know you have hyperglycemia?

156
00:10:29,599 --> 00:10:31,559
I ate too much at noon,
and they help with digestion.

157
00:10:33,239 --> 00:10:33,760
Where did you go?

158
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,719
I've been waiting for you
for a long time.

159
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:35,919
I went to have a meal.

160
00:10:37,599 --> 00:10:40,039
Do you ask me to receive training?

161
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:41,679
What training?

162
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:42,799
You haven't recovered.

163
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,400
You don't ask me to receive training,

164
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:49,919
and this is the first time
you come to my dorm.

165
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:55,799
Did you quarrel with your wife

166
00:10:56,359 --> 00:10:57,400
and come here for shelter?

167
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,200
No way.

168
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:02,119
I cannot see you if
there's nothing for you?

169
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,919
Alright, Ma.

170
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:22,599
I'll take care of

171
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:24,520
my hand properly.

172
00:11:39,239 --> 00:11:40,320
Doctors are very responsible.

173
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:42,719
Sometimes, they will exaggerate

174
00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:44,039
the injury.

175
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:46,239
A big guy can recover soon.

176
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,200
Maybe you'll be all right soon.

177
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,719
Alright, I'm not even upset.

178
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,760
Why are you upset?

179
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,359
I am not upset.

180
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,400
If you aren't upset, I'll give you this.

181
00:12:04,119 --> 00:12:05,520
It's empty.
You are making fun of me.

182
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,359
Ma,

183
00:12:16,479 --> 00:12:17,320
I've figured it out.

184
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,520
From today,

185
00:12:18,599 --> 00:12:19,559
my pairs skating career

186
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:21,719
is over.

187
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,640
Shen Zhengyi.

188
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:46,919
You're back.

189
00:12:48,479 --> 00:12:49,320
What are you doing here?

190
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,799
Nothing.

191
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:52,760
As I have not

192
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:54,440
seen you recently,

193
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,799
I just come by to see
what you are doing.

194
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:03,479
Are you an idiot?

195
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,080
Your ears are cold.

196
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,080
Why did you wait for me?

197
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,200
You want to know where

198
00:13:08,239 --> 00:13:09,039
I've been, right?

199
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,239
No.

200
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,840
I just want to know

201
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:13,799
if you need someone to

202
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,840
talk with or something.

203
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,400
I can do nothing.

204
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,440
But if

205
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,799
you need someone to talk with

206
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,440
or take a stroll,

207
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:25,719
I will be there for you.

208
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,320
Thank you.

209
00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:30,200
I can take care of myself. Trust me.

210
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:32,559
Don't stand here.

211
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,400
Go back to take a rest.

212
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:36,280
You go back first.

213
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,799
You go first.

214
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:41,080
Then I'll leave.

215
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,679
Good night.

216
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:44,960
Good night.

217
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:06,000
Did you hear about the
Figure Skating team?

218
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,119
You said Shao Beisheng?

219
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,799
He's going to retire.

220
00:14:11,119 --> 00:14:11,919
Right.

221
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,159
Since he's in such situation,

222
00:14:13,239 --> 00:14:13,760
he has no

223
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,039
other choice but to retire.

224
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,520
He was so popular

225
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:19,039
as Prince of Figure Skating
in the past.

226
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,760
Now his professional career

227
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:23,320
is total gone.

228
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,919
He's been practicing for many years.

229
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,840
There's no other ways.

230
00:14:35,719 --> 00:14:36,359
Are you okay?

231
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,039
Almost.

232
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,080
(Come to the skating rink tonight
at 6:00.)

233
00:14:41,719 --> 00:14:42,679
(I have an important decision)

234
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:43,280
(to announce.)

235
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:01,840
(Director's Office)

236
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,760
Please come in.

237
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,320
Coach Ma, come here.

238
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:09,559
I want to ask you
to go to the skating rink.

239
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,520
Alright, alright.

240
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,359
Let's go.

241
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,840
What will Shao Beisheng

242
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:39,159
announce?

243
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:40,640
Does he really

244
00:15:40,719 --> 00:15:41,719
want to retire?

245
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:43,280
Don't look at me.

246
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:44,840
I don't know either.

247
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,559
He didn't tell me.

248
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:49,799
Master.

249
00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:51,080
Wang Jun.

250
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,200
What are you doing here?

251
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,440
We saw group messages

252
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,760
and came here.

253
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:57,960
Did Shao Beisheng tell you to come?

254
00:16:02,719 --> 00:16:03,479
Master.

255
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,119
Is Beisheng really going to retire?

256
00:16:08,359 --> 00:16:09,200
Zhengyi!

257
00:16:21,599 --> 00:16:24,159
- Director.
- Hello Director.

258
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:24,880
Hi, everyone.

259
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,080
Shao Beisheng.

260
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,599
Beisheng.

261
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,719
Look at him. Isn't he Shao Beisheng?

262
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:52,000
Shao Beisheng, it's Beisheng.

263
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
What is he doing? Is that him?

264
00:16:53,719 --> 00:16:54,320
Look.

265
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,520
Shao Beisheng.

266
00:17:33,199 --> 00:17:34,479
That is too dreamy.

267
00:17:49,199 --> 00:17:50,839
Beisheng, amazing!

268
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:06,599
So handsome!

269
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:20,260
(Double Axel)

270
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:25,640
So handsome! Cool!

271
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,880
Beisheng.

272
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,260
(Triple Axel)

273
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:53,479
The triple Axel jump.

274
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:55,560
It is not perfect yet.

275
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:56,680
But it's soon to be.

276
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,400
Okay.

277
00:19:00,719 --> 00:19:01,400
The triple Axel jump.

278
00:19:01,959 --> 00:19:02,839
Generally, male pairs skater

279
00:19:03,239 --> 00:19:04,760
is quite great to finish Double Axel.

280
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,880
Oh my goodness, it's too...

281
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,079
Cool!

282
00:19:25,719 --> 00:19:27,599
Handsome! Beisheng, cool!

283
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,760
Amazing!

284
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:29,959
Cool!

285
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,479
Cool, Beisheng.

286
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,520
Shao Beisheng, you're amazing!

287
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,119
Today, the reason why
I ask everyone to come

288
00:19:50,719 --> 00:19:51,280
is because I want to announce

289
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:52,280
one thing to you.

290
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,319
From now on,

291
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:56,719
the Pairs Skating career
of Shao Beisheng

292
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,400
is over.

293
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:01,959
Why?

294
00:20:02,239 --> 00:20:03,239
Why?

295
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,920
I don't get it.

296
00:20:05,719 --> 00:20:06,719
Exactly.

297
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,560
So sudden?

298
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,439
Director Zhang,

299
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,040
from now on,

300
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,640
I want to switch to single skating.

301
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,880
Alright.

302
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I support you!

303
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:24,800
Shao Beisheng's switch
to single skating is supported!

304
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,160
From today,

305
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,640
I officially switch to

306
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:33,160
single skating.

307
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,800
You do realize there's no
precedent for this, right?

308
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,839
There's no precedent for this,

309
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:42,560
but it isn't impossible.

310
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:43,599
It is just because no one

311
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,640
wants to try.

312
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,280
Right.

313
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,239
Why does no one try?

314
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:47,439
Because it doesn't work.

315
00:20:51,439 --> 00:20:52,319
But I thought

316
00:20:53,239 --> 00:20:54,719
compared to giving up figure skating,

317
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,560
I'd rather choose a

318
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,239
road that no one would

319
00:20:58,319 --> 00:20:59,640
think it possible.

320
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,520
Director.

321
00:21:24,439 --> 00:21:25,520
It's not an emotional decision.

322
00:21:26,439 --> 00:21:27,400
I just want to keep proving

323
00:21:27,479 --> 00:21:28,719
my value on the skating.

324
00:21:30,439 --> 00:21:32,839
Beisheng, I admire you.

325
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:34,239
I admire your determination
and perseverance.

326
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,199
You can

327
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:36,599
practice triple Axel jump to this extent

328
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,719
in such a short time.

329
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:39,839
It is very good,

330
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:40,880
right?

331
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,280
As to you want to switch from
pairs skating to single skating,

332
00:21:48,479 --> 00:21:50,239
there's no precedent in the team, right?

333
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,719
Right.

334
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:00,280
With only a triple Axel jump,

335
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,839
you cannot prove that your decision

336
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:02,959
is right,

337
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,800
and it doesn't mean

338
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:09,439
you will be eligible for single skating.

339
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:11,479
Do you understand?

340
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,760
What if I guarantee for him?

341
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:17,079
Why does Coach Zhuang come?

342
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,680
Coach Zhuang.

343
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:20,839
Director Zhang.

344
00:22:24,479 --> 00:22:25,479
Director Zhang,

345
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,000
given his personal ability,

346
00:22:30,719 --> 00:22:32,119
I think there's no problem for him
to switch to single skating

347
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:34,520
if he can practice for six months.

348
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:42,920
Coach Zhuang.

349
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,400
He's my son.

350
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,959
He's the son of Coach Zhuang.

351
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,800
How come I've never heard of it?

352
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,400
No matter what decision he makes,

353
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:56,959
I will support him.

354
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,000
As long as you could just give him time,

355
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,199
I believe that

356
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,199
he will make a miracle for you.

357
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,359
Coach Zhuang.

358
00:23:06,479 --> 00:23:07,680
I understand how much you love your son.

359
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,439
We all saw

360
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:10,119
all his efforts

361
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,199
just now.

362
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:12,680
You have an

363
00:23:12,719 --> 00:23:14,040
excellent son.

364
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,400
But as to it,

365
00:23:18,479 --> 00:23:19,359
please allow me to think about it.

366
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:20,400
Okay?

367
00:24:05,439 --> 00:24:06,439
Well...

368
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,760
Thank you.

369
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,199
I have told you that

370
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:29,760
whatever decision you make,

371
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,160
I will support it.

372
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,880
You don't flinch when

373
00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:40,040
you come into trouble this time,

374
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:42,400
and I am particularly happy.

375
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,199
Although there's

376
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,560
no precedent for the switch from
a pairs skater to a single skater,

377
00:24:54,479 --> 00:24:55,839
it doesn't mean you can't.

378
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,199
Your power

379
00:24:57,359 --> 00:24:59,000
and physical fitness
are better than others.

380
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,560
As long as you try your best,

381
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:03,359
I support you.

382
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,520
Don't be afraid of failure

383
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,880
since you've tried hard.

384
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,079
You'd better not

385
00:25:26,199 --> 00:25:27,520
expect too much from me.

386
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:29,680
I am leaving.

387
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:38,439
You're really great!

388
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:39,880
I think that

389
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,439
your performance is better
than previous one.

390
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,119
Shall we keep practicing?

391
00:25:43,479 --> 00:25:44,479
Okay.

392
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,800
Great!

393
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,880
I can do it.

394
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:48,920
I know that

395
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,920
Beisheng can overcome
all the difficulties.

396
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,800
Beisheng is the best!

397
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,040
Mom, I have one thing to tell you.

398
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,000
What is it?

399
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,079
You're the one I love the most

400
00:25:57,199 --> 00:25:58,119
in the whole world.

401
00:26:09,439 --> 00:26:11,359
You're the one mom loves the most, too.

402
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:33,959
How was it?

403
00:26:34,239 --> 00:26:35,199
How was the talk?

404
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:39,959
Quite good.

405
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:42,800
This is a historic step.

406
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:44,400
I'm so happy for you guys.

407
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:49,000
After all those years of estrangement,

408
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,839
it's not that easy to let it go.

409
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,400
What do you mean?

410
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:55,040
I...

411
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,520
I think he's being nice with you.

412
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,599
So far,

413
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,239
he hasn't even called me mom yet.

414
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,959
The so-called good attitude,

415
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,760
and the so-called obedience

416
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:10,880
are just because

417
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,199
I'm the coach of the Wind Chaser,

418
00:27:13,239 --> 00:27:14,959
and I support his switch.

419
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,479
Coach Zhuang.

420
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,199
I don't think so.

421
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,719
No matter how polite

422
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,839
he is to you,

423
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,040
that's not the same to a coach.

424
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:27,640
You are his mom after all.

425
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,479
I know this kid.

426
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,000
He's pretending to be cool.

427
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,640
Don't worry. Everything is fine.

428
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,439
So Shao Beisheng is the son of

429
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,880
Coach Zhuang.

430
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,119
Isn't that like a TV show?

431
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:52,319
Too surprised.

432
00:27:52,719 --> 00:27:54,000
There is too much information tonight.

433
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,400
I'm having indigestion.

434
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,239
When I was little,

435
00:28:00,239 --> 00:28:01,560
it was my mother I admired the most.

436
00:28:01,959 --> 00:28:02,760
Like your mother,

437
00:28:03,439 --> 00:28:04,479
she used to be a
short track speed skater.

438
00:28:05,239 --> 00:28:08,000
But she was a coach.

439
00:28:09,719 --> 00:28:11,040
(I didn't expect that the absent mother)

440
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:12,520
(that Shao Beisheng mentioned)

441
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:13,839
(is Coach Zhuang.)

442
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,040
He's coming out.

443
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:20,640
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

444
00:28:20,719 --> 00:28:21,359
Congratulations!

445
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,640
Why are you looking at me like this?

446
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,920
You're so great.

447
00:28:24,239 --> 00:28:25,800
You don't tell such a big matter
to anyone.

448
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,959
I wanted to surprise you.

449
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,000
We know

450
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:31,680
you don't give up so easily.

451
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,079
Xiao Qing.

452
00:28:39,199 --> 00:28:39,959
Sorry.

453
00:28:40,439 --> 00:28:41,119
I cannot be

454
00:28:41,199 --> 00:28:42,079
your partner anymore.

455
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,439
Is it the decision

456
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,319
after your careful consideration?

457
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,040
I don't want to give up figure skating.

458
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,280
I can just do so

459
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:53,640
to challenge the impossible.

460
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,000
If I fail,

461
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:56,079
I won't regret it.

462
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:56,959
I hope

463
00:28:57,079 --> 00:28:57,719
you can find your new partner

464
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,599
as soon as possible.

465
00:28:59,119 --> 00:28:59,439
Don't delay

466
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,760
the upcoming contests and trainings.

467
00:29:01,719 --> 00:29:02,520
If there's anything you need

468
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,400
me to help,

469
00:29:03,479 --> 00:29:04,239
just tell me.

470
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,719
I'll help you.

471
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:10,800
Anyway,

472
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,599
I think this is a big day today.

473
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,560
I guess it's worth celebrating, right?

474
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:15,560
Right.

475
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,280
Yeah, you have to treat us to dinner.

476
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,920
Okay, you choose whatever
you want to eat.

477
00:29:20,199 --> 00:29:20,760
Let's go.

478
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,800
Let's enjoy a meal.

479
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,479
Let's go, Xiao Qing.

480
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:29,000
- What do you want to eat?
- Eat...

481
00:29:29,479 --> 00:29:30,719
Seafood or something expensive.

482
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:31,760
Okay.

483
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,760
Congratulation to Shao Beisheng!

484
00:29:33,959 --> 00:29:35,040
Thank you.

485
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,439
Bro,

486
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,199
you look absolutely gorgeous today.

487
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:42,199
Stop it.

488
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:43,839
Indeed, I am not lying.

489
00:29:44,239 --> 00:29:46,239
So from now on, Shao Beisheng

490
00:29:46,439 --> 00:29:47,920
becomes a single skater.

491
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:49,119
No problem.

492
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:50,160
He absolutely can do it.

493
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:52,359
Well, he did like this.

494
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,400
You're so ugly.

495
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:55,000
But does that Director

496
00:29:55,479 --> 00:29:56,560
know about it?

497
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:57,920
He said that he would think about it.

498
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,800
What does he need to think about?

499
00:29:59,439 --> 00:30:00,280
He said that he would think about it,

500
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,560
instead of disagreeing with it.

501
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,880
I think there's a lot of hope.

502
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:05,439
It's not important.

503
00:30:05,719 --> 00:30:06,520
Anyway, there's

504
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:07,479
no word called failure

505
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,520
in my dictionary.

506
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,880
I will not give up.

507
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:10,680
Fighting!

508
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,599
Fighting!

509
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,680
You can do it! Cheers!

510
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,880
Okay.

511
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:19,760
Let's eat!

512
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,560
Let's eat!

513
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,880
Just eat!

514
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:28,199
Eat the fish.

515
00:30:31,439 --> 00:30:32,479
I don't want to eat the fish.

516
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,280
Why not?

517
00:30:33,439 --> 00:30:34,359
Don't you like to eat the fish?

518
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,560
No, I don't.

519
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,760
Alright, just eat it.

520
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,280
Beisheng.

521
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,359
I want to eat the fish,
but I cannot get it.

522
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,000
Are you crazy?

523
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:51,800
Give me your bowl.

524
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:57,160
Are you happy?

525
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,520
Thank you, Beisheng.

526
00:31:04,479 --> 00:31:05,280
I'll help you.

527
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,239
You have a problem with your hand.

528
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,359
Thank you, thank you.

529
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,760
Eat this as well.

530
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:10,280
Don't bother.

531
00:31:10,439 --> 00:31:11,800
Okay. Thanks.

532
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,199
Enough.

533
00:31:13,719 --> 00:31:14,680
Do you want to drink something?

534
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,280
Waitress.

535
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,199
Here I am.

536
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:18,119
A bottle of iced tea, please.

537
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,479
Okay.

538
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:23,800
Take it slow.

539
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,319
Your boyfriend

540
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,760
is going to be taken by someone.

541
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:27,920
You're still eating.

542
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,239
You're so nosy.

543
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:31,479
You really don't have
to take care of me.

544
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:32,079
My hand is

545
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,040
almost recovered.

546
00:31:33,439 --> 00:31:34,839
It's true. Thank you.

547
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,640
What are you looking at?

548
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,000
You also want it?

549
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,199
Give me the cup.

550
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,520
No, I...

551
00:31:43,719 --> 00:31:44,280
Give it to me.

552
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:45,000
Hurry up.

553
00:31:45,719 --> 00:31:46,400
Right.

554
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:47,560
Why don't you want it?

555
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,719
You're running out of it.

556
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:50,680
This is called the exclusive love
to you.

557
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:53,359
Drink, you have to drink.

558
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:54,479
It's so tasty.

559
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,520
What are you laughing at?

560
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,719
Bring it over if you want it.

561
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:58,880
If you pour me a drink,

562
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:00,000
then it will be available to everyone?

563
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,359
Zhu Lele, do you want it?

564
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:04,959
I don't.

565
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,719
I have something to do today.

566
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:10,800
I gotta go now.

567
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:12,199
Enjoy your meal.

568
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:14,079
Are you leaving now?

569
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:15,959
Xiao Qing, you haven't eaten.

570
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,959
Go after her.

571
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,959
Let her go.

572
00:32:22,439 --> 00:32:23,800
Yes, let's eat.

573
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,479
It'll get cold later.

574
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,479
Be good.

575
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:30,439
In fact,

576
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,000
I switch to single skating,

577
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:33,640
which has a big effect on her as well.

578
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,920
Leave her alone.

579
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,479
I don't want to bother her.

580
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:39,880
I see. I see.

581
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:40,800
Let's eat!

582
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,280
I've never seen anyone like you.

583
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:49,719
Why do you push your boyfriend

584
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:51,199
to approach some other girl?

585
00:32:51,479 --> 00:32:52,479
I want to hit you.

586
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,119
I hit you.

587
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,959
Stop talking, just eat.

588
00:33:06,199 --> 00:33:07,479
Why are you back today?

589
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,479
Nothing.

590
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,079
I just want to.

591
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,959
As Shao Beisheng has
switched to single skating,

592
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:20,439
you're not giving up.

593
00:33:24,239 --> 00:33:24,959
I know.

594
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,800
You approve of Shao Beisheng
as a partner,

595
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:28,599
and feel guilty of his injury.

596
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,479
But Shao Beisheng

597
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,800
has tried to convince you

598
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,000
to not miss the chance, right?

599
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,000
So what's the point

600
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:34,079
of staying in Wind Chaser?

601
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:34,599
How did you know that

602
00:33:34,719 --> 00:33:36,119
Shao Beisheng convinced me?

603
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:38,719
Did you find

604
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,079
Shao Beisheng?

605
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:42,000
What did you say to him?

606
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:43,239
I just talked to him about

607
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:44,079
Coach Jiang.

608
00:33:44,199 --> 00:33:45,400
Why did you tell him that?

609
00:33:45,479 --> 00:33:46,199
Xiao Qing.

610
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:47,800
Shao Beisheng has made his decision.

611
00:33:48,199 --> 00:33:49,599
Why don't you just move on?

612
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,800
You don't know anything.

613
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,719
What? She knew everything?

614
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,600
Well... Don't be mad.

615
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,520
Calm down.

616
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,239
You promised to keep it secret,

617
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:11,919
right?

618
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:12,879
Why did Xiao Qing know

619
00:34:12,959 --> 00:34:13,919
the whole fake couple thing?

620
00:34:14,479 --> 00:34:15,520
I didn't tell her.

621
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,280
She just found out herself.

622
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,159
Don't be mad. Drink something sweet.

623
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,080
Calm down.

624
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,399
Then you promise it won't happen again.

625
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,399
I promise it won't happen again.

626
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,120
But I think that

627
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,639
since Xiao Qing knows it,

628
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:33,560
we just tell

629
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,000
the truth to Zhu Lele.

630
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,000
We are in the same dorm.

631
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:37,800
Someday

632
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:38,919
if Lele finds out that

633
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,199
Xiao Qing knows something
she doesn't know,

634
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,479
she'll be angry.

635
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,280
We just...

636
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,479
Of course not.

637
00:34:44,439 --> 00:34:44,879
If Zhu Lele knows it,

638
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,280
then everyone in school knows it.

639
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,879
Don't break the contract again.

640
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,000
We...

641
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:53,919
we need to think it over.

642
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,840
Why are you always following me?

643
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,199
I'll take you back to your dorm.

644
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,560
Don't get me wrong!

645
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,600
Shao Beisheng told me to send you back.

646
00:35:10,919 --> 00:35:12,760
What are they doing

647
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,399
in the middle of the night?

648
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,439
They must be on date.

649
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,199
Otherwise, why did they let us leave,

650
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,159
right?

651
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:20,399
You are right.

652
00:35:21,639 --> 00:35:23,560
When people fall in love,

653
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,719
they will abandon friends.

654
00:35:25,399 --> 00:35:26,560
So she's such a person.

655
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:28,120
Are you talking about Shao Beisheng?

656
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:29,959
I'm talking about Shen Zhengyi.

657
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,000
Since you have time to think about
other people's relationships,

658
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,120
you'd better think about

659
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,199
our play.

660
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:36,800
This is probably the last play

661
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,760
of Drama Club.

662
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:41,120
Just achieve

663
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:42,479
100% attendance?

664
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:43,520
You can count on me.

665
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,040
That's easy for you to say.

666
00:35:47,919 --> 00:35:49,399
100% attendance.

667
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:50,520
I asked around and then found out that

668
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:51,439
no

669
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,600
campus activities

670
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:53,399
in that theater

671
00:35:53,479 --> 00:35:54,560
achieved 100% attendance.

672
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:56,120
Don't mention we are

673
00:35:56,199 --> 00:35:57,479
just a Drama Club that
is going to be dissolved.

674
00:35:57,959 --> 00:35:59,159
How come?

675
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,520
Don't be panic.

676
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,280
You can count on me.

677
00:36:10,879 --> 00:36:13,360
Let's go. Send me back to the dorm.

678
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,360
It smells good.

679
00:36:44,879 --> 00:36:45,840
Okay.

680
00:36:46,399 --> 00:36:48,120
You and Shen Zhengyi
become a true couple?

681
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:50,159
What? Who told you so?

682
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:53,600
Zhu Lele said

683
00:36:53,919 --> 00:36:55,000
you let us leave

684
00:36:55,399 --> 00:36:56,159
just to secretly

685
00:36:56,239 --> 00:36:57,199
date with her.

686
00:36:57,879 --> 00:36:59,639
No, I didn't.

687
00:36:59,879 --> 00:37:00,719
She was looking for me

688
00:37:02,439 --> 00:37:03,120
to talk about something.

689
00:37:03,439 --> 00:37:04,239
Talk about something?

690
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:06,520
What is going on?

691
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,239
Just something.

692
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:13,239
It's none of your business.

693
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,239
You're dangerous.

694
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:19,840
What's up?

695
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,840
Your brain is pumping

696
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:23,479
phenylethylamine out.

697
00:37:24,479 --> 00:37:25,320
Love is a normal

698
00:37:25,399 --> 00:37:26,239
physiological reaction,

699
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,560
and a biological instinct.

700
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,800
Nothing to be embarrassing.

701
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:31,000
You said I like Shen Zhengyi?

702
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:33,879
I am telling you.

703
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:36,239
Even if the sky falls,

704
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,600
I can never like Shen Zhengyi.

705
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:38,199
Anything is possible.

706
00:37:38,399 --> 00:37:40,040
But it's impossible for me to

707
00:37:40,879 --> 00:37:41,919
like Shen Zhengyi.

708
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:44,040
Go away. What are you looking at?

709
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,840
Because of phenylethylamine,

710
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,560
the heartbeat and breathing

711
00:38:07,639 --> 00:38:08,439
will speed up.

712
00:38:09,479 --> 00:38:10,600
The heart beats faster,

713
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:12,199
the palms sweat,

714
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,000
and the face glows.

715
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,959
In particular, pupils dilate.

716
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:19,159
Don't you dare sincerely say

717
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:20,399
none of these symptoms appeared

718
00:38:20,479 --> 00:38:21,639
when you were with her?

719
00:38:22,479 --> 00:38:23,280
No.

720
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:25,560
Look at me in the eye and say it.

721
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,560
No.

722
00:38:30,439 --> 00:38:31,600
If yes,

723
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:33,520
that's because I was mad at her.

724
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,439
I can never like her anyway.

725
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,719
The stubborn man

726
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,239
has to pay the price.

727
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,120
Just leave me.

728
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:50,239
Okay, stubborn man.

729
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,239
Are you thinking about Shen Zhengyi?

730
00:39:05,439 --> 00:39:06,919
Go away! Draw your lightning.

731
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,360
Lie down to think about it.

732
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:09,600
I don't.

733
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,520
Turn over to think about it.

734
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,040
Enough!

735
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:15,239
I don't like her.

736
00:39:21,439 --> 00:39:23,000
When you close your eyes,
it's all of Shen Zhengyi, right?

737
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:38,530
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team
of Lingbei University)

738
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,399
There's a great technique difference

739
00:39:52,399 --> 00:39:53,800
between pairs skating
and single skating.

740
00:39:54,399 --> 00:39:56,159
The jump and spin of single skating

741
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:57,040
is demanding to

742
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,040
the player's individual ability.

743
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:00,199
If Beisheng wants to

744
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:00,879
get high scores in Single Skating,

745
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,399
it's still very difficult.

746
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:13,120
I am responsible for

747
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,320
what Beisheng is like today.

748
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:16,239
If he insists,

749
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:18,000
I'll be there for him the whole time.

750
00:40:36,479 --> 00:40:37,399
I think Shao Beisheng

751
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,360
shall retire.

752
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:40,479
Because of the injury,

753
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:42,159
he cannot play the Pairs Skating again.

754
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,399
What a pity!

755
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:50,919
Isn't it good for him to retire

756
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,080
with all the glory?

757
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:54,080
Why does he have to be so persistent?

758
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,320
Go change shoes.

759
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,840
You are here.

760
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,460
(Xiao Qing's Application for Departure
from Team)

761
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,520
You've been jumping better than

762
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:31,199
other team members
since you were a kid.

763
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,639
I support you.

764
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,040
Just do it!

765
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,520
When you jump,

766
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,239
you need to strengthen
the drive of your leg.

767
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:46,439
Why did you come here?

768
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,840
I'm here to practice with you.

769
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,679
There's something wrong with your jump.

770
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:50,879
You can do Double Axel,

771
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
instead of triple Axel jump.

772
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:53,120
I can teach you the method that

773
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:54,320
I learned in Russia.

774
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:55,639
Thank you.

775
00:41:56,399 --> 00:41:57,719
But shouldn't you be busy lately?

776
00:41:58,479 --> 00:41:59,280
Are you going to join

777
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,120
the Coach Jiang's team?

778
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,439
There should be a lot of process to go.

779
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,040
I have videos.

780
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:04,280
I'll be okay by just watching videos.

781
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,040
I'm not going to join the
Coach Jiang's team.

782
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:09,760
Why?

783
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,719
It's a complicated process.

784
00:42:13,439 --> 00:42:15,080
She didn't pick me in the end anyway,

785
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,120
so I've made a decision as well.

786
00:42:17,879 --> 00:42:19,320
I want to switch to single skating, too.

787
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:20,840
What?

788
00:42:21,479 --> 00:42:22,439
Alright, let's practice together.

789
00:42:48,679 --> 00:42:49,479
Are you crazy?

790
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:51,199
You are good at Pairs Skating.

791
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,120
Why did you switch to Single Skating?

792
00:42:52,919 --> 00:42:53,800
Shao Beisheng can do so,

793
00:42:53,959 --> 00:42:54,679
why can't I?

794
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,000
Shao Beisheng was forced to do so

795
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:56,879
because he got injured in his hand.

796
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,040
What about you?

797
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,679
It's the opportunity of a lifetime

798
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,159
to join Coach Jiang's team.

799
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,320
I've already turned her down.

800
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,199
What?

801
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,320
Xiao Qing, what's

802
00:43:06,439 --> 00:43:07,320
in your mind?

803
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,080
You said no to

804
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:10,199
such a good opportunity

805
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,280
without any discussion with me?

806
00:43:11,479 --> 00:43:12,560
I'm an adult now.

807
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:13,040
I can be responsible for

808
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:14,399
all my decisions.

809
00:43:14,479 --> 00:43:15,719
Could you just leave me alone?

810
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:17,959
Anyway,

811
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:18,719
you want to stay in Wind Chaser

812
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,840
just for Shao Beisheng, right?

813
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,199
Right, I do it just for him.

814
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,439
He switches to Single Skating, so do I.

815
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,399
He practices, then I follow.

816
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,040
Can't I?

817
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:24,840
Are you an idiot?

818
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,760
Shao Beisheng has a girlfriend.

819
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,760
He and Zhengyi are not real couple.

820
