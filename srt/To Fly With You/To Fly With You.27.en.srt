=Episode 27=

3
00:01:37,199 --> 00:01:38,519
With that height and weight,

4
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,559
how can Curry complete

5
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,480
Triple Axel and Quadruple Salchow

6
00:01:41,639 --> 00:01:42,480
so perfectly?

7
00:01:43,639 --> 00:01:44,839
Because foreigners have superb
physical capabilities,

8
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:45,959
and can jump high?

9
00:01:46,199 --> 00:01:47,400
I won't be easily persuaded.

10
00:01:47,919 --> 00:01:49,000
It's just two movements.
Keep practicing yourself.

11
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,919
Every day!

12
00:01:50,839 --> 00:01:52,120
You can outperform him

13
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:53,199
as long as you jump
higher and farther enough.

14
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,519
Right?

15
00:01:56,279 --> 00:01:56,839
Stop thinking about it.

16
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,160
Concentrate yourself

17
00:01:58,279 --> 00:01:59,000
on the present.

18
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,680
The Asian Cup is coming.

19
00:02:01,199 --> 00:02:02,000
Let's get a good result

20
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,040
and prove yourself to them.

21
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,960
Coach Zhuang,

22
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,199
are you sure you won't

23
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,000
consider my suggestion?

24
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,080
I've made up my mind.

25
00:02:20,679 --> 00:02:21,960
I just feel sorry for you.

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,520
You haven't changed at all.

27
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,720
Have you ever realized that

28
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,559
you've made no progress

29
00:02:28,559 --> 00:02:30,080
since I left?

30
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,399
I'm fast enough,

31
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,279
so there is no need for
further improvement.

32
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:35,679
Well then, you don't have to

33
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,559
waste your time on me.

34
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,240
Eunkyung Choi,

35
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:40,520
what you need the most now

36
00:02:40,679 --> 00:02:41,919
is teamwork.

37
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,839
If you still play the game by yourself,

38
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,279
there is no way you can improve

39
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:46,839
no matter who

40
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,960
is your coach.

41
00:02:48,559 --> 00:02:49,839
There is nothing wrong about my way.

42
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,520
I'm always like this.

43
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:57,559
How about this?

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,119
If I win the champion in the Asian Cup,

45
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,160
you come back,

46
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:01,399
OK?

47
00:03:02,279 --> 00:03:03,279
You seem incredibly confident.

48
00:03:03,399 --> 00:03:04,600
It's so obvious.

49
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,279
Today, that Shen Zhengyi

50
00:03:05,399 --> 00:03:06,279
was lapped by me.

51
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,520
But it's not impossible
for her to defeat you.

52
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:10,199
Her performance

53
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,160
in the last lap

54
00:03:11,279 --> 00:03:12,399
was very close to yours.

55
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:20,520
But it's only close.

56
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,839
We cannot work together because
we believe in different approaches.

57
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,279
I wish you good luck.

58
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,759
Stop looking at me.

59
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,720
I'm fine.

60
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,960
It was just for mutual learning.

61
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:48,960
It won't get into the record anyway.

62
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,720
Right?

63
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,399
I see. Stop worrying.

64
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:03,199
Take your time.

65
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,399
See you around.

66
00:04:04,839 --> 00:04:05,839
Have a good chat.

67
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:13,960
Anything for drink?

68
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,200
Come on.

69
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,519
Don't be so upset.

70
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,200
Was Eunkyung Choi really that amazing?

71
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:41,399
To the extent that

72
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:43,399
it would leave me with
psychological consequence.

73
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,320
What about you?

74
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,200
The prestigious student of Curry?

75
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:51,959
He didn't pick me.

76
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,040
That's not funny.

77
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,760
I'm not gonna feel better

78
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:57,040
with jokes like this.

79
00:04:58,119 --> 00:04:59,119
He picked Xiao Qing.

80
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,799
Why?

81
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,760
She was there, too?

82
00:05:08,359 --> 00:05:09,440
She has been in contact with
Curry by mails,

83
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,040
probably for me,

84
00:05:12,799 --> 00:05:14,600
so maybe she also recommended herself.

85
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,000
How could she do this?

86
00:05:17,559 --> 00:05:18,239
Let me reason with her.

87
00:05:18,799 --> 00:05:19,559
Don't.

88
00:05:20,559 --> 00:05:21,200
She got picked

89
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:22,239
really because

90
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:23,359
she performed well today.

91
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,359
But you practised hard too.

92
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,000
Besides,

93
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:26,799
he said that

94
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,559
he only wanted male players, right?

95
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,559
He didn't need female players.

96
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,760
But she completed Triple Axel

97
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,200
as a female player,

98
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,600
and she did do well

99
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,559
in today's performance.

100
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
That probably impressed Curry,

101
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,359
so he made an exception.

102
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,880
But you completed Quadruple Salchow!

103
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,239
It's a fair game,

104
00:05:43,679 --> 00:05:44,480
and also a cruel one.

105
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,239
There is nothing I can do

106
00:05:46,359 --> 00:05:47,480
about it.

107
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:49,880
I've got no objection.

108
00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:59,000
OK, it's fine.

109
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:00,200
Really.

110
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,679
You lost to Xiao Qing,

111
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,760
and I was tortured by Eunkyung Choi.

112
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:26,239
We are really a couple of bad luck,

113
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,440
right?

114
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,920
But you look fine,

115
00:06:33,679 --> 00:06:35,119
nothing like being tortured.

116
00:06:36,359 --> 00:06:37,320
Well, being tortured

117
00:06:38,119 --> 00:06:39,239
doesn't mean I'm defeated.

118
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,359
I am tough,

119
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,679
indeed.

120
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,600
This time,

121
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:46,440
I set a new goal.

122
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,799
I have to catch up with her
in the Asian Cup.

123
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,559
And Coach Zhuang said I could make it.

124
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,239
Why do you become

125
00:06:56,359 --> 00:06:57,359
so optimistic now?

126
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,320
Just count how many times
I got overwhelmed

127
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,320
since I joined Wind Chaser.

128
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:04,799
But I've become

129
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,000
stronger and stronger now.

130
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,480
How about this?

131
00:07:11,119 --> 00:07:11,679
Push me.

132
00:07:12,119 --> 00:07:12,799
Why?

133
00:07:13,239 --> 00:07:14,200
Push me. Just push.

134
00:07:14,239 --> 00:07:15,480
For what?

135
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:16,320
Just push me.

136
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,359
Push.

137
00:07:17,799 --> 00:07:18,440
I'll do it for real.

138
00:07:18,799 --> 00:07:19,359
Come on.

139
00:07:23,799 --> 00:07:24,559
One more.

140
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:31,760
I'm up again!

141
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,200
So you know,

142
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,440
sometimes we need to be like

143
00:07:41,559 --> 00:07:42,359
a tumbler,

144
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,320

Great!

150
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:00,239
Stop.

151
00:08:00,799 --> 00:08:01,359
Stop being cute

152
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,359
and amusing me.

153

You're cute enough.

154
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,679
In fact, I've thought about it already.

155
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:13,320
It's no big deal.

156
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,880
I can practise on my own.

157
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,040
And

158
00:08:17,559 --> 00:08:18,119
I've also set

159
00:08:18,119 --> 00:08:19,000
a small goal for myself.

160
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,880
What is it?

161
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,000
I will complete

162
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,239
the Triple Axel and Quadruple Salchow
in the most perfect way,

163
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,799
and defeat Curry's student

164

in the Asian Cup.

Perfect!

186
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:34,430
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team of
Lingbei University)

187
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,200
This is the performance data
of Eunkyung Choi

188
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,280
in the 7-lap pursuit race.

189
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,000
Take a look.

190
00:09:40,599 --> 00:09:41,400
Eunkyung Choi has managed to maintain

191
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,960
her best status.

192
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,880
She managed to finish each lap

193
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,080
within 9.340s on average,

194
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,840
and even 8s for the shortest lap time.

195
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,960
She's hard to compete with.

196
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:52,520
I know Eunkyung Choi well.

197
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,479
She's entered her bottleneck stage,

198
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,719
and it's hard to break through.

199
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,960
We still have chance.

200
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:00,200
Even if it's difficult for her to
break her own record,

201
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:01,960
she is much ahead of others

202
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:03,200
in the Asian Cup.

203
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,640
Without tactical cooperation,

204
00:10:04,719 --> 00:10:05,719
we cannot

205
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,280
compete against her easily.

206
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,280
Yes,

207
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,960
the only way we can defeat her

208
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:12,520
is through tactical cooperation.

209
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,599
What's your opinion?

210
00:10:17,239 --> 00:10:18,479
I think Shen Zhengyi

211
00:10:18,599 --> 00:10:19,640
can offer support
to Luo Xiaoyi.

212
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,119
Luo Xiaoyi is much more
experienced

213
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,880
in terms of competition experience,

214
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,239
but Shen Zhengyi has greater power.

215
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:27,239
She can occupy
the most competitive position

216
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,359
at the start-up.

217
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,719
So she can lead the race first

218
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,760
and consume Choi's energy,

219
00:10:31,119 --> 00:10:32,479
and then Luo Xiaoyi can
make the final sprint

220
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,239
at the right time.

221
00:10:33,359 --> 00:10:34,039
That maximizes our possibility to win.

222
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,880
You forget one thing.

223
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,359
Shen Zhengyi does have power,

224
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,000
but that power is not enduring.

225
00:10:40,719 --> 00:10:42,760
If she used up all her energy
in the first half,

226
00:10:43,119 --> 00:10:43,960
what's she gonna do in the next half?

227
00:10:44,119 --> 00:10:45,119
What's Luo Xiaoyi gonna do

228
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:45,960
on her own?

229
00:10:46,239 --> 00:10:46,599
That's true.

230
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,880
So we can carry out some

231
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,000
endurance training for Shen Zhengyi.

232
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:49,760
No.

233
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,000
The contest is about to start.

234
00:10:51,119 --> 00:10:51,719
It's not gonna work

235
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,400
if we carry out endurance training
at this time.

236
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,840
Definitely no.

237
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,239
I have some idea.

238
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,119
Shen Zhengyi's best
single-lap performance

239
00:10:59,479 --> 00:11:00,599
in the 7-lap pursuit race

240
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,960
was 9.803s,

241
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,359
which was very close

242
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:06,239
to the performance

243
00:11:06,719 --> 00:11:08,000
of Eunkyung Choi,

244
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:10,239
and was better than that of Luo Xiaoyi.

245
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:13,000
She has the potential to
be the champion.

246
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,520
But, Coach Zhuang,

247
00:11:15,479 --> 00:11:16,280
we've got limited time

248
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,359
to prepare for the Asian Cup.

249
00:11:18,119 --> 00:11:19,359
The earlier we start training
for tactical cooperation,

250
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:20,479
the better result we can get.

251
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,359
I think each and every player
of Wind Chaser

252
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:23,520
has the chance to win.

253
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,880
Let's not talk about

254
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,000
who plays the supporter role.

255
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:27,000
The most important thing now

256
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:28,280
is to improve training quality.

257
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,400
We can determine
cooperation strategies

258
00:11:30,599 --> 00:11:31,239
based on the conditions of the athletes

259
00:11:31,599 --> 00:11:32,880
then.

260
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,000
What do you think?

261
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,880
What you said makes sense.

262
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,719
But I still insist on

263
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,119
my personal opinion.

264
00:11:50,719 --> 00:11:51,280
Mom.

265
00:11:52,119 --> 00:11:52,640
What's up?

266
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:54,880
Nothing, I just miss you.

267
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,239
I've got some fruit for you.

268
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,599
Thanks.

269
00:12:02,359 --> 00:12:03,760
I was too busy with the exchange

270
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,880
to care for you.

271
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,359
That's fine.

272
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:10,479
Not going to Russia is no big deal.

273
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,960
I'll have more time to be with you.

274
00:12:16,479 --> 00:12:17,280
I know

275
00:12:18,119 --> 00:12:19,479
my son is strong.

276
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,400
But you must feel disappointed

277
00:12:22,479 --> 00:12:23,359
for not being able to

278
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,520
train with your idol.

279
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,479
Zhengyi said

280
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:30,280
those who have failed
to be recognized by their idols

281
00:12:30,359 --> 00:12:31,280
will make great achievement.

282
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:32,840
Just like her

283
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,760
being tortured by Eunkyung Choi,

284
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,080
and me being looked down upon by Curry.

285
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,479
I'm fine.

286
00:12:39,239 --> 00:12:40,520
She's good at comforting people.

287
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,200
You smile more often

288
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,119
after you fall in love with Zhengyi.

289
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,239
Be nice to her.

290
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:51,520
We're good, mom.

291
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,359
Rest assured.

292
00:12:53,479 --> 00:12:54,080
OK, off you go.

293
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,479
That bag is for Zhengyi.

294
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,599
Don't forget to give it to her.

295
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,719
Got it.

296
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:00,880
See you then.

297
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,840
Come in.

298
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,680
(Wind Chaser)

299
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:20,719
I know you must have been busy.

300
00:13:21,479 --> 00:13:22,239
Haven't had anything yet?

301
00:13:22,599 --> 00:13:23,599
I bought you something to eat.

302
00:13:25,719 --> 00:13:26,599
Okay. Thanks.

303
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:29,719
I've got things to talk to you.

304
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,640
Today we analyzed

305
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,599
the performance data of
Eunkyung Choi and Shen Zhengyi

306
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,880
in the 7-lap pursuit race.

307
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:38,880
Then?

308
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,760
She was behind Eunkyung Choi

309
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,880
by 7 seconds in total.

310
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,080
And her average performance

311
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,000
was not as good as yours.

312
00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:46,080
We will still count on you

313
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,239
to win the champion.

314
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
But I can't win

315
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,239
on my own.

316
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,479
I need strategic support.

317
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,880
So here's what I think.

318
00:13:53,719 --> 00:13:54,640
Let Shen Zhengyi lead first

319
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,080
to consume Eunkyung Choi's energy,

320
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,479
and then you sprint in the last moment.

321
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,119
We're most likely to win this way.

322
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,119
I thought about that, too.

323
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,359
With Shen Zhengyi's help,

324
00:14:04,479 --> 00:14:05,359
as long as she

325
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,479
can be a trouble for Choi,

326
00:14:06,599 --> 00:14:07,760
even the smallest interference,

327
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,599
I will outperform her.

328
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:11,359
Make it this way then.

329
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,520
But Coach Zhuang

330
00:14:14,719 --> 00:14:15,760
hasn't approved it.

331
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:21,599
So she won't let

332
00:14:21,719 --> 00:14:23,200
Shen Zhengyi support me?

333
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,200
I'll try my best to

334
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,359
persuade her.

335
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,000
And

336
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,239
I also need to find out

337
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,359
whether Shen Zhengyi
is willing to be your supporter.

338
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:33,960
She just won the 1500m

339
00:14:34,119 --> 00:14:34,640
gold medal

340
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,640
in Ling Yun Cup.

341
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,880
This is also her first time

342
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,520
to take part in the Asian Cup.

343
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,599
So I need to take her attitude

344
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,599
into account.

345
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,719
Don't bother to consider that.

346
00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:44,719
It's her first time to the Asian Cup,

347
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,320
but maybe my last time.

348
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,320
Luo Xiaoyi!

349
00:14:56,719 --> 00:14:57,599
All in all,

350
00:14:58,479 --> 00:14:59,719
I hope you have not forgotten

351
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,960
our common goal.

352
00:15:05,119 --> 00:15:06,000
I hope you can

353
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,080
stick to it.

354
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:08,960
Train yourself hard.

355
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,119
Leave the rest to me.

356
00:15:23,119 --> 00:15:24,080
Still awake?

357
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:27,479
How's the packing up?

358
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,000
Almost done.

359
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,200
Just some small stuff

360
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,080
to be packed.

361
00:15:32,719 --> 00:15:34,559
Are you sure about going to Russia?

362
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:36,719
Why not?

363
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,080
I've tried so hard

364
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,239
to get selected.

365
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,719
I know

366
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,599
it's a rare opportunity

367
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:43,719
for you.

368
00:15:44,479 --> 00:15:45,719
But I hope you have thought it through.

369
00:15:45,719 --> 00:15:46,320
What you've done

370
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:47,479
has to be all for yourself,

371
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:48,840
not for anyone else.

372
00:15:50,719 --> 00:15:51,919
I took part in the qualification trial

373
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:53,679
because I was enraged by Shao Beisheng

374
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:54,840
and was in a moment of pique.

375
00:15:56,479 --> 00:15:57,719
You still like him?

376
00:16:04,719 --> 00:16:06,479
Shao Beisheng told me today

377
00:16:07,119 --> 00:16:08,840
that I'm his respectable opponent.

378
00:16:09,359 --> 00:16:10,119
It made me feel like

379
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:10,919
we were back to

380
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,119
the first day we met.

381
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:13,719
There was nothing about love

382
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:15,919
or falling short of expectation.

383
00:16:16,719 --> 00:16:17,719
We were just two figure skaters

384
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,679
who respected each other.

385
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:23,080
Do you know how it feels?

386
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,719
I can win medals,

387
00:16:28,359 --> 00:16:30,239
but I can't win the heart
of the boy I like.

388
00:16:30,599 --> 00:16:31,320
It's too unstable,

389
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,440
too vague,

390
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:33,960
and makes people fragile.

391
00:16:34,599 --> 00:16:36,320
So going to Russia

392
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:37,679
is my way to

393
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:38,599
correct everything.

394
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,479
I am still the respectable
figure skating player,

395
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:41,599
Xiao Qing.

396
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:56,960
Don't look!

397
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,840
It's a secret.

398
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,559
Brother,

399
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:05,319
I've got one question for you.

400
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,520
Can you answer it before I go?

401
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,280
Go ahead.

402
00:17:09,719 --> 00:17:11,680
Why do you think so highly
of Shen Zhengyi?

403
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,000
In fact,

404
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,319
I can tell that

405
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,760
you are in a dilemma

406
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,680
of deciding the arrangement of
Luo Xiaoyi and Shen Zhengyi.

407
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,599
It's hard to decide

408
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,599
who should assist.

409
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,119
Then look at their performance.

410
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:32,760
That's how we play it fair.

411
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,839
And also in this way,

412
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:35,599
you can be relieved.

413
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,160
Right?

414
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,920
This is just your childish
way of thinking.

415
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,760
I must fulfill my promise

416
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,920
to Xiaoyi's brother.

417
00:17:48,239 --> 00:17:49,640
I owe him a champion.

418
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,280
You think and worry

419
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,680
way too much.

420
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,040
Zhengyi...

421
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,560
Shen Zhengyi surprised me.

422
00:18:09,439 --> 00:18:10,560
She's very different from Luo Xiaoyi.

423
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,800
She's got something on her

424
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:14,719
that I really appreciate.

425
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,400
Her efforts and energy all come from

426
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,160
a pure love for speed skating.

427
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:21,000
I haven't seen such pure aspiration

428
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,560
for a very long time.

429
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:24,959
She's the kind of player

430
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:26,119
that all coaches will like.

431
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,680
It's true.

432
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:30,160
After so long, I can only

433
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,280
regain the charm of competitive sports

434
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,680
from her.

435
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:36,160
Zhengyi told me that

436
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,199
I was the one who brought her into

437
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,319
the world of Short Track Speed Skating.

438
00:18:40,439 --> 00:18:41,119
But in fact,

439
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,319
she was the one who helped me

440
00:18:43,439 --> 00:18:44,680
be who I should be.

441
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,239
I think you should let her play.

442
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:52,520
Stop.

443
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,839
Don't worry about me.

444
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,560
I'll discuss the arrangement
for tactical cooperation

445
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:56,680
with Coach Zhuang.

446
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:58,599
If Zhengyi is capable,

447
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,040
we will seriously consider her.

448
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:02,800
All members of Wind Chaser

449
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,640
have been working so hard

450
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,719
and contributed so much.

451
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,040
We must succeed.

452
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,760
I still don't understand.

453
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,560
You do think

454
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,800
Shen Zhengyi has a higher possibility of
winning the champion.

455
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:12,199
Why are you still hesitating?

456
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:17,319
You don't understand.

457
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:20,040
There are promises
that I just can't let go.

458
00:19:24,199 --> 00:19:24,920
Well,

459
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:25,800
stop worrying about me.

460
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,119
Okay?

461
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,439
I'll look after myself,

462
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,119
but you have to take care of yourself

463
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,199
in Russia too.

464
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:33,040
OK?

465
00:19:33,199 --> 00:19:34,319
Take good care of yourself.

466
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,280
Well, you should sleep now.

467
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:39,839
Good night.

468
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,280
Good night.

469

(Training Agenda, Luo Xiaoyi)

00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:09,860
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team of
Lingbei University)

471
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,839
Sorry, Coach Ma.

472
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,760
Don't put it that way.

473
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,599
There's nothing you should
feel sorry about.

474
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:24,560
Xiao Qing,

475
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,719
Curry picked you

476
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,920
because you are competent.

477
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,920
We all admire your competency,

478
00:20:31,479 --> 00:20:32,079
including Beisheng.

479
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,560
He knows how he feels about it.

480
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,199
Don't feel sorry

481
00:20:35,439 --> 00:20:36,319
to anyone.

482
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:37,800
And don't feel guilty.

483
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:42,079
You look like an underdog!

484
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,959
It's a good thing,

485
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,319
right?

486
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,439
Let me tell you.

487
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:47,599
No matter which team you are in,

488
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,719
it would be the honor of that team.

489
00:20:49,199 --> 00:20:50,319
When you came to Wind Chaser,

490
00:20:50,439 --> 00:20:50,839
I was thinking that

491
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:51,920
it was so great that

492
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:52,839
such an outstanding athlete

493
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:53,959
can join us.

494
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,040
I deserve a pay rise.

495
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,040
Well, it turned out that
I got no pay rise

496
00:20:58,199 --> 00:20:58,920
and you're now leaving.

497
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,560
Sorry,

498
00:21:02,199 --> 00:21:03,040
I let you down.

499
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:04,439
You're being sorry again!

500
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:07,280
I'm just kidding.

501
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:08,839
Don't take it seriously.

502
00:21:10,439 --> 00:21:11,839
Well, I was your coach

503
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:14,319
and trained you.

504
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:15,560
So do remember our
master-apprentice relation.

505
00:21:16,199 --> 00:21:17,319
If you get good results

506
00:21:18,479 --> 00:21:19,319
or win gold medals

507
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:20,199
abroad,

508
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:21,680
I'd also feel honored.

509
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,920
Don't forget to tell the media

510
00:21:23,439 --> 00:21:24,920
that you learned some real lessons

511
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:26,359
from Coach Ma back in China.

512
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,319
Right?

513
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:29,479
So I can have something to boast about.

514
00:21:32,239 --> 00:21:33,160
Coach Ma.

515
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,119
You did teach me a lot.

516
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,560
I owe you

517
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,400
for my achievement today.

518

522
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:43,800

Eunkyung Choi that day.

567
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,400
You've been working hard.

Fuel yourself.

570
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,359
In fact, you don't have to

571
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,760
think too much about
what happened that day.

572
00:25:15,479 --> 00:25:16,000
I saw you

573
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:17,839
doing leg workout.

574
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,959
I want to do more training

575
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:19,760
so as to hold her down

576
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:20,959
at the start-up.

577
00:25:21,719 --> 00:25:22,640
If she takes the lead
from the beginning,

578
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:24,599
I'm afraid I won't have any chance to
catch up with her.

579
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,520
That makes sense.

580
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:28,880
But you need to know

581
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:29,680
that 1500m race and

582
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,640
500m race are different.

583
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:32,719
Strength training is important,

584
00:25:32,719 --> 00:25:34,119
but endurance training
is more important.

585
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:35,560
The key to win

586
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,520
is sticking to the end while

587
00:25:37,719 --> 00:25:38,719
still having the energy to sprint.

588
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:41,239
Then what should I do?

589
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,280
You've got enough power.

590
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,880
What you need to do more
is endurance training.

591
00:25:48,719 --> 00:25:50,000
I want to add it to your workout plan.

592
00:25:51,199 --> 00:25:51,959
Sure.

593
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:52,920
I'll follow your instructions.

594
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,239
Then

595
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,839
let's do some extra endurance training

596
00:25:57,239 --> 00:25:58,119
after each day's workout.

597
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:00,000
Extra training?

598
00:26:01,239 --> 00:26:02,239
That may take up

599
00:26:02,239 --> 00:26:02,959
your resting time.

600
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,439
I'm fine. I can take it.

601
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,359
OK, let's start from today.

602
00:26:13,479 --> 00:26:14,520

606
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:27,640
That's fine.

607
00:26:28,239 --> 00:26:29,000
We can start another day

608

if you already have arrangement tonight.

609

The duration of endurance
training is long.

610
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:33,079
I'm just worried that

611
00:26:33,479 --> 00:26:34,640
we can't achieve the best result

612
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,800

613
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:42,040

615

No.

655

It's just that I left too much

of my homework.

Don't bother.

I'm fine watching you eat.

668

They are both for you!

669
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,599
Are you really not gonna eat?

670
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:41,000
Then I won't, either.

671
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:41,959
I will not allure you with the food.

672
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:44,359
But does your diet

673
00:30:44,479 --> 00:30:45,319
work?

674
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:46,640
You're being too harsh on yourself.

675
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,319
Of course diet works!

676
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,479
It can lower

677
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,800
my weight,

678
00:30:53,239 --> 00:30:54,280

To sum it up,

683
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:03,160
I must lose weight

and Quadruple Salchow.

00:31:11,719 --> 00:31:12,479
but we have not...

690
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:14,079
Shen Zhengyi?

702
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,040
You went on a date

703
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:52,599
or did construction work?

704
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,520
Do it if you can.

705
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,439
Sit there like this for 1 hour

706
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,280
without moving.

707
00:32:56,479 --> 00:32:57,040
I haven't moved

708
00:32:57,199 --> 00:32:57,599
for over one hour,

709
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,359
working on my script.

710
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,280
Flexible as I am!

711
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,520
No one forced you to do that.

712
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,359
You did it willingly,

713
00:33:03,479 --> 00:33:04,199
for love.

714
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:05,719
I just wanted to spend

715
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,079
more time with her.

716
00:33:08,479 --> 00:33:08,959
She trains till very late

717
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,119
every single day

718
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:11,520
and doesn't even

719
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,719
have the time to talk to me.

720
00:33:15,719 --> 00:33:16,520
In that sense,

721
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,079
she seems to spend more time
with her coach

722
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,640
than with me.

723
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,959
Are you jealous even

724
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,520
of her coach?

725
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,520
If you don't want

726
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,719
Shen Zhengyi to train with someone else,

727
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,920
you can go for it yourself.

728
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:31,079
Perhaps

729
00:33:31,199 --> 00:33:32,199
you two can make some progress together.

730
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:33,479
Right?

731
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:37,319
That makes sense.

732
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,920
Like you and Zhu Lele

733
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,719
can get together in the Drama Club

734
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,599
in the name of

735
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,359
organizing club events.

736
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,280
Right?

737
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,199
From now on, ask me no more about

738
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,359
your relationship with Shen Zhengyi.

739
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,370
(Auditorium)

740
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:01,000
Want a bet?

741
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,359
I'm on Ye An.

742
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:04,800
I'm on Zhu Lele.

743
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,639
Zhu Lele.

744
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,919
You know well about

745
00:34:11,439 --> 00:34:12,560
Zhu Lele's performance skills.

746
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,239
What's the relationship

747
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,000
between our President and Zhu Lele?

748
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,280
Don't you know?

749
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,000
His ex-girlfriend.

750
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,760
Well, that would also count as nepotism?

751
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:23,919
Naive.

752
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,600
What're you talking about?

753
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,280
We are reading the script.

754
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,040
We want to prepare in advance.

755
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,280
Reading the script or gloating?

756
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,800
I'm here!

757
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:38,959
How's everything going?

758
00:34:40,919 --> 00:34:41,719
Pretty good.

759
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,080
I've got confidence.

760
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,840
Hello, everyone.

761
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,959
Then, let's begin.

762
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,439
I have been painful and unrestful

763
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,919
each night since you left.

764
00:35:06,919 --> 00:35:08,199
Curling up in the bed,

765
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,280
I trembled.

766
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,280
The curtains were closed,

767
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,800
the table slanted,

768
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,399
and bread crumbled.

769
00:35:20,879 --> 00:35:22,479
The milk in the fridge went bad,

770
00:35:23,479 --> 00:35:24,800
the tap was leaking,

771
00:35:26,479 --> 00:35:27,959
and the watch ran out of power.

772
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,199
My tears were bitter,

773
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:34,159
running down for this endless farewell.

774
00:35:34,879 --> 00:35:36,120
But I won't go.

775
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:40,320
I'll wait for you by your side,

776
00:35:41,479 --> 00:35:42,679
hoping one day you would look back.

777
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:52,879
Splendid!

778
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,399
That's very contagious.

779
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:57,959
Now it's my turn.

780
00:36:00,479 --> 00:36:01,399
Have a seat.

781
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,600
Wait.

782
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:19,959
Change one.

783
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,199
Give us

784
00:36:22,399 --> 00:36:23,120
an improvisation

785
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:24,639
to make us understand

786
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,159
indisputably

787
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,600
about the situation you are in,

788
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,320
and the things you try to express.

789
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,399
That's all you need to do.

790
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,280
Wait.

791
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,919
I also prepared the same lines.

792
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,959
Why do I have to improvise?

793
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:36,199
It's not fair!

794
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,199
You can quit

795
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:40,199
if you think it's unfair.

796
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,600
Leave the competition.

797
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,320
Fine!

798
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,560
I'll do it anyway!

799
00:36:50,479 --> 00:36:51,760
Then think about
what you want to perform

800
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,000
and prepare yourself.

801
00:36:56,639 --> 00:36:57,479
Maybe you can act out

802
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,919
an episode of doing chores.

803
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:02,040
It's what you do for the President

804
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:03,560
every day.

805
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,120
I know what to perform.

806
00:37:18,199 --> 00:37:19,280
Aren't you at home?

807
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:57,080
See you at the cinema at 7:30 tonight.

808
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,360
Be there or be square.

809
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,520
Love from Wanwan.

810
00:39:00,959 --> 00:39:01,639
My performance is done.

811
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:02,959
How was it?

812
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,080
Nice, very nice.

813
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,239
I get it!

814
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,040
The deliveryman!

815
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:11,520
Although I don't know

816
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:12,800
how you managed to open the door

817
00:39:13,479 --> 00:39:14,600
and why you lingered there
after delivering the parcel.

818
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,520
You were peeking on
the lover letter of someone.

819
00:39:16,919 --> 00:39:18,520
And you got so touched by it

820
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:19,840
and started to believe in love again.

821
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,360
So you broke the door

822
00:39:21,479 --> 00:39:22,399
and went out to search for love.

823
00:39:22,919 --> 00:39:24,080
That's it!

824
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,120
You don't understand it at all!

825
00:39:28,919 --> 00:39:29,600
What I acted out

826
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:31,679
was a girl

827
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,679
who wanted to give her boyfriend

828
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,639
a surprise,

829
00:39:34,399 --> 00:39:35,840
and then realized he was not at home.

830
00:39:36,399 --> 00:39:37,840
So she tried to hide the present

831
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,399
when she discovered a note

832
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:42,840
saying

833
00:39:42,919 --> 00:39:44,120
he went to watch movies
with someone else.

834
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,800
So she felt

835
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:49,520
her boyfriend no longer loved her.

836
00:39:50,919 --> 00:39:52,360
Right, I got it.

837
00:39:52,479 --> 00:39:53,239
Exactly what it is supposed to mean.

838
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,639
Yes, that's what

839
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:56,919
I wanted to say.

840
00:39:59,040 --> 00:39:59,840
Ridiculous.

841
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:01,520
Wait.

842
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:02,840
How could she tell

843
00:40:02,919 --> 00:40:04,040
that her boyfriend no longer loved her
with a single piece of note?

844
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:05,520
How could you make sure

845
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:06,840
that her boyfriend did go to the movie

846
00:40:06,919 --> 00:40:07,800
with that girl?

847
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,840
But he kept the note in his home.

848
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:11,800
How would you explain that?

849
00:40:12,399 --> 00:40:13,639
He was being ambiguous.

850
00:40:14,919 --> 00:40:15,840
I didn't see that point.

851
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:17,399
So he is prohibited from
ordinary interaction with females?

852
00:40:17,919 --> 00:40:18,639
Wait! Wait!

853
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:19,639
President.

854
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:22,120
You are straying from the topic.

855
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,360
President.

856
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,760
You did go a little bit too far.

857
00:40:32,399 --> 00:40:33,120
Alright.

858
00:40:33,399 --> 00:40:34,639
Now both of us

859
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,520
have finished our performance.

860
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,080
Pick one.

861
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:51,919
Zhu Lele,

862
00:40:51,959 --> 00:40:52,919
you did make great progress this time.

863
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,399
But I'll leave the show to

864
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,080
Ye An to perform.

865
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:20,080
Then, maybe we

866
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:21,600
can start rehearsal now?

867
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:28,080
Lele!

868
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:29,399
- Lele!
- Lele! Le...

869
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,600
President,

870
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,040
you can catch up with her
if you go now.

871
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:35,800
Quick!

872
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,639
Hurry up!

873
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:38,600
President.

874
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,520
President, are you going or not?

875
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:44,040
Let's do the rehearsal first
if you are not going.

876
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:46,320
The female lead is here.

877
00:41:46,479 --> 00:41:47,520
And so is our male lead.

878
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,360
Right?

879
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,239
Let's rehearse first.

880
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,239
Who said I'd be the male lead?

881
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:55,479
Do your rehearsal.

882
00:41:56,239 --> 00:41:57,080
President!

883
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:00,520
What can we do now?

884
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,479
- I don't know.
- Let me have a try?

885
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,360
Come on!

886
00:42:04,479 --> 00:42:05,120
You?

887
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,040
Do it.

888
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,360
You still bother to...

889
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:29,919
Lele.

890
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:32,800
Why are you crying?

891
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,560
It has nothing to do with you.

892
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,439
Both of you are liars!

893
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:38,800
So annoying.
