=Episode 23=

3
00:01:47,279 --> 00:01:48,279
Shen Jiacheng.

4
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:53,720
Shen Jiacheng.

5
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,800
Darling.

6
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,040
What happened?

7
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,519
Zhengyi hasn't been back for so long.

8
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,599
What's the matter with her?

9
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:09,279
It's only two weeks.

10
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,520
It's normal for kids

11
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,399
to have some activities on weekends.

12
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,160
Maybe she'll come back this weekend.

13
00:02:15,839 --> 00:02:17,279
Do you have her coach's number?

14
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,520
You... Why do you want

15
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,399
her coach's number?

16
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,520
I'm just asking you whether

17
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:24,039
you have her coach's number.

18
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:26,960
Zhengyi is now in the

19
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:28,520
intense training phase.

20
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,160
Let's just leave her alone.

21
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:31,800
Well.

22
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:33,639
Why are you like this?

23
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,039
Do you think that

24
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:36,399
I am a particularly

25
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,800
unreasonable mother,

26
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:38,839
and I'm the obstacle

27
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,360
in our kid's way to grow up?

28
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,399
No.

29
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,279
It was you

30
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:44,720
who gave birth to Zhengyi.

31
00:02:44,839 --> 00:02:46,039
She is related to you by blood.

32
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,080
Your love to her

33
00:02:47,279 --> 00:02:49,520
is like an endless river.

34
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,039
She's too young to feel it now,

35
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,160
but she'll know when getting older.

36
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,839
But I've been thinking it over,

37
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,039
and I just cannot rest assured.

38
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,960
As for College Student Ice League,

39
00:02:59,399 --> 00:03:01,520
she promised me that she would
quit after the competition.

40
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,360
As a result, you and your daughter

41
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,039
fooled me around,

42
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,279
and it ended up with nothing definite.

43
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,080
But now,

44
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,039
she is going to attend the Ling Yun Cup

45
00:03:09,839 --> 00:03:11,160
for 1500-meter race.

46
00:03:11,839 --> 00:03:12,639
Shen Jiacheng.

47
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,520
Your daughter is not

48
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,720
just simply playing.

49
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,039
Yes, I know she likes skating.

50
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:17,720
And I am also

51
00:03:17,839 --> 00:03:18,919
entangled with it.

52
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:20,520
But I just cannot rest assured.

53
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,960
What if

54
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:22,839
something goes wrong?

55
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:24,839
This afternoon,

56
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:26,080
let's go pick her up,

57
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,039
and make her withdraw
from the team directly.

58
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,800
I cannot.

59
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,160
I have a meeting this afternoon.

60
00:03:30,839 --> 00:03:32,720
Why are you always busy
at the critical moment?

61
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,960
10 squats for one set.

62
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:43,919
Do 2 sets.

63
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,479
2 minutes for

64
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,360
one-leg support.

65
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:48,080
3 minutes for the best record.

66
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,160
Hello, who is it?

67
00:03:59,279 --> 00:03:59,919
Hello.

68
00:04:00,399 --> 00:04:01,199
Is this Coach Xiao?

69
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,720
I'm Zhengyi's father.

70
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,199
Coach Zhuang,

71
00:04:09,399 --> 00:04:10,080
I'll answer the phone.

72
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,479
Well,

73
00:04:13,839 --> 00:04:14,399
this afternoon,

74
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:15,960
Zhengyi's mother and I

75
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,160
have to come to school

76
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,519
to visit the team.
Is it okay?

77
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:20,079
Uncle and auntie,

78
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,920
you're going to visit the team today,

79
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,600
right?

80
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,799
Ok, I see.

81
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,079
Thank you.

82
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:42,200
Hello, Liu.

83
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,040
I will ask you a favor this afternoon.

84
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,559
I'll talk to you later. Okay.

85
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,040
Coach Zhuang,

86
00:04:57,679 --> 00:04:58,920
a reporter from the Sports Weekly

87
00:04:59,079 --> 00:04:59,720
told me that

88
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,959
he'd like to have an interview
with you this afternoon.

89
00:05:01,559 --> 00:05:02,160
So sudden?

90
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:02,799
What's it about?

91
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,079
Isn't Ling Yun Cup coming?

92
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,200
I think probably it's

93
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,200
about the preparation for Ling Yun Cup.

94
00:05:06,799 --> 00:05:07,799
I'll send you the outline later.

95
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:09,440
Alright.

96
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,160
Then let's continue.

97
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:13,040
Okay.

98
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,440
10 leg workouts in one set.

99
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:17,279
Do 2 sets as well.

100
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,720
Pushing off the ice
ten times in one set.

101
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:19,920
Do 2 sets as well.

102
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,960
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team of
Lingbei University)

103
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,680
Uncle and auntie,

104
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,519
this is the

105
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:26,920
locker room Zhengyi and
other players usually use.

106
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:29,679
Our off-ice training room
is in the front.

107
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:38,320
Why are uncle and auntie here?

108
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:41,679
Oh no.

109
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:56,880
Beisheng.

110
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,320
Come over here.

111
00:05:59,200 --> 00:05:59,880
What's up?

112
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:02,839
The time of arrival of Curry

113
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:03,720
has almost been settled.

114
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:04,640
Just the following week after

115
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,359
Ling Yun Cup ends.

116
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:06,640
Is the news accurate?

117
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:07,760
80% accurate.

118
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,000
Alright.

119
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:10,720
I'll waste no time in practicing.

120
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:11,880
Fighting!

121
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:17,119
Please help me.

122
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:18,239
My mom came to school.

123
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:20,440
Well, Ma.

124
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,239
I'll take a leave.

125
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,839
Didn't you just say to
waste no time in practicing?

126
00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:23,600
Right, but...

127
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:24,959
Zhengyi's mother comes to school.

128
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:25,839
What if her mother

129
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,839
insists to make her

130
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,119
withdraw from the team?

131
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,600
I'll practice as soon as I get back.

132
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,559
I am leaving.

133
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:32,559
- You...
- Bye.

134
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,600
Uncle and auntie, please come in.

135
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:36,920
This is our

136
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Off-ice Training Room.

137
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,760
Our training is

138
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:41,640
divided into morning session
and afternoon session.

139
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,399
Half of it is on the ice,

140
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:43,480
and half of it is off the ice.

141
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,119
Then except the time for courses,

142
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:46,760
our training time

143
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,799
is about 5 hours.

144
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,359
Because Ling Yun Cup is coming,

145
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,040
so our training time

146
00:06:51,239 --> 00:06:51,760
has been increased to

147
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,000
over 6 hours.

148
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:54,640
Good, good.

149
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,720
The facilities are better than

150
00:06:58,799 --> 00:06:59,640
we used to have.

151
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,880
Not only the facilities are good,

152
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,760
our support is also good.

153
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,880
Our training methods,

154
00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:04,760
safeguard procedures

155
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,880
and all kinds of safety equipment

156
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,760
are all in place.

157
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:08,119
Zhengyi in the Wind Chaser...

158
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,279
Coach Xiao.

159
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,119
How many players do you have here?

160
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:13,279
We have a total of 15 players

161
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,279
in the team.

162
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,640
Several senior players
in the senior year

163
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,519
are going to retire.

164
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,720
There are about six new players

165
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,160
who were recruited

166
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:19,000
together with Zhengyi.

167
00:07:19,359 --> 00:07:20,399
That is sufficient...

168
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:22,399
So it won't

169
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,720
make a difference

170
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:25,600
without Zhengyi.

171
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,359
Zhengyi's mother.

172
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,799
Zhengyi has a great potential

173
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,920
and she is talented.

174
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,760
She has great power.

175
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:31,880
The team is going to train her

176
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,279
as the key player.

177
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,640
Coach Xiao,

178
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,600
both of us were

179
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,720
athletes.

180
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,880
The so-called talent

181
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,279
can be only used to fool the outsiders.

182
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,239
There are so many talented athletes,

183
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,799
but how many of them can reach the top?

184
00:07:43,239 --> 00:07:43,799
And I don't think

185
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,519
our Zhengyi

186
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,760
has to follow this path.

187
00:07:46,119 --> 00:07:46,799
So I am coming here

188
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:48,760
to make her withdraw from the team.

189
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:51,399
Mom, why are you here?

190
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,640
No, I don't withdraw from the team.

191
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,519
Now I am

192
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,760
getting better and better.

193
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,359
Because you're getting
better and better,

194
00:07:58,399 --> 00:07:59,880
so I am more worried.

195
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,119
It doesn't matter that you just

196
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,880
learn skating in the team before.

197
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:04,040
But as you're getting
better and better,

198
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,279
going higher and higher,

199
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:06,640
you will want the glory
more than anyone.

200
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,760
But you have to understand

201
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,880
there's only one winner.

202
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,720
So many people are victims.

203
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,799
Don't you get it?

204
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,359
Even if I don't win that medal,

205
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:14,000
I don't think

206
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,399
I'm the victim.

207
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,000
That's because

208
00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:16,920
you don't have that chance and

209
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,399
the ability to win.

210
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:19,519
Why don't I have the ability

211
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,799
and chance?

212
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,399
The answer is no.

213
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:24,279
I don't think so.

214
00:08:50,719 --> 00:08:51,719
Hello, Beisheng.

215
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,440
Mom, where are you now?

216
00:08:54,479 --> 00:08:55,119
I am outside.

217
00:08:55,239 --> 00:08:55,919
What happened?

218
00:08:56,479 --> 00:08:57,320
Zhengyi's mom is here.

219
00:08:57,719 --> 00:08:58,599
She might probably

220
00:08:58,719 --> 00:08:59,799
make Zhengyi withdraw from the team.

221
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,679
What shall we do now?

222
00:09:01,359 --> 00:09:01,919
Don't worry.

223
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,719
I'll be right back.

224
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:04,200
Okay, I'll hang up.

225
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:15,719
Auntie.

226
00:09:16,359 --> 00:09:17,119
I have the ability

227
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,599
and the chance to win.

228
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,320
But I never thought that

229
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:21,719
the one who lost is the victim.

230
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,039
I don't know why you

231
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,840
oppose Shen Zhengyi to practice
short track speed skating.

232
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,320
But anyway,

233
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,320
I'm on her side.

234
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:46,479
To be honest,

235
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,960
at first

236
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,440
I didn't really like Shen Zhengyi.

237
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,039
She was just an amateur.

238
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,320
Why can she get into Wind Chaser

239
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:53,719
and train with

240
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,599
the professional players?

241
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,320
I didn't even want to admit that

242
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,599
she was my teammate.

243
00:10:00,719 --> 00:10:01,599
But later,

244
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,440
the way Zhengyi practiced
on the skating rink

245
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,359
has completely changed my view of her.

246
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,080
She is a person who will try her best

247
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,320
for short track speed skating.

248
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:10,239
She just took

249
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,599
a few months

250
00:10:11,719 --> 00:10:12,679
to become a

251
00:10:12,719 --> 00:10:13,679
professional player,

252
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:16,080
and she won a silver medal
for Wind Chaser.

253
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,479
All of us recognize her

254
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:20,599
and respect her.

255
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,200
Shen Zhengyi now

256
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,080
is an integral part of Wind Chaser.

257
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,080
I don't agree her quitting.

258
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,359
You are Zhengyi's good friend?

259
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,440
We're teammates.

260
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,719
We both practice

261
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,840
1500-meter race.

262
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,840
I used to have one teammate

263
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,559
who practiced1500-meter race with me.

264
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,440
She admired me at that time,

265
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,840
and I trusted her.

266
00:10:52,599 --> 00:10:53,960
Once, we attended a competition

267
00:10:54,719 --> 00:10:56,320
and sprinted on the
track at the same time.

268
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:57,599
I was one step away

269
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,080
from winning the championship.

270
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,320
But at the last minute,

271
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:02,479
she betrayed her teammate

272
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,320
in order to win the championship,

273
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,320
and I was carried off the track

274
00:11:06,719 --> 00:11:08,200
and could never come back.

275
00:11:14,599 --> 00:11:16,080
Now I want to ask you something.

276
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,960
If Zhengyi has a chance to win,

277
00:11:19,359 --> 00:11:20,359
will you give this chance

278
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,320
to her?

279
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,679
Will you assist her

280
00:11:22,719 --> 00:11:23,840
sincerely?

281
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:33,960
Can you do that?

282
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,239
Winning the championship

283
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:39,200
is always about the abilities.

284
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:40,320
As long as she's better than me,

285
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:41,359
I have no problem with it.

286
00:11:43,239 --> 00:11:44,119
Everyone knows

287
00:11:45,599 --> 00:11:46,359
such good words.

288
00:11:46,599 --> 00:11:47,320
Mom, why are you...

289
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,200
Don't say like that.

290
00:11:48,719 --> 00:11:50,039
Darling, you...

291
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,919
Then I also have a question

292
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,960
to ask.

293
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,960
You just said that

294
00:11:54,359 --> 00:11:55,679
you cannot get back to the rink

295
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,960
because of the

296
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,080
betrayal of your teammate.

297
00:11:58,559 --> 00:11:59,320
But did her betrayal

298
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,840
make you regret

299
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,440
that you chose
Short Track Speed Skating?

300
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:11,960
Mom.

301
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,719
Just let me stay in Wind Chaser.

302
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,719
I really, really like skating.

303
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,200
Auntie, I'm begging you.

304
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,919
Auntie, I promise

305
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:23,960
such thing

306
00:12:24,239 --> 00:12:24,840
will not happen in

307
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:25,679
Wind Chaser.

308
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,400
What happened?

309
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:47,239
What happened? Don't cry.

310
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,400
It's okay.

311
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,640
Where's your mom?

312
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:50,559
She left?

313
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,760
She went back to the dorm

314
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,799
to pack my things.

315
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:55,359
She asked me to calm down

316
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:56,400
before seeing her.

317
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,280
That's fine.

318
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,280
Zhengyi, we'll have a solution.

319
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,760
Her mother told her to
withdraw from the team?

320
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,280
Coach Zhuang,

321
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,000
my mom finally let me get into

322
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,520
Wind Chaser Short Track Team.

323
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,159
What did you say?

324
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,520
My mom finally let me get into

325
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,159
Wind Chaser Short Track Team.

326
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:12,880
Why didn't you say it earlier?

327
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,239
Such a happy...

328
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,359
Such a happy thing.

329
00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:15,919
Why are you crying?

330
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:17,359
Isn't that too exciting for me?

331
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:18,760
You scared me.

332
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,679
You scared me.

333
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,159
Alright.

334
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:24,760
It's so difficult!

335
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:29,880
Stop crying.

336
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,280
Alright, alright.

337
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,520
I'll bring you the sheets

338
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,760
after washing them.

339
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:39,760
Mom.

340
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,039
Thank you today.

341
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:45,760
You are so

342
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,760
like me.

343
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,359
Never turn back and regret

344
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,919
what you have decided.

345
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,039
Don't worry.

346
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:56,400
I will win you

347
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,520
the gold medal of

348
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,559
1500-meter race.

349
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:04,039
For mom,

350
00:14:04,479 --> 00:14:05,119
the gold medal

351
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:06,799
is far less important than your safety.

352
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,159
When you're on the rink,

353
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,400
you have to trust

354
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,159
your teammate.

355
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,359
Make sure that your teammate
also trusts you.

356
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,359
Okay?

357
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:14,799
I know.

358
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,640
Well, I'd better get going,

359
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:17,880
your dad is waiting.

360
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:19,479
Be careful.

361
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,280
Just go.

362
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,559
Goodbye, mommy.

363
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,760
Bye.

364
00:14:33,359 --> 00:14:34,280
Come in.

365
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,479
You're here.

366
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:41,559
Shen Zhengyi?

367
00:14:48,359 --> 00:14:49,159
Here's some snacks for you.

368
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,919
Thank you today.

369
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,640
If you haven't supported me,

370
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:55,760
I don't know

371
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:57,119
how long I have to persuade my mom.

372
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,119
We're all on the same team.

373
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,159
We should help each other.

374
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:04,000
I was quite surprised

375
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,880
about the experience of your mom.

376
00:15:07,359 --> 00:15:09,000
For the question she asked today,

377
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,280
what's your answer

378
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,159
if you were me?

379
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:16,760
Same as you.

380
00:15:17,479 --> 00:15:18,880
Whoever has the abilities shall
get the champion.

381
00:15:33,239 --> 00:15:33,840
Actually, I think

382
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,599
I really

383
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,119
misjudged Luo Xiaoyi before.

384
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,000
She's actually nice.

385
00:15:38,359 --> 00:15:39,640
But you said that before

386
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,440
she offended a lot of people

387
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,760
because of the withdrawal from training.

388
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,679
She's suddenly nice to you this time,

389
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,799
there might be a conspiracy.

390
00:15:46,239 --> 00:15:47,479
What kind of conspiracy could there be?

391
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:48,919
She is already the best

392
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:49,760
in the team.

393
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:51,159
Why does she have a conspiracy on me?

394
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:53,039
And so many senior players

395
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:54,159
have been convinced by her,

396
00:15:54,239 --> 00:15:54,640
which means that

397
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,000
she must have something excellent.

398
00:15:56,119 --> 00:15:56,799
Alright, alright.

399
00:15:57,599 --> 00:15:58,280
It's been a long time since

400
00:15:58,359 --> 00:15:58,880
we went out on a date,

401
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,400
why are you always
talking about Luo Xiaoyi?

402
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,880
Are you jealous?

403
00:16:02,359 --> 00:16:03,479
I'm jealous of everyone.

404
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:06,640
I ask you a question.

405
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:07,640
If Zhu Lele and I

406
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,359
fall into the water at the same time,

407
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,280
who will you save?

408
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,400
You have hesitated.

409
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:13,640
You have hesitated.

410
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,760
You have hesitated to answer
such a question?

411
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,119
But I have to think about it.

412
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,000
You ask me.

413
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,280
- If I and Qu...
- I will save you.

414
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:24,960
No matter who falls in the water,

415
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:25,919
I will save you.

416
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:27,320
Don't you be ashamed?

417
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,679
Learn from me, okay?

418
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:33,599
If Zhu Lele and I

419
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:34,159
fall into the water at the same time,

420
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,000
who will you save?

421
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,640
You have hesitated again.

422
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:41,400
Zhu Lele.

423
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:52,740
(Wind Chaser Ice Sports Team of
Lingbei University)

424
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,719
From now on,

425
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,119
Shen Zhengyi has joined

426
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:55,880
tactical cooperation training

427
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,919
of 1500-meter race officially.

428
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,880
There are four players now.

429
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,119
For tactical cooperation training,

430
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,119
two persons are in one group.

431
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,000
Excuse me!

432
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:05,920
Coach.

433
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,400
I want to partner with Zhu Lele,

434
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,160
okay?

435
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,640
Zhu Lele is still a new player.

436
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,880
It's best to let the senior player

437
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,800
partner with the new player.

438
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,400
Coach Zhuang, what do you think?

439
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,640
It's alright.

440
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,359
Let them try.

441
00:17:17,719 --> 00:17:18,640
- Thank you, Coach Zhuang.
- Thank you, Coach Zhuang.

442
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,520
Alright.

443
00:17:20,719 --> 00:17:21,280
Get prepared.

444
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,359
Later we'll practice

445
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,000
battling in groups.

446
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,359
Dismiss.

447
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,400
Fighting, Zhengyi!

448
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,280
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

449
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,680
Fighting, Zhengyi!

450
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,680
Fighting, Xiaoyi!

451
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,680
Fighting, Lele!

452
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,920
Fighting, Xiaoyi!

453
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,000
Fighting, Zhengyi!

454
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,359
Among them, Zhu Lele is the weakest

455
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:11,280
in the overall strength.

456
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,439
Shen Zhengyi came first
once she started skating.

457
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,359
She couldn't keep up with her

458
00:18:13,479 --> 00:18:14,239
and assist her at all.

459
00:18:14,239 --> 00:18:15,800
Shen Zhengyi, leave me alone.

460
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,119
They're coming up.

461
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,920
Zhengyi, fighting!

462
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,079
Xiaoyi, fighting!

463
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:25,119
Pay attention to the cooperation.

464
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,800
The following two groups are great.

465
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,800
Keep going.

466
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:29,560
(Luo Xiaoyi.)

467
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,560
(I'll show you what I can do.)

468
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:39,319
Come over here.

469
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:45,760
What were you doing?

470
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:48,439
Luo Xiaoyi, Liu Sisi.

471
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:49,479
What about your cooperation?

472
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,319
You all felt yourself outstanding,

473
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:53,479
and just went forth.

474
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:54,719
What about your team spirit?

475
00:18:56,199 --> 00:18:56,959
Shen Zhengyi.

476
00:18:57,479 --> 00:18:58,479
Do you know about your teammate?

477
00:18:58,719 --> 00:18:59,680
Do you know how to work with her?

478
00:19:00,199 --> 00:19:01,599
You just knew to go forth yourself.

479
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:04,319
Both of you

480
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:07,119
are senior players that have attended

481
00:19:07,239 --> 00:19:07,959
a lot of competitions.

482
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:09,000
What were you doing?

483
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:11,719
What's the difference
between you and new players?

484
00:19:14,239 --> 00:19:15,680
Zhu Lele, why were you shouting out?

485
00:19:15,719 --> 00:19:16,839
Are you just a bystander?

486
00:19:21,439 --> 00:19:22,000
For four of you,

487
00:19:22,479 --> 00:19:23,119
20 laps as a penalty

488
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,599
after the training.

489
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,000
- Got it.
- Got it.

490
00:19:27,239 --> 00:19:28,119
Just continue.

491
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:46,959
Hang on.

492
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,760
We are about to finish.

493
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:48,560
Let's go.

494
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:49,760
I won't run anymore.

495
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:50,560
What?

496
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,439
Wang Fang and others said that

497
00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:53,479
I am not suitable to partner with you.

498
00:19:54,479 --> 00:19:55,280
I also know

499
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,280
it's my fault

500
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,520
to hold you back.

501
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,119
Don't listen to them.

502
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,479
Don't you forget that

503
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,599
we are twins in Wind Chaser?

504
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,800
You and I

505
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,520
cannot be separate.

506
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,719
Hurry up!

507
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,400
You just think it so good.

508
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:07,959
Now everyone says I can't,

509
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:09,560
and I also know I can't.

510
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,839
What's the use of

511
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,760
your recognition for me?

512
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:13,119
It is no use running.

513
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:15,239
You're thinking too much.

514
00:20:15,479 --> 00:20:16,599
Why are you listening to them?

515
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:18,439
It's our first time working together.

516
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,239
More practice

517
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:21,359
will work, right?

518
00:20:22,479 --> 00:20:23,599
It's no use refusing to run now.

519
00:20:23,719 --> 00:20:25,079
Can you skate faster in this way?

520
00:20:25,239 --> 00:20:25,839
Hurry up!

521
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:27,719
They're running there.

522
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,680
We will be scolded later.

523
00:20:28,719 --> 00:20:30,079
Hurry up.

524
00:20:30,239 --> 00:20:31,239
Hurry up.

525
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,520
Shen Zhengyi.

526
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,199
Luo Xiaoyi.

527
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,319
What's up?

528
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,000
The tactical cooperation
for 1500-meter race

529
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:48,880
is very important.

530
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,400
Have you ever considered

531
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,000
changing your partner?

532
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,760
Change my partner?

533
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,760
Right.

534
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:55,880
You and Zhu Lele

535
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,119
are new players.

536
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:57,880
You don't

537
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,280
have as much

538
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,319
experience as senior players.

539
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,839
Moreover,

540
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:02,079
there are some problems with

541
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:03,280
your cooperation.

542
00:21:03,479 --> 00:21:04,560
I don't think you can

543
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,000
improve if it goes on like this.

544
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,560
If you want to improve,

545
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,079
I can lead you.

546
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:12,359
You lead me?

547
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,400
But in general,

548
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,800
I don't think I can

549
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:17,880
partner with you.

550
00:21:19,239 --> 00:21:20,520
Don't underestimate yourself.

551
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:21,839
You are not bad.

552
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,280
Besides,

553
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,719
you'll improve very quickly

554
00:21:25,239 --> 00:21:26,319
when partnering with me.

555
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:28,640
Thank you for your kindness.

556
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:29,920
No, thanks.

557
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:30,920
Zhu Lele and I

558
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,040
cooperate quite well.

559
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:32,760
And the two of us

560
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:34,079
are best friends.

561
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:35,000
Shen Zhengyi.

562
00:21:35,239 --> 00:21:36,280
This is a competitive sport.

563
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,359
It's not about partnering with someone

564
00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:38,280
who gets along well with you.

565
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:39,599
I know it.

566
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,719
But...

567
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:54,560
(Recruitment Information
for HR Assistant)

568
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,359
Recently, you've been so active to

569
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,959
befriend Shen Zhengyi.

570
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,839
It's none of your business.

571
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:18,839
Right.

572
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,760
I'm retiring soon.

573
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,359
It's none of my business.

574
00:22:21,959 --> 00:22:22,760
However,

575
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:25,560
if Shen Zhengyi will not assist you

576
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,599
after I left,

577
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,520
what will you do?

578
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:28,560
You might not get the gold medal

579
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,680
of Asian Cup.

580
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:33,319
That's none of your business.

581
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,680
Just worry about your work.

582
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,079
There are

583
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:38,599
a handful of jobs that fit me.

584
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:40,040
However,

585
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,800
I am actually worried about you.

586
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,079
I've never seen a player

587
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:43,920
like Shen Zhengyi who

588
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,520
has made the progress so fast.

589
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:46,760
Do you think

590
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,560
she would still

591
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,119
assist you sincerely

592
00:22:50,199 --> 00:22:51,760
if she outperforms you?

593
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:53,599
I'm looking forward to

594
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,520
that day.

595
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,560
That's true.

596
00:22:58,119 --> 00:22:59,119
Maybe there won't be

597
00:22:59,199 --> 00:22:59,920
that day.

598
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,160
Because no matter what happens,

599
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,920
Coach Xiao will help you.

600
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,119
However,

601
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,319
I think Coach Xiao

602
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:07,040
treats Shen Zhengyi

603
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,040
so well.

604
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:09,880
Don't you think that

605
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,119
Coach Xiao will be on

606
00:23:11,199 --> 00:23:12,599
Shen Zhengyi's side one day?

607
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:42,800
Lele.

608
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,359
Don't take what Luo Xiaoyi said

609
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,760
seriously.

610
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:48,199
She's really good.

611
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:49,280
But,

612
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,680
we have practiced very hard, too.

613
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,119
Let's practice

614
00:23:52,239 --> 00:23:53,359
more together.

615
00:23:57,199 --> 00:23:57,839
Zhengyi.

616
00:23:58,439 --> 00:23:59,719
Don't encourage me.

617
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:04,599
I want to go out by myself.

618
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,560
Lele.

619
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,560
I'm okay.

620
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,119
Ma, you see.

621
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:21,760
There's something wrong with this move.

622
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
The landing is unbalanced.

623
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:30,119
It's really great.

624
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,680
You are quite good.

625
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:34,439
I think the previous moves are alright.

626
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:36,119
But it's going to be great

627
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,359
if this Triple Axel Jump

628
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,560
can be changed to Quadruple Jump.

629
00:24:40,199 --> 00:24:41,280
You are in a hurry.

630
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:41,760
This...

631
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,920
This is supposed to be a new show.

632
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:43,959
What's the hurry?

633
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,959
I'm running out of time.

634
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:46,719
Curry is about to come soon.

635
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,479
So I need to master

636
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,280
Quadruple Jump.

637
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,439
Haste makes waste.

638
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,719
You should calm down.

639
00:24:57,359 --> 00:24:58,239
I will practice some more.

640
00:24:59,079 --> 00:24:59,680
I will practice some more.

641
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,199
There's nothing I can do about you.

642
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,280
Just one more time.

643
00:25:02,479 --> 00:25:03,359
Okay.

644
00:25:11,239 --> 00:25:12,000
Come on.

645
00:25:27,239 --> 00:25:28,040
(I'll practice some more today,)

646
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,479
(I'll see you later.)

647
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:31,199
Zhengyi.

648
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,400
Coach Xiao.

649
00:25:35,719 --> 00:25:36,560
You are alone today?

650
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:40,079
Where's Lele?

651
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,000
She is in the dorm.

652
00:25:42,479 --> 00:25:42,920
What happened?

653
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,079
You have quarreled with her?

654
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,119
No.

655
00:25:45,719 --> 00:25:46,560
Because we

656
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:47,839
haven't cooperated so well recently,

657
00:25:48,479 --> 00:25:49,599
she is quite anxious

658
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:51,560
and wants to be alone.

659
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:53,040
I can understand.

660
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:54,239
Two best friends

661
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:55,479
promised to improve together.

662
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:56,800
But when she has realized
she couldn't keep up,

663
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,800
she is really upset.

664
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,560
I think that tactical cooperation

665
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:03,119
is a lot more difficult than
practicing techniques.

666
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:04,160
Of course.

667
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,000
Practicing techniques

668
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:06,079
is your personal matter.

669
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,560
But for tactical cooperation,

670
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,079
you have to fit in with your teammate.

671
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,560
The good relationship between you

672
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:11,359
will not be enough.

673
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,839
Your experience,

674
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,839
reaction capacity, skills,

675
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,599
and comprehensive ability,

676
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,560
even personality differences

677
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,040
will make an impact on

678
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:18,160
your partnership.

679
00:26:18,719 --> 00:26:19,719
So what's the solution?

680
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,760
Either you cooperate with her,

681
00:26:21,239 --> 00:26:22,079
or she cooperates with you.

682
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:23,400
You are a player

683
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,319
with great power.

684
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,880
It's difficult for Zhu Lele

685
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,839
to keep up with you.

686
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:28,920
Then I'll try to get used to her,

687
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:29,920
okay?

688
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:30,839
What about your strength?

689
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:32,280
Then it's all gone.

690
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,560
Zhu Lele is a

691
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,040
player with mediocre skills.

692
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,479
She is just an average player

693
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,479
in the same team with you.

694
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,479
In College Student Ice League,

695
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:41,719
she didn't even make it to the finals.

696
00:26:42,239 --> 00:26:42,640
So if you want to

697
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,000
skate to the pace of Zhu Lele,

698
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:46,119
it may be difficult for you to improve.

699
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:48,199
What can I do?

700
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:49,400
I don't want to change my partner.

701
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,119
And we agree

702
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,040
to skate together.

703
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,160
What about your goal?

704
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,119
Don't you want to win the gold medal?

705
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:57,359
Zhengyi.

706
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,520
If you want to improve,

707
00:26:58,839 --> 00:26:59,319
you should partner with

708
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,640
someone better.

709
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,479
Go talk to Lele.

710
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:05,560
Aren't you two best friends?

711
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:07,640
The last thing

712
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,560
best friends want to see

713
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,239
is the sacrifice for each other.

714
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,839
Go talk to Lele.

715
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:27,319
Your dishes are all ready, Sir.

716
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:28,479
Okay. Thanks.

717
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,719
Enjoy your meal.

718
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:36,920
Don't think too much.

719
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:38,599
I trust you.

720
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:39,839
You can do it.

721
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,079
What's the use of trusting me?

722
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:43,839
That's where my ability lies.

723
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,520
I don't skate well.

724
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:47,239
It's also my problem.

725
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,640
Why was I trying to

726
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:49,880
partner with Zhengyi?

727
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,280
She is a talented player
and a hard worker.

728
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,319
I'm just an average one on the rink.

729
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:56,719
No matter how hard I try,

730
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,000
I'm holding others back.

731
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
No, no.

732
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:01,239
What are you talking about?

733
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,479
My girlfriend

734
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:05,119
cannot be an average one!

735
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,239
In my eyes,

736
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,560
you're the brightest star

737
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:09,079
on the rink.

738
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:12,319
I'm not in the mood

739
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,760
to joke with you right now.

740
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,040
Don't talk nonsense.

741
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:21,079
Forget it.

742
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:22,239
Anyway, I don't like

743
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:23,040
Short Track Speed Skating.

744
00:28:23,479 --> 00:28:24,880
I can just fool around
for a couple of years.

745
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:26,560
No way.

746
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,359
I'm still waiting

747
00:28:27,479 --> 00:28:28,079
to show off to Shao Beisheng

748
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,359
when you win the gold medal.

749
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,920
You've been skating for years,

750
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:32,119
how could you not like it?

751
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:33,839
I said that

752
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,839
I don't like it.

753
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:38,479
You like it.

754
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,560
You like

755
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:40,640
Short Track Speed Skating the best.

756
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,599
I know it.

757
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,560
You, Shao Beisheng

758
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,719
and Shen Zhengyi

759
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,719
are the same.

760
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,640
When Shao Beisheng got injured,

761
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:48,319
he just switched the item,

762
00:28:48,719 --> 00:28:50,040
abandoned all the glory

763
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:50,920
of Figure Skating prince,

764
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:52,319
and started from zero.

765
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,839
So is Shen Zhengyi.

766
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,760
When she got into Wind Chaser
without any formal training,

767
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:56,839
so many people were

768
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,119
waiting to see her failure.

769
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,400
But she never cared about it.

770
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,839
She can do it,

771
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:02,560
then why can't you?

772
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:04,839
You all like

773
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,760
Short Track Speed Skating.

774
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:06,599
But you just

775
00:29:06,719 --> 00:29:08,119
ran into a little trouble now.

776
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,920
Would you please be quiet?

777
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:11,839
I don't want to hear

778
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,839
such words now.

779
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:13,800
Understand?

780
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:17,000
Lele,

781
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:18,760
you can't escape.

782
00:29:19,239 --> 00:29:19,800
Escape

783
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,160
is not the solution.

784
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,359
It's like we're in a relationship.

785
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,640
You don't tell anyone today,

786
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:26,920
and you don't tell anyone tomorrow.

787
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:28,319
But sooner or later,

788
00:29:28,479 --> 00:29:29,400
you have to tell others.

789
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:30,640
You cannot just

790
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,839
hide it all the way.

791
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:34,319
So is your passion for
Short Track Speed Skating.

792
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:35,719
Go for it if you like it.

793
00:29:36,479 --> 00:29:37,239
You can't lie to yourself

794
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:38,160
that you don't like it.

795
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,079
Lele.

796
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,079
You cannot always escape.

797
00:29:47,479 --> 00:29:48,599
You do like it.

798
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:50,079
I told you I don't like it.

799
00:29:50,239 --> 00:29:51,280
I mean it.

800
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,079
What are you doing? We're in the public.

801
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,280
There are others watching.

802
00:29:59,439 --> 00:30:00,040
Just sit down.

803
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,079
Sit down first.

804
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:06,880
Look.

805
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,119
You don't like it today,

806
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:09,040
which doesn't represent you...

807
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:09,920
I don't like it today,

808
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:10,839
and I don't like it tomorrow.

809
00:30:10,959 --> 00:30:11,959
I don't like it

810
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:13,119
every day in my life.

811
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,959
I'm telling you for the last time.

812
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,880
I just don't like
Short Track Speed Skating.

813
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,439
You can't say so.

814
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,199
You've skated for so many years.

815
00:30:20,439 --> 00:30:20,959
If you don't like it...

816
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,160
Qu Zhi, I'm warning you that

817
00:30:22,479 --> 00:30:23,400
if you try to convince me again,

818
00:30:23,479 --> 00:30:24,839
I don't even like you anymore.

819
00:30:31,199 --> 00:30:32,199
Don't be angry.

820
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,319
You can say that
you don't like everything,

821
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,239
but except me.

822
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,560
I don't like you. I mean it.

823
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,319
Why are you so annoying?

824
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,920
What do you mean?

825
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,479
What are you doing?

826
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,479
Let me ask you.

827
00:30:50,199 --> 00:30:53,160
Do you want to break up with me?

828
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,640
We are in the public.

829
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:56,079
Why are you talking about that again?

830
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:57,040
Let go of me.

831
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,560
Do you want to break up with me?

832
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,760
Do you?

833
00:31:01,959 --> 00:31:03,280
Do you?

834
00:31:04,199 --> 00:31:05,040
Are you questioning me?

835
00:31:05,479 --> 00:31:07,920
I ask you yes or no?

836
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,359
Yes.

837
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:24,280
So you don't escape from

838
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,040
telling others about our relationship,

839
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,359
and you never want to tell others.

840
00:31:28,439 --> 00:31:29,079
Right?

841
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:31,119
I'm just

842
00:31:31,479 --> 00:31:31,959
your backup boyfriend

843
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:33,479
for a breakup.

844
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,599
Waitress, check out please.

845
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,199
Qu Zhi.

846
00:32:26,959 --> 00:32:28,599
(My girlfriend)

847
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,079
(cannot be an average one!)

848
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,280
(In my eyes,)

849
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,560
(you're the brightest star)

850
00:32:32,959 --> 00:32:34,400
(on the rink.)

851
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,719
You do like it.

852
00:32:39,239 --> 00:32:40,000
You like

853
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:41,119
Short Track Speed Skating the best.

854
00:32:41,479 --> 00:32:42,560
You are the same as them,

855
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,359
and you like it very much.

856
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,079
But you just

857
00:32:45,199 --> 00:32:46,880
ran into a little trouble now.

858
00:32:52,199 --> 00:32:52,920
Zhengyi.

859
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,520
You're back.

860
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,479
What's wrong with you?

861
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,560
Do I say

862
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,239
anything hurtful sometimes?

863
00:33:16,439 --> 00:33:18,239
Actually I like
Short Track Speed Skating.

864
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:20,719
I like it very much.

865
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,640
I really, really like it.

866
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,119
But I don't know

867
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,439
what's wrong with me lately.

868
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,239
I just don't want to work hard anymore,

869
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,319
and want to give up.

870
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:40,359
I really

871
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,760
want to partner with you.

872
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:46,880
But I'm afraid that my ability

873
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,719
will hold you back.

874
00:33:49,719 --> 00:33:51,359
Don't say that.

875
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,000
We are best friends.

876
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:55,040
That must be the two of us

877
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,680
that work best together.

878
00:33:56,959 --> 00:33:58,280
Everybody knows that, too.

879
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:01,199
I think you've been

880
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:02,439
listening to them

881
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:03,560
a lot lately.

882
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:05,520
You're putting too much
pressure on yourself.

883
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,000
So it's really

884
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,120
my own problem.

885
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:14,840
I just

886
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,879
did not work hard enough,
was not determined,

887
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,000
and confident enough.

888
00:34:21,479 --> 00:34:22,080
And I should

889
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,080
have believed you.

890
00:34:25,479 --> 00:34:26,199
It's okay.

891
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,199
I will work harder.

892
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,520
Trust me.

893
00:34:32,959 --> 00:34:34,159
I will stand by your side

894
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,320
with my own efforts.

895
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,560
Fighting!

896
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:54,760
The group list of Ling Yun Cup

897
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,959
preliminary has settled.

898
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:58,320
Luo Xiaoyi and Zhu Lele
are in one group.

899
00:35:00,399 --> 00:35:02,639
Shen Zhengyi and Liu Sisi
are in one group.

900
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,000
Later, we'll train

901
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,080
according to the preliminary groups.

902
00:35:08,399 --> 00:35:10,159
Today we mainly practice
tactical cooperation.

903
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,120
I hope

904
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,200
before you are on the rink,

905
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,080
you can discuss who the main one is,

906
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,879
and who the assisting one is.

907
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,399
Make it clear before
going on the rink, okay?

908
00:35:18,959 --> 00:35:19,719
Okay, get prepared.

909
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,399
Dismiss.

910
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,159
Let's change the shoes.

911
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:37,919
What shall I do?

912
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,320
I and Luo Xiaoyi are in one group.

913
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,159
Will I get scolded?

914
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:42,639
No way.

915
00:35:42,959 --> 00:35:44,080
She's not that scary.

916
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,120
You just have to do your best.

917
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:49,679
Shen Zhengyi

918
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,000
has made a lot of progress.

919
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,679
She's as good as you are now.

920
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,320
I'm wrong.

921
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,120
She's already better than you.

922
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:57,479
Do you think

923
00:35:57,479 --> 00:35:58,919
you can still stand out?

924
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:14,320
Liu Sisi didn't want to

925
00:36:14,399 --> 00:36:15,639
assist me,

926
00:36:15,879 --> 00:36:17,040
she will not assist you either.

927
00:36:18,439 --> 00:36:19,520
Wait and see.

928
00:36:39,919 --> 00:36:40,760
Ready.

929
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,280
Fighting!

930
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,679
Shen Zhengyi, keep going!

931
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,520
Pay attention to your pace.

932
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,560
If Shen Zhengyi and Liu Sisi

933
00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:57,399
work well,

934
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,560
it is also difficult for Luo Xiaoyi

935
00:36:58,679 --> 00:36:59,520
to compete with them.

936
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:02,280
Fighting, Zhengyi.

937
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:03,919
(There is a gap in the inner track.)

938
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:05,560
(Go forward.)

939
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,679
(Not that easy.)

940
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,120
They may not think so.

941
00:37:34,879 --> 00:37:35,879
Lele, fighting!

942
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:37,239
Fighting, Xiaoyi!

943
00:37:37,399 --> 00:37:38,399
Fighting, Zhengyi!

944
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,360
(I can also rank first.)

945
00:37:50,919 --> 00:37:51,760
(Like I don't exist?)

946
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,000
(Oh no.)

947
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,560
Come on!

948
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,199
Can you tell me

949
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,639
how it was today?

950
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,800
Did you compete with the
teammate or the opponent?

951
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,760
What is the tactical cooperation?

952
00:38:28,879 --> 00:38:30,320
The tactic only exists
when you can cooperate.

953
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:33,479
- Sorry, coach.
- Sorry, coach.

954
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:34,600
It's no use apologizing to me.

955
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,120
Apologize to your teammate.

956
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,879
Now that we have settled
tactical cooperation,

957
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:41,040
you have to put

958
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:42,479
yourself in the shoes of your teammate.

959
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,679
Only good cooperation

960
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,600
can deal with various changes

961
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:45,560
on the rink.

962
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:46,679
Before Ling Yun Cup,

963
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,399
I want you to know

964
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,639
what the true cooperation is.

965
00:38:48,919 --> 00:38:49,639
Okay?

966
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,800
There's one other thing
you should remember

967
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,679
that you are always team members

968
00:38:53,879 --> 00:38:55,199
as you are in Wind Chaser.

969
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,120
Alright.

970
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,439
Take a three-minute break.

971
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:03,600
Luo Xiaoyi.

972
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:09,600
Don't worry.

973
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,399
Even no one assists me,

974
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,800
I can still get the champion.

975
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:14,199
Do you think Yu Bingling

976
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,639
will make such stupid mistakes?

977
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:19,800
Got it.

978
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,760
To tell you the truth,

979
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:31,719
Ling Yun Cup

980
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,120
is the last competition I'll attend.

981
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,600
In this competition,

982
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:36,679
I won't assist anyone.

983
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,479
(But I also want to
make it to the final.)

984
00:39:52,439 --> 00:39:53,439
(Yu Bingling is following her teammate.)

985
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,320
(They are cooperating so well)

986
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,320
(that they block)

987
00:39:55,479 --> 00:39:56,199
(the opponent's route.)

988
00:39:56,439 --> 00:39:57,919
(It would be fair to say it is
an impregnable fortress.)

989
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,000
(Yu Bingling is sprinting!)

990
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,159
We're up against such a tough team.

991
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:01,760
(They block the player of)

992
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,159
(Topspeed player behind.)

993
00:40:03,399 --> 00:40:05,320
We don't have much time left.

994
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,320
(She is sprinting!)

995
00:40:06,399 --> 00:40:08,159
(Yu Bingling took the
lead to across the finish line.)

996
00:40:08,399 --> 00:40:09,080
(You could say it is a)

997
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:11,159
(perfect cooperation victory.)

998
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,439
(Let us celebrate Yu Bingling)

999
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,639
(for winning the championship.)

1000
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:23,620
(You help me first. I don't want
to be your good friends. Hum.)

1001
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,479
I heard that

1002
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,159
Flyer is coming to Lingbei tomorrow.

1003
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:39,159
So soon?

1004
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:40,679
They might

1005
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,120
want to get used to the rink in advance.

1006
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,239
What does it feel like to

1007
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:44,919
compete with Flyer in 1500-meter race?

1008
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,120
Like being crushed.

1009
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,879
Didn't you see in the
College Student Ice League?

1010
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,719
Don't mention Yu Bingling.

1011
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:52,120
I heard that even if

1012
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:53,080
two persons in the team
are picked randomly,

1013
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,040
they can cooperate with each other.

1014
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,840
We haven't even agreed on

1015
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,600
the cooperation

1016
00:40:56,719 --> 00:40:58,040
between us.

1017
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,320
(What if the coach wants me to)

1018
00:41:02,399 --> 00:41:03,639
(assist Liu Sisi?)

1019
00:41:03,959 --> 00:41:04,800
(That's like giving up)

1020
00:41:04,959 --> 00:41:06,080
(the chance of getting a gold medal.)

1021
00:41:06,439 --> 00:41:07,959
(I might not even
make it to the finals.)

1022
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,439
(Then I can't prove anything)

1023
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,639
(to my mom.)

1024
00:41:12,439 --> 00:41:13,959
Luo Xiaoyi and I are different.

1025
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,159
I probably don't even deserve to

1026
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,439
cooperate with her.

1027
00:41:17,919 --> 00:41:18,639
Alright.

1028
00:41:19,879 --> 00:41:20,600
No matter how great

1029
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:22,199
your disparity in strength is,

1030
00:41:22,879 --> 00:41:23,840
you have to work hard.

1031
00:41:24,479 --> 00:41:25,280
After all, we all represent

1032
00:41:25,439 --> 00:41:26,360
Wind Chaser.

1033
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,719
(Luo Xiaoyi, rest assured.)

1034
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:36,600
(On the skating rink,)

1035
00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:37,919
(I will cooperate fully with you.)

1036
00:41:49,919 --> 00:41:50,800
(Mind yourself.)
