Sing less when you're outside.

Haven't you been yelled at enough
by Mr. Xu?

00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:36,039
We're not even in Binchuan yet.

13
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,879
Even if you sing in Zhuhai,

14
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,000
it'll still reach his ears.

15
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,479
Nonsense.

16
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,639
Saying sing too much and you lose value.

17
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:46,159
The one with value

18
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:49,240
is me.

19
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,520
Enough. Stop it.

20
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,360
I sent you out to work,
yet you let yourself loose.

21
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:56,919
Stop being smug.

22
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,680
Are you done yet?

23
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:14,280
Fine.

24
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:17,879
We're back.

25
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,120

(A singer-dancer
at Binchuan International Club.)

29
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,039
(I used to like smiling.)

30
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,199
(I liked singing.)

31
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,439
(I liked pretty dresses.)

32
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:45,039
(But now I hate all of it.)

33
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,039
(I hate my life now.)

Buy tickets to Xiamen.

36
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,660
We'll arrive on the 18th
and go back on the 20th.

37
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,900
We have to meet a boss there.

38
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,280
Wu wants both of us to go along.

39
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:15,400
The 18th won't work.

40
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,150
Mr. Liu is bringing
an important guest over.

41
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,439
Tell him to change the date.

42
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:21,720
Tell Mr. Liu to change the date?

43
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,680
Can't you do it?

44
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,590
Are you assistant team leader
for nothing?

45
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,680
What is up with you today?

46
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,120
Qu Meng.

47
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,040
Qu Meng.

48
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,160
Qu Meng!

49
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:40,000
Is it over there?

50
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,500
Someone's trying to lie on the tracks.

51
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:42,079
Qu Meng.

52
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,839
We're already late.

53
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:44,560
Don't meddle.

54
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,180
Stop acting crazy.

55
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,160
You all drove me crazy long ago.

56
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,720
- Don't do anything stupid.
- Help.

57
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,399
- Get up.
- The train's coming.

58
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:03,360
- The train's coming.
- Get up, now.

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,480
Young man.

60
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,160
Don't do anything stupid.

61
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,480
Someone's lying on the tracks.

62
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,959
Get up.

63
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,439
Young man.

64
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:14,279
- Young man.
- Young man.

65
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,160
Think it through.

66
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,600
You've got a long road ahead.

67
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,720
Get up.

68
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,360
Lie down somewhere else.

69
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,240
Yeah.

70
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,879
Don't do anything stupid.

71
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,600
Get up. It's dangerous there.

72
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,720
Get up!

73
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,480
Get up!

74
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,040
Get up, young man.

75
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:52,480
What are you doing?

76
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,879
Get up.

77
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,319
Wake up!

78
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,439
Get up here!

79
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,160
Let's go. Leave it.

80
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:55,959
Qu Meng.

81
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,540

=Episode 6=
=Awake=

83
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,880
Wu brought this back
from Hong Kong, China.

84
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:48,439
It's yours.

85
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:52,399
Is this thing real or fake?

86
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,639
What orders do you have, Ms. Hong?

87
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:03,319
Mr. Wang is going fishing this Saturday

88
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:04,160
and wants you along.

89
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:06,360
Sure.

90
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,480
If Ms. Hong says so,

91
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,680
how could I refuse?

92
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:12,480
He's important.

93
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:15,160
Otherwise, Mr. Xu wouldn't have

94
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,120
picked you.

95
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,600
I'll go.

96
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:19,120
He can fish his fish.

97
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,000
I'll wait in the car.

98
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:22,680
He can stay his place.

99
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,480
I won't go.

100
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,240
Why are you acting crazy?

101
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,100
It's not like you never
kept him company before.

102
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,480
Did I ever get to choose?

103
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,080
Stop asking what you know.

104
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,919
Enough. Save it.

105
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,639
People come and go here.

106
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,120
Do you know how many

107
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,480
wanted to take you away?

108
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,799
Once they heard you did time,

109
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,960
they all backed off.

110
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,639
Have some self-awareness.

111
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,000
Mr. Wu's gesture is rare.

112
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,720
Cherish it.

113
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:11,600

00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:32,679

158
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:37,879
Stop!

159
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:41,559
What are you doing?

160
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,399

- Don't run.
- What happened?

168
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,039
Stop!

169
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,639
I asked around about you.

170
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,500
Your name's Yang Wenyuan, right?

171
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,960
Why did you lie on the tracks?

172
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,480
Sometimes,

173
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:00,720
I just want to feel death.

174
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,240
I've been submitting to poetry journals.

175
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:14,799
This is yours.

176
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,960
Thanks for that day.

177
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,600
I'm returning it to you.

178
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,720
You came just to return this?

179
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:30,320
I heard this golden ball
is exclusive to this place.

180
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:32,279
I did find you.

181
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:34,200
Wait here.

182
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,679
You can get some sleep.

183
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,840
I get off at 6:00 AM tomorrow.

184
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,080
I'll take you out then.

185
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:43,799
I... I'm writing something.

186
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:46,080
I want to borrow your name

187
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:47,799
as the main character.

188
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,240
What kind of writing?

189
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,519
A novel.

190
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,639
An essay.

191
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,360
Maybe a poem.

192
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:56,840
Can I know you better?

193
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:06,440
Idiot.

194
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:15,279
People are divided into ranks.

195
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,240
We're not from the same world.

196
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,200
Don't ask what you shouldn't.

197
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:25,720
Don't come to places like this again.

198
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:27,679
In my writing,

199
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:29,559
we can be from the same world.

200
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,240
In your writing,

201
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,360
what kind of person am I?

202
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,759
Someone who loves freedom.

203
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,799
Wait.

204
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,519
Hurry up.

205
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,279
Sorry.

206
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,039
Let's go.

207
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:14,399
Don't look around. Move.

208
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:15,720
Don't come back.

209
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,879
(His name is Yang Wenyuan.)

210
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,519
(A local newspaper reporter,)

211
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:28,720
(but he wants to be a poet.)

212
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,690
(I heard he lay on the tracks yesterday)

213
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,679
(to feel near death.)

214
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,120
(There really are idiots like this.)

215
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,159
How did he find this place?

216
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,639
Why bring him upstairs?

217
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,120
Did he see the girls?

218
00:15:57,399 --> 00:15:59,320
I know how to handle
the club's business.

219
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,600
Qu Meng.

220
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,399
Think carefully

221
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:09,279
about what Mr. Wang said.

222
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,799
Do you think we and Mr. Wang

223
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:16,720
are from the same world?

224
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,759
Why wouldn't we be?

225
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,690
Don't they eat, drink, use the toilet,

226
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,639
sleep and breathe?

227
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:30,759
It's different.

228
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,360
Mr. Jin.

229
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:44,559
Open a bottle

230
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,720
of Remy Martin.

231
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,360
Once Remy is opened,

232
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,600
good things will follow.

233
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:49,840
Naturally.

247
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:47,720
Is Mr. Wang's fishing trip settled?

248
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,720
That girl Qu Meng

249
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:52,680
is difficult.

250
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:54,160
She's too stubborn.

251
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:57,400
You can't force her.

252
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:58,759
You have to be gentle.

253
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:00,079
Got it.

254
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:01,920
Mr. Wu.

255
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,440
I just mentioned Qu Meng, and you...

256
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,799
Why do you sound jealous?

257
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,480
Who's jealous?

258
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,920
You're jealous.

259
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:21,119
The whole room smells of your jealousy.

260
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,720
Don't be jealous.

261
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,990
I'm going on a business trip
in a couple of days.

262
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,400
I'm helping Xu sign a contract.

263
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:34,319
A big contract.

264
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:37,000
Talk to Mr. Xu.

265
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,920
Don't keep running around.

266
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,799
Isn't it fine to stay at the restaurant?

267
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,839
They pay me a salary,

268
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,599
so I have to work myself to death.

269
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,759
As the old saying goes,

270
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:51,039
if you're paid, you handle the trouble.

271
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:55,440
Now, everyone is doing real business.

272
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:01,160
We can't afford to fall behind.

273
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,759
Any news this month?

274
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,559
No.

275
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,680
Maybe when I go
on a business trip to Hong Kong, China,

276
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,279
you can come with me and check.

277
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,000
See if it's your problem

278
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
or mine.

279
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,640
Have you lost your mind?

280
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,440
What?

281
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,000
It's definitely your problem.

282
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:34,240
You can't say it like that.

283
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:00,880
You're just too thin.

284
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,960
Look at how thin you are.

285
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:05,799
Without some flesh,
the outfit won't fit.

286
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,640
Eat more.

287
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,000
I've gained some weight recently.

288
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:10,799
Mr. Liu.

289
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:11,960
Hurry.

290
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:13,839
Let's go.

291
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,039
Looking for Qu Meng?

292
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,400
What are you holding?

293
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:33,359
I came to return clothes.

294
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:34,759
You came all the way here

295
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:35,880
just to return clothes?

296
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:41,880
Let me check.

297
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:49,319
I promised her to write a poem for her.

298
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,920
I want her to see it.

299
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:54,079
You already set up a meeting.

300
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,759
Scholar, you call this a poem?

301
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:58,079
Qu Meng really has sharp eyes for men.

302
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,920
I knew you'd be meddling secretly.

303
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,160
She told me to wait for you here.

304
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,920
It's too shaky.

305
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:10,960
Help me a bit.

306
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,759
Help me.

307
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,640
Ms. He.

308
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,640
Let me hold. I can't walk steadily.

309
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,960
Why are you so shy?

310
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,480
Never had a girl hold you?

311
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:35,200
Distinguished guests.

312
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,599
Good evening, everyone.

313
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:40,480
Welcome to the International Club.

314
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,799
- Good.
- Good.

315
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:44,720
First,

316
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,160
let me share some good news.

317
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,480
Our club

318
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,559
was rated last year

319
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,240
as Binchuan City's top dining place.

320
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,759
This is thanks to your support.

321
00:21:56,759 --> 00:21:58,020
She told you not to overthink it.

322
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,799
That ball is just for show.

323
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,200
Like those flashy people

324
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:05,559
who all wear suits.

325
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:07,720
They're not as comfy
as tanks and shorts.

326
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,240
It's just about style.

327
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:10,880
I saw everything.

328
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,359
This ball

329
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:25,559
is for the lucky draw.

330
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:27,559
Yes.

331
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:28,759
A lucky draw.

332
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,210
We're drawing today too.

333
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,880
We've specially prepared
a lucky draw for you.

334
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,599
We'll have the results soon.
Try your luck.

335
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:39,960
There are three prize tiers.

336
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:40,720
Take this.

337
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,720
Want a drink? I'll get you one.

338
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:43,930
Give me a second.

339
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,400
1,000 yuan in cash.

340
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,319
With the Fu character, second prize.

341
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,799
A gold bracelet.

342
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,440
Here comes the exciting part.

343
00:22:58,599 --> 00:22:59,640
With the Ya character,

344
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,319
first prize, a Rolex gold watch.

345
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:05,079
A gold Rolex.

346
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:22,519
Today, we've also prepared
a special prize.

347
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,880
The special prize is

348
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:29,240
to sing a duet with our club's
Golden Ball Angel,

349
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:31,599
Qu Meng.

350
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,599
So who drew the Golden Ball?

351
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:36,079
Where's the Golden Ball?

352
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:38,240
Where's the Golden Ball?

353
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:40,839
Where's the Golden Ball?

354
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:41,839
Here it is!

355
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,640
Hurry up. Stand up.

356
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:48,319
Let's congratulate him.

357
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:50,119
Congratulations.

358
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:52,480
Good. How lucky.

359
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:55,480
Move. Don't just stand there.

360
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,960
Go on. Get on it.

361
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,519
Get on it. Go.

362
00:23:58,519 --> 00:23:59,880
Hurry. Go on.

363
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,319
Qu Meng's waiting there. Go.

364
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,080
Congratulations.

365
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,039
Don't be shy, young man.

366
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,559
- Go on.
- Get up there.

367
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,599
- Get up there.
- Get up there.

368
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:10,839

- Hurry up.

370
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:21,160
- Go on.

371
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:32,519
- Sing one.
- Sing one.

372
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:36,400
- Good.

378
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:22,380
♪I just can't recall it♪

379
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:42,359
Hello.

380
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,160
Singing lady.

381
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:53,880
Hello.

382
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:58,240
When the neon river flood the banks,

383
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,279
your laughter

384
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,599
is the sail that won't sink.

385
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:07,000
When distant starlight cuts the clouds,

386
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:09,440
your singing

387
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:11,640
is an untamed flame.

388
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:14,279
Don't be afraid.

389
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,880
The nightingale also waited in thorns,

390
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,400
just to sing defiant notes.

391
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,680
Don't be afraid.

392
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,559
Seeds break through ruins to rise,

393
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,400
only to pierce the pain and take root.

394
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,079
Every grain of dust will awaken.

395
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:39,640
Every soul is surging.

396
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,000
Light will cross a thousand years.

397
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:46,559
Flowers will eventually
bloom before our eyes.

398
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:49,519
Between light and flowers,

399
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,680
I saw your tears.

400
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,480
They shimmer

401
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:58,759
and shatter into stars in neon.

402
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:00,920
Hello.

403
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,519
Miss.

404
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,279
Hello.

405
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:21,160
- Good.
- Good.

406
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:26,480
- Good.
- Good.

407
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:37,920
Talk.

408
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,200
What was tonight about?

409
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,400
Reciting poems too. It's quite novel.

410
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:46,079
Mr. Xu, this is on me.

411
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:47,960
I didn't think it through.

412
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:50,200
This isn't the time to blame.

413
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:53,440
We're family. Fix this first.

414
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:54,920
It's no big deal.

415
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:57,559
He probably didn't get the trick.

416
00:27:58,039 --> 00:28:00,519
He saw the raffle earlier.

417
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:01,920
He's just curious.

418
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:03,319
It's fine now.

419
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,359
People like him has no backing.

420
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,400
Give him cash and send him off.

421
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,799
You think money is easy to make?

422
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,319
He caused trouble without spending.

423
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,359
We earned this on knife edges.

424
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:13,480
You just give it away?

425
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:16,960
Mr. Xu.

426
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:24,559
Here.

427
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,759
Apologize to Mr. Xu.

428
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,920
I caused this.

429
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,079
I'll handle it.

430
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,680
Where is he?

431
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:37,319
He was sent away.

432
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,359
He's gone?

433
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:41,440
No one saw him leave.

434
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,599
Yang Wen... Yang Wenyuan.

435
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:33,839
Qu Meng wears this too.

436
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:36,079
Do you all do this?

437
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:38,759
Does she do this too?

438
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,359
Get lost.

439
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,000
You were forced, right?

440
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:44,440
Go.

441
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,920
It's too late.

442
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:28,599
(People are divided into ranks.)

443
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,500
(We're not from the same world.)

444
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,390
(Don't ask what you shouldn't.)

445
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,799
(Don't come)

446
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,150
(to places like this again.)

447
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:41,240
Yang Wenyuan!

448
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:46,240
(Binchuan Police Shunyang Road Station)
Stop. What are you doing?

449
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,559
I came looking for you,

450
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:51,799
just wanting to see
what the club is all about.

451
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,279
Now there's no need.

452
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:57,480
It won't work.

453
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,000
The police have checked many times,

454
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:01,880
but no one dares tell the truth.

455
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,599
Don't get yourself involved.

456
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,000
Stop it. Go back with me.

457
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:10,240
What are you doing?

458
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,720
Not coming back?

459
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:27,559
Are you leaving or not?

460
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:28,359
Sir.

461
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:30,319
Is there a problem?

462
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:41,559
What are you doing? Look at yourself.

463
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:43,039
Stop it, you...

464
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:46,160
You even made the police come out.

465
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:47,839
Sir.

466
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:49,839
How about you talk inside?

467
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:57,599
We're fine.

468
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:58,920
Sorry.

469
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:02,720
Alright, that's enough.

470
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,480
Give me a hug.

471
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,680
They've fallen in love.

472
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:41,359
Let's go.

473
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,880
We searched everywhere.

474
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:54,519
This guy didn't hide anything.

475
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:18,119
Are you doing it too?

476
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,279
Get up.

477
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,680
Get up!

478
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,200
Okay.

479
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:47,039
I provoked you first.

480
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,400
Consider it my compensation.

481
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:54,240
Qu Meng, don't do this.

482
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:55,759
I said, don't do this.

483
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,720
Don't do this.

484
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,119
You think I'm dirty?

485
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,559
Yang Wenyuan,
you have no right to think we're dirty.

486
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:24,480
Do you know what it's like

487
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,800
to have no money to feed yourself?

488
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,519
I was the third girl in my family.

489
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,599
In ninth grade, my mom left.

490
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,199
My stepfather sold my eldest sister.

491
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:39,280
One day, my second sister

492
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,719
suddenly went with him
to the city to buy medicine

493
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:43,199
and never returned.

494
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,960
I escaped alone

495
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:56,559
and came to Binchuan.

496
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,360
At first, I worked in a small restaurant

497
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:01,559
as a waitress.

498
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:03,679
One day,

499
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,800
a group of men
suddenly started groping me.

500
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,590
I refused to comply.

501
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,280
They took advantage of my drunkenness,

502
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:12,480
locked me in a private room,
and raped me.

503
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,159
I made a scene,

504
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:16,559
so they falsely accused me of stealing.

505
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:18,719
Eventually, they threw me in jail.

506
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:21,000
Well?

507
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:23,880
Not what you imagined, right?

508
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:31,199
You think I was born wanting that job?

509
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,679
Am I born that lowly?

510
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,880
Yes, we were young and naive,

511
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,119
being led in like headless flies.

512
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,960
We thought we found a shortcut
and thought we could still get out.

513
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:44,510
But once you're on the thief's ship,

514
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:46,719
there's no getting off.

515
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:50,039
I can help you.

516
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:50,960
How?

517
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:53,190
I'll take you away from here.

518
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,840
I work in the club.

519
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,079
Who would let me go?

520
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:11,119
Since you're already involved,

521
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,280
we can only use their methods.

522
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:18,159
Leave Binchuan.

523
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,159
The club,

524
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,639
what we are, and what we do

525
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:24,400
doesn't matter.

526
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,320
Our roots were ground away long ago.

527
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,920
We're asleep for too long.

528
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,800
We can't wake up.

529
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,079
A poor poet like you

530
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:33,880
shouldn't imagine using us

531
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:35,559
to satisfy your idealism.

532
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:37,880
All your self-indulgent words

533
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,480
only cause trouble for others.

534
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,639
They're useless.

535
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,119
I'd say stop dreaming here.

536
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:44,760
Take the money,

537
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,119
write your lousy poems,

538
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,150
and don't come back for me.

539
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,480
It won't end well.

540
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:06,440
Go back.

541
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,039
I said,

542
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,880
go back.

543
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,719
Get lost!

544
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:29,199
Just discipling him.

545
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,920
Watch your limits.

546
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,320
In other people's eyes,

547
00:37:58,519 --> 00:38:00,199
I'm just a convict for life.

548
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:02,280
My life is a dump.

549
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,519
You're a great poet.

550
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:04,780
I'm not worth you picking trash.

551
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:05,679
Do you understand?

552
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,920
When I got out,

553
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,079
Ms. Hong brought me to the club.

554
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,320
(Binchuan Correctional Institution)
But it wasn't at all what I imagined.

555
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,480
You think I didn't resist?

556
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,039
You think I wanted to live like this?

557
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,519
In your eyes, I saw

558
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:36,000
my former self.

559
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,079
Dreams in my heart.

560
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:40,480
Light in my eyes.

561
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,519
Why hasn't the driver returned yet?

562
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:18,639
Meng.

563
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:20,719
You seem worried.

564
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:24,800
If you're unhappy at the club,

565
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:27,880
tell me anytime. I'll get you a new job.

566
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,880
Do you know
why I like listening to you sing?

567
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:36,679
When you sing "Sweet as Honey", it's...

568
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:44,000
♪Sweet as honey. Your smile is sweet♪

569
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,199
I always feel my vocal technique
and breath control are lacking.

570
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,360
Touch it. My breath...

571
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:52,679
Feel it.

572
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:58,320
♪Sweet as honey. Your smile is sweet♪

573
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,000
Meng, do you think

574
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,760
this breath is...

575
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:05,960
What's going on?

576
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,679
Go, hurry.

577
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,800
(Dance Hall)
Let's check it out.

578
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:11,880
What's happening?

579
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,180
What's going on? What's the situation?

580
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:13,880
Exactly.

581
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:43,780
(Awake)

582
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:52,260
(Awake)

583
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,079
Awake!

584
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,119
Get up!

585
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,519
Hello, singing lady.

586
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:05,800
When the neon river flood the banks,

587
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,360
your laughter

588
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,039
is the sail that won't sink.

589
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,440
When distant starlight cuts the clouds,

590
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:16,320
your singing

591
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:18,360
is an untamed flame.

592
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,199
Don't be afraid.

593
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,920
The nightingale also waited in thorns,

594
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:27,480
just to sing defiant notes.

595
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,000
Don't be afraid.

596
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,000
Seeds break through ruins to rise,

597
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,440
only to pierce the pain and take root.

598
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:39,880
Every grain of dust will awaken.

599
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:43,639
Every soul is surging.

600
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,320
Light will cross a thousand years.

601
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,880
Flowers will eventually
bloom before our eyes.

602
00:41:54,519 --> 00:41:56,079
Between light and flowers,

603
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,039
I saw your tears.

604
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:00,480
They shimmer

605
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:04,239
and shatter into stars in neon.

606
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:06,840
Yang Wenyuan!

607
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:29,599
Can you tell me your name?

608
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:31,840
My name is Qu Meng.

609
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,119
Qu, like a song.

610
00:42:38,679 --> 00:42:39,519

611
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:42,920
