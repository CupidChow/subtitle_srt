2
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,959
(Muke Club)

3
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:57,439
I honestly don't know

4
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,719
when your mother gave birth to you.

5
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,480
When I went to the attic
to get the truth,

6
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:04,959
she was already dead.

7
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,640
My guess is

8
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,759
that she and Feifei's mom

9
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,520
were pregnant around the same time.

10
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,759
They were tight back then.

11
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:17,080
Inseparable.

12
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,599
Like they were joined at the hip.

13
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,280
You get what I mean?

14
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,080
Just like you,

15
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,719
I was kept in the dark, too.

16
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,100
(Early 1990s)

17
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:12,400
Golden Ball Angel, Qu Meng,

18
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,280
has recovered from an illness

19
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,840
and returns to the stage.

20
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,360
Let's welcome her
with a round of applause!

21
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,639
Thank you, Ms. Hong.

22
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,000
Without her,

23
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,840
I wouldn't be who I am today.

24
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,960
From now on,

25
00:03:36,066 --> 00:03:37,977
we'll face a brand-new start together.

26
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,360
Today, I'd like to invite her
to sing a song with me

27
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,088
and say goodbye to the past.

28
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:44,200
Please welcome
the Queen of the Golden Ball,

29
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:45,177

I don't know how your mother
gave birth to you either.

76
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,240
She was remarkable.

77
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,120
If I were you,

78
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:10,759
I'd live well.

79
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,399
After your mother passed away,

80
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,519
Feifei's mom

81
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:44,279
tried to stand up for her.

82
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,240
She caused trouble a few times.

83
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:50,759
I was worried about her safety

84
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:53,080
and afraid she'd stir things up,

85
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,039
so I had no choice

86
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,840
but to lock her up.

87
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:01,519
She left a letter

88
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:03,159
and ran away.

89
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,000
For all these years,

90
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,600
I thought

91
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,639
she was dead.

92
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:10,639
The whole time...

93
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,440
If you're

94
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,080
as innocent as you claim,

95
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,480
you could tell all this to the police.

96
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,679
I'm innocent,

97
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,399
but I don't deal with the police.

98
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,840
I'm not used to talking to them.

99
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:38,480
Besides,

100
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,879
Xu Peng has been dead for years.

101
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,440
Does the truth

102
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,279
matter anymore?

103
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,879
It does.

104
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,399
At least, it matters to your daughter.

105
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:57,919
You should tell Wu Feifei

106
00:10:58,755 --> 00:10:59,840
that all these years,

107
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,150
she wasn't someone without a mother.

108
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:03,200
No.

109
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:06,879
Give me some time.

110
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,440
I'll send Feifei away.

111
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:11,879
Whatever you want,

112
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:13,639
just say it.

113
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:16,120
Come at me.

114
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,000
By the way,

115
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,080
we're negotiating now.

116
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:26,720
If it goes well,

117
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,039
you hand the thing over to me.

118
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,080
If it doesn't,

119
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,320
you still hand it over.

120
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,200
I haven't done this in a long time.

121
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:26,320
Doing it again so suddenly,

122
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,600
I'm a bit rusty.

123
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:30,960
I thought

124
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:34,000
I'd never have to do this again.

125
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:46,480
Stop wasting everyone's time.

126
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:26,879
You're impulsive.

127
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,879
You're young.

128
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,600
You don't think things through.

129
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,840
I'll give you one more chance.

130
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,320
By 10:00 PM tomorrow,

131
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,639
bring it to Chen Kang yourself.

132
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:52,159
How do you plan to explain this
to your daughter?

133
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,399
Explain what?

134
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:58,559
You lied to her for so many years.

135
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,320
Do you plan to keep lying
for the rest of her life?

136
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,519
This is our family matter.

137
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,799
Your family matter?

138
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:13,840
Fine.

139
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,360
I gave you a chance.

140
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,879
Help!

141
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:13,000
Help!

142
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,480
Who is it?

143
00:15:17,488 --> 00:15:18,440
- Don't touch me!
- Dong.

144
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,550
- Don't touch me!
- It's me.

145
00:15:19,555 --> 00:15:20,270
You're safe now.

146
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,080
Feng!

147
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:25,200
Why did you take so long?

148
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,919
Feng.

149
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,679
I thought I'd never see you again.

150
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,320
Feng.

151
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,840
Feng...

152
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:41,120
Feng, it was terrifying.

153
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:46,279
(I'm Gao Feng.)

154
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:48,399
(An orphan.)

155
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,519
(To me,)

156
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,960
(being an orphan
isn't just identity,)

157
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,519
(it's a mystery.)

158
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:01,200
(But lately,)

159
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:04,360
(it feels like I'm waking up from it.)

160
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,759
(The road ahead is full of thorns,)

161
00:16:08,755 --> 00:16:10,355
(but my mind has never been clearer.)

162
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:15,480
(I see with my bleeding eyes)

163
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,120
(and run on my bleeding legs.)

164
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,919
(Even if I'm broken into pieces,)

165
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:26,919
(I know)

166
00:16:28,022 --> 00:16:29,600
(as long as I run toward the end,)

167
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,840
(I'll see the beginning of my life.)

168
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,639
(Nothing will stop me.)

(Grave of Beloved Wife, Li Hongyue)

171
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:11,759
It's chilly.

172
00:17:12,555 --> 00:17:13,720
Don't catch a cold, Feifei.

173
00:17:20,222 --> 00:17:21,790
How many lies are you still telling?

174
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,039
Answer me!

175
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,599
You think I'm not hurting?

176
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,599
You think I'm not hurting?

177
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,200
You think I don't feel pain?

178
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:45,279
You think I'm not hurting?

179
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:46,440
- Stop it!
- I...

180
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,640
Feifei,

181
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:24,119
come home.

182
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:28,759
Let's go home.

Qu Meng.

187
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,720
Hurry up.

188
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:17,880
Qu Meng.

189
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,319
What Qu Meng?

190
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:22,480
All you ever know

191
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,519
is Qu Meng.

192
00:19:25,355 --> 00:19:26,200
What do you want?

193
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:27,920
You're here.

194
00:19:28,577 --> 00:19:29,480
How are you feeling?

195
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:31,720
Any reactions lately?

196
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:32,799
I'm fine. Nothing wrong.

197
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,680
Where's Qu Meng?

198
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,039
I'll help you find her.

199
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:37,319
Hey. Wait.

200
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,119
Alright.

201
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,000
Did he suspect anything?

202
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:52,839
No.

203
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:56,440
Wrap the bandage tighter.

204
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,240
In another month or two,

205
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,488
you won't be able to hide it.

206
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:04,440
I'll hide it for as long as I can.

207
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:07,480
It probably likes hearing me sing.

208
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,599
Every time I sing, it kicks.

209
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,359
I really couldn't hold it in just now.

210
00:20:14,511 --> 00:20:16,320
They say a mother and her child
are connected.

211
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:17,920
I believe the baby

212
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,599
can feel how I feel.

213
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:30,680
Come.

214
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,799
Hold your breath.

215
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,640
Forget it.

216
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,839
Don't sing tonight.

217
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,359
Thank you, Ms. Hong.

218
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:53,359
It feels so nice!

219
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,720
Tell me honestly.

220
00:20:58,039 --> 00:20:59,119
Have you ever hated me?

221
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,720
Yes.

222
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,240
Of course I have.

223
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:09,777
If you hadn't been waiting for me
at the gate

224
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,519
the day I got out,

225
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:15,759
my life might've turned out
very differently.

226
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,319
But hating you doesn't help.

227
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,400
Now that you understand me
and protect me,

228
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:23,119
I'm grateful.

229
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,599
There's no such thing as "what if".

230
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,960
Only karma

231
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:35,119
and the outcome we're heading toward.

232
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:42,720
Don't get it, do you?

233
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,319
Yang Wenyuan told me that.

234
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:46,480
Sounds deep, right?

235
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,799
♪I give long roads
to the distant horizon♪

236
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:59,480
♪I give roses to love♪

237
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,039
♪What can I give you♪

238
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:07,119
♪My lover?♪

239
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:11,780
♪I give white clouds to the meadow♪

240
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:15,420
♪I give rivers to the ocean♪

241
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:18,380
♪What can I give you♪

242
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:22,100
♪My friend?♪

243
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:30,620
♪What can I give you?♪

244
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,279
The most dangerous place

245
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:57,400
is the safest place, right?

246
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,240
There's no such thing
as absolute safety.

247
00:23:03,866 --> 00:23:05,160
This place makes the most sense

248
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,680
out of all the options I could think of.

249
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:23,400
After Yang Wenyuan passed,

250
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,160
did you come back?

251
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,559
I didn't dare to.

252
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,720
(Look, our club is new)

253
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:39,240
to the real estate business.

254
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:41,920
We need someone

255
00:23:42,155 --> 00:23:43,622
to oversee things in Shenzhen.

256
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,000
Emotionally speaking,

257
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:47,119
Hongyue is pregnant now.

258
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,200
As a husband and father-to-be,

259
00:23:50,222 --> 00:23:52,200
it doesn't feel right
not to stay with her.

260
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:53,759
But practically speaking,

261
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:57,759
a lot of people
are relying on this project

262
00:23:57,759 --> 00:23:59,160
to make a living.

263
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:01,240
I wouldn't feel right not going either.

264
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:02,759
How about this, Wu?

265
00:24:02,777 --> 00:24:04,022
I'll make the call for you.

266
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:05,279
You go to Shenzhen first.

267
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,000
During this time,

268
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,359
it doesn't matter
if you can't stay with me.

269
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:11,759
But for the group,

270
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:13,240
it's critical.

271
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,559
Right, Mr. Xu?

272
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,000
So Wu,

273
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,880
you head over first.

274
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,000
When I'm close to my due date,
you come back.

275
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,400
Just six months.

276
00:24:21,555 --> 00:24:23,030
I'll be back by the end of the year.

277
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,759
Once the baby's born,
I'll come back right away, okay?

278
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:26,960
Good, Mr. Wu.

279
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,155
I must raise a toast to you.

280
00:24:28,377 --> 00:24:29,333
- Sure.
- Cheers.

281
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,839
Then it's settled.

282
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,759
A toast to Hongyue.

283
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:34,680
Alright, Mr. Xu.

284
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,119
That settles

285
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,319
Wu's part.

286
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:39,240
But I do have

287
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,519
something personal.

288
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,359
Go ahead.

289
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:44,359
The doctor says

290
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,000
the baby's a bit big.

291
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,160
It won't be very convenient

292
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:50,680
to stay at the club.

293
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,960
I'm thinking of moving out.

294
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:53,799
Yes.

295
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:56,319
The club's too chaotic.

296
00:24:57,555 --> 00:24:58,790
It's better to move out.

297
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,400
Alright.

298
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:02,759
Whatever Mr. Wu decides.

299
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:04,000
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

300
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:06,400
Also, I'll take Qu Meng with me.

301
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,680
Why take Qu Meng?

302
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:13,039
If you're gone,
Qu Meng can fill in for you.

303
00:25:13,133 --> 00:25:15,240
If she leaves too,
who's going to run things here?

304
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:16,880
Mr. Xu,

305
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:18,799
the club can't run on

306
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,039
just Qu Meng and me forever.

307
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:20,720
Right?

308
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,960
He Xiaohong can do a good job, too.

309
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,119
You've seen that.

310
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:26,799
She needs more chances to train, right?

311
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,880
No matter how busy work gets,

312
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,359
I have to look after Ms. Hong.

313
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:33,160
Mr. Wu.

314
00:25:33,355 --> 00:25:34,590
I'll thank you in advance.

315
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:35,960
I'll finish all.

316
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:47,279
Xu, Qu Meng

317
00:25:47,311 --> 00:25:48,350
is good at everything,

318
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,200
but she has

319
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,720
a short fuse.

320
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,960
Only Hongyue

321
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,119
can keep her in line.

322
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,160
She can also take care of Hongyue.

323
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,549
I think it works.

324
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,688
Let's settle it that way.

325
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:01,799
Alright.

326
00:26:02,288 --> 00:26:04,310
Since it's your family matter,
you decide.

327
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,480
I'm looking into Gao Dahua.

328
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:16,519
That cook.

329
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:18,079
(He seems honest.)

330
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,119
(You can never really tell.)

331
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,160
(Don't be so naive.)

332
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:23,960
(Anyone working in a club)

333
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,400
(isn't truly honest.)

334
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,920
I checked into it.

335
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,319
His family

336
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,359
has been wanting a child.

337
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:40,920
Do you think I'm cruel?

338
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:42,519
No mother

339
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,720
is truly cruel.

340
00:26:46,422 --> 00:26:47,920
Do you believe in reincarnation?

341
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:49,960
I didn't before.

342
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,599
But now...

343
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:56,319
I do.

344
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,440
This life is already set.

345
00:27:01,444 --> 00:27:02,711
All I can do is to live well

346
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,000
and earn blessings for the next one.

347
00:27:51,177 --> 00:27:52,977
You haven't had the noodles I made

348
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,160
in a long time, have you?

349
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,720
Stop acting in front of me.

350
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,559
You insisted on sending me to Shenzhen,

351
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,680
acting all reasonable and big-hearted.

352
00:28:19,866 --> 00:28:21,533
Who were you putting on a show for?

353
00:28:23,955 --> 00:28:25,590
But if I can keep acting long enough,

354
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,200
doesn't it become real?

355
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:29,400
You fight out there in front,

356
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,960
and I stay behind

357
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,240
and support you.

358
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:38,400
Ming will go to Shenzhen with me.

359
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:41,119
I'll find another driver.

360
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,480
I think Zhang Biao is fine.

361
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:45,599
Let him drive for you

362
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:46,559
and run errands.

363
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:49,029
He likes money,

364
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,733
but other than that,
he's not a bad person.

365
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:51,839
Sure.

366
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:05,160
In your heart,

367
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:08,000
what are you to me?

368
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,559
Be honest.

369
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:32,200
A woman.

370
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,079
I'm your woman.

371
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:39,759
I see you as my woman, too.

372
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,400
The woman I love.

373
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:47,160
You're pregnant now,

374
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,720
and I can't stay by your side.

375
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:56,960
I feel terrible, honestly.

376
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,000
Maybe when I come back from Shenzhen,

377
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:04,559
I'll already be a father,

378
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,920
and you'll be a mother.

379
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,359
I wonder if things between us

380
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:20,599
will change after the baby is born.

381
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:22,359
I don't know.

382
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,240
What do you think?

383
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:29,160
I don't know, either.

384
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:33,240
We'll see.

385
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:06,980
♪I come to the street entrance♪

386
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:09,880

387
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,200
(that never change,)

388
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:14,920
(no matter how much time passes.)

389
00:31:15,844 --> 00:31:17,488
(One is something you're born with.)

390
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,799
(Blood ties.)

391
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,519
(Who your parents are)

392
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:23,480
(can't be changed.)

393
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,920
(The other)

394
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,200
(is karma.)

395
00:31:29,377 --> 00:31:30,920
(One must bear the consequences)

396
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,839
(for what they have done,)

397
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:35,160
(whether good or bad.)

398
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,340
Qu Meng...

399
00:31:36,466 --> 00:31:38,311
(There'll always be a day of reckoning.)

400
00:31:38,311 --> 00:31:39,266
Hongyue...

401
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:40,720

00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,820

Are you feeling better?

407
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,444
If you run into any trouble, come to us.

408
00:32:02,955 --> 00:32:04,510
Don't hurt yourself like this again.

409
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,480
I don't know...

410
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,680
Madam, please take a look at this.

411
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,200
Do you know her?

412
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,680
She's been using your identity

413
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,977
to move around Binchuan recently.

414
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,519
I don't know!

415
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,880
I don't know her!

416
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:25,720
We won't hurt you.

417
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,160
I don't know her! I really don't!

418
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,920
Madam, we won't hurt you.

419
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,960
Please don't hurt yourself.

420
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,240
Alright. I won't touch you.

421
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:36,680
Don't worry. I won't hurt you.

422
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,240
Take a deep breath.

423
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:54,160
Madam, I don't know
what you went through,

424
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:56,680
but please trust us.

425
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,759
We're here to protect you.

426
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,039
But you have to tell us

427
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,240
what you know.

428
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,279
Only then can we protect you.

429
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:11,640
Can you tell me

430
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,440
what kind of place

431
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,799
the International Club is?

432
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:22,559
Young girl, do you want to go
to the International Club?

433
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:29,319
That place is full of
big shots and celebrities.

434
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:33,160
You have to sing and dance well.

435
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,400
The lights stay on all night.

436
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:40,039
(The music never stops.)

437
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,759
(There's drinking.)

438
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:47,240
If you're tired, you sleep.

439
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,400
Don't go.

440
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,599
Never go there...

441
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:31,679
Tonight,

442
00:34:31,711 --> 00:34:34,266
he'll have to explain everything
about the International Club,

443
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:35,760
your mother,

444
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,400
and my mother.

445
00:34:38,066 --> 00:34:39,800
Lay everything out once and for all.

446
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:43,000
Where your family goes from here

447
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,039
depends on your choice.

448
00:34:47,555 --> 00:34:49,360
10:00 PM tonight.
I'll wait for your answer.

449
00:35:08,711 --> 00:35:10,200
I'll make dinner. It'll be ready soon.

450
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,280
I was impulsive last night.

451
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:31,400
Let's talk somewhere else.

452
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,719
Young people shouldn't think too small.

453
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:45,360
You can't give up on your future

454
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:49,159
because of your parents' generation.

455
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,599
By the way,

456
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:57,000
our group

457
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,760
has businesses and projects
all over the world.

458
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:01,599
You like hiking, don't you?

459
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,000
The Alps.

460
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,719
Mount Kilimanjaro.

461
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,760
We have travel agencies for that.

462
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,320
If you like the sea,

463
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,239
we also have projects

464
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:14,000
in the Caribbean and Hawaii.

465
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,119
Our company needs

466
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:17,440
young people like you.

467
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:20,000
Pick a place

468
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,800
and start over.

469
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:29,039
Mr. Wu, you're capable of anything.

470
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:31,840
I don't think
I'll ever get a clean start

471
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,039
wherever I go.

472
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,880
One bad morning for you,

473
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,719
one phone call,

474
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,360
and I'd be wiped out,

475
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:39,519
just like my mother.

476
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,360
What kind of talk is that?

477
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:43,760
I'm a businessman.

478
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,920
I'm nobody.

479
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:46,920
Standing here

480
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,760
talking to someone like you
is not easy for me.

481
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:54,079
Mr. Wu, you're astute.

482
00:36:55,155 --> 00:36:56,670
You've got a good grasp of things.

483
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,480
Matters of your generation,

484
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,199
money, and power...

485
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,440
You can deal with all that.

486
00:37:02,977 --> 00:37:04,510
But when it comes to our generation,

487
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:05,400
to blood ties,

488
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,360
and to feelings,

489
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,639
you can't.

490
00:37:09,222 --> 00:37:10,670
Mr. Wu, think about this instead.

491
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:13,360
What would your daughter do
for her mother?

492
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:15,400
Go talk to her.

493
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:17,599
I've told her everything
I needed to say.

494
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:20,239
Stop.

495
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,239
I warned you.

496
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:26,880
Don't mess with my daughter.

497
00:37:31,044 --> 00:37:33,000
(After learning about
the International Club,)

498
00:37:33,066 --> 00:37:34,244
(I often come here.)

499
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,639
(I come here)

500
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:37,039
(to see where I came from.)

501
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,280
(I told you.)

502
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,840
I have ways and means

503
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,519
to deal with you.

504
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:46,840
Excuse me.

505
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,599
We're Long Yu's parents.

506
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:55,360
Who signed the consent form

507
00:39:56,039 --> 00:39:57,199
for Long Yu's surgery?

508
00:39:58,119 --> 00:39:59,039
I did.

509
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:00,800
I'm Gao Feng's mother.

510
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:02,360
Please don't worry.

511
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:04,519
She'll have all the treatments
she needs.

512
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:05,719
We cover the medical expenses.

513
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:08,360
Why should you get to decide
for my daughter?

514
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,039
We have money.

515
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:12,599
Long Yu shouldn't be
staying here at all.

516
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:13,559
Alright. Enough.

517
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:18,320
Gao Feng,

518
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,360
you're the one

519
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:21,880
who put Long Yu through all this.

520
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:24,199
I don't care about your personal mess.

521
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,000
But you can't drag my daughter into it.

522
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,280
Let's be clear.

523
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:31,480
We're not here

524
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,519
to ask for compensation.

525
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,360
But if anything happens to Long Yu,

526
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,239
I won't let this slide.

527
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:40,159
From now on,

528
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,710
you're not allowed to get near her.

529
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,239
Once we're back,

530
00:40:43,288 --> 00:40:44,822
we'll transfer her to another hospital.

531
00:40:46,044 --> 00:40:47,755
I'm sorry, Mr. Long and Mrs. Long.

532
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,800
What happened to Long Yu is on me.

533
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:51,719
I'll take responsibility.

534
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:54,480
You don't even know who you are,

535
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,639
do you?

536
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,199
Take responsibility?

537
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,480
Why don't you get your own life
in order first?

538
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:02,159
You spawn.

539
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:07,440
Young man,

540
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:08,960
take my advice.

541
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:10,840
Be realistic.

542
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:13,480
Mind your own business.

543
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,440
Mr. Wu told you that, right?

544
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,920
This tea

545
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,639
tastes exactly like the one

546
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,039
I had in Mr. Wu's office.

547
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,199
Knowing Long Yu,

548
00:41:33,488 --> 00:41:34,880
she wouldn't have told you about me

549
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,760
in such detail.

550
00:41:37,688 --> 00:41:39,844
Also, your daughter
just came out of surgery.

551
00:41:39,888 --> 00:41:41,400
She hasn't even woken up yet.

552
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,480
You're telling me
to mind my own business

553
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,688
and rushing to take her away.

554
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:46,360
Is that how parents talk?

555
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:46,960
You!

556
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,000
You can call me a spawn.

557
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,440
I don't care.

558
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,920
I don't envy families

559
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:55,149
like yours anyway.

560
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,230
- What?
- Mr. Long and Mrs. Long,

561
00:41:56,239 --> 00:41:57,639
let me make my position clear.

562
00:41:58,159 --> 00:41:59,440
Long Yu is my family.

563
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,039
I won't let you take her away.

564
00:42:02,066 --> 00:42:03,622
- What are you doing?
- Talk properly.

565
00:42:03,622 --> 00:42:04,280
Why hit him?

566
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,159
Old geezer,

567
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:07,840
I'll take that slap

568
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,880
for Long Yu.

569
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:12,039
But you don't deserve to hit me again.

570
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:16,199
Look at this.

571
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,920
This is a Guardianship Agreement.

572
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,000
It's legally notarized.

573
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,199
Long Yu and I

574
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:23,800
are each other's legal guardians.

575
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,400
I travel a lot,

576
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,719
so I asked her to help me sign.

577
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:28,519
I didn't know

578
00:42:28,555 --> 00:42:30,400
she'd also transfer
her guardianship rights

579
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,440
to me.

580
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:33,719
So compared to me,

581
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:36,920
you're the unrelated ones, understand?

582
00:42:36,933 --> 00:42:38,880
We're her biological parents.

583
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,929
She left home as a teenager.

584
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:41,888
All you ever did was send money.
You never took care of her.

585
00:42:41,911 --> 00:42:42,777
Parents, huh?

586
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,280
Since Mr. Wu sent you,

587
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:48,639
tell him this.

588
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:49,639
No one

589
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,079
is taking Long Yu away but me.

590
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,239
Let's eat, Dad.
