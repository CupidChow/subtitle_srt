Why hide a body

41
00:06:03,955 --> 00:06:06,630
(People's Public Security)
inside such an obvious city landmark?

42
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,333

(Human Skeleton Found Inside Stone Lion)
a hidden underbelly in Binchuan,

44
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,120
or an injustice that never cleared up?

45
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,240
The driver responsible for the crash
has been identified,

46
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,630
but the motive is still unclear.

47
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,600
And the identity of the remains

48
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,733
has yet to be confirmed.

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,630
Everyone, what we're dealing with

50
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,480
is more than just a traffic accident.

51
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,800
What matters is

52
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,680
that we get to the bottom

53
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,190
of the truth behind it.

54
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,630
(Penglai Plaza belongs to
the Penglai Group.)

55
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,920
(Over the past few years,)

56
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,630

from other departments.

59
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:45,000
But every investigation
came up short of hard evidence.

60
00:06:45,577 --> 00:06:48,200
I believe this crash is unlikely
to be a coincidence.

61
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,310
For this case,

62
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,266
the provincial department
has issued instructions

63
00:06:51,266 --> 00:06:53,950
to conduct
a comprehensive investigation,

64
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,111
verify every lead,

65
00:06:55,111 --> 00:06:57,630
and punish offenders
strictly according to the law.

66
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,390
In one week,

67
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,510
we must confirm
the identity of the remains

68
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,700
and establish the basic facts
of the case.

Mister, please come down.

79
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:21,830
I'll answer that.

80
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,070
I'm with the municipal
criminal investigation unit.

81
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,600
We've set up a task force

82
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,430

please contact us immediately.

86
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,480
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

87
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,270
As if it would've helped.

88
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,950
You're gone eight months a year.

89
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,720
Should I count on you for money?

90
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,733
Or for you to come back
and look after him?

91
00:08:00,622 --> 00:08:02,711
We found out after the Chinese New Year.

92
00:08:04,444 --> 00:08:05,830
What else do you want to ask?

93
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,390
Gao Feng,

94
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,430
your dad is dead.

95
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,270
Don't you have anything to say?

96
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,480
Foster father.

97
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,600
Fine.

98
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,622
If you won't speak, I will.

99
00:08:31,822 --> 00:08:34,311
From now on, if you don't want
to come back, then don't.

100
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,533
I have my pension.
I can get by on my own.

101
00:08:38,022 --> 00:08:40,111
You don't need to
send money back anymore.

102
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,910
Keep it for yourself.

103
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,600
You never liked staying here anyway.

104
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,790
Go hiking or anything.

105
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,440
Do whatever you like.

106
00:08:50,844 --> 00:08:51,800
Just don't mess up

107
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,390
that I have to go identify your body!

108
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,030
Mom.

109
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:59,910
Foster mother.

110
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,750
When I get old and can't walk anymore,

111
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,870
I'll go to a nursing home.

112
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,270
I'll just pretend I never raised...

113
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,820
(Funeral)

114
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,360
You and your dad, that's it then.

115
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,177
I'm not leaving for the time being.

116
00:09:28,888 --> 00:09:30,888
After I finish dealing with
the old man's funeral,

117
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,960
I'll stay.

118
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,960
I'll book you a body checkup later.

119
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,320
We'll figure out

120
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,320
what to do later.

121
00:10:21,866 --> 00:10:23,022
You're finally free now?

122
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,750
I paid three months of rent for you.

123
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,120
Pay me back.

124
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:35,150
Take it out of my paycheck next month.

125
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,111
You need someone to run the grill,
right?

126
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,000
I'll do it.

127
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,480
Do you even believe what you're saying?

128
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,670
You work two months, save some money,

129
00:10:44,688 --> 00:10:46,333
and then you take off traveling again.

130
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:47,977
Who am I supposed to get the money from?

131
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,720
I'm not lying. I'm not leaving for now.

132
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,390
Gao Feng,

133
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,910
we're

134
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,910
done now.

135
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:04,390
It's not that.

136
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,200
I think something feels off

137
00:11:06,311 --> 00:11:07,440
about the old man's death.

138
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,550
Su Min.

139
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,390
It's me.

140
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,630
Are you insane?

141
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,670
Testing me this late at night?

142
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,200
I need to talk to you.

143
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,550
Did you go home?

144
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,080
I did.

145
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,270
I didn't see you.

146
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:28,320
Didn't you use to go to
the old man's food stall every day?

147
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,270
You said his cooking tasted like home.

148
00:12:30,933 --> 00:12:33,330
He called you his godson.
Why didn't you show up at his funeral?

149
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,510
Stop running around all the time.

150
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,222
Spend more time with your mom.

151
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:39,630
The old man

152
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,030
didn't die of illness, right?

153
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,980
(His good name lives on.
His good spirit endures.)

154
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Well,

155
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,750
I must clean you up nicely.

156
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,720
So you don't complain
to the King of Hell

157
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,750
about having a lazy wife.

158
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,000
You frigging Gao Dahua!

159
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,480
Tell me what happened.

160
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,480
It's been ruled out as a criminal case.

161
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,600
How did Gao Dahua die?

162
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,480
Stop calling him

163
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,750
by his name.

164
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,840
Who's Gao Dahua to you?

165
00:13:32,133 --> 00:13:34,511
He just passed away.
Why are you making a fuss here?

166
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,440
Wait.

167
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,240
If Gao Dahua died of illness,

168
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,911
you wouldn't be telling me all this.

169
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,840
Something's wrong.

170
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,320
We have rules.

171
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,390
Fine. I'll look into it myself.

172
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,390
Don't be ridiculous.

173
00:13:50,555 --> 00:13:52,533
You really think
you're an auxiliary police?

174
00:13:53,444 --> 00:13:54,733
Gao Feng, stand there.

175
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,200
Stop right there.

176
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,150
Gao Feng, ask yourself honestly.

177
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,390
Are you really doing this
because you care about Mr. Gao?

178
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,790
Listen to me.

179
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,200
He's gone. Let it go.

180
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,670
Your family needs a man.

181
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,480
Stop drifting around.

182
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,910
Get to the point.

183
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,840
How did he die?

184
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,320
Dying of illness wasn't bad enough?

185
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,790
Don't brush me off.

186
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,333
You know what kind of person I am.

187
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:44,860
(His good name lives on.
His good spirit endures.)

188
00:14:57,222 --> 00:14:59,400
Cancer patients go through
tremendous pain at the end.

189
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,320
It's unbearable.

190
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,355
(Death Certificate)
If you don't believe me, go in and look.

191
00:15:02,355 --> 00:15:03,933
He scraped the paint off the walls.

192
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,670
He drank paraquat and died.

193
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,790
I'm a light sleeper.

194
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,720
That night, I took a sleeping pill.

195
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,030
But Gao Feng,

196
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,510
I'm actually glad

197
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,030
you asked this yourself.

198
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,960
At least

199
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,910
you still care about him.

200
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,600
The old man loved to drink.

201
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,720
He wasn't himself after drinking.

202
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,320
He hit you, cursed at you,

203
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,790
and even hurt you.

204
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,000
Now that he's gone,

205
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,030
I'll tell you what he never said.

206
00:15:58,311 --> 00:16:00,977
He was dead set against you
going to the police academy back then.

207
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,790
He said you were

208
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,777
trying to use a public job
to track down your birth parents.

209
00:16:04,933 --> 00:16:07,200
Your motive wasn't right,
and you couldn't be a cop.

210
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,022
(You hid my household register,
didn't you?)

211
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,270
Gao Dahua,
you're trying to fool me again?

212
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,150
Let go!

213
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,200
As long as I'm alive,

214
00:16:18,533 --> 00:16:20,688
don't even think about
applying to the police academy.

215
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,750
Forget about becoming a cop.

216
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,320
Stop wasting your effort.

217
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,790
You just want to use the job

218
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,790
to look for your biological parents,

219
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,080
right?

220
00:16:31,088 --> 00:16:32,790
You're scared
I'd become a cop and dig into you?

221
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:33,720
You scoundrel!

222
00:16:33,844 --> 00:16:36,555
(You know where my mother was
and kept it from me all this time!)

223
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,840
(You scoundrel!)

224
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,270
(That's not how it was.)

225
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,360
You know how he met Su Min.

226
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,510
Su Min's parents were police officers.

227
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,270
(They were killed
right in front of his food stall.)

228
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,750
(Your dad only wanted you to be safe.)

229
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,510
Is that wrong?

230
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,480
Calling it suicide sounds awful.

231
00:17:06,244 --> 00:17:07,750
Throughout your dad's whole life,

232
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,750
aside from his bad temper,

233
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,720
he was an upright man.

234
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,480
I've never asked you for much.

235
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,920
If you will do me this favor,

236
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,030
don't tell anyone about his suicide.

237
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,720
Tell people he died of an illness.

238
00:17:25,355 --> 00:17:26,555
Will you do that for me?

239
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,480
He's the one who raised you.

240
00:17:40,555 --> 00:17:41,550
Have some conscience.

241
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,510
See him off properly tomorrow, okay?

242
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,400
(An orphan has three birthdays.)

243
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,960
(The first one is
given by someone else.)

244
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,000
(Gao Dahua picked it for me.)

245
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,044
(He said it was the day
he brought me home.)

246
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,750
(I never)

247
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,000
(took that seriously.)

248
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:21,790
(My foster father said)

249
00:18:22,155 --> 00:18:24,550
(I was abandoned by my birth parents
the day I was born.)

250
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,790
(But after I grew up,
I remembered a melody.)

251
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,880
(I was sure
it was my birth mother's voice.)

252
00:18:34,355 --> 00:18:37,030
(People can remember things
from when they were two or three.)

253
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,311
(My foster father said
it was all in my head.)

254
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,030
(I think)

255
00:18:44,155 --> 00:18:45,955
(you can do this job better than I.)

256
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:50,920
Are you trying to talk me into it again?

257
00:18:51,044 --> 00:18:52,890
You can't just drift around
like this forever.

258
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:55,720
You've got to settle into a proper job.

259
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:57,960
I did try.

260
00:18:58,533 --> 00:19:00,155
I applied to the police academy.

261
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,480
You knew that.

262
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,160
Tell me the truth about my mother.

263
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,270
I'll go find a decent job,

264
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,790
and be a good son, okay?

265
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,790
Stop listening to that nonsense.

266
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,200
Do you really think

267
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,350
I don't know anything?

268
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
When I was five, I said
I wanted to look for my mother.

269
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,350
You beat me up.

270
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,830
You were drunk.

271
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,920
You were mumbling to yourself,
and I heard every word.

272
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,510
Do you really think

273
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,680
I don't remember any of it?

274
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,070
You said my mother suffered so much
to give birth to me.

275
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,510
If I were a baby you picked up,

276
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,440
how would you know
what she went through?

277
00:19:41,533 --> 00:19:43,480
You've been lying to yourself
your whole life.

278
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,510
And now you want me
to live like that too?

279
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,400
Why should I?

280
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,790
Because I'm your father!

281
00:19:52,555 --> 00:19:54,066
You're my foster father.

282
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,200
(He wasn't a clever man.)

283
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,510
(Sometimes he let things slip.)

284
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:06,640
(That's how I knew)

285
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,240
(he was lying to me.)

286
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:14,160
(The second birthday is the one
an orphan chooses for himself.)

287
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,590
(I chose April 1st.)

288
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,200
(That birthday)

289
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,200
(is there to remind me)

290
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,030
(that I was fooled.)

291
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:28,550
(The third birthday is
an orphan's real birthday.)

292
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,400
(That's the question about who I am.)

293
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,480
(Who am I?
I've been chasing for thirty years.)

294
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,960
(I may never get the answer.)

295
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,350
You're Gao Feng?

296
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,640
Gao Dahua is your dad, right?

297
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,480
Who are you?

298
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,880
The police won't let me say.

299
00:20:48,911 --> 00:20:50,200
But I think you deserve to know.

300
00:20:50,311 --> 00:20:51,790
Your father didn't die of illness.

301
00:21:22,533 --> 00:21:25,580
(Death Certificate: The deceased
died by suicide due to other causes.)

302
00:21:39,422 --> 00:21:40,880
Have you got any common courtesy?

303
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,310
The music's blaring.

304
00:21:44,288 --> 00:21:46,355
There's something wrong
with Gao Dahua's death.

305
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,480
It was suicide,

306
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,790
but not because of his illness.

307
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,240
Care to explain?

308
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,200
Why do you think that?

309
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,350
It says "other causes," not illness.

310
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:14,333
(Due to other causes.)
(The time also doesn't match.)

311
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:16,680
(If it were suicide caused by illness,)

312
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:19,066
they wouldn't need three days
to look into it.

313
00:22:19,133 --> 00:22:20,920
(That woman said the police
went to see her.)

314
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,933
(If Gao Dahua couldn't
take the pain anymore,)

315
00:22:22,977 --> 00:22:24,666
(it wouldn't drag
other people into this.)

316
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,790
I asked Su Min.

317
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,070
And I asked the old lady today.

318
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,110
Her story

319
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,830
sounded rehearsed,

320
00:22:32,866 --> 00:22:34,622
like she'd been prepared for me.

321
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:38,160
Su Min called her the moment he saw me.

322
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,400
I checked her phone.

323
00:22:41,311 --> 00:22:42,822
There's something going on here.

324
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,400
Everyone's keeping things from me.

325
00:22:54,511 --> 00:22:56,333
When this place was being renovated,

326
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,310
we were still together.

327
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:06,066
I thought you were someone

328
00:23:06,066 --> 00:23:07,644
who didn't care about anything.

329
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,270
Turns out

330
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:11,977
you care quite a lot
about your foster father.

331
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:15,750
What I care about

332
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:18,590
is the answer he kept buried inside.

333
00:23:20,288 --> 00:23:22,311
The way he died was far from normal.

334
00:23:22,511 --> 00:23:24,177
It must have something to do with me.

335
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,680
Was he running away, was he afraid,

336
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:29,960
or something else?

337
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,680
It's nice

338
00:23:32,266 --> 00:23:33,866
to have someone you care about.

339
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,510
You probably won't get what I'm saying.

340
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,030
You have parents.

341
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,510
Having them doesn't mean you care.

342
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:53,000
And caring doesn't mean you have them.

343
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:57,220
(Gao Dahua. Send a message)

344
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:01,260

(Around noon, Mr. Gao called me.)

391
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,240
Mr. Gao, someone died today.
It's chaos out there.

392
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,720
Don't go out.

393
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,440
Songjiang Garden.

394
00:27:27,888 --> 00:27:29,777
What are you going there for, Mr. Gao?

395
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,790
Are you meeting

396
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,200
some old lady to dance?

397
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:34,550
Dong,

398
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,750
when you come to eat at my place,

399
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,070
I'll give you extra meat.

400
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,350
Alright, Mr. Gao.

401
00:28:01,711 --> 00:28:04,270
(He got out of the car
when we reached Songjiang Garden.)

402
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,310
That's all I know.

403
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,160
Civil servant.

404
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,420

405
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,680
That's good.

406
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:27,110
Very well. Take this phone number.

407
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,577
Ladies, stop dancing for a moment.

408
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,680
(Reward Offered, Seeking Info.)
Over there too.

409
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,480
(Reward for any clues.)
People at the matchmaking corner,

410
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,310
please gather around.

411
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,880
Sir, stop playing for a bit.

412
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,160
Please gather around here.

413
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,350
We're offering a reward.

414
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,830
A devoted son is looking for
his father's old friends.

Any leads are welcome.

416
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,750
- Gao Dahua was a cook.
- Gao Dahua?

417
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:44,960
I don't know this man.

418
00:28:44,977 --> 00:28:47,111
If you've eaten at his food stall,
you'll remember him.

419
00:28:47,111 --> 00:28:47,880
Please ask around.

420
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,750
Please ask around. You'll recognize him.

421
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,830
Are you offering a reward?

422
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,110
Yeah.

423
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,000
Be careful!

424
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:11,240
Gao Feng!

425
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,550
You're wearing me out.

426
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:36,030
I drank too much yesterday.

427
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,110
I hit you hard.

428
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:46,070
From now on, I won't stop you

429
00:30:46,155 --> 00:30:47,688
from looking for your parents.

430
00:30:48,022 --> 00:30:49,666
Just don't run around on your own.

431
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:52,088
(There are traffickers out there.)

432
00:30:52,488 --> 00:30:54,800
(Your mother suffered so much
to give birth to you.)

433
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,510
(Don't let yourself get taken away.)

434
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,550
You hear me?

435
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,440
What exactly

436
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,310
are you investigating?

437
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,680
Gao Feng, go home and see your dad off.

438
00:32:25,244 --> 00:32:27,288
Your mom has something to say to you.

439
00:32:32,288 --> 00:32:34,440
(Police Report Receipt)
Gao Dahua had another woman.

440
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,510
I only found out a few months ago.

441
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,830
He gave her one hundred thousand yuan
a few days before he passed.

442
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:43,030
That money was
for his final round of chemotherapy.

443
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,270
It's all written in this report.

444
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:49,590
We suspect the woman was a scammer.

445
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,310
The police will handle

446
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,310
the money issue.

447
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,720
Don't worry.

448
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,000
Alright.

449
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:02,350
Call Dong and the others in.
It's time to see your dad off.

450
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,960
You're all trying to fool me, huh?

451
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,169
Gao Dahua spent his whole life
cooking at a stove.

452
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:17,440
You're telling me he had an affair?

453
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,160
Gao Feng.

454
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,880
Your generation

455
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,240
treats reputation like it's everything.

456
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,920
You'd even make up a lie like this.

457
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,550
What are you really hiding from me?

458
00:33:34,933 --> 00:33:36,920
This has something to do with me,
doesn't it?

459
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,640
Gao Feng.

460
00:33:38,155 --> 00:33:40,444
That woman is my biological mother,
right?

461
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,350
My mom came to look for me, right?

462
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,750
She came to find me, right?

463
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:44,830
He's dead.

464
00:33:44,933 --> 00:33:46,680
What could be more important than that?

465
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,920
What I care about is how he died!

466
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,550
What was he afraid of
that he had to hide the way he died?

467
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,680
You scoundrel!

468
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:00,920
Madam Zhang.

469
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,400
Go outside

470
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,110
and see if everything's ready.

471
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,280
It's alright.

472
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,710
Don't worry.

473
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,000
Did the woman who gave birth to you

474
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,510
even want you?

475
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,710
Do you know what she looks like?

476
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,070
Is she really that perfect in your eyes?

477
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,550
Did she never do anything wrong?

478
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:36,800
Gao Feng,

479
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,230
just see your dad off properly,

480
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,800
please.

481
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,030
Let me talk to him alone.

482
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,480
Please.

483
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:41,940
(Hearse)

484
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,760
Old man,

485
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,400
we never saw eye to eye.

486
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,550
I know

487
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,670
you probably wished

488
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,030
that just once, I'd call you dad

489
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:57,440
loud and clear

490
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,200
in front of family and friends.

491
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,630
I'm sorry.

492
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,710
I just can't say it.

493
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,840
You worked yourself to the bone

494
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,840
to raise me.

495
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,400
(But why)

496
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,360
(did you always)

497
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:30,920
(dodge my questions?)

498
00:36:32,733 --> 00:36:33,840
(I won't get the chance)

499
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,480
(to repay you.)

500
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:38,960
(Still,)

501
00:36:39,333 --> 00:36:41,488
(I have to see you off
on your last journey.)

502
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,150
(Old man...)

503
00:36:44,888 --> 00:36:46,000
(Rest in peace.)

504
00:37:32,777 --> 00:37:34,150
(Your dad didn't die of illness.)

505
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,510
(He drank paraquat and died.)

506
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,190
(That's not true.)

507
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:39,170
(But if anyone asks,
tell them he died of illness.)

508
00:37:39,177 --> 00:37:40,666
(No. I think you deserve to know.)

509
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,230
(The police will
handle the money issue.)

510
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,444
(The police won't let me say.)

511
00:37:44,466 --> 00:37:45,360
(Something is off.)

512
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,320
(Not a big deal,
but it's humiliating if it gets out.)

513
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,400
(Are you doing this
because you care about Mr. Gao?)

514
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:52,510
(He's gone. Let it go.)

515
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:07,180
(Taxi)

516
00:38:07,222 --> 00:38:09,580
This car's been parked by
Songjiang Garden the whole time.

517
00:38:09,644 --> 00:38:10,670
It hasn't moved, right?

518
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,550
No.

519
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:15,880
If I'm right,

520
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,840
we may already have the answer.

521
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,670
Really?

522
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:24,800
Get off.

523
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:30,920
Mr. Gao's lover was there?

524
00:38:30,955 --> 00:38:32,590
Whether she was his lover, I don't know.

525
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,190
But she's been following me.

526
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:38,230
So when you had me shouting at the park,

527
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:39,880
that was a smokescreen.

528
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,230
Feng, that's...

529
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:41,960
Keep it down.

530
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:47,400
Look at his.

531
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,880
Parking fees at Songjiang Garden
are expensive.

532
00:38:50,133 --> 00:38:51,510
Would a cabbie stop there to rest?

533
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,590
No way.

534
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,030
Feng.

535
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:09,150
What is it?

536
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,190
Feng!

537
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,400
That's the car.

538
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:19,800
Go. Go after it.

539
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,030
Where is she?

540
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,480
She got out.

541
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:39,030
She had me drive around to stall you.

542
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:41,320
You think you could've caught me?

543
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
What did she look like?

544
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,070
Where did she get out?

545
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,440
She paid me.

546
00:40:45,488 --> 00:40:46,760
I've got to keep my mouth shut.

547
00:40:47,155 --> 00:40:48,320
But she did say one thing.

548
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:51,190
Everything you want to know
