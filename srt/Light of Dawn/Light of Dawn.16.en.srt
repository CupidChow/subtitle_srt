1
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,420
=Light of Dawn=

2
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,159
That van that suddenly rushed out.

3
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,480
We have already coordinated
with the traffic authorities

4
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,150
and conducted
a series of investigations.

5
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:10,620
Based on the current witness statements
and physical evidence,

6
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,780
it was indeed drunk driving.

7
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,880
There is no evidence
that anyone was behind it.

8
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,919
It has been preliminarily
determined to be an accident.

9
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,830
However, Gao Feng did see

10
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,900
Xu Zhiyang get into a conflict
with several people.

11
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,090
The nearby surveillance footage
is still under review.

12
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,680
The hospital has informed us

13
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,800
that Xu Zhiyang may

14
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,080
never wake up again.

15
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,439
They told us to prepare for the worst.

16
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:50,879
I need you to stay here and keep watch

17
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,690
for the next couple of days.

18
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:10,439
You must be tired.

19
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,199
Go back and get some rest.

20
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:16,599
I will stay here.

21
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,360
Was it you?

22
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,599
Did you cause Xu Zhiyang's car accident?

23
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:23,660
What are you talking about?

24
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,800
A car just happened to pass by there,

25
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,719
and the driver
just happened to be drunk.

26
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,990
Isn't that too much of a coincidence?

27
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,560
It was not a coincidence.

28
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:34,919
It was an accident, purely an accident.

29
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:39,120
Even a tiger will not harm its own cubs.

30
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,280
A traffic accident.

31
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,400
The traffic police
will reach a final conclusion.

32
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,759
Everything I talked about
with Yang that night

33
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,680
has already been told to the police.

34
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,479
I do not believe you.

35
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:05,039
I will wait for him
to wake up and tell me himself.

36
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,599
If you lied to me,

37
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,970
I will never forgive you
for the rest of my life.

38
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:18,879
And I will never forgive myself either.

39
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,000
Dad will never lie to you again.

40
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,639
Xu Zhiyang is in a coma.

41
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,639
The doctors
are not sure if he will wake up.

42
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,800
Mr. Wu.

43
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,480
Do you want him to wake up?

44
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,800
That depends on fate.

45
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,880
(He forced me to do everything.)

46
00:04:51,881 --> 00:04:53,860
(It was Wu Guohao.
It has always been him.)

47
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:17,240
What went wrong?

48
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:19,240
That was on me.

49
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,319
I really had no idea
a car would suddenly rush out.

50
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:24,920
It was an accident.

51
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:28,319
An accident?
Did I ask you for an accident?

52
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,439
I told you to bring him home properly.

53
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,399
I told you to bring him home safely.

54
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,560
I told you to make him listen.

55
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,439
Do you understand?

56
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,079
No accidents.

57
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,560
I wanted him to live well.

58
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:41,319
I wanted him to be my son.

59
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,839
You have disappointed me too much.

60
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,160
Too much. You have
disappointed me too much.

61
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,399
You have really disappointed me.

62
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,759
What was the last thing he said?

63
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,839
He said,

64
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,439
karma has come.

65
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:17,839
Do not wake me up.

66
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,480
Who told you to come in?
Do not open the curtains...

67
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,360
Get up.

68
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,920
Go take a shower.

69
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,800
I brought you something good to eat.

70
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:08,560
Come on.

71
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:09,439
Be good.

72
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,639
There is food.

73
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:16,079
All right.

74
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,690
When you were little
and learning to walk,

75
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:25,279
you kept falling down.

76
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,800
That really hurt.

77
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,990
You were in pain when you fell,

78
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,639
and I felt it too.

79
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,279
But back then, I felt so happy.

80
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,560
I just thought,

81
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,519
if my son falls one more time,

82
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,480
the next time
he will definitely learn to walk.

83
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:44,800
Right?

84
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:48,279
And that was true, right?

85
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:50,519
Look at you now.

86
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,720
So tall. So handsome.

87
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:57,000
Running and walking,

88
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:59,100
you have been going
for more than twenty years.

89
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:03,560
Feng.

90
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:06,040
If something major happens again,

91
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:07,839
I...

92
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,040
I will not be able
to hold you back anymore.

93
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,240
But remember this.

94
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,639
I will always stand behind you.

95
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:22,839
Here.

96
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,800
Take it.

97
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,440
Mom.

98
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:37,559
Everything I have done,

99
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,840
was it all wrong?

100
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,320
Otherwise,

101
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,519
why is it that

102
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:44,679
I am always one step away?

103
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,440
Feng.

104
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,279
Do not worry.

105
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,960
I will walk this last step with you.

106
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:01,879
Eat.

107
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,919
You tore my family apart.

108
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,159
Are you satisfied now?

109
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,639
Let me be clear.

110
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:53,639
From now on,
I will handle my family myself.

111
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,679
Dad, let us go.

112
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:12,600
As for Xu Zhiyang's traffic accident,

113
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,600
we are still investigating
whether the driver

114
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,120
had intent to deliberately kill.

115
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,750
Based on our preliminary findings,

116
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,990
the confession letter Xu Zhiyang
withdrew from the bank

117
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:22,759
matches Xu Peng's handwriting.

118
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,639
However, the letter
Xu Peng left for his child

119
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:27,240
has no date or signature,

120
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,080
and the wording is incomplete.

121
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,759
We therefore believe this
is not the full letter.

122
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,440
We retrieved surveillance footage
from the area

123
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,990
Xu Zhiyang passed through
before the collision.

124
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:37,879
Because this alley

125
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:39,679
had a history of robbery and theft,

126
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,240
the cameras
were equipped with audio recording.

127
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,600
Our technical team restored the audio.

128
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,840
The following is part
of what Xu Zhiyang said.

129
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,399
My dad said you are a satan.

130
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,639
Everything leaves a trace.

131
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,960
Dragging me back will change nothing.

132
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:55,790
As long as we are still here,

133
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,559
every sin you committed,

134
00:10:58,559 --> 00:10:59,799
will never be erased.

135
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,720
Wu Guohao.

136
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:04,159
Your reckoning has come.

137
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:05,480
Wu Guohao

138
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:07,399
has now been barred
from leaving Binchuan.

139
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:09,440
All of his communication devices

140
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,380
will also be monitored
in accordance with the law.

141
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:13,559
Director.

142
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:14,879
Leaders.

143
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,320
Although all current criminal evidence

144
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,440
points to Xu Peng,

145
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,039
Wu Guohao still remains a major suspect.

146
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:23,039
Given the recent developments

147
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:24,240
and the existing leads,

148
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,720
this case cannot be closed for now.

149
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,960
I would like to request more time

150
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:31,639
so we can continue investigating

151
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:34,159
any potential crimes
involving Wu Guohao.

152
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,080
All right.

153
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,039
Additionally, Gao Feng, who has been
assisting our investigation,

154
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:39,080
is waiting outside.

155
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,159
Could we have him
share his thoughts with everyone?

156
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:44,840
All right. Let him in.

157
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:46,519
Okay.

158
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:50,879
Gao Feng

159
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:52,279
may very well know

160
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,759
some leads we are not aware of.

161
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:57,600
Gao.

162
00:11:58,799 --> 00:11:59,360
Come in.

163
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,600
Thank you very much.

164
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:08,240
Please share your thoughts

165
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,519
freely with us.

166
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,480
Hello, leaders.

167
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,399
Actually, my thinking is very simple.

168
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,240
At this point in the case,

169
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,440
I am not the only one seeking the truth.

170
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,840
Wu Feifei is as well.

171
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:26,399
I believe that at this stage,

172
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,840
Wu Feifei is our biggest breakthrough.

173
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,879
From now on,
I will handle my family's affairs myself.

174
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,360
Then do you still trust Wu Feifei?

175
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,759
She once stood

176
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,080
by her father's side more than once.

177
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,480
I can understand her.

178
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,440
Not everyone is willing to believe

179
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,890
that their own father is a criminal.

180
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,960
And not everyone has the courage
to turn against family for justice,

181
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,759
especially when

182
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,290
it is a father and daughter who have
lived together for so many years.

183
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,240
This raises blood sugar.

184
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,320
The medicine is gone.

185
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:28,000
Give me another injection.

186
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,840
You have not given me one
in a long time.

187
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,360
If we do find evidence

188
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,240
that Wu Guohao
was involved in the crimes,

189
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,480
Wu Feifei would inevitably
be implicated.

190
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,000
Do you think she would take that risk?

191
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:53,240
I am an orphan.

192
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:56,320
I was raised by the Gao family.

193
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:58,519
I used to imagine who my parents were,

194
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,879
and what another kind
of life might be like.

195
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,679
That is why I kept leaving,

196
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,279
searching for the truth,

197
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,440
searching for what my life could become.

198
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,919
But Wu Feifei is different from me.

199
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,240
Her roots are here.

200
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:13,720
Now those roots are shaken.

201
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,500
Her mother died in the attic,
and her husband is still in a coma.

202
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:17,960
She cannot remain indifferent.

203
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:19,279
Wu Feifei

204
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,399
wants the truth
more than anyone right now.

205
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:46,799
Leaders,

206
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,679
I know my words
may not carry much weight,

207
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,279
but

208
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:53,159
I sincerely hope you will

209
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,559
give her one more chance.

210
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,399
In fact, Wu Feifei
has always been braver than I am.

211
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,279
I believe
she will make the right choice.

212
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:56,600
Do you know
what you just injected me with?

213
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,679
Feifei,

214
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:11,360
when did you put all these things

215
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,360
around me?

216
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:21,759
I forced Xu Peng
to do many of those things.

217
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,679
Are you satisfied now?

218
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:26,960
So it really was you.

219
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,440
How can you be so terrifying?

220
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,480
Terrifying?

221
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,720
In the home
where I raised you all these years,

222
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,240
you planted recording devices,

223
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:42,360
and you doubted me?

224
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,799
Are you still my daughter?

225
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:48,840
Is this still your home?

226
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:54,000
Haven't you been hiding
behind family all along

227
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,320
and lying to me the whole time?

228
00:16:58,039 --> 00:16:59,840
All I want is the truth.

229
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,679
The truth.

230
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:02,639
The truth...

231
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,279
So now you want that truth too?

232
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:09,079
Hongyue, Qu Meng,

233
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,440
Xu Peng, Xu Zhiyang, Gao Feng,

234
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,799
I do not care what they did to me.

235
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:18,960
But today,

236
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,279
why are you standing against me too?

237
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:26,960
When you did all of this,

238
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:32,279
you should have known
this day would come.

239
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,599
Turn yourself in.

240
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,720
What are you going to do?

241
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:50,880
Report your own father?

242
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:53,880
On what grounds?

243
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,880
What evidence do you have?

244
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:00,559
Just this groundless hatred of yours?

245
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,920
Do you know what happens
to people who hate me?

246
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:09,640
What do you mean?

247
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,359
Are you planning to come after me too?

248
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:16,559
Feifei,

249
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,559
you are furious
and not thinking straight.

250
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,640
You are my daughter.

251
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:26,920
You and I share the same blood.

252
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,279
The same blood

253
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:36,599
does not blur the line
between right and wrong.

254
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:39,240
Were they wrong?

255
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,400
My husband.

256
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:42,599
Gao Feng.

257
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:45,000
They did nothing wrong.

258
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,519
I was the one who was wrong.

259
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,720
I was wrong.

260
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:58,680
I believed you for so many years.

261
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,799
It was all a lie.

262
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:08,960
You want the truth?

263
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:12,039
Then I will give you the truth.

264
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,540
=Episode 16=
=Truth=

265
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:29,079
Help. Help me.

266
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:37,900
(Days before the Penglai Plaza crash)

267
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,039
In this lifetime,

268
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,519
every breath is numbered.

269
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,440
Do not sigh.

270
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:17,000
Each sigh costs you one breath.
It brings bad luck.

271
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:20,359
When has luck

272
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:22,599
ever been on my side?

273
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,079
Then you should sigh even less.

274
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:42,160
Gao Feng's door lock is broken.

275
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,119
Fix it for him.

276
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:49,640
When should I do it?

277
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:55,960
Gao Dahua.

278
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,480
Are you

279
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,000
really avoiding talking to me now?

280
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,720
Who is it?

281
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,279
Who is it?

282
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,680
Gao Dahua.

283
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,260
Have you started digging around again?

284
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,799
Can you stop looking?

285
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:27,440
I am heading out for a bit.

286
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:30,440
Mix the dough.

287
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,690
Wait for me to come back
and season the filling.

288
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,880
Take a good look.

289
00:23:57,759 --> 00:23:59,279
Do you still recognize me?

290
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:08,599
You are Hong...

291
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,839
Long time no see.

292
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:15,680
Why is it you?

293
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:22,319
Who did you think it would be?

294
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,960
Qu Meng?

295
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:38,240
Those posts you made online
looking for Qu Meng,

296
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:40,039
what were you trying to prove?

297
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,759
Why did you not
even dare write her name?

298
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,880
You kept it so vague.

299
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,440
I am afraid I was the only one
who could understand it.

300
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:56,799
You probably did not expect me
to come looking for you.

301
00:24:58,359 --> 00:24:59,039
Where is Qu Meng?

302
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:01,559
Why is she not with you?

303
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:20,880
She is dead.

304
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:23,640
You did not know?

305
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,079
Qu Meng

306
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,319
has been dead for a long time.

307
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:38,720
Dead?

308
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,240
Dead?

309
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:48,720
Then

310
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,160
everything I did was for nothing.

311
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,160
Not for nothing.

312
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,400
That missing person notice

313
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,039
brought old acquaintances like us

314
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:03,559
back together again.

315
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:09,880
I came back this time
because I need your help.

316
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,440
Are you short on money?

317
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:15,039
If you are,

318
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:17,440
I can lend you some.

319
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,720
There is no time.

320
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:24,319
Brain cancer.

321
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,759
It cannot be cured.

322
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,400
I came back to Binchuan this time

323
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,039
to report it to the police.

324
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:38,119
You and I work together

325
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:40,079
and tell them that the stone lion...

326
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:40,799
Ms. Hong.

327
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,519
Ms. Hong.

328
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,160
A lot has changed in Binchuan,

329
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:50,000
but some things have not.

330
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:51,720
Look at you now.

331
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,680
There are some things

332
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,759
you cannot change.

333
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,960
It is useless.

334
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,119
Useless.

335
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:05,119
Where is Gao Feng?

336
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,839
Where is Gao Feng?

337
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,000
I want to see Gao Feng.

338
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:38,279
Do not touch Gao Feng.

339
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,920
Mr. Xu has been dead for so long.

340
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,519
No one will believe you.

341
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,559
Besides, there are so many stories
about that stone lion.

342
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:48,119
You have no evidence.

343
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:50,880
Why would the police believe you?

344
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,759
You are wrong.

345
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,240
This is no longer like our time.

346
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,200
There are many people, many things,

347
00:27:58,319 --> 00:27:59,200
and those truths

348
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:01,960
you never wanted anyone to know

349
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,759
should finally come to light.

350
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:05,440
But I am afraid

351
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:07,599
you will not be able to change anything.

352
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,039
Gao Dahua.

353
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,640
Good deeds dissolve slowly,
evil is repaid first.

354
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:17,799
Retribution has arrived.

355
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,519
This is my retribution.

356
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,720
You will face yours too.

357
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:27,599
The debts we owe must all be paid.

358
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,920
You, me, and Wu Guohao included!

359
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,599
None of us can escape!

360
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,190
If you dare touch Gao Feng,

361
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:38,880
I will tell Wu Guohao

362
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,400
that you are not dead,

363
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,480
that you have come back.

364
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,880
That you are not dead!

365
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,960
You knew it all along

366
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:47,000
that Wu Guohao was the real boss.

367
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,559
You knew it!

368
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,200
I did not!

369
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:48,920
You knew it!

370
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,359
- I did not know!
- You knew!

371
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,440
Stop looking for Gao Feng.

372
00:28:57,799 --> 00:28:59,359
And do not come looking for me again!

373
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:26,319
Did you find Qu Meng?

374
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:32,960
Do not overthink it.

375
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,920
I am asking if you found Qu Meng.

376
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,359
Do not ask what you should not.

377
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,480
Gao Dahua.

378
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:47,200
Gao Feng is my son.

379
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:49,279
If anyone tries
to take Gao Feng away from me,

380
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:50,400
I will fight them to the end.

381
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:52,000
Do not flatter yourself.

382
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,920
All these years,
you treated him like your own.

383
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:00,759
But did he ever
see you as his real mother?

384
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:03,490
He is out there every day
looking for his birth mother!

385
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:08,279
He is my son!

386
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,640
He is my son, Zhang Jing's son!

387
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:17,880
Rest assured.

388
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:20,880
My son

389
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,720
will always belong to the Gao family.

390
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,599
No matter what price I have to pay.

391
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,519
Why did you come here?

392
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,480
These past years
have not been easy for you either.

393
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,559
A mother unable to see her child.

394
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:25,440
Look.

395
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:27,559
Today, Feifei

396
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:30,079
looks so happy.

397
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:50,200
You know our family's situation.

398
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,240
This is all I have.

399
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:03,839
Take all of it.

400
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,599
Take it all.

401
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,880
If you want treatment, get treated.

402
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,960
If you do not, then go travel somewhere.

403
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,240
I am already half dead anyway.

404
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:29,960
Gao Dahua.

405
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,279
Hiding it and lying
about it your whole life,

406
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,680
can you really hold your head up?

407
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,920
Whatever happened in the past,

408
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,119
it is all over now.

409
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:48,240
As long as the child
can live well today,

410
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,799
whether I can hold my head up

411
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,240
does not matter.

412
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,519
Back then, it was Qu Meng who chose you.

413
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:11,440
But you were a coward.

414
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,240
I was not.

415
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:16,640
At that time,

416
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:18,839
I was forced into it too.

417
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,000
My daughter,

418
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,359
I've seen her.

419
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:31,839
Thank you.

420
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:33,319
Gao Feng.

421
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:36,160
I have to tell him the truth.

422
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,440
You are asking
for my life by doing this.

423
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,480
(Gao Dahua.)

424
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,319
(I already gave you a chance to atone.)

425
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,639
(Gao Dahua was right.)

426
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,159
(If I go to the police rashly,)

427
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,079
(Wu Guohao will definitely
shift all the blame)

428
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:43,880
(onto Xu Peng.)

429
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,280
(Right now,)

430
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,920
(I cannot even say clearly who I am.)

431
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:54,360
(This has to be made public.)

432
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,000
(Gao Feng, Muke Club.)

433
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,519
(Xu Zhiyang's lover, Wang Dan)
(It must be connected to Wu Guohao.)

434
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:24,800
You are awake.

435
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,639
Looks like you are recovering well.

436
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:33,199
The medical facilities here
are quite good.

437
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,719
You should focus on getting better.

438
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,519
After my daughter's wedding is over,

439
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,960
we will let you out.

440
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,960
But once you are out,

441
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:48,360
the loan sharks
will come looking for you.

442
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:51,440
Whatever they do to you,

443
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:54,920
will no longer concern me.

444
00:36:57,079 --> 00:36:59,119
Shouldn't you help me pay off the debts

445
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,639
and get me settled?

446
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:04,920
Those debts were your own doing.

447
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:08,519
Once you are running around like a mad dog,
hiding from creditors,

448
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,239
you will not have time

449
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:12,960
to harass my daughter and son-in-law.

450
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,039
You picked the wrong opponent.

451
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:22,840
Do you really not know your own limits?

452
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,639
After this accidental fall of yours,

453
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,360
we arranged a full medical examination.

454
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,880
We found you were pregnant.

455
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,400
No idea whose child it was.

456
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,920
That was dangerous.

457
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,239
So,

458
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,039
for your own health,

459
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,039
we removed your uterus.

460
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,960
That is for the best.

461
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,800
At least you will not
harm anyone else again.

462
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,400
Recover well.

463
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:50,360
Did you understand everything
I just said?

464
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,920
Why are you telling me all this?

465
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,239
We will help you
get out of the hospital.

466
00:38:58,199 --> 00:39:01,079
Take this to the police.

467
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:07,199
Report it together
with the Wu family's detention

468
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:09,360
and abuse of you.

469
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:13,400
Madam.

470
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,990
This alone does not count
as evidence, does it?

471
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,599
Of course this alone is not enough.

472
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,440
There is still the most crucial part.

473
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:28,000
I will do that myself.

474
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:31,360
What is it?

475
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:34,000
(For reasons I cannot explain,)

476
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,559
(I took a huge risk
and told Wang Dan the plan,)

477
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,639
(a woman I had only met once.)

478
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:45,639
(Somehow, I felt)

479
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:50,039
(that many of us were heading toward
the same ending.)

480
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,599
(This is my plan,)

481
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,000
(and perhaps our fate as well.)

482
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:02,480
Do not joke with me, Madam.

483
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:04,390
If anyone goes, it should be me.

484
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:06,559
Let me do it.

485
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,920
I have been looking for a way
to get back at Wu Guohao.

486
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:14,559
And after the crash,

487
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,880
what cards do you still have?

488
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:18,519
After all, the blame

489
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:20,200
has already been
thrown out by Wu Guohao.

490
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:21,760
That child

491
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,119
will cling to what happened
to her mother and never let go.

492
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:33,039
You do not have children.

493
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,119
You would not understand.

494
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,239
I do understand.

495
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,039
There were several times when I,

496
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:47,920
almost became a mother myself.

497
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,000
And now Wu Guohao

498
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:54,559
has destroyed even my last bit of hope.

499
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,960
So what if I end up shattered?

500
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:05,760
I have spent my whole life
stuck in the gutter,

501
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:09,599
crushed by money thrown in my face.

502
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,280
I deserve to stand tall once.

503
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:17,559
Just let me go.

504
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,320
This is my choice.

505
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,519
It is not worth it.

506
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:28,320
It really is not worth it.

507
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,920
For a long time, I also believed

508
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,199
that Qu Meng

509
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,719
did it for a man.

510
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,760
But later I realized

511
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:46,840
that she did not.

512
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:51,119
She did it to prove

513
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,440
the cause and consequence
of good and evil.

514
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,000
Tell me.

515
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,280
Do you think I resemble Qu Meng?

516
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:22,360
No.

517
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,360
She lived more bravely than any of us.

518
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,119
(Are you not looking for Qu Meng?)

519
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,480
