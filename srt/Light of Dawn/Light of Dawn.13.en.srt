=Light of Dawn=

2
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,510
Let him alone.

3
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,870
Making this decision

4
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,790
wasn't easy.

5
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,790
Put yourself in his shoes.

6
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,040
If one day,

7
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,280
something happened to me,

8
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,360
would you turn me in?

9
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,630
I'm saying if.

10
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,870
I've always kept this tape.

11
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,470
I've never shown it to you.

12
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,400
Today, let's watch it together.

13
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,240
Mr. Xu didn't have much hair
from a young age.

14
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,630
He had a big head.

15
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,240
It was filled with wisdom.

16
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,190
The woman beside him is Qu Meng.

17
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,310
She's Gao Feng's mother.

18
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,240
She was very close to your mother.

19
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,150
It was as if they were twins.

20
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,630
But I still couldn't figure out

21
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,520
why they did

22
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,430
what they did.

23
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,240
Dad, I told you
to cut your ties with the past.

24
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,960
Now, you're bringing up
all these old issues again.

25
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,080
Can we still have
a heart-to-heart conversation?

26
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,080
Of course.

27
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,520
Come, try to steal the ball.

28
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,800
Go on.

29
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,070
Come, steal the ball.

30
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:52,920
Come.

31
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,660
(Grave of Xu Peng)

32
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,100
With the minor crime you've committed,

33
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,070
you should've been released long ago

34
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,880
since your father-in-law
was an influential figure.

35
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,720
Just when all the evidence

36
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,070
points to your father,

37
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,630
they release you.

38
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,460
Isn't it too much of a coincidence?

39
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,830
You're Gao Feng, huh?

40
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,920
Sometimes, I'm also curious

41
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,000
as to the kind of person your father is.

42
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,720
If he did commit all those crimes,

43
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,510
would Wu Guohao
even commit arson and murder

44
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,600
20 years later to destroy evidence

45
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,480
and cover his tracks?

46
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,120
What exactly are you trying to say here?
What's your goal?

47
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,360
I think they must be
close to each other.

48
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,870
Gao Feng, I know
my family has let you down.

49
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,920
We know our faults now.

50
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,310
Please spare us.

51
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,270
Okay?

52
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,100
I heard that you're going
to be a father soon.

53
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,720
At this moment, you came back
to take a look at your father

54
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,920
and try to figure out
the kind of person he is.

55
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,490
That's pretty meaningful.

56
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,040
Fine.

57
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,390
For my child's sake,

58
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,360
please spare us,

59
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,040
okay?

60
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,800
If you truly care about your child,

61
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,360
you should think this through.

62
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,630
Don't be like Wu Feifei.

63
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,750
She lived in obscurity.

64
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,940
(Grave of Xu Peng)

65
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,950
The investigation into
the 1009 traffic collision,

66
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:47,120
the corpse discovered at Penglai Plaza,
the arson in the attic,

67
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,800
and related incidents

68
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,120
have now largely been clarified.

69
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,100
According to the testimony
of witness Li Churan,

70
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:55,360
the key individual Madam He colluded
with Wang Dan to crash into the statue,

71
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,240
thereby drawing police attention,

72
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,560
stirring public sentiment,

73
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,750
and luring another key witness,
Gao Feng, into the scheme.

74
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,950
The aim was to expose
the illegal transactions

75
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,480
involving the well-known
entertainment venue,

76
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,990
Binchuan International Club,
during the 1990s.

77
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,480
Other departments
working jointly on the case

78
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,670
have begun follow-up investigations.

79
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,160
Should any direct connection
be found between them

80
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,630
and the International Club's
illegal dealings

81
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,000
we will take control measures

82
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,040
against the Penglai Group

83
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,390
and the relevant individuals
at the earliest opportunity.

84
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,600
In a second examination of the scene
where the body was found,

85
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,510
forensic technicians identified

86
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,430
a previously overlooked clue.

87
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,310
Due to the complex cement structure
at the base of the square statue,

88
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:33,000
an item resembling a belt buckle
was concealed as exhibit.

89
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,440
Previously, forensic experts
had conducted multiple examinations.

90
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,030
By analyzing the fracture injuries
on the cadaver's hyoid bone,

91
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,260
(Case Report)
they preliminarily determined

92
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,360
that the weapon that caused
Qu Meng's death was a belt.

93
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,870
Everyone,

94
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,510
let me just say this upfront.

95
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,870
You guys know
how influential Penglai Group is.

96
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,840
Once we start digging,
more dirt is bound to come out.

97
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,120
In 2018, a national campaign was held

98
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,630
to combat organized crime
and eliminate evil forces.

99
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,120
If Penglai Group
is confirmed to be involved,

100
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,240
this time,

101
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,630
we have to get to the bottom of it.

102
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,840
No matter if it's the past

103
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,150
or the present,

104
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,790
we must ensure that facts are clear,

105
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,490
conclusive evidence is obtained,

106
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,790
and evil is eliminated.

107
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,510
Mr. Xu's belt?

108
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,840
That's right.

109
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:21,960
They say

110
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,030
the belt buckle was discovered
at the burial site

111
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,960
of the statue's remains.

112
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,270
They told me to claim it.

113
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,080
But quite some time has passed.

114
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:32,480
The belt buckle has a bird pattern.

115
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,360
Was it a roc?

116
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,720
It's a bird that resembles an eagle.

117
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,480
Impossible.

118
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:55,870
This is impossible.

119
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:59,550
I suppose Qu Meng did corner Mr. Xu.

120
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,080
My father wouldn't
even dare to gut a fish. Why would he...

121
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,840
Back then, I was outside the room.

122
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,630
I wanted to stop him.

123
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,270
But he chased me out of the room...

124
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,320
My father would never kill.

125
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,720
He's not a murderer.

126
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,360
Trust me.

127
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,670
He could never be a murderer!

128
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,840
Yang.

129
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,200
Calm down...

130
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,000
How can I calm down? How can I?

131
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,620
How do you guys expect me to calm down?

132
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,270
Fine.

133
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,750
Even if he did murder someone,

134
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,670
how could he be so foolish as to

135
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:25,440
leave the body and
the belt buckle inside the statue?

136
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,320
Did he lose his mind?

137
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,570
Something's off.
I'm sure someone is trying to frame him.

138
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,270
Who's trying to frame him?

139
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:35,960
Was it you?

140
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:37,750
Was it you?

141
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,510
Xu Zhiyang!

142
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,270
Let's clarify things.

143
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,080
Once we clarify things,

144
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,390
you guys will be able to understand

145
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,870
why there were so many things

146
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,080
I have to keep to myself.

147
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,750
Mr. Xu was the one

148
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,750
who buried Qu Meng's body in the statue.

149
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,000
But why?

150
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,000
It was meant to be a warning.

151
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,080
Back then,
Qu Meng was causing a commotion.

152
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:18,870
She even instigated others to join her.

153
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,720
In order to stop their commotion

154
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,270
and make them submit,

155
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,030
Mr. Xu came up

156
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,870
with that ruthless idea.

157
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,080
Did you know why

158
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,960
I kept all these things to myself?

159
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,240
It was because
I was worried about you, Yang.

160
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,360
I was afraid that you couldn't take it.

161
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,240
Some things

162
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:48,120
are cruel enough just to know.

163
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,670
Whatever happens to me is fine

164
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,480
if the older generation's affairs
had involved me.

165
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,910
I just didn't want you two
to know about these shady dealings.

166
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,320
I just hope that you two

167
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,840
will stay sunny

168
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,200
and happy.

169
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,600
Understood?

170
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:37,150
Sorry, Yang.

171
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,670
I promised you.

172
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,510
This is the last thing

173
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,870
I'm hiding from you.

174
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:59,300
=Episode 13=
=Exhibit=

175
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,320
You shouldn't stay outside.

176
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,510
Head to your room.

177
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,240
It's cold out here.

178
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,480
You should have something.

179
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,320
Don't let my grandchild starve.

180
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,150
Don't panic.

181
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,720
I'll discuss this with
Mr. Cao right away.

182
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,750
It's pointless.

183
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,840
The cops have already found the belt.

184
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:48,480
We don't know
what will happen after this.

185
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,390
If you keep covering this up
out of emotional attachment,

186
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,120
you'll be putting
the entire group at serious risk.

187
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,320
Give it to me.

188
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,120
I'll hand it over.

189
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,120
Be a good boy. Give it to me.

190
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:12,080
If you turn in evidence
of your father's crimes,

191
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,630
that's called putting duty
before family ties.

192
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,600
Legally speaking,
there's nothing wrong with it.

193
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,000
But morally speaking,

194
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,630
what do you think

195
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:27,440
people inside and outside of the group

196
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:28,720
will say and think about you,

197
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,790
especially the elders
who worked for your father?

198
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,890
Can you bear
the weight of public opinion?

199
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,960
You'll be the subject of gossip
for the rest of your life.

200
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,840
Be a good boy.

201
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,390
Give it to me.

202
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,510
Dad.

203
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,720
From now on,

204
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,720
we should let him
decide for himself, okay?

205
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,960
What should I do?

206
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,960
I seriously don't know.

207
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:18,390
Dawg.

208
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,720
This concerns more than the company.

209
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,720
I cannot help you make a decision.

210
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,840
If I do, I'm afraid

211
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,450
you'll blame me for it
for the rest of your life.

212
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,750
But no matter what decision you make,

213
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,360
I'll never blame you for it.

214
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,630
The kind of person your father is

215
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,990
has nothing to do with who you are.

216
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,550
I trust you.

217
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,030
You should trust

218
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,510
that I'll always stay by your side.

221
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,440
Mr. Wu Guohao,

222
00:17:26,655 --> 00:17:28,175
we are now conducting an inquiry

223
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,110
regarding the alleged involvement
of Binchuan International Club

224
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,310
in illegal sexual transactions.

225
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,200
Please answer our questions honestly.

226
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,590
As the primary person in charge
of the club at that time,

227
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,790
were you aware of,
involved in, assisting,

228
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,070
or suspected of
engaging in illegal sexual transactions?

(ICU)

230
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,830
I don't know anything.

231
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,350
As Xu Peng's business partner
and best friend,

232
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,000
were you aware of, involved in,

233
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,350
or concealed the violent incident
in which Xu Peng murdered Qu Meng?

234
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,400
I'm not sure.

235
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,790
Gao Feng,

236
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,920
based on the current progress
of the case investigation

237
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,680
and your status as
a direct relative of the victim,

238
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,510
we now need
to share some information with you.

239
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,550
Did you locate the culprit
who murdered my mother?

240
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,350
Xu Zhiyang came here to submit evidence.

241
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,850
Rumors have been
circulating outside the entire day.

242
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,750
Judging from
the current evidence we have,

243
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,310
the culprit is Xu Peng.

244
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,400
However, we've located
some new leads as well.

245
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,590
Our colleagues from
the Technical Appraisal Center

246
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,790
used a special method

247
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,590
to open the golden ball
you handed to us.

248
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,480
Inside the golden ball,

249
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,350
we discovered a series
of hand-engraved numbers.

250
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,000
We think

251
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,350
that there's
a special meaning to the numbers.

252
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:44,880
I never knew

253
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,200
that this stuff could be opened.

254
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,270
I don't know

255
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,000
what the numbers mean either.

256
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,590
The Technical Appraisal Center

257
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,110
scanned the golden ball.

258
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:54,550
We found out

259
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
that someone had replated

260
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,590
the surface of the ball.

261
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,550
Their goal was to cover the cut mark

262
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,160
on the ball.

263
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,640
So, what she wanted to say

264
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,000
had always been inside here.

265
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,240
Gao Feng, we called you here today

266
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,720
because we wanted to know

267
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,030
if you had found any other leads.

268
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,680
Nothing comes to mind for now.

269
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,500
However, perhaps I could try again

270
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,750
with real-world discoveries.

271
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,750
I met Xu Zhiyang a few days ago.

272
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,400
He was in a poor state of mind.

273
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,680
Perhaps there were
internal problems within his family.

274
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:34,960
And,

275
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,510
do you guys truly think
that Wu Guohao is innocent?

276
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,960
He told me personally

277
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,640
that he knew everything
Xu Peng had done.

278
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,680
Maybe I can

279
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,750
provide another breakthrough approach.

280
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,920
My mother's murderer has been found.

281
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:59,720
I guess I can finally
put this behind me.

282
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:04,200
Xu Zhiyang handed over the evidence
of his father's crime to you all.

283
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,720
To him,

284
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,750
I think he can finally
put this behind him as well.

285
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,240
But there's one more person.

286
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,590
I don't think it's that easy

287
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,120

I never found a reason,
nor could I bring myself

297
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,680
to ask you to identify her.

Why do you think

00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,030
Try it on.

369
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,510
I'll just measure it out for you.

370
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:37,000
It's a little big for you.

371
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:41,720
Just make do with it, okay?

372
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:46,030
Back when you were
out and about every day,

373
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:48,640
you didn't even call me once in a month.

374
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,720
Whenever I was on my phone,

375
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,510
I saw news about
backpackers getting into trouble.

376
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,750
I was so worried about you.

377
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:58,350
I didn't know which snowy mountain
you were exploring at all.

378
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,100
It's auspicious
if you wear the shirt I bought.

379
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,240
The size won't matter too much.

380
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,830
I bought it at a discount.

381
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,550
Sit down. Come.

382
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:25,680
Feng, have some water.

383
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:33,960
Feng,

384
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,920
once you're done with your stuff,

385
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,310
I'll buy a shirt just like yours.

386
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,720
I'll go check out the mountains,

387
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,240
the lakes,

388
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,830
and the grasslands you mentioned.

389
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,550
I might not be able to hike anymore.

390
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,640
But I guess it's fine to wander
at the foot of the mountain.

391
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:00,160
I've never been out there before.

392
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,400
Mom, I'm sorry.

393
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,240
You were implicated

394
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,930
just because I investigated the case.

395
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,830
I'm fine with no matter
what they throw at me.

396
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,540
But they can't just
write such filthy words

397
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,400
on our door.

398
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,030
Feng,

399
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:30,640
from now on, I'll support you
no matter what you do.

400
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:33,030
You can wander out there.

401
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:34,480
If you're tired

402
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,390
or if you're suffering out there,

403
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,590
you can come back.

404
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,200
I'll wait for you at home.

405
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,160
Have some water.

406
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,720
Sit and rest.

407
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,070
I'll try my best to clean it.

408
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:14,550
Let me do it.

409
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,400
(Happy Birthday)
What do you want to do, then?

410
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,350
It's so pretty.

411
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,830
Mom!

412
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,270
You want Mom?

413
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,480
You have two moms over here.

414
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,600
Your mom is here.

415
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,190
Here, blow out the candles.

416
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:46,400
Here, Feifei.

417
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:50,240
Happy birthday to you.

418
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:53,070
Happy birthday to you.

419
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,030
Feifei.

420
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,990
You're watching the same video again.

421
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,160
I went to see her today.

422
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,350
She was lying on the autopsy table.

423
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:07,200
Why can I never see her face clearly?

424
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,750
Her face was blurry in the portrait.

425
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,000
Today, her face is scorched.

426
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,350
Did her face

427
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,000
look the way you imagined?

428
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,200
She was burned beyond recognition.

429
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,270
Did she know
that you were already all grown up?

430
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,480
Did she know
that you'd already gotten married?

431
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,480
Did she know that you were
going to be a mother soon?

432
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,200
Did she know

433
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,680
that I'd already become a robot
that was carrying a machine?

434
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:07,920
She only did the things
she wanted to do.

435
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:10,440
She was too selfish!

436
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,240
Has she ever thought about our present?

437
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,110
Let's not bring her up.

438
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,160
Feifei.

439
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,270
You and Yang should leave.

440
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:31,880
Go somewhere else.

441
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,200
Start a new life out there.

442
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,070
I'm not leaving.

443
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:47,030
You should put the past behind you.

444
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,370
It's not that easy
to put the past behind me.

445
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,360
Whether or not I can
get over this hurdle in my heart

446
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,880
has nothing to do with where I live.

447
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,030
Can we still return
to the good old days?

448
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:12,590
The ties of blood cannot be erased.

449
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:35,920
You guys

450
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,920
should

451
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,960
stay together.

452
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,630
The sports shoes,

453
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,880
they're cleaned.

454
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:56,230
Hello, Yang.

455
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:00,070
If you're reading this letter,

456
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,150
that means

457
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:04,070
it's time for me
to bid farewell to this world.

458
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,190
I always wondered

459
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,480
if you would find this letter.

460
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,190
If you're reading this,

461
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:14,000
I suppose there are two possibilities.

462
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:17,630
Firstly, you'll find
this letter quickly.

463
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:22,400
That means you'll get over
this hurdle of mine very quickly

464
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:25,070
and you'll run on the grasslands

465
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,550
while wearing the same sports shoes.

466
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:29,670
If that's the case,

467
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,440
I want to tell you this.

468
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,840
Yang,

469
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,800
I love you.

470
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,190
As for the other possibility,

471
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,150
you'll only find this letter
after a long time.

472
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,440
If that's the case,

473
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,630
I suppose you've found out
about my past.

474
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,160
You'll be disappointed in me

475
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:52,150
and wish to get rid of the sports shoes.

476
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,150
I assume there are certain things
you will want to know.

477
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,800
I've committed
a lot of wrong deeds in my life.

478
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,030
The club I operated
involved sex transactions.

479
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,230
I harmed a man called Yang Wenyuan.

480
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,630
I even strangled a woman called Qu Meng

481
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,280
to death.

482
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:15,030
There are plenty
of other things as well.

483
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:18,880
I want to tell you them myself.

484
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,960
What to do from here

485
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,400
is up to you.

486
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,760
You're already

487
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,360
a real man.

488
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,550
I'm not a good person.

489
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,190
But I'm not evil to the core.

490
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:35,670
Yang,

491
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:37,760
he was the one

492
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,840
who forced me to do everything.

493
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:42,710
Wu Guohao is the devil.

494
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,480
He had always been the devil.

495
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:48,340
(Penglai Group)
The past year has been one

496
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:51,360
of soaring growth

497
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:52,960
and strategic expansion
for Penglai Group.

498
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,920
(1995-1996 Annual Summary Meeting)

499
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,800
(Penglai Group)
We secured Penglai Plaza

500
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:57,630
and a flagship real estate project

501
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:59,000
in the development zone.

502
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,230
We must confront
the transformation of our industry

503
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,630
and align with
the broader trend of sector improvement.

504
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:08,190
We must also explore

505
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:10,000
(Wu Guohao)
new industries and new fields.

506
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,320
Our group will be making
a major move next.

507
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:14,920
I hope everyone can
focus on the bigger picture

508
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:15,990
and try your best to cooperate.

509
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:16,760
Now,

510
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,150
let's work hard together

511
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,710
and create a new prosperous era.

512
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,630
Lastly, I want to give
special thanks to an individual.

513
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,630
He's the most
important person in the group.

514
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:30,700
He's the soul of our group.

515
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,280
He's the person in charge
of Binchuan International Club,

516
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:35,320
and the deputy GM of Penglai Group,

517
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,400
Mr. Wu Guohao!

518
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,070
Let's welcome him to the stage.

519
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,000
