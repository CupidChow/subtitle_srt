00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:52,539
=Light of Dawn=

2
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,719
Mr. Wu,

3
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,959
how much will you pay
to buy me off this time?

4
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,560
You've got guts.

5
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,560
You think I'm afraid of you?

6
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,840
A barefoot man fears no shoes.

7
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,039
I've got nothing left to lose.

8
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,439
You're not afraid of me.

9
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,520
You're afraid of yourself.

10
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:25,080
Feifei and I are honest businesspeople.

11
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,090
We're not afraid of an investigation.

12
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:30,840
If we're implicated,

13
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,319
we'll pay what needs to be paid

14
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,759
and answer to the law if we must.

15
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:34,990
You, on the other hand,

16
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,120
are you not afraid

17
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,280
that your mother died because of you?

18
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,680
Why do I get the feeling
you keep rambling

19
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,560
because you're scared
I'll get to the truth?

20
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,639
Even if you're not afraid,

21
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,960
what about the people around you?

22
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:00,280
Aren't you worried
they'll get dragged down because of you?

23
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,159
Is that a threat?

24
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,479
If you say it is, then it is.

25
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:10,919
Wu Guohao, listen up.

26
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,479
My mother died inside the statue,

27
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:14,599
and I'm still alive.

28
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:17,840
The reason I'm alive

29
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,800
is to find out the truth.

30
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,280
No one can stop me.

31
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:25,080
Investigate

32
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,319
however you like.

33
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,000
Long Yu. Dong.

34
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,000
You don't have many close friends.

35
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:33,719
That makes things easier.

36
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,879
Even an old dog will bite
when it's cornered.

37
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:47,319
It knows exactly how biting feels.

38
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,639
Then try me.

39
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:58,280
I'll help you find out the truth
about your birth.

40
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,000
Go check

41
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,159
whether the house you're looking for

42
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,840
was rented under He Xiaohong's name.

43
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,000
As I said,

44
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:12,879
the truth of your birth

45
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,840
isn't pretty.

46
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,680
Looks like we underestimated him.

47
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,480
Especially that lad.

48
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,000
He's dogged.

49
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,480
I didn't see that coming.

50
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:48,240
He's still wet behind the ears.

51
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,120
But even veterans

52
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,839
are wary of someone like him.

53
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,680
Your rules

54
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,639
don't work on him.

55
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:57,439
Then what do you suggest?

56
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:04,160
We need to tread carefully.

57
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,800
Try not to go out too much lately.

58
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:12,199
If you feel like playing mahjong,

59
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,290
I can teach you
how to play on your phone.

60
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,279
Also,

61
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,360
don't open the door for strangers.

62
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,160
What's wrong?

63
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,720
Nothing.

64
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,160
I saw some reports saying

65
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,900
there have been a lot of scams
targeting elderly people living alone.

66
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,360
You come home every day.

67
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,399
I'm not living alone.

68
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:36,720
Director Wang,

69
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:39,040
we've narrowed down Madam He's location.

70
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:40,519
We'll move tomorrow morning.

71
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:42,399
Good. Keep a close watch.

72
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,959
(Wait.)

73
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,000
(It's not lights.)

74
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,399
Why is the door locked?

75
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,600
Feng,

76
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:40,360
you asked me for the documents,
didn't you?

77
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,360
I brought them over.

78
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,920
I'll slide them

79
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:45,759
under the door.

80
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,480
I'm off.

81
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:56,600
(Investigate)

82
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,800
(however you like.)

83
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,279
(As I said,)

84
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,000
(the truth about your birth)

85
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,959
(isn't pretty.)

86
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,680
(You don't have many close friends.)

87
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,079
(Aren't you worried they'll get
dragged down because of you?)

88
00:07:26,482 --> 00:07:28,042
I don't care who you are

89
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,800
or whether your parents
went through something ugly.

90
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,120
It's none of my concern.

91
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,240
There's only one thing.

92
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,360
Come back in one piece.

93
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,340
(Binchuan Villa Complex)

94
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,639
(Gao Feng.)

95
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,279
(Run forward.)

96
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,160
(Perhaps that's dawn.)

97
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:12,220
=Episode 9=
(Flame)

98
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,100
If you can still ride a carousel
with someone

99
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,720
after you've grown up,

100
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,580
that person must be
your best friend, right?

101
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:32,840
With your best friend,

102
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,799
you say things

103
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,559
you can't tell anyone else.

104
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:38,399
So tell me

105
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,879
what's been weighing on you?

106
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:44,799
I've never told anyone.

107
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,279
Not even my dad knows.

108
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:51,600
To be honest, I don't have feelings
for my mom.

109
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,120
I don't know what she looked like.

110
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,799
I don't know what she liked

111
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,799
or disliked,

112
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,600
her favorite food,

113
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,840
or how she looked when she smiled.

114
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,000
I know none of it.

115
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,960
To me,

116
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:12,960
she's just a name,

117
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,399
a portrait,

118
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,200
and

119
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,519
a study my dad never let me enter.

120
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:34,200
♪Tearful eyes♪

121
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,919
♪Reddened by tears♪

00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,720

Bestie.

125
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,279
If one day

126
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:56,360
I stand at the edge of a cliff,

127
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,159
remember to pull me back.

128
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,240
Go check

129
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,360
whether the house you're looking for

130
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:06,240
was rented under He Xiaohong's name.

131
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,720
Feng.

132
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:39,679
Feng.

133
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,720
Feng.

134
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,720
Feng.

135
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:56,200
Gao Feng.

136
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,360
Something's happened.

137
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,679
Get over here right now.

138
00:15:58,679 --> 00:15:59,730
I'll send you the location.

139
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,080
We'll be right there.

140
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:02,360
Be careful.

141
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,000
Wait for us.

142
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,600
Something's wrong on Gao Feng's side.

143
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:49,200
There's smoke.

144
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,119
If the police aren't here,

145
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,759
fire trucks should be here by now.

146
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,319
Pull out.

147
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:55,359
Understood, Boss.

148
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,039
The flame is getting bigger.

149
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:58,200
No problem.

150
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,519
Tell Chen Kang to be careful.

151
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,039
Don't be reckless.

152
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:02,680
Got it.

153
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,079
Answer me.

154
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,240
Answer me!

155
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,599
Feifei,

156
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,640
how did you find this place?

157
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:31,580
What are you trying to do?

158
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,000
Get him out of there.

159
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,559
Get him out of there!

160
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,720
It's dangerous, Feifei!

161
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,300
- What are you doing?
- Let go of me.

162
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:42,720
Let go!

163
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:43,920
- Ming.
- Let go!

164
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,440
Feifei.

165
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,759
Save that guy.

166
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:47,400
Understood.

167
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:48,480
Move.

168
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:49,839
Quick.

169
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:53,319
Come here.

170
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:54,319
Hurry.

171
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:55,920
Someone help!

172
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:58,000
Quick! Get them out of here.

173
00:19:58,519 --> 00:19:59,559
Are you okay?

174
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:01,079
This place is too dangerous.

175
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:02,759
Hand the thing over to us.

176
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:04,519
Get out of here first. Quick.

177
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,519
Hurry.

178
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:08,759
Let's get out of here.
Hand the thing over to us.

179
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,240
Let's get out of here.
Hand the thing over to us.

180
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,359
Give it to me.

181
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:20,759
Run!

182
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:06,920
Quick!

183
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,260
Check upstairs for anyone still inside.

184
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:14,480
Yes. Save people first.

185
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,240
Move.

186
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,319
Split up.

187
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:18,200
On the double!

188
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,799
Someone!

189
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:56,599
Over here!

190
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,440
Someone!

191
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,839
Someone!

192
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:04,200
Gao Feng.

193
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:05,559
Gao Feng.

194
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,880
Stretcher. Quick. Doctor.

195
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,559
Doctor.

196
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:09,720
There's someone inside.

197
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,460
The evidence is
with the fake firefighters.

198
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:12,319
Go.

199
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:13,640
Now!

200
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:17,240
Let's go.

201
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,039
Hurry.

202
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:30,559
Mr. Ming, careful.

203
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,599
A fire broke out in an abandoned house

204
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,780
in the southern suburbs of Binchuan
early this morning.

205
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,799
Police and firefighters

206
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,519
rushed to the scene.

207
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:16,319
Two people were injured.
One is lightly wounded,

208
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,839
and one is in a coma.

209
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:20,480
More updates on the morning news.

210
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,200
(Emergency Department)
Are you her family?

211
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:32,480
If you are, sign here.

212
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:41,279
Wait.

213
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:43,519
How is the patient now?

214
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:44,990
She lost a lot of blood.
Her kidney is injured.

215
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,290
We don't know if it can be saved.

216
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:49,920
Madam, we don't do this anymore.

217
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,960
I know.

218
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,799
But I feel better if you take it.

219
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,240
If you insist,
we'll take it as the medical fees

220
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,300
and settle it at discharge.

221
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,440
- Thank you.
- No problem.

222
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,780
There's an arson case
at a suburban villa

223
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:46,680
this morning.

224
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,519
Have you heard?

225
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:48,960
Arson?

226
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:53,519
Didn't short videos say
it was an accident?

227
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,079
It was arson.

228
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,930
Have you heard about it, Miss Wu?

229
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:02,480
I don't watch shorts.

230
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,119
We found the body of a key person

231
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,880
linked to the Wang Dan Plaza case
at the scene.

232
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:12,759
The forensic report shows

233
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,480
she was already dead
before the fire started.

234
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:24,519
Does this affect my husband?

235
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,000
The eyewitness was Gao Feng.
Your friend.

236
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:31,960
Is he all right?

237
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,079
He's fine. His friend, Long Yu,
was badly injured.

238
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,119
She's still in critical condition.

239
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,920
What does this have to do with us?

240
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,950
Where were you
when the fire broke out, Mr. Wu?

241
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:45,160
I was at home.

242
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,480
Was he, Miss Wu?

243
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,680
I usually sleep in. I'm not sure.

244
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,119
There's one thing
we need you to explain, Mr. Wu.

245
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,519
A base station near the scene

246
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:06,200
picked up activity from your phone.

247
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,480
Hello?

248
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,880
Officer Su, someone turned himself in.

249
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,279
I set the fire.

250
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:24,000
He Xiaohong and I worked together.

251
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:25,630
We've known each other
for over twenty years.

252
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,680
She owed me money.

253
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:29,640
I only managed
to track her down after all these years.

254
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,519
But when I got there,
she was already dead.

255
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:32,920
I was pissed,

256
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,440
so I set the place on fire.

257
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,400
Let me be clear.

258
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:38,359
I didn't burn her to death.

259
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:40,400
Your forensics can prove that.

260
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,000
My phone broke,

261
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,119
so I asked my driver to get it fixed.

262
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,640
I have no idea

263
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:47,880
where he got it fixed.

264
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,640
Sorry to disturb you.

265
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:02,090
If we need anything else,
we'll ask for your cooperation.

266
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,319
I'll have another drink.

267
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:27,720
If I hadn't gone today,

268
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:30,319
would you really have burned them alive?

269
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:35,319
Is this what you claim
a clean businessman?

270
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:39,039
Who was the woman in the attic?

271
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,640
How is Gao Feng's mother
connected to all of this?

272
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:45,519
Tell me.

273
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,599
Tell me!

274
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:53,920
Calm down.

275
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,319
How can I calm down?

276
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:00,799
My dad might be a murderer.

277
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,319
Answer me! Say something!

278
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,079
Are you done venting?

279
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:12,480
If you really want the truth,

280
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,640
I'll take you somewhere.

281
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:34,920
Even an old dog will bite
when it's cornered.

282
00:29:36,282 --> 00:29:39,722
It knows exactly how biting feels.

283
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:57,720
The number you have dialed
is currently busy.

284
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:17,440
Feifei.

285
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,960
I was trying to get this back.

286
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:28,400
That woman in the villa
was sorting through all of this.

287
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,359
(Tian Juan)

288
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:32,000
It's not that I didn't want
to negotiate.

289
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,160
She wanted us both ruined.

290
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,640
She didn't care about her own life,

291
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,000
but others still want to live.

292
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:42,720
We can't let her ruin

293
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:46,000
other people's new lives.

294
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:26,240
Three, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

295
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:32,160
Four, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

296
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:33,440
Chest expansion.

297
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:40,920
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

298
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:42,839
Two, two...

299
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:46,960
She wanted to expose their old wounds.

300
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:48,680
Is this

301
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:52,680
a care facility you run?

302
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,480
I rent it.

303
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,000
I made the decision

304
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,799
a long time ago.

305
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,880
I want to take care of them
for the rest of their lives.

306
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:06,000
Let them live
without gossip or judgment.

307
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:08,920
They contributed a lot.

308
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:11,240
Without them,

309
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,799
there would be no Penglai

310
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,279
or us today.

311
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:21,440
Feifei, you can blame me,

312
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:23,319
but don't blame your dad.

313
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:25,640
The people who know the group's past

314
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:27,799
are only your dad and me.

315
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,160
Those women you saw

316
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,440
were all dancers

317
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:33,480
at the club back then.

318
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:34,839
Every one of them

319
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:38,160
went through something unpleasant.

320
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,839
Some of them didn't understand

321
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,039
how Mr. Xu ran things.

322
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:49,839
Gao Feng's mother secretly rallied people
to report the club

323
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:51,200
and angered Mr. Xu.

324
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:53,640
That's how she ended up like this.

325
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:55,400
The woman in the attic

326
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,839
was probably one of them too,

327
00:32:58,079 --> 00:32:59,079
but she escaped.

328
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,880
And now she's back for revenge.

329
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:03,440
I'm sorry, Feifei.

330
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,359
We did hide this from you.

331
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,240
I tried to convince your dad

332
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,300
that we should tell the police
everything,

333
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:12,000
given how things

334
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,079
have turned out now.

335
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:15,799
Mr. Xu was the club's boss back then.

336
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,079
It was all on him.

337
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,720
But your dad scolded me.

338
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,759
He said he'd rather take your blame,

339
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,440
and make himself

340
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,640
a target,

341
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,160
even risk getting himself into trouble,

342
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,799
than let those things come out.

343
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:36,880
He did it to protect today's Penglai,

344
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,480
Xu Peng's reputation,

345
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,440
and Xu Zhiyang's safety,

346
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,440
and to make sure those women
would be taken care of in their old age.

347
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,880
The reason why
I'm going to jail this time

348
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,880
is to help your dad.

349
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:53,920
Let everything stop here.

350
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,599
With the fire.

351
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:57,160
With me.

352
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,519
Let it end here.

353
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:21,320
Let those woman have food

354
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:23,039
and a roof over their heads.

355
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,159
That has always been my wish.

356
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,159
Feifei,

357
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,360
I've told you the truth as it is.

358
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,199
I know it's hard for you to take in.

359
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:41,960
Dad.

360
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,199
I just want to know one thing.

361
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:50,639
Did you force them to do those things?

362
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:52,480
No.

363
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,599
They stayed by their own choice.

364
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:00,559
Feifei,

365
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:04,400
you wouldn't understand
what things were like back then.

366
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:06,450
Take your time to think it through

367
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:08,239
and make your own choice.

368
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:12,400
And about today,

369
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,760
I never meant to set a fire
to kill Gao Feng.

370
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,239
His appearance there
caught me off guard.

371
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:20,239
Your dad

372
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,159
is not a murderer.

373
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,800
I wasn't before.

374
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:27,400
And I'm not now.

375
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,559
Cheer up.

376
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:09,840
She's safe, isn't she?

377
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:12,559
This girl asked Dong for the address

378
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:13,800
and followed you the whole way.

379
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,960
She was worried
something might happen to you.

380
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:22,840
We'll cover the medical bills
and hospital fees.

381
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:24,760
From now on,

382
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:26,880
I'll take care of her.

383
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,159
That fire really shook me.

384
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,119
Do what you want to do.

385
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:38,800
But promise me you'll be safe.

386
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,400
I saw it.

387
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:49,760
You promised your mom.

388
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:51,719
Madam Zhang,

389
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,400
leave Feng to me.

390
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,400
You can rest easy.

391
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:58,060
(Inpatient Department)

392
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,000
Other than the arsonist,

393
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,880
what else did you see in the fire?

394
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,920
If you saw something, say it now.

395
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,639
Once I figure out what I saw,

396
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:16,760
I'll tell you everything.

397
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:19,960
What else are you trying to figure out?

398
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:21,800
Just tell me whatever you saw.

399
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,400
Names.

400
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:23,880
What?

401
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:26,719
There were a lot of names on the wall.

402
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:29,519
I didn't see them clearly.

403
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,119
But one of them

404
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:34,519
was probably my mother's.

405
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,880
I honestly don't know

406
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,480
what that woman

407
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:41,360
wanted or what she was trying to say.

408
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,000
From now on,

409
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:44,960
you're not allowed to act alone.

410
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,840
If anything comes to mind,
call me right away.

411
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:49,880
Watch yourself.

412
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,780
(Bestie: Let's meet.)

413
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,239
Gao Feng, if you hate me that much,

414
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:28,159
you can push me off right now.

415
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,960
And you'll never know

416
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,039
who you are.

417
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:43,079
You people are something else.

418
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,119
You used me to find that woman,

419
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,760
set a fire, kill us both,
and destroy the evidence.

420
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,500
There's nothing you wouldn't do,
is there?

421
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,500
What did the fake firefighter take

422
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:56,639
from the scene?

423
00:38:57,079 --> 00:38:58,199
What did you get?

424
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:00,400
What did you see?

425
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:03,559
Too bad.

426
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:06,679
If this happens again,

427
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:09,039
you should kill me first.

428
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,840
Gao Feng, I'm actually glad.

429
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:15,599
I'm glad you can still yell at me.

430
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:19,840
If you had died

431
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:21,400
right in front of me,

432
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,840
I would never forgive myself.

433
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,159
But can we stop now?

434
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:28,639
I'm scared.

435
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,760
What do you have that makes me stop?

436
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,320
What gives you the right
to tell me to stop?

437
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:37,920
Money?

438
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:42,119
My birth mother is buried
under Penglai Plaza.

439
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:43,360
What your dad destroyed today

440
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,410
was the answer I've been searching for
all my life.

441
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:47,239
These two things

442
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:48,920
are what keep me going.

443
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:51,199
How much are they worth to me?

444
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,320
You tell me!

445
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,360
Yes.

446
00:39:59,000 --> 00:39:59,840
You have money.

447
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,119
A lot of money.

448
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:06,519
You're used to

449
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,639
cleaning up your mess with money.

450
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,320
If anyone gets in your way,

451
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:14,840
money can fix them.

452
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:18,920
Wu Feifei, you know

453
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,519
this won't fix me.

454
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,440
We've known each other for two years.
You know me well.

455
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,199
If I don't get to the bottom of this,

456
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:27,119
I lose any desire to live.

457
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,400
Wu Feifei, remember this.
If you want to use money on me again,

458
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,079
buy my life then!

459
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:34,920
Gao Feng, did I bring up money today?

460
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,559
You wanted the truth, didn't you?
I'll tell you.

461
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,320
What I know so far is

462
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,920
Penglai Plaza was built
by the Xu family.

463
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,280
My dad and the woman in the attic

464
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:46,880
worked for them.

465
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:49,000
I don't know what that woman did
back then

466
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,280
to cross Mr. Xu.

467
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,440
She ran away.

468
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,679
Now she's back for revenge.

469
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,159
No.

470
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,280
Xu Peng has been dead for years.

471
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,440
What could've been so serious

472
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,239
that your dad went this far for him?

473
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,800
If I'd known earlier,
I would've told you.

474
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:07,159
I just found out about

475
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,159
that woman and that house myself.

476
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:14,000
Your dad told you all this, didn't he?

477
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,239
Wu Feifei, this is who you've become.

478
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,800
Just like your dad.

479
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:33,360
An accomplice
who buries bodies and sets fires.

480
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,199
Then you make up a story for yourself

481
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:38,880
and feel good about it.

482
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,800
I'll tell you one thing.

483
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:51,440
I did get something.

484
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,800
Gao Feng, if you don't believe me,

485
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:01,880
hand it over to the police.

486
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,480
I also want to know what it is

487
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,599
not even fire can burn away.

488
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,780
