Why is the head covered?

00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,760
Take it off.

4
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,640
We're legitimate business people.

5
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,310
They went too far.

6
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,240
Sorry.

7
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,800
Tell us your demands.

8
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,870
Let the girls decide.

9
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,560
If they don't want to work,

10
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,750
let them go.

11
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,750
If they all left,

12
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,710
our club would have to shut down.

13
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,680
Everyone would starve.

14
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,360

From ancient times to now,

18
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,280
tell me what ways

19
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,430
allow women to live with dignity.

20

Only someone like you

21
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,030
doesn't care about their lives.

22
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,990
Don't waste time talking to him.

23
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,430
He's an idiot.

24
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,400
Just kick him out.

25
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,960
You caused quite a scene this afternoon.

26
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:25,030
Even the police called
to check what happened.

27
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,150
We spent ages smoothing things over.

28
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,430
I heard you wanted
to write an article too.

29
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,470
The impact is severe.

30
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,120
To undo it...

31
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,710
He Xiaohong, bring it in.

32
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,800
You did all this

33
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,680
just because you like Qu Meng.

34
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:08,910
But

35
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,470
your affection could harm her.

36
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:16,830
You've seen it too.

37
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,510
(Lottery)
The lottery is for guests.

38
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,720
Qu Meng is already assistant team leader.

39
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,630
Her ball didn't need to go in.

40
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,120
But after what you did,

41
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,720
I can't control my people.

42
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,510
So I have no choice.

43
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:34,720
I can only do this.

44
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,680
Take it down for the guests to draw.

45
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,510
I did this.

46
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,430
Let Qu Meng go.

47
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,240
Spare her. Come at me!

48
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,750
Four guests still need to draw.

49
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,310
One ball for four draws then.

53
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,560
Go.

00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,040
Go.

56
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,720
If there's anything, tell me.

57
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,830
Don't make things hard for her.

58
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,430
First,

59
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,800
go to the police station.

60
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,870

63
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,920
how you got the face injury,

64
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:37,000
say you fell after drinking too much.

65
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,510
You've suffered.

66
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,720
Leave Binchuan.

67
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,920
Go.

68
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,600

76
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,870
worth it.

77
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,270
Can you tell me your name?

78
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,630
My name is Qu Meng.

79
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:34,870
Qu, like a song.

80
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,360

81
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,840

your biological mom might have

85
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,240
been at International Club back then.

86
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,790
The old man indeed worked

87
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,910
as a chef there.

88
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,030
The police have uncovered this.

89
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,790
You'll find out sooner or later.

00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:10,670
I think

91
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,390
I should tell you first.

92
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,360
I bought beef this afternoon.

93

You don't blame me?

It happened a long time ago.

98
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,870
We both know very well

99
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,290
that I want to get to the bottom of this.

100
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,440
Now that we know
the old man's connection,

101
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,910
it's like another piece of the puzzle.

102
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,360
I'm one step closer to the truth.

103
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,440

into a big ship like them.

115
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,600
I don't care.

116
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,600
But now I live in fear every day.

117
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,510
Do you know?

118
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,200
Do you know what it feels like to have
your heart in your throat every day?

119

I wish

120
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,200
I could tie you to me every day.

121
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,270
I heard people say

122
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,600
some children come to this world

123
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,750
to repay a debt.

124
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,790
And some

125
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,550
come to collect debt.

is getting clearer.

00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,790
I heard

134
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,200
some people pay a lot of money

135
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,290
to buy newspaper
published on the day they were born,

136
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,670
just to know

137
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,240
what happened in the world that day.

138
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,200
Those are people with roots.

139
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,600
I envy them.

00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,030

141
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,790

every day to eat with me

00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,000
Hello.

194
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,480
Smiling lady.

195
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:10,960
Hello.

196
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,480
You smile under the city lights

197
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,390
is like a sunrise that arrived early.

198
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,030
Twinkling

199
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,960
and tearing open the night.

200
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,630
I want to conceal my heart as a lamp

201
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,480
to illuminate the path of your steps.

202
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,030
I'm willing to use my not so broad,

203
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,390
yet utterly stubborn back

204
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,670
to shield you from all surging noise

205
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,600
and scorching flame.

206
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,000
Miss.

207
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,720
Sing with all your heart

208
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,270
and smile as wildly as you wish.

209
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,690
You don't need to come closer

210
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,000
to listen carefully.

211
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,150
If you can sing freely,

212
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:58,960
behind you,

213
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,200
my eyes

214
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,590
will follow you like a shadow.

(Hello.)

222
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,000
(Miss.)

223
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,960
(I have no right to judge,)

224
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,510
(but I believe you)

225
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:26,510
(have the right to make your names)

226
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,590
(gilded headlines every proud morning.)

227
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:33,640
(Wake up.)

228
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,270
(Let the night tear the numbers apart.)

229
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:39,640
(Set off.)

230
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:43,350
(Let the dawn light the road ahead.)

231
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,160
What are you all dawdling around for?

232
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,750
Let's start.

233
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,350
(Hello.)

234
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,480
(The silent gale.)

235
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,590
(That falling leaf)

236
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,030
(was your final dance,)

237
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,000
(telling them)

238
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:08,350
(that the soil is preparing for spring.)

239
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,550
(Hello.)

240
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,160
(Yesterday,)

241
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,200
(I buried the words "utterly powerless")

242
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,440
(deep in my chest.)

243
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,590
(Hello, future.)

244
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,160
(Welcome)

245
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,200
(I'll inscribe "Fearless")

246
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,440
(in lead)

247
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,880
(and mail them to the vast dawn.)

248
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:43,110
The reconstructed image
of your biological mother's skull is ready,

249
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,510
but we still can't confirm her identity.

250
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:51,310
Next, we may need your assistance
in the investigation.

251
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,360
So I'm considered as a witness now?

252
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,400
I can help you,

253
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,240
right?

254
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,350
Things are getting
more and more complicated.

255
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,510
Your knowing Wu Feifei

256
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,680
can't be a coincidence.

257
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:04,960
Based on our observation,

258
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,790
Wu Feifei may leave the country soon.

259
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,350
I hope you can find a way
to keep her here.

260
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:11,640
Okay. I'll try.

261
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:13,920
Also,

262
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,510
I really do have a lead here

263
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,550
that might help you.

264
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,790
Do you remember

265
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,200
that I told you

266
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,880
that a song kept playing in my head?

267
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,640
That song

268
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,110
kept appearing in my childhood dreams.

269
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,880
Later, I found it.

270
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,240
It's this song.

271
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,720
I hope it can help you.

276
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,310
You don't have a straight.

277
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:04,270
You're one card short.

278
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,270
You need the big cat.

279
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:07,680
Again.

280
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,550
Mr. Ming, Mr. Cao.

281
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,640
How about we stop for now?

282
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,920
I want to talk to Dad.

283
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:17,640
- Alright.
- Okay.

284
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,910
If there's any legal issues
in Hong Kong, China, call me anytime.

285
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,790
I lost anyway.

286
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,440
Let's go.

287
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:26,550
Something wrong?

288
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:28,720
Dad.

289
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,030
You really had nothing
to do with that, right?

290
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,440
What are you talking about?

291
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,510
Mr. Xu's matters.

292
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,590
Didn't I tell you already?

293
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,550
I had nothing to do with it.

294
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,590
I just

295
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,030
might be leaving soon.

296
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,240
I feel uneasy.

297
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,160
Don't worry.

298
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,400
I'm here at home.

299
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,750
Don't worry about Yang.

300
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:57,270
I'll take care of him.

301
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,270
And your friend, Gao Feng.

302
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,790
By reason and by right,

303
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,720
we should compensate him.

304
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,310
Then it's settled.

305
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,310
Once I settled down,

306
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,550
we'll set a time

307
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,920
to call every day.

308
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,480
Whatever happens here,

309
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,550
you tell me.

310
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,400
I hope I can help you.

311
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,110
We'll do as you say.

312
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,960
We'll call every day.

313
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,680
If anything happens, we talk right away.

314
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,200
Alright?

315
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:30,830
Feifei.

316
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,160
Did you call network repair?

317
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,200
What network repair?

318
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:39,070
Yes, I called for one.

319
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,740
(Professional Network Repair)

320
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:04,920
Sorry.

321
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,160
I broke the rules.

322
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,310
We had an agreement.

323
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,640
I remember it.

324
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,030
No names.

325
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,000
No reasons.

326
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,030
No explanations.

327
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,960
But I'm just curious

328
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:20,480
what a near-perfect-score family is like.

329
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,920
I wanted to see.

330
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:29,790
You're really rich.

331
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,310
Get to the point.

332
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:36,360
You've crossed the line.

333
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,030
Long Yu told me.

334
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,680
You also went to the bar
asking about me.

335
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:46,220
(Muke Club, Not Open Yet)

336
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,270
You crossed the line too.

337
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:50,720
I've been investigating

338
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,680
the woman who might know about my past.

339
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,270
How did it lead back to you?

340
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,640
Why are you involved too?

341
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,520
Is it really just a coincidence?

342
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,270
What are you after?

343
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,400
How much do you know?

344
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,000
I'm not obligated to tell you.

345
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:15,070
My dad has told the police
everything he knows.

346
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,830
When powerful people speak,

347
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:23,720
they leave three parts unsaid
and seven to interpretation.

348
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,270
Can we really believe it all?

349
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,240
My dad is the head of the company.

350
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,400
If he really knew something,

351
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,950
he wouldn't have let your mother

352
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,160
lie in the plaza for over 20 years.

353
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,110
I heard about your mother

354
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:44,960
and felt heartbroken.

355
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,070
That's why Penglai Group

356
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,270
will compensate you properly.

357
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:49,830
What about you?

358
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,200
Don't you want the truth?

359
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,590
Is it him?

360
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,480
Yes.

361
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,130
Let me propose something.

362
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:11,350
We work together
and get to the bottom of this.

363
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,490
Just the two of us.

364
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,980
You and I are just online friends.
Why should I work with you?

365
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,830
Then why did you call me
when you hesitated

366
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:18,750
about getting married?

367
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,110
(Bestie)
I'm getting married.

368
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,640
Should I go through with it?

369
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,510
I told you I flipped a coin.

370
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,790
I could've called anyone.

371
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,350
There's nothing left for us to discuss. You should go.

372
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:35,160
Do you remember what you told me
in front of the statue?

373
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:38,110
You said you just ran away from home

374
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,380
and needed some space of your own.

375
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,400
The reason we even met

376
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,440
is because neither of us

377
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,390
knew who we really were.

378
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,680
Now I almost do.

379
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:49,640
What about you?

380
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,310
Bestie.

381
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:58,070
Without this mansion and the identity
of the Wu family's heiress,

382
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,400
do you know who you are?

383
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,310
Let's work together
to find out the truth.

384
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:06,480
Just the two of us.

385
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,000
Look into this man.

386
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,200
Okay.

387
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:18,260
(Bestie: Have you decided?
If so, let's meet.)

388
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,110
Dad.

389
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,240
Well?

390
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,750
How did it go this morning,

391
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,030
talking to your friend?

392
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,880
Nothing wrong with him

393
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:45,400
asking about his mom.

394
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,160
Anyone

395
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,750
would keep digging
until they get to the bottom of things,

396
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,070
but he picked the wrong person.

397
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,960
He should've come to me.

398
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:00,590
Feifei, you're not a child anymore.

399
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,240
Whether to go or stay

400
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:05,640
or help your friend investigate

401
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,350
is up to you.

402
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:14,960
Someone's waiting for you at the bar.

403
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,270
Tell Wu Feifei

404
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,160
I'm on my way.

405
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,550
It's not her.

406
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,940
(Muke Club)

407
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,160
Mr. Wu, it's our first time meeting.

408
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:44,960
You're busy too.

409
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,070
Just say what you need to say.

410
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,510
Feifei mentioned

411
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,070
you like to go out,

412
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,160
traveling, outdoor activities,

413
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,550
mountain climbing, and rock climbing.

414
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,480
Here's

415
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,590
a private membership card
for a top local club.

416
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,400
The annual fee is all paid.

417
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,110
You don't need to work anymore.

418
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,270
Go wherever you want to go.

419
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,790
It's our first meeting.

420
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,160
Consider it a gift.

421
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,160
You're so generous.

422
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,240
Do you have instructions for me?

423
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,440
Gao.

424
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,400
However you handle your mother's case

425
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,590
is your business.

426
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,440
Don't involve my daughter.

427
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,880
Then did you explain

428
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,500
everything about my mother's case
to the police?

429
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,880
I'll fully cooperate
with the investigation

430
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,510
to uncover the truth.

431
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,000
As the head of Penglai,

432
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:49,350
my burdens are heavy.

433
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,590
If we don't investigate thoroughly,

434
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,160
it could affect stock prices

435
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,240
and many people's livelihoods.

436
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,350
The responsibility on you is huge.

437
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,350
But to be honest,

438
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,830
I'm just an unemployed person.

439
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,400
I don't care
about businesses and companies.

440
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,350
Gao.

441
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:15,400
Given what happened to your mother,

442
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,830
it's understandable

443
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,830
you'd keep digging.

444
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:23,440
I also want to help you.

445
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,720
I want to talk to Wu Feifei.

446
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,480
I came today

447
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,680
to ask for your help.

448
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,350
Don't involve Feifei.

449
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:34,830
Is that what she wants?

450
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,550
Yes.

451
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,270
It's what she wants.

452
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,000
She doesn't want to see you.

453
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,070
What you say

454
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:47,550
sounds like you have
your daughter's best interests.

455
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,550
But to an outsider like me,

456
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,310
isn't it blackmailing with family ties?

457
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,000
You wouldn't understand family ties.

458
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,680
I just want Feifei

459
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:59,070
to live simply

460
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,440
and happily.

461
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,680
The police will fully look
into your mother's case.

462
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,400
If anyone is to be held accountable,

463
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,960
it will naturally point to me.

464
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,200
As the head of the company,

465
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,160
this is unavoidable.

466
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,270
We might even meet in court.

467
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:21,440
By the way,

468
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,830
do you have any requests?

469
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,270
Just tell me.

470
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,110
No rush.

471
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:31,550
Take your time.

472
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,200
I'll go now.

473
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,400
Mr. Wu.

474
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,590
Have you considered

475
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,440
the point

476
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:05,110
of investigating something

477
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,160
from so long ago?

478
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,790
You're young.

479
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,270
Life moves forward.

480
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:16,790
Think about it again.

481
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,480
Think it through.

482
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:28,790
Hello everyone.

483
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:30,270
I'm your Kun.

484
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,830
Here's the latest news.

485
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:34,880
(Penglai Group Press Conference)
Penglai Group's official WeChat says

486
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,110
Chairman Wu Guohao

487
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,000
will make a statement

488
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,160
regarding the recent Penglai Plaza

489
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,000
car accident.

490
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:42,960
Let's see if what Mr. Wu says

491
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,160
will have any effect.

492
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:48,960
Director.

493
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,110
You've all worked hard.

494
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,200
Come, have breakfast.

495
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,340
Director.

496
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,070
You've all been up all night, right?

497
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:57,830
No energy left, right?

498
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,070
When I first started working,

499
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,550
I could stay up late too.

500
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,830
Back then,

501
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,640
we didn't have these resources.

502
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,240
No computers, no internet.

503
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,160
Checking cases and gathering info,

504
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,750
all relied on our two feet.

505
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:12,750
It was exhausting.

506
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,680
The conditions are
so much better than back then.

507
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:18,480
Software, hardware,
and all kinds of high-tech stuff.

508
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,680
Everything's available.

509
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:20,960
But don't forget,

510
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:23,070
our opponents are cunning.

511
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:25,070
So don't be discouraged.

512
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,510
Anything within human ability

513
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:28,510
isn't difficult.

514
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,270
I'll give you the highest access rights

515
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,510
and coordinate

516
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,070
with relevant city departments.

517
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,720
We'll investigate Penglai Group's

518
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,070
business, taxes, construction safety,

519
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:39,830
and so on.

520
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,750
Leave no trace unchecked.

521
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,750
We must find

522
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,590
Madam He.

523
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:47,590
I believe

524
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,200
we'll make a breakthrough.

525
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,920
Based on surveillance footage checks,

526
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,590
we've located the suspected fugitive,
the café waitress,

527
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:57,470
who recently
appeared near the ferry terminal.

528
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,550
She may be fleeing.

529
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,220
Execute immediate arrest.

530
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:01,070
Yes.

531
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,200
Stop running. You can't escape.

532
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:06,030
Do you want to struggle
and I handcuff you

533
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,390
or you want to walk down voluntarily?

534
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,790
These are two different situations.

535
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,720
Li Churan.

536
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,400
Sophomore at Binchuan
University of Finance and Economics.

537
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,390
Excellent academic performance
during school

538
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,750
For several consecutive semesters,

539
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,980
she received the "Three Good Student"
title and scholarship.

540
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,480
With such a bright future,

541
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,830
why help Madam He?

542
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,030
What's your relationship with her?

543
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:54,960
I told you.

544
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:58,750
She'll come tomorrow at 5:00 PM.

545
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,070
Don't you want to save her?

546
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,640
A woman unrelated to you

547
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,270
sponsored an orphan
to study for so many years,

548
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,750
raising her into a university student.

549
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:10,320
You're the orphan, right?

550
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,840
These days
we've been looking for Madam He.

551
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,760
Even with today's advanced technology,

552
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,070
we still haven't found

553
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,030
her whereabouts.

554
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,190
Why?

555
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:22,280
I know Madam He is in poor health

556
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,400
and has mobility issues.

557
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:25,030
Have you wondered
without you by her side

558
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,360
these past days,

559
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:27,710
- she might be...
- You're talking nonsense!

560
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,630
You know best
whether I'm talking nonsense.

561
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,030
One person

562
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:34,440
risking their life

563
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,480
to protect someone unrelated

564
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,030
is very difficult.

565
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,760
You're compassionate and loyal,

566
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,960
but you're wrong.

567
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,110
Every minute you delay

568
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,800
could put another life

569
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,440
at risk,

570
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,630
including Madam He's.

571
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:50,670
The bones in the statue
have been there for years.

572
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,400
Why is it only discovered

573
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,150
now?

574
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,400
Those who planned the car crash

575
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:56,510
chose this method to send a message.

576
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,400
Could it be because they also believe

577
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,190
it's time for the truth to come out?

578
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,280
She chose this way to speak

579
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,510
because she believes

580
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:05,550
we will investigate to the end.

581
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,630
Li Churan.

582
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:10,670
We need to know

583
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,190
what Madam He wants to do

584
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:13,960
only can we help her

585
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:15,710
and save her.

586
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:20,440
We still have a chance.

587
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,320
Let me in.

588
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,070
Let me in. Don't block my way.

589
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:03,670
Let me in. Let go!

590
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,440
Calm down.

591
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:07,070
Let me in.

592
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,480
Let me in.

593
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,550
Don't block her way.

594
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,110
This is for you.

595
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,800
Li Churan.

596
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,630
You're a kind child
with a sense of justice.

597
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,920
When I told you this address,

598
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,440
I already figured out

599
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,670
you would eventually
bring the police here.

600
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,880
You're still young.

601
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:55,510
I'm sorry for dragging you

602
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,030
into my affairs.

603
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:58,710
That's enough.

604
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,630
Don't come here again.

605
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,230
Today I want to tell you

606
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,440
that since we met,

607
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:10,070
all the acts you've been grateful for

608
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,110
were only for myself.

609
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,280
I needed some help from you,

610
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:20,480
so I did you favors.

611
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,550
I guided you step by step to today.

612
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,280
You were just eager

613
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,190
to show gratitude to me.

614
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,110
As for what I have to do

615
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,150
or where I'm going,

616
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,230
you don't need to know.

617
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:47,480
Goodbye.

618
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,940
(The exiled universe echoes,)

619
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:00,060
(leaving a trace in the flesh of time.)

620
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,500
(A hidden wound awakens repeatedly.)

621
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:08,190
I'll be leaving soon.

622
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,510
Why did you ask me here?

623
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:15,320
The two of us have known each other
for two years.

624
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,230
Regarding family,

625
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:19,400
I always try to find it,
yet you always try to escape.

626
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,440
We're not from the same world.

627
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,190
Maybe some impulses are the same.

628
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,990
That's why
we can still talk and get along.

629
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:29,760
Sometimes people have to make
unavoidable choices.

630
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:33,610
You can't always act for yourself.

631
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:35,840
I was sincere in advising you.

632
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,920
When were you not sincere?

633
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,110
I've been thinking these past few days.

634
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:59,150
My mom died in that statue.

635
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:02,190
I've lived all alone

636
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:05,110
and survived until today.

637
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,360
Why?

638
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,070
I've told Su Min a few times

639
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,480
about my dreams.

640
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:18,230
Maybe my dreams

641
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,710
could connect to clues about my mother.

642
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:23,030
Isn't it just a dream?

643
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,230
I also dreamed of my mom.

644
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,920
Did you also dream she sang to you?

645
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,710
I also dreamed of a house.

646
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,880
It was vague and blurry.

647
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,880
I don't know if I remember it

648
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:55,440
or if it was just a broken dream.

649
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:03,550
Your father asked me a question before.

650
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,190
Have you considered

651
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:07,760
the point of investigating something

652
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,920
from so long ago?

653
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,360
Tell him for me.

654
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,840
Sometimes people should look forward.

655
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,760
But for someone like me,

656
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:20,070
I think being an echo chamber
is more interesting.

657
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:23,510
Some voices have been buried for years.

658
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,960
Hitting my broken wall

659
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,190
should make an echo.

660
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,880
I won't let go of my mother's case.

661
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:34,710
No matter where you go,

662
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:36,480
what drinks we shared,

663
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,500
or what we talked about,

664
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,400
I will investigate everything.

665
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,590
If I offended your father in any way,

666
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,710
I apologize.

667
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,920
Staying or leaving

668
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:53,590
is up to you.

669
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:19,440
Wu.

670
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,700
What's the situation?
