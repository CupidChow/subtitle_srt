(People's Public Security)

3
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,950
The dead woman at the fire scene

4
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,190
is a key figure linked to
the Wang Dan car crash case.

5
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,590
She's also the same woman

6
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,150
who had been deliberately
feeding Gao Feng information

7
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,400
about his birth.

8
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,470
Before Gao Dahua committed suicide,

9
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,870
she was in close contact with him.

10
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,360
This appears to have been
meticulously planned.

11
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,710
There's one more thing.

12
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,310
After the arson,

13
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,900
Wu Guohao and his daughter
drove to an institution in the suburbs,

14
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,350
(Mingyue Care Center Patients)
Mingyue Care Center.

15
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,630
(Former International Club Singer-Dancers)
The owner used to be Xu Peng.

16
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,910
Now it's Xu Zhiyang.

17
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,710
You didn't know
there was a care home under your name?

18
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,250
I have so many companies under my name.

19
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,240
How could I keep track of

20
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,280
every single one?

21
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,320
When my dad was alive,

22
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,890
he didn't talk much
about business with me.

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,830
And I rarely discussed it
with my father-in-law.

24
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,240
The women living at the care center

25
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,740
are all former singers and dancers
from the International Club.

26
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,810
(Welcome to the International Club)
After interviewing them,

27
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,470
their answers were unusually consistent.

28
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,430
Aside from singing and dancing,

29
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,100
they claimed to
know nothing beyond that.

30
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,520
We have reason to suspect

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,520
the care center serves as a form
of indirect control.

32
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,960
Psychologists were brought in.

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,500
Varying degrees of psychological trauma
were found among them.

34
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,840
They became evasive and reticent

35
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,220
at the mention of
the International Club.

36
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,150
Madam He had been using a fake ID

37
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,560
under the name He Xiaohong.

38
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,590
But the real He Xiaohong

39
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,680
has been living at the care center
all along.

40
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,070
According to Zhao Tianming,
who turned himself in for arson.

41
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,310
The person I burned

42
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,870
was the He Xiaohong I knew.

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,860
This may have been done
to obfuscate the truth

44
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,070
and conceal the true identity
of the dead woman at the fire scene.

45
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,190
So our next step

46
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,590
is to confirm Madam He's real identity
as soon as possible.

47
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,680
Let's hear your thoughts.

48
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,240
International Club.

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,760
Something's wrong with
the International Club.

50
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,750
That's where Penglai began.

51
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,200
Someone's digging things up.

52
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,890
And someone else is covering them up.

53
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,310
You're like this. Hard to get along.

54
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,430
Guess being around me
hasn't been easy for you.

55
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,030
I actually kept a bottle
of aged liquor for you

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,030
to celebrate

57
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,240
after you found out
the truth of your birth.

58
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,480
The car's in its usual spot.

59
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,240
Be back at work on time.

60
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,920
You have to overcome your own hurdle.

61
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,270
Thanks to you,

62
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,920
I have to fight against
the law of attraction every single day.

63
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,430
Now it's on you.

64
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,480
Run forward.

65
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,040
Maybe it's dawn.

66
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,560
My mom asked me,

67
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,310
after everything

68
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,920
I put you through,

69
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:04,070
does it really not hurt here at all?

70
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,630
Do I feel nothing?

71
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,720
It hurts.

72
00:05:19,697 --> 00:05:20,480
It hurts a lot.

73
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,070
Care center?

74
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,510
What care center?

75
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,410
Don't play dumb. Be serious.

76
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,870
Alright. I'm serious.

77
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,000
Very serious.

78
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,600
Officers,

79
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,310
I said this enough times.

80
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,600
The person I burned

81
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,240
was the He Xiaohong I know.

82
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,270
As for anyone else,

83
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,720
whatever Hong you're talking about,

84
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,000
that's for you

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,270
to identify.

86
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,870
Anyone can say anything.

87
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,600
I could even claim
I'm He Xiaohong myself.

88
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,000
The police went to the care center.

89
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,040
One of the women got scared.

90
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,950
She took sleeping pills.

91
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,830
She's being resuscitated now.

92
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,120
Well, I'm not eating.
I'm going to the hospital now.

93
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:18,950
Eat first.

94
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,310
We'll go together later.

95
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,240
Eat.

96
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,600
Come on.

97
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,190
We'll go together?

98
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:27,600
Okay.

99
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:29,950
Zhao Tianming,

100
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,040
He Xiaohong attempted suicide.

101
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,390
She's being resuscitated.

102
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,560
We're giving you a chance now.

103
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,680
Tell us the truth.

104
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,120
Weren't you always talking about
settling scores?

105
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:43,560
Arson gets you ten years.

106
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,600
Mutilating a corpse for three years.

107
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,720
That's just over ten years.

108
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,120
You'd still get out someday.

109
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,310
But add

110
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,680
intentional concealment

111
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,950
and making false statement,

112
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,720
at your age,

113
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,160
you'd never walk out again.

114
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,720
Officer Su,

115
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,510
I've explained

116
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,560
everything clearly.

117
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,430
I didn't hide anything.

118
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,120
I have no children.

119
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,240
I lived more than half my life

120
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,040
and never amounted to much.

121
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,950
What a wasted life.

122
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,390
I broke the law, I admit it.

123
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,070
Dude,

124
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,750
are you hungry?

125
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,800
Want me to grab you something?

126
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,480
You've been tailing me.

127
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,040
That must've been tough.

128
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:18,420
(Rescue Room)

129
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,950
Who is He Xiaohong's family?

130
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,680
Nurse, how is she?

131
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,070
She's temporarily out of danger.

132
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,300
Family member needs to sign and pay.

133
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,190
Nurse, here's my bank card.

134
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,560
You see, I don't know
how online payment works,

135
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,240
but please tell the doctor

136
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,510
to use the best medicine
and the best equipment.

137
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,750
I made the decision

138
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,360
a long time ago.

139
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,440
I'll take care of them
for the rest of their lives.

140
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:45,910
Let them live
without gossip or judgment.

141
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,320
They contributed a lot.

142
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,150
Without them,
there would be no Penglai.

143
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,320
Are you her family?

144
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,750
(Infusion Ward)

145
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,670
She has no family.

146
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,270
I'm like her family.

147
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,080
No.

148
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,440
Xu Peng has been dead for years.

149
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,270
What could've been so serious

150
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,030
that your dad went this far for him?

151
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:08,960
Come with me.

152
00:09:33,023 --> 00:09:34,080
I need to see you now.

153
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,240
Am I going in, or are you coming out?

154
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,840
I don't have time. I'm not home.

155
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,240
Ms. Feifei, we've got a problem.

156
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,440
I'm waiting at your place.

157
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,670
What are you trying to do?

158
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,910
Don't you want the answer?

159
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,030
Let me in.

160
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,550
In five minutes,

161
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,510
I'll tell you everything.

162
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,500
Bestie's special offer.

163
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,630
I'll tell you what I know

164
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,990
before I tell Su Min.

165
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,790
The likes of you

166
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,270
love to gamble, don't you?

167
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:32,840
Wu Feifei.

168
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,840
Don't you want to know
what really happened

169
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,120
to my mother and those women?

170
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,200
Don't you want to know

171
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,910
what that fire truly meant?

172
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,440
Don't you want to know

173
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,150
whether your dad has still been
lying to you?

174
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,840
You don't want to be an accomplice
or an executioner.

175
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,120
Bestie,

176
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,200
don't be stupid.

177
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,200
Don't choose the wrong path.

178
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,480
Ms. Feifei,

179
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,030
I'll throw him out.

180
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,910
Let him in.

181
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,670
Stay with him.

182
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,440
Care to gamble, Ms. Wu?

183
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,630
Gao Feng, stop it.

184
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,510
I see now.

185
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,550
Negotiate with your dad

186
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,660
about how much
the information I have is worth.

187
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,160
I'll wait to hear from you.

188
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:28,840
- What exactly have you...
- Just tell him

189
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,340
(Showcase Night)
I've figured it out.

190
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,390
He'll know what it means.

(Binchuan International Club
Appreciation Banquet)

192
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:34,790
Dad,

193
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,790
Gao Feng says he knows
what was taken from the fire scene.

194
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,320
He says you'll understand
what that means.

195
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,120
How much is there
that I was never supposed to know?

196
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:50,030
You promised you wouldn't hide anything
from me anymore.

197
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,320
Feifei,

198
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,510
only family truly wants
what's best for you.

199
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,080
You never know

200
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,150
what outsiders are after.

201
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,270
So

202
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,200
there's nothing I don't know now,
right?

203
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,910
I did get something.

204
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,270
I also want to know

205
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,270
what it is

206
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,200

It's just me here.

210
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:57,990
Where is Wu Feifei?

211
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,600
You told me to come alone.

212
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,960
Why would she come?

213
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:02,510
Fair enough.

214
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,840
If she were here,

215
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,030
we couldn't be completely honest.

216
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,510
If you already had a lead,

217
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,750
why not hand it over to the police?

218
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,670
I gave Wu Feifei my words.

219
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,030
I'd talk to you first.

220
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,030
This thing

221
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,320
matters more to you and your daughter.

222
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,840
I couldn't figure out before

223
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,910
what kind of evidence

224
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,600
was worth such drastic moves.

225
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,390
You had safer ways

226
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,120
than arson.

227
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,720
Until I went to your house

228
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,120
and saw that painting.

231
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,240
was Wu Feifei's biological mother.

232
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:44,600
Am I right?

(Early 1990s)

234
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,720
Be careful with those glasses.

235
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,870
Wipe all the water marks.

236
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,600
Stay sharp tonight.

237
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,100
Don't seat guests at the wrong tables.

238

Didn't Ms. Hong give you
three months off?

242
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,240
After so much has happened,

243
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,080
and Yang Wenyuan's gone
like he was never here.

244
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,600
Do me a favor. Fit me in.

245
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,360
I'm singing tonight.

246
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:29,960

00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:31,200
Thank you, Mr. Gao.

00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:31,960
Careful, it's hot.

249

Alright.

00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:38,550
It smells great.

251

Ms. Qu, are you better now?

252
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:44,910
Haven't seen you in a while.

253
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,630

258
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:54,840
Get back now.

What's with that face?

262
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,680
Didn't you say

263
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,880
we're short-handed
at the end of the year

264
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,240
and wanted me back on shift?

265
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:10,980
I'll change your shift.

I can't.

00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,000
I dream every night.

276
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,790
At least you have a conscience.

277
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,880
I thought

278
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,030
you'd be like the others,

279

Ms. Hongyue is also a good singer.

311
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,960
She's especially good at foreign songs.

312
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,690
Why don't you have her sing one for you?

313
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,680
Really?

314
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,160
Come join us.

315
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,790
I like foreign songs.

316
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,960
What are you trying to do?

317
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:27,920
Listen.

318
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:29,720
You quit this month

319
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,030
and leave next month.

320
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,880
Why should I be the one to leave?

321
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:36,920
Those killers

322
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,720
are living just fine.

323
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,110

324
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,200
Forget it.

325
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,980
Don't come to work
for the next few days either.

00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,640
Don't worry.

00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,480
I won't cause trouble.

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,000

Tonight I'll stay with Manager Zhao.

336
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:31,310
If I'm late, the timing will be off.

337
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,550
You're walking straight into trouble.

338
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,350
Leave me alone!

339
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,400
Pretend you don't know.

340
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,720
Please.

341
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,310
I bought the pesticide.

342
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:44,830
If you don't agree,

343
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:45,590
I'll kill it.

344
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,200
What is this?

345
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:49,750
Are you threatening me?

346
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,000
You think you can threaten me?

347
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,830
You think far too highly of yourself.

348
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,270
I'm a lost cause.

349
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,000
I'm worthless.

350
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,510
What a lively ferry, huh?

351
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,920
But all that noise

352
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,440
is just the walking dead.

353
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:18,480
Ms. Hong,

354
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,550
I never had a choice to begin with.

355
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,400
All I wanted

356
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:24,680
was to survive.

357
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,030
If there had been another way,

358
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,350
I wouldn't be living like this.

359
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,750
Before I met Yang Wenyuan,

360
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,440
I lied to myself every single day.

361
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,510
But now,

362
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,110
I want to live bravely,

363
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,400
to really live.

364
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,310
Take my advice.

365
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,000
Before anyone finds out,

366
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,440
abort the child.

367
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,640
It's been a long time

368
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,720
since I had an intense negotiation.

369
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,880
It feels unfamiliar.

370
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,920
Do you young people
still play by the rules

371
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,960
like we old-timers do

372
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,200
when you negotiate?

373
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,070
I don't mind.

374
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,290
We'll do it your way.

375
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,680
Let's define this talk first.

376
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:11,030
How many times have we met?

377
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:13,750
Doesn't matter.

378
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,160
If today goes well,

379
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,310
this can be the last.

380
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,920
I don't quite know

381
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:31,160
about your mother.

382
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,310
That's fine. Tell me what you know.

383
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,590
Okay.

384
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,270
I warned you before.

385
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,880
Knowing too much won't do you any good.

386
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,110
Let me make my stance clear.

387
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,400
My life isn't worth much.

388
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,440
I'm living

389
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,720
just to get to the truth.

390
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,640
No one can stop me.

391
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,310
What's going on with Qu Meng?

392
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:07,640
Manager Zhao called me.

393
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:10,510
He said she's been
unusually attentive lately.

394
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,240
Isn't that good?

395
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,590
She's come around.

396
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,110
Has she?

397
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:24,790
Hongyue, don't cover for her.

398
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,270
My legs are numb.

399
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,350
Isn't there a Mr. Li in Shenzhen

400
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,920
who runs a building materials business?

401
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,960
If we build a good relationship
with him,

402
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,310
it'll help us enter
the real estate market.

403
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,270
Let Qu Meng

404
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,510
handle it.

405
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,270
Isn't Gu Meng still making a fuss
about Yang Wenyuan?

406
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,110
Yang Wenyuan

407
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,750
brought this on himself.

408
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,990
He pushed things too far.

409
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,790
And our men acted a little rashly.

410
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,480
Who would've thought
he'd react like that?

411
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:11,880
We should avoid

412
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,720
things like that in the future.

413
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:15,830
Give this

414
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,640
to Qu Meng.

415
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,880
Consider it a small gesture.

416
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,480
Mr. Xu.

417
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,700
Can a human life

418
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,720
be priced?

419
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,100
What do you mean...

420
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,510
I'll take care of it.

421
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,440
This

422
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,480
has to be handled by Ms. Hong.

423
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,830
Did they send you?

424
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,400
Or did you come on your own?

425
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,240
Look on the bright side.

426
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,400
Ordinary people can never

427
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,640
make this much in Binchuan
in a lifetime.

428
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:00,350
People aren't bought with money.

429
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,200
Only livestock are.

430
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,480
I'll take this all the way for him.

431
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,270
Stop right there.

432
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,290
Better to live on your knees
than to die on your feet.

433
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,110
Don't you understand?

434
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,030
All that talk Yang Wenyuan had

435
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,550
about ideals

436
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,070
and distant dreams

437
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,790
was empty words.

438
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,640
When you're alive, you look after
what's right in front of you.

439
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,400
You live on food and drink.

440
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,890
When you die,
you go back where you belong.

441
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,480
It's as simple as that.

442
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,750
Only the ignorant
live that kind of life.

443
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,720
Ignorance is bliss.

444
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:56,350
And you?

445
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,680
Are you really going

446
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,500
to spend your whole life here
playing the fool

447
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,820
and turning a blind eye?

448
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:07,110
If Mr. Xu can handle things this way,

449
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,990
he couldn't care less
whether you make a scene.

450
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,240
But think carefully.

451
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,160
If you keep pushing this,

452
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,960
who do you think
will be the next to disappear?

453
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,680
This is the deal
I negotiated with Mr. Xu.

454
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,110
It's the final offer.

455
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:36,550
Hand over the videotape
Yang Wenyuan hid,

456
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,680
and none of the girls on your side

457
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,680
will be held accountable.

458
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,920
We wipe the slate clean.

459
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,830
He Xiaohong.

460
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,070
Meng Mei.

461
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:51,790
Tiantian.

462
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:54,550
Do you want them to end up the same way
Yang Wenyuan did?

463
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,000
You wouldn't.

464
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,270
Think it through.

465
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,000
Why did Yang Wenyuan die for?

466
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,100
Do you want his death to be for nothing?

467
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:03,790
You wouldn't!

468
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,200
I have no choice!

469
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,440
I just want you all to stay alive,

470
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,400
all right?

471
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:23,960
Qu Meng.

472
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,510
(That day,)

473
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,590
(for the first time
I saw myself clearly.)

474
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,640
(I wasn't their savior.)

475
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,400
(I was the executioner.)

476
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,790
(Beyond all the noise and bustle,)

477
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,680
(I saw the souls of those girls)

478
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,720
(stripped of their bodies,
withering away into nothing.)

479
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,440
(I told them they'd have a better life.)

480
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,960
(But with my own hands,)

481
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,790
(I cut them down piece by piece.)

482
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:23,200
(I never had a choice to begin with.)

483
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,790
(All I wanted was)

484
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,310
(to survive.)

485
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,480
(If there had been another way,)

486
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,920
(I wouldn't be living like this.)

487
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,400
(Before I met Yang Wenyuan,)

488
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,590
I lied to myself every single day.

489
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,510
But now,

490
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,310
I want to live bravely,

491
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,590
to really live.

492
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,880
(I can't go on, day after day,)

493
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,750
(staring at those restless souls
hovering over my head.)

494
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,480
(I want to be human.)

495
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,800
(I don't want to be
a corpse-devouring ghost anymore.)

496
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,640
(I've figured out my past)

497
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:05,350
(and my future.)

498
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:09,160
(I finally know what kind of person
I should become.)

499
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:13,480
Those two women were tight.

500
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,550
But neither of them met a good end.

501
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:21,440
One died in an accident
while entertaining clients,

502
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,480
the other one

503
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,110
lost her mind,

504
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,240
was always on the run,

505
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,440
and was obsessed with revenge.

506
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,990
What do you mean by "died in an accident
while entertaining clients?"

507
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,160
Then how did she end up

508
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,270
inside the statue?

509
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,590
Like I said,

510
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,510
the truth about your birth is ugly.

511
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:54,160
As for how she ended up in the statue,

512
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,160
you should ask Xu Peng.

513
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,480
I've told you everything I know.

514
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,070
I didn't hide anything.

515
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,170
There's nothing in it

516
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,920
for me to lie to you.

517
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,830
The police will look into it
sooner or later.

518
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,550
The clues in your hands

519
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:18,240
will lose their value.

520
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:21,440
Is that so?

521
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,240
Mr. Wu, you seem to value them
a great deal though.

522
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,680
Maybe they can prove a lot.

523
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,110
They'll always matter.

524
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:40,030
Shall we check what you've got now?

525
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,070
You came here today

526
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,200
because you want to take it with you.

527
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:59,480
Let's stop beating around the bush.

528
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:01,960
For now,

529
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,790
I'll take your word for it.

530
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,110
Let me ask something else.

531
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,480
How was I born?

532
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,790
Why was I born?

533
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,240
I'd really like to know

534
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,790
that too.

535
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:24,960
Not just that,

536
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:27,350
there are plenty of things

537
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,270
I'm curious about too.

538
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:11,880
What's wrong?

539
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,440
Don't feel like it?

540
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,880
Today's the right day.

541
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:21,110
Otherwise,

542
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:24,480
all those bitter tonics
you drank could've been for nothing.

543
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,440
Yang Wenyuan.

544
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,320
You were the one
who handled it in the end.

545
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,000
Didn't you say

546
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,480
you'd send him away?

547
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,960
It's all in the past.

548
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,800
I get why you care about Qu Meng.

549
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,630
But why worry about
Yang Wenyuan too?

550
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,190
He's dead.

551
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,360
Why did it have to go this far?

552
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,670
Let me make this clear.

553
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:28,960
I'm kind to Qu Meng

554
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,280
because she's your person.

555
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,030
As for those girls,

556
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,110
I'm the one who feeds them.

557
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,360
If the club went under,

558
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,150
they'd be starving.

559
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,670
Yang Wenyuan was the one
who put them in danger.

560
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,880
Do you even believe

561
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,800
what you're saying?

562
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,030
I do.

563
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,710
And I think you do too.

564
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,320
Otherwise, you wouldn't be with me.

565
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,360
You're starting to act

566
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,110
like that madwoman now.

567
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,000
You two are something else.

568
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,920
You took so many of my tapes.

569
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,360
Where did you hide them?

570
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:56,400
You rent a place outside?

571
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,400
Did you make copies?

572
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:07,550
I didn't know how.

573
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,400
Wait.

574
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:14,030
Last time I went to Hong Kong, China,

575
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:16,590
I bought two boxes of French cosmetics.

576
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,110
One was for Ms. Hong.

577
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:20,150
This one's for you.

578
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,920
I don't need that on my face.

579
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,670
Just a small gift.

580
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,230
Ms. Hong's been loyal to you.

581
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,920
I'm sorry.

582
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,590
I'm so sorry!

583
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,030
I never thought

584
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,590
things would end up like this.

585
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,510
But it is what it is.

586
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,180
Try to come to terms with it.

587
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,150
Shut your trap!

588
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:16,020
(International)

589
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,480
You satisfied now?

590
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:19,480
Is this what you wanted?

591
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,510
I didn't want this either.

592
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:22,280
Don't be a hypocrite!

593
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:25,880
Qu Meng,

594
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,280
Yang Wenyuan is dead now.

595
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,260
What are you going to do

596
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:47,230
about the child?

597
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:49,190
I'm asking

598
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,480
for myself.

599
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:53,660
It has nothing to do with anyone else.

600
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:58,110
You're keeping this baby,

601
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,440
aren't you?

602
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,630
What kind of stupid question is that?

603
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,510
Even if I die,

604
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,510
I'll protect my child.

605
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,070
I was wrong before.

606
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,590
From now on,

607
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:32,960
I'll help you.

608
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,070
This.

609
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,800
They wanted me to destroy it.

610
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:47,670
They said this thing

611
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,670
was more dangerous than the man himself.

612
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:53,150
They told me to burn it.

613
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,510
But I read a few pages,

614
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,360
and I got pulled in.

615
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:03,380
I couldn't bring myself to burn it.

616
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,110
Yang Wenyuan was a thinking man.

617
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,480
He was something else.

618
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:16,760
You two are incredible.

619
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,640
Keeping the baby
is the top priority now.

620
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,540
I'll bind my stomach for the time being.

621
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,800
I'll keep it hidden.

622
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:48,550
In a few months,

623
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,000
I'll find a way to get out.

624
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:56,360
I have a plan.

625
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,070
Being a mother isn't easy.

626
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,760
From now on, you stay with me.

627
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,670
Once I start to show,

628
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,630
I'll say I'm going to the countryside
to give birth.

629
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,390
You'll come with me
and look after me.

630
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,440
I'm pregnant too.

631
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:18,360
I didn't want this child at first.

632
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:20,590
But for you,

633
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:23,550
I'll have this baby no matter what.

634
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,440
I stopped taking the pills recently.

635
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,110
I'm pregnant.

636
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,630
Really?

637
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:09,590
For real?

638
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,150
From now on,

639
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,320
it's not you who's pregnant.

640
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,400
It's me.

641
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,840
You don't need to be involved in this.

642
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:27,110
Helping you

643
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,550
is my chance

644
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:33,800
