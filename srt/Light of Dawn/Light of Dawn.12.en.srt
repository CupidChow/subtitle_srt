00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,420
=Light of Dawn=

2
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,680
Let's eat, Dad.

3
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,910
So this is how the Penghai empire

4
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,630
was built.

5
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,590
Feifei,

6
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,710
you can't

7
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,150
deny

8
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,120
my entire past

9
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,960
with a few videotapes.

10
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,960
These were

11
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,520
business tactics at that time.

12
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,030
When did you find out

13
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,120
my mom was still alive?

14
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,030
The day we went to the police station.

15
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,360
They showed me the surveillance footage.

16
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,560
I recognized her right away.

17
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,750
So all this time,

18
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,360
you had every chance
to tell me the truth,

19
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,240
but you chose to lie instead.

20
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,310
Is lying really that easy for you?

21
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,150
How do you make lies sound so real?

22
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,840
What I told you,

23
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,030
how I said it, and when I said it,

24
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,630
I had my reasons.

25
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,520
Tell me this.

26
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,960
When you spoke to Gao Feng,

27
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,520
which part of it was true?

28
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,120
You took me to the care center
to see those women.

29
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,840
You said it was for Penglai,

30
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,470
for justice, and for me.

31
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,310
Which of those was true?

32
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:36,560
Every Thursday night, when you locked
yourself in the study listening to music,

33
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,960
did you ever ask yourself
what you'd actually done?

34
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,590
I'm talking to you. Answer me.

35
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,910
It hurt me

36
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,430
when I set that fire.

37
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,240
When I left the police station

38
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,030
and realized she was still alive,

39
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,590
I was miserable.

40
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,750
You saw what she kept

41
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,000
in the attic.

42
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,360
After all these years,

43
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,310
she was still that stubborn.

44
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,680
She clung to her obsession.

45
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,360
But did she ever take care of you?

46
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,040
It was me. I played
both mother and father

47
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,600
and raised you.

48
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,750
It was me alone.

49
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,720
Those years at the club

50
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,480
were memories your mom and I shared.

51
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,560
But she wanted...

52
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,560
She wanted a reckoning.

53
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,560
She wanted to put an end to it.

54
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,510
For me,

55
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,270
those years were
fate pushing us forward.

56
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,870
Not everything needs a reckoning.

57
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,190
Penglai wasn't built

58
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,000
on a few videotapes.

59
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,800
I didn't have it easy.

60
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,480
I can't let everything we have
be destroyed

61
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,070
because of her stubbornness.

62
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,750
If setting that fire

63
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,120
was what it took
to keep the Penglai Group alive,

64
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,070
then

65
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,800
I had to do it.

66
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,480
Penglai again.

67
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,630
Everything you say

68
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,270
comes back to Penglai!

69
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,390
Then what about my family?

70
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,070
You tell me, what about my home?

71
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,070
Tonight, Gao Feng and I will
be waiting for you at Muke Club.

72
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,720
I want you to tell me

73
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,430
the whole truth.

74
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,240
I want a home without lies.

75
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,120
I want a father who speaks honestly.

76
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,120
I'll wait for your decision.

77
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:16,300
=Episode 12=
=Choose=

78
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:23,870
Do I look like her?

79
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,270
Do I look like my mom?

80
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,580
You were there
when the fire happened, weren't you?

81
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
Do we look alike?

82
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,270
I guess not.

83
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,160
If we did look alike,

84
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,750
if she saw me as her daughter,

85
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,270
she wouldn't have been so cruel.

86
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,870
Do you still envy

87
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,480
this perfect family now?

88
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,920
It's ten.

89
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:31,870
Wait.

90
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,680
Forget it.

91
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,260
Let's wait a little longer.

92
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm late.

93
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,160
Feifei, do you want me to talk here

94
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,270
or at the police station?

95
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,700
(Su Min)

96
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:51,970
What are you doing?

97
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,550
If my dad hadn't shown up tonight,

98
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,550
I would've told you

99
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,510
everything I know.

100
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,030
But he's here.

101
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,670
So I'm giving him another chance.

102
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,390
You still trust him?

103
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,510
He's my dad.

104
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,030
That golden ball of yours

105
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,270
isn't that important.

106
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,320
My dad will hand over

107
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,750
all the evidence he has

108
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,270
to the police.

109
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,390
Right, Dad?

110
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,320
Yes.

111
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,670
You gave me your word, didn't you?

112
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,550
I did.

113
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,320
I'm sorry.

114
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,080
This is where

115
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,360
we should end things.

116
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,960
Wu Feifei, don't do this.

117
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,080
Let's go, Dad.

118
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,240
Wu Feifei, don't do this.

119
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,910
Thank you, Gao Feng.

120
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,440
But I'm not like my mom.

121
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,670
I'm not as righteous as you think.

122
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,080
I don't want to be a hero.

123
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,120
You misjudged me.

124
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,150
I just want to keep my family safe.

125
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,790
He's my only family.

126
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,080
Did you find it?

127
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:38,980
(Special Informed Consent)

128
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,140
(Gao Feng)

129
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,380
(History of the Peloponnesian War)

130
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,870
This belongs to your mom.

131
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,270
What you do with it

132
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,150
is up to you.

133
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,840
Doctor!

134
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,120
Doctor!

135
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:10,910
Feifei.

136
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:14,960
What did you mean by "another chance"?

137
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,720
I need to know

138
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:19,600
what you didn't tell Gao Feng.

139
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,720
The people who came to the club

140
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,120
were powerful.

141
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,200
Mr. Xu planned to use the recordings

142
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,390
as leverage for future dealings.

143
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,390
This is the darkest side of the club.

144
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:39,440
And Gao Feng's mother
stepped right into this.

145
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,080
They wanted to report it
using those tapes.

146
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,510
Mr. Xu had no choice.

147
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,480
Those people were too powerful.

148
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,840
I didn't want you involved

149
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,000
because

150
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,600
it was dangerous.

151
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,480
So everything was done by Mr. Xu?

152
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,840
I want to hear you say it.

153
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,840
Tell me you were dragged into this,

154
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,870
weren't you?

155
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,320
From now on, I'll be honest with you.

156
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:28,750
Very well.

157
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,630
From now on,

158
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,240
our family is a separate matter

159
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:38,630
from Mr. Xu and the company.

160
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,080
I'll take care of everything
from here on out.

161
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,910
Once the tapes and documents

162
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:43,960
are handed over,

163
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,720
the past is settled.

164
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:50,080
Whatever compensation Gao Feng deserves,
whatever turmoil the company faces,

165
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,790
we'll deal with it head-on.

166
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,670
Also,

167
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,200
remember this, Dad.

168
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,750
You knew nothing

169
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,840
about anything Mr. Xu did.

170
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:05,910
It has nothing to do with our family.

171
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:06,790
No.

172
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,630
If this comes out,

173
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,390
you'll be accused of covering up.

174
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,240
Your mom's case

175
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,480
is involved as well.

176
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,270
And Gao Feng

177
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,200
is on our tail.

178
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,120
I'm not scared of them.

179
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,200
What I'm scared of
is that once I tell the truth,

180
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,910
you'll act on impulse.

181
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,790
You're my dad.

182
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,000
As long as I can protect you,

183
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,390
I'd even sell off the company.

184
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,910
But I need you

185
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,480
to protect this family the way I do.

186
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,600
Can you do that?

187
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,480
Alright.

188
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,790
Then it's settled.

189
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,240
It's time to change the tubes.

190
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,120
Okay.

191
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:09,600
Feifei.

192
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,960
I'll tell you a secret.

193
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,510
The reason why I kept all this from you

194
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,480
wasn't that I was afraid of
getting caught.

195
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,840
I was afraid

196
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,030
you'd think I was a bad guy.

197
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,390
I see.

198
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,440
I'm your daughter.

199
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,270
No one wants you to be a good man

200
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,720
more than I do.

201
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:16,900
(Early 1990s)

202
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,160
Don't start the round yet.

203
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,400
Wait till I get back.

204
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,030
Serve, my foot.

205
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:23,720
They're wary of me.

206
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,030
I don't even know where they're staying.

207
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:29,270
Obviously, there's something
they don't want me to know.

208
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:30,830
Whatever.

209
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,270
As long as the hush money
is good enough.

210
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,480
Alright. I'm hanging up.

211
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,240
I'll play with you guys later.

212
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,160
Bye.

213
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,440
Biao.

214
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,070
Nanny Gao, sorry to keep you waiting.

215
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,490
Diapers and everything are in the back.
Get them yourself.

216
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,920
Biao, I'll have to trouble you again.

217
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,100
This. Alcohol, gauze, painkillers,
and the rest of the list.

218
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:10,920
Bring them over as soon as possible.

219
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,270
Why didn't you say it all at once?

220
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,680
Sorry for the trouble.

221
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,830
Why do you need all this?

222
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,000
Alcohol.

223
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,480
Gauze...

224
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,750
Take this. Go play cards.

225
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,790
You'll get lucky.

226
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,750
I'll be here in half an hour.

227
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,440
Hurry back.

228
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,680
Alcohol, vitamin, gauze.

229
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,510
Where's the meds? Did you get it?

230
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:17,720
He's buying it now.

231
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,880
Get me that big towel.

232
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:19,550
Hurry.

233
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,310
Oh my goodness.

234
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,350
Oh my goodness.

235
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,240
The maid's pregnant too.

236
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,440
No wonder you wouldn't let me in.

237
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,350
Long time no see.

238
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,200
Whose kid is it?

239
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,000
Didn't I already pay you?

240
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,390
Don't ask questions you shouldn't.

241
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,070
Things are different now.

242
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,000
You'll have to pay more.

243
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,830
How much do you want?

244
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,510
Fine. Name your price.

245
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,880
I'll pay you to shut you up for good.

246
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,310
I'll take the car.

247
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,240
And

248
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:32,240
give me one hundred thousand in cash.

249
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,110
Alright.

250
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,480
That little brat's worth that much?

251
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,590
He's Mr. Zhao's.

252
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,480
Think it through.

253
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:48,960
If the club ever goes under,

254
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,070
keeping Mr. Zhao's child

255
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,000
means you and I both have a way out.

256
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:57,880
So,

257
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,350
are you in?

258
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,270
I need to take another look.

259
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,790
He's that Yang fellow's. right?

260
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,160
I forgot to tell you.

261
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,480
Your man was brought in by me.

262
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,270
Two hundred thousand.

263
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,440
Two hundred thousand.

264
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,440
Cash. Now.

265
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,350
I'll pay you in installments.

266
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,510
No. Right now.

267
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,950
Where do you expect me to get
two hundred thousand in cash right now?

268
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,920
That's not my problem.

269
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,200
You don't have it,

270
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:02,640
do you?

271
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:03,880
Fine.

272
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,440
Mr. Xu.

273
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:06,720
Mr. Wu.

274
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,440
They'll definitely have it.

275
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,440
Maybe I'll pull off something big.

276
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,400
You're asking for death!

277
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,550
You're dead when Mr. Wu gets back!

278
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,200
The baby in your belly
isn't even Mr. Wu's, right?

279
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:27,480
Zhang Biao's dead. How are you
going to explain that to Mr. Wu?

280
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,160
Don't worry.
I've got a way to deal with him.

281
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,000
Who is it?

282
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,270
It's me.

283
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,440
Gao Dahua.

284
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,200
Come in.

285
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,590
Sit.

286
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:03,550
Thank you.

287
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:10,880
Is your baby alright?

288
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,790
Mr. Wu's kid

289
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:18,480
is tough.

290
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,590
I've been taking care of Qu Meng lately.

291
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,750
About the money we agreed on...

292
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,000
Don't worry.

293
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,270
I won't short you.

294
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,310
I don't want it anymore.

295
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,920
I don't want the money.

296
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,400
I'll count it as earning
some good karma.

297
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:55,880
Gao Dahua,

298
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:01,200
you and your wife never had kids.

299
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:04,920
That's why

300
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:07,550
I need to earn karma.

301
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,310
These days,

302
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,640
having you cook

303
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,350
and look after Qu Meng

304
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,590
wasn't just for that.

305
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,000
We've been watching you.

306
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,880
You're a good man.

307
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,070
Keeping this child

308
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,440
is trouble for us.

309
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,550
If

310
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:38,400
you're willing...

311
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,070
Yes, I am.

312
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,350
I am.

313
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,200
We'll give the child to you.

314
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,830
Can you look after him well?

315
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:52,680
I can.

316
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:56,990
I can take good care of him.

317
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,510
Think carefully. This child

318
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:03,200
won't be easy.

319
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:07,160
I'll raise him as my own.

320
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:09,480
I swear I will.

321
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,550
Do you want to take one last look?

322
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:36,350
No.

323
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,880
We won't be able to let go then.

324
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,240
Go.

325
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:09,750
Don't be sad.

326
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,240
You're a mother now.

327
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,000
You're incredible.

328
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:18,510
You really are.

329
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:22,880
Ms. Hong.

330
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,030
You're the incredible one.

331
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,160
Qu Meng.

332
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,920
You're ruthless indeed.

333
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,960
Your son is ruthless too.

334
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,960
This is the karma you planted?

335
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,480
Ruthless indeed.

336
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:19,880
(Let the past be the past.)

337
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:33,180
(Detention Area. Binchuan City
No. 1 Detention Center)

338
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,110
Dawg.

339
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,240
Mine?

340
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:10,340
(Detention Area. Binchuan City
No. 1 Detention Center)

341
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,000
Who?

342
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,000
That woman found in the attic fire

343
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,480
was Wu Feifei's birth mother,

344
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,750
Hongyue.

345
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:22,350
My mother's death

346
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,220
was tied to the sex trade
at the International Club

347
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,480
back in the 1990s.

348
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,720
Wu Guohao told me

349
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,400
my mother's name was Qu Meng.

350
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:32,960
He knew her.

351
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,790
He knew everything
that happened back then.

352
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,350
He set the fire

353
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:39,310
to cover up evidence

354
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,480
and every trace of
Wu Feifei's birth mother.

355
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:45,110
This may involve criminal activity
linked to the International Club.

356
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:46,510
Wu Feifei

357
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,400
chose to shield her dad.

358
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,720
Do you have any proof?

359
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,590
No.

360
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:01,550
Only statements.

361
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:06,350
The woman in the fire
can't be my mother.

362
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,200
Well.

363
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:12,750
This case is wide open now
and has drawn a lot of public attention.

364
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,920
We can't overlook any lead.

365
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,030
So we need both of you
to cooperate with the investigation.

366
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,400
We will cooperate.

367
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,640
If the company committed

368
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,400
any illegal or improper acts
in the past,

369
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,690
we will fully cooperate
with the investigation.

370
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,960
That's our responsibility.

371
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,960
You've already looked
into the International Club.

372
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,680
My dad was questioned as well.

373
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:35,480
If you still have doubts,

374
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,720
you're free to keep investigating.

375
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:40,790
I will grant you access
to all company documents.

376
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:43,030
If you find anything,

377
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,920
the company will
take legal responsibility.

378
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,480
But if you claim

379
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:50,750
my dad was involved

380
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:51,750
or covered things up,

381
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,720
or that the company is still
breaking the law today,

382
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,160
show us evidence.

383
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,070
Also,

384
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,160
you say the woman in the fire

385
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,070
is my mother,

386
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:04,880
but I don't accept that.

387
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,920
I can show you
my mom's death certificate.

388
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,270
You mentioned

389
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:10,790
you want to collect my DNA sample.

390
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:11,960
I'm sorry.

391
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,750
It's against the rules.

392
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,030
Alright.

393
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,440
Then

394
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:23,270
we'll need to take your mother's
personal belongings

395
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,240
for examination.

396
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,550
Gao Feng claims he identified

397
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,500
the woman in the fire

398
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,790
based on a golden ball pendant
and a portrait of your mother.

399
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,440
He claims?

400
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,350
Do you have that golden ball?

401
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,510
Maybe you should rein in your trainee.

402
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,030
If she keeps asking like this,

403
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,030
isn't that eliciting a confession?

404
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,310
I don't know anything
about a golden ball pendant.

405
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:11,030
But I can show you

406
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,550
the portrait you mentioned.

407
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:25,030
(Every moment in life is a choice.)

408
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:28,320
(Some choices lead to light,)

409
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,800
(others lead to hell.)

410
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,580
(Even when your judgment is clouded,)

411
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,710
(you still have to choose.)

412
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,070
Sorry about this.

413
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,550
We hired the new cleaners.
They weren't experienced.

414
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:40,800
They thought the painting
was waterproof

415
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,990
and wiped it with a wet cloth.

416
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,920
Everything my mom left behind is here.

417
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:45,550
See if you need it.

418
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,070
My mom passed away long ago.

419
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:53,770
The person you're talking about

420
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,670
is not her.

421
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,110
That woman has nothing to do with me.

422
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:24,590
We'll compensate

423
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,590
for your mother's death.

424
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,000
As the developer of Penglai Plaza,

425
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:31,090
I'll cooperate fully
with all police investigations

426
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,280
into the company's past.

427
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,230
I've made my stance.

428
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:36,510
You can ask Su Min.

429
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,840
I'm in full control of the company.

430
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
If there were any shady dealings
in the past,

431
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:47,230
I will give the public and the police
an explanation.

432
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,590
But stop making things up

433
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,000
about my mother.

434
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:58,400
Wu Feifei, you're not like your dad.

435
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,900
Don't sweep everything under the rug.

436
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:05,800
Gao Feng,

437
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,360
stay away from my family.

438
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:30,300
(Chongqing Home-style Cuisine)

439
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,010
When did you find out

440
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,660
about the relationship
between Madam He and Wu Guohao?

441
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:37,560
Just a few days ago.

442
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,880
Why didn't you tell me right away?

443
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,550
Fine. I'll explain it again.

444
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,070
When I got to the fire scene,

445
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,030
I saw Madam He wearing
a golden ball pendant.

446
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,280
The same one my mom had.

447
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,280
So I took it.

448
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:51,840
I didn't have any other evidence.

449
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,230
I figured I could use this

450
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,670
to negotiate with Wu Guohao

451
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,920
and see if I could confirm
their connection.

452
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:59,230
Verifying facts is the police's job.

453
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,400
What did you promise me
outside the hospital that day?

454
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,030
Do you realize that what you did

455
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:06,480
could count as tampering with
or destroying evidence?

456
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,630
Do you know how serious that is?

457
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,550
We'll deal with your negligence

458
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,550
and responsibility later.

459
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,960
This golden ball pendant

460
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:49,550
is the only thing my mom left me.

461
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,390
I've worn it since I was little.

462
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,800
I was just too eager

463
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,480
to find out how my mom died.

464
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,030
So when I saw Madam He

465
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,760
wearing the same one at the fire,

466
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:05,440
I was stunned.

467
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,030
I don't know

468
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:09,400
what kind of relationship they had.

469
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,190
But I was scared.

470
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,390
I was scared that everything
was somehow connected to me.

471
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,590
I was scared that my mom would die
because of me.

472
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,800
And

473
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,440
I really did want to
give Wu Feifei a chance.

474
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,550
Not everyone can turn in
their own family,

475
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,630
especially someone she has depended on
her whole life.

476
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,110
You may not understand,

477
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,510
but that's how I honestly feel.

478
00:38:49,611 --> 00:38:51,000
Take this as evidence.

479
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,440
I'm not sure if it'll help.

480
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:57,110
Look into it or test it if needed.

481
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:58,790
When you're done,

482
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,590
return it to me exactly as it was.

483
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,550
I'm sorry.

484
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:32,230
Have some shrimp.

485
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,230
Eat more.

486
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:34,150
It's nutritious.

487
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,590
It helps you recover faster.

488
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:36,800
Thank you, Madam Zhang.

489
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,030
Here. Have some vegetables.

490
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:45,400
Didn't you promise

491
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,960
to eat all three deals with me?

492
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:48,360
You cook tomorrow.

493
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:50,480
Don't mind me.

494
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,550
Just eat.

495
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:58,150
Eat this. It'll help you heal faster.

496
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,070
I had someone check your fortune.

497
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,110
Next year.

498
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,510
Next year is perfect for you two

499
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,110
to get married.

500
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,150
Long Yu.

501
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,550
You two need to think this through.

502
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,150
Once these videotapes are handed in,

503
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,110
everything about the company
and Mr. Xu in the past

504
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:41,590
will be dragged back into the open.

505
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:46,440
The company's stock price
and reputation

506
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:48,550
are bound to take a hit.

507
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:52,190
That's certainly not the worst part.

508
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,190
Worst case, we start over.

509
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,000
But Yang's dad...

510
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,510
Dad,

511
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:59,440
we agreed I'd handle this.

512
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:01,360
Dad.

513
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,520
Feifei and Lawyer Cao
are doing the right thing.

514
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:07,880
If these things were done by my dad,

515
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,480
then as his son, I have to face them.

516
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,330
There's no running from it.

517
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,880
Yes, turning in the evidence now

518
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:19,190
will affect the company.

519
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,630
But as long as you're still here,

520
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,960
I believe we'll have a chance
to bounce back.

521
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:25,920
And it makes sense

522
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,840
for me to hand it in.

523
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,070
I'll say they were
my dad's belongings.

524
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,730
I never looked through them.

525
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:32,800
There's always a way to explain it.

526
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:34,840
Yang,

527
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:37,000
Mr. Xu is a good man.

528
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:40,000
He helped a lot of people.

529
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:43,110
I'm the one who benefited the most.

530
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:48,360
Every generation has its own stories.

531
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:53,070
What my dad did

532
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,000
caused trouble for all of you.

533
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:56,840
Don't say that. No.

534
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:01,070
It's my fault.

535
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:04,920
Mr. Xu has been gone for so many years,

536
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:08,360
and I still haven't
settled things properly.

537
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,000
No. You did everything you could.

538
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:11,840
Even Feifei's mom...

539
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:17,960
Alright.

540
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:20,190
This ends here.

541
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:22,390
If the storm comes, let it come.

542
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:23,960
We'll face it together.

543
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,150
Once Lawyer Cao finishes all the plans,

544
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:28,030
I'll turn everything in.

545
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:29,960
That's the plan.

546
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:41,280
Let him alone.

547
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:43,630
Making this decision

548
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,400
wasn't easy.

549
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,320
Put yourself in his shoes.

550
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,920
If one day,

551
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,920
something happened to me,

552
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,150
