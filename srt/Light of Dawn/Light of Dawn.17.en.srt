=Light of Dawn=

2
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,620
(Day of the Penglai Plaza crash)

3
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,319
Hello, Ms. Hong.

4
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,079
Gao Feng and I have arrived.

5
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,280
We are seated by the window.

6
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,319
Okay.

7
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,560
Su.

8
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:31,000
Didn't I tell you

9
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,360
I was trying
to find Gao Feng's birth mother?

10
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,759
Didn't you warn me about scammers?

11
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:38,879
I think I really ran into one today.

12
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,120
I already gave her the money.
One hundred thousand.

13
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,120
Okay. I won't move. I won't.

14
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,520
I'll send you the address.

15
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,520
Hurry over.

16
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,080
And Su,

17
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,560
bring a few more people with you.

18
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:53,319
That woman seems a bit unstable.

19
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,360
The way she talks isn't normal.

20
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,120
Bring more people and detain her.

21
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:02,560
Hello.

22
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:04,960
Are you not looking for Qu Meng?

23
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,240
You will see her very soon.

24
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:17,160
That's impossible.

25
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:22,319
Back then, you buried
Gao Feng's birth mother yourself.

26
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,160
I didn't know.

27
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,279
Didn't know,

28
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,360
or didn't dare to know?

29
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,439
I didn't know.

30
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,160
Why wouldn't you let Gao Feng
look for his birth mother?

31
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,160
Why wouldn't you let Gao Feng
apply to the police academy?

32
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,720
All these years,

33
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,480
even for a single second,

34
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:43,079
if you hadn't kept lying to yourself,

35
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,439
it would never have come to this.

36
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:53,580
(Late 1990s
Penglai Plaza)

37
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,360
Stop dragging your feet. Move it.

38
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:07,920
Gao, let's stop this.

39
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,120
Hey. You stop right there.

40
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,519
You!

41
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,990
Gao Dahua, what are you staring at?

42
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,720
Move faster.

43
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:17,160
You're the only one left.

44
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,660
Even if it's just you,
you're finishing the job.

45
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,480
Stop right there. Do not run.

46
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,040
This is all my fault.

47
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,040
I was wrong.

48
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,480
I did not know it was Qu Meng.

49
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,319
I only wanted
to avoid dying at their hands.

50
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:06,160
I never thought it would be her.

51
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:08,079
I never imagined it was really her.

52
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,319
Please do not let Gao Feng find out.

53
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,360
It is already too late.

54
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,439
The stone statue has been smashed open.

55
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,199
The police
will start investigating soon.

56
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,720
Gao Feng will find out sooner or later.

57
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,519
Everything about his birth mother.

58
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,120
I deserve to die.

59
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,879
I will kill myself.

60
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:34,800
I will kill myself.

61
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,000
Can I trade my life for Qu Meng's?

62
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,680
Death will not let you off that easily.

63
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,199
What we are involved in

64
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,680
cannot be settled just by dying.

65
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:00,439
If I die,

66
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:01,600
once I am dead,

67
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,480
the police will not be able
to keep digging.

68
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,480
For my wife and my son,

69
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,199
you will just be a fraud.

70
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,240
Those things had nothing to do with me.

71
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:13,600
Ms. Hong.

72
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,390
I have been a coward my whole life.

73
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,240
I only want my wife and son

74
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,199
to live a steady, peaceful life.

75
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,560
Following me,

76
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,920
they have suffered enough.

77
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,839
Please do not drag them into this.

78
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,399
We were all too weak.

79
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:32,240
If we had even half
of Qu Meng's resolve,

80
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,759
none of us
would be living like this today.

81
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,279
You agree, right?

82
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:42,959
Ms. Hong.

83
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,319
You agree, right?

84
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:46,959
Then it is settled.

85
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,759
I will die.

86
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,920
I will die right now.

87
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,519
All of us deserve to die.

88
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,759
All of us.

89
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,160
We should have died long ago.

90
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,380
=Episode 17=
=Reunion=

91
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,320
- Who is a family member of Zhang Jing?
- I am.

92
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,390
- How is she?
- A mild cerebral infarction.

93
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,840
Fortunately, she was brought in early.

94
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,720
No surgery is needed.

95
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,990
It is best to stay hospitalized
for observation for a few days.

96
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,639
- Go register and pay the fees.
- Okay. Thank you, doctor.

97
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,930
- You are welcome. It is my duty.
- Thank you.

98
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,279
Do you know why

99
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:00,960
I never liked using an insulin pump?

100
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:04,159
All these years,

101
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,519
I just wanted you to take care of me.

102
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,080
The moment when you gave me injections,

103
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:11,600
even if it was only for a short while,

104
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,200
in my eyes,

105
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,919
you will always be

106
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:17,240
that obedient and sensible little girl.

107
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:19,759
Feifei.

108
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,840
Do not become like your mother.

109
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:26,320
Do not follow her path.

110
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,120
After years of senseless turmoil,

111
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:38,039
it tore this family apart
between life and death.

112
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:43,840
We are already separated
by life and death.

113
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,840
You always say

114
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:49,559
I carry your blood.

115
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,639
But I carry my mother's blood.

116
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,639
Are you not afraid
that for my mother's sake,

117
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:58,960
I will come after you?

118
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:03,600
You have lived half your life

119
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:05,240
hiding everything away.

120
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,120
To be honest, I actually pity you.

121
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,990
You have spent your whole life
running from the truth.

122
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:14,399
Killing to silence others.

123
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:15,840
Destroying evidence.

124
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:20,799
You ungrateful child.

125
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,480
Everything I did was for you.

126
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,879
I have lived half my life

127
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,639
calculating every step.

128
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,919
I calculated everything,

129
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,600
except that the one who would report me
to the Public Security Bureau

130
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,960
would be my own daughter.

131
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,480
I fought my whole life

132
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,919
against people out there

133
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:39,960
who wanted me dead.

134
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,039
I competed nonstop

135
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:42,879
to build all of this.

136
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:45,080
And it was all for you.

137
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,440
Yet a flimsy confession letter

138
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:52,360
made you and Yang come after me,

139
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,600
seeing me as some monster
who kills to silence others

140
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:00,039
and destroys evidence.

141
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:02,960
Feifei.

142
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:05,440
Thirty years ago, Binchuan

143
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,200
meant nothing to me.

144
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,480
It was only because of you

145
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,240
that I finally had roots.

146
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:18,120
Because of you,

147
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,960
I stayed in this city.

148
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:31,240
Love is love.

149
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:34,840
Crime is crime.

150
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:39,000
They do not cancel each other out.

151
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:47,960
Dad.

152
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:50,679
Turn yourself in.

153
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,639
I will go with you
to the Public Security Bureau.

154
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,639
We will tell them everything.

155
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,240
No matter how it ends,

156
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,240
I am still your daughter.

157
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,519
Otherwise...

158
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,360
Otherwise, whatever we had
as father and daughter

159
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,600
may truly come to an end.

160
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,320
Gao Feng is my child.

161
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,000
He is my son, Zhang Jing's son.

162
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,519
I am sorry, Mom.

163
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:48,799
I was digging into my own past
and dragged you into it.

164
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:23,399
You really are just like the old man.

165
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,080
Both of you are stubborn to the end,

166
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,720
even when it is obvious.

167
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:32,159
You claim you are not doing it
for each other,

168
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,240
yet you cannot stop worrying
about one another.

169
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:39,200
You still care about this family.

170
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,879
Come home.

171
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,559
All right?

172
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,639
The Technical Appraisal Center
confirmed that Uncle Gao's video

173
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,440
and the footage Xu Zhiyang
previously submitted,

174
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,720
the video of Xu Peng
committing the crime,

175
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,990
are actually the same recording.

176
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,600
It was just split into two parts.

177
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,880
What we obtained earlier
was the first segment.

178
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:08,559
As for Uncle Gao's case,
I will get to the bottom of it.

179
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,039
Aunt Zhang may not
have known everything either.

180
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,250
That does not matter anymore.

181
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,559
How is Wu Feifei doing now?

182
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,320
We have not been able
to reach her at all.

183
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,240
Her phone will not connect,

184
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,159
and their house is shut tight.

185
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,200
We have people watching it.

186
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,639
What matters most right now

187
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,720
is that we need to protect Wu Feifei
as soon as possible.

188
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,840
My only real memory from childhood

189
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:43,000
is my mother telling me

190
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:45,000
that if I ever felt lonely,

191
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,399
I should listen to the sounds
inside the statue.

192
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:51,160
You were there when the fire happened,
were you not?

193
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:53,480
Do I resemble my mother?

194
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,639
Probably not.

195
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:58,240
If I did,

196
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,679
if she truly saw me as her daughter,

197
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,120
she would not have been so ruthless.

198
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,639
Do me a favor.

199
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:10,240
Help me check where Wu Feifei went

200
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:11,519
after the attic fire.

201
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,879
(Binchuan Public Security Bureau Data Center)
Pull all surveillance footage related to this vehicle.

202
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:15,080
Stop.

203
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,679
Gao Feng,
after reviewing the surveillance,

204
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,600
Wu Feifei and Wu Guohao

205
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,480
went to her mother's
cemetery together once,

206
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,200
and later she went there alone again.

207
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,320
As for what she did there,

208
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:29,799
we have not been able
to determine it yet.

209
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:30,860
(Beloved Wife, Li Hongyue)

210
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,039
I know.

211
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:35,080
To say goodbye.

212
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,080
To say goodbye to her childhood.

213
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,759
(Beloved Wife, Li Hongyue)

214
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,440
These are your mother's belongings.

215
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,840
How would you like to handle them?

216
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:48,960
That is for you to decide.

217
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,159
Ms. Wu, based on the latest leads,

218
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,559
we need to conduct

219
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:55,440
a DNA test.

220
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:57,759
Please come back to the bureau with us
and assist with the investigation.

221
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,679
All right, I will go with you.

222
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:37,080
What are you doing?

223
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,759
Are you hitting someone
in front of the police?

224
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,610
Believe it or not,
I can take you in right now.

225
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,600
Officer Su.

226
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,919
Thank you for your concern.

227
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:45,960
This is not assault.

228
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,799
It is our unique corporate culture.

229
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,159
A little pat,

230
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:52,320
to keep people clear headed.

231
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:53,480
Thank you, Mr. Wu.

232
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:57,320
Wu Guohao.

233
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,039
I am formally notifying you now

234
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,950
that you may not leave Binchuan
for the time being.

235
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,399
If it is confirmed
that the woman in the attic

236
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:04,599
is your wife, Hongyue,

237
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,160
we will proceed in accordance
with the law immediately.

238
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,160
I am not going anywhere.

239
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,599
Please investigate this thoroughly

240
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,680
and clear my name.

241
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,640
- This way.
- Officer Su, take care.

242
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,079
Feifei.

243
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:43,920
Dad.

244
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,519
I am leaving now.

245
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,599
Take care of yourself.

246
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:38,839
Based on the deductions
made by Gao Feng and Wu Feifei,

247
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,359
everything Hongyue did
after returning to Binchuan

248
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:43,160
seems she was guiding them, step by step

249
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,799
to question and investigate
their own origins.

250
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,799
Following this line of thinking,
we discovered a sequence of numbers

251
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,290
inside both spherical pieces
of evidence.

252
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:51,279
After examination,

253
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:54,480
We believe this string of numbers
represents latitude and longitude.

254
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,359
They point precisely

255
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:57,960
to the stone lion at Penglai Plaza.

256
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,079
However,

257
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:02,839
the victim could not
have known in advance

258
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,519
that she would be buried
beneath the statue.

259
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:08,359
So when she left behind these numbers,

260
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:11,400
could they have meant something else?

261
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:13,759
After the statue was struck open,

262
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:15,079
we carried out

263
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:17,319
routine excavation
and investigation in the area.

264
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,559
So far,

265
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:21,279
we have found no other suspicious leads.

266
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:24,480
We will expand the search,
both in scope and in depth.

267
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,000
Since these numbers

268
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,960
clearly point to Penglai Plaza,

269
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:29,690
we will comb
the entire place thoroughly.

270
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:30,319
Understood.

271
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:38,880
Thank you.

272
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,519
The DNA test results

273
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:42,480
will be ready shortly.

274
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,119
What are you thinking right now?

275
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:45,480
I am thinking about

276
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:52,160
what went through your mind
when you learned

277
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:55,390
that your mother was buried there.

278
00:20:58,119 --> 00:20:58,799
During that time,

279
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,240
I often camped overnight at the plaza.

280
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,119
Sometimes people out on morning runs

281
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:04,640
mistook me for a homeless person.

282
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,519
But honestly, those were

283
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:09,100
the best nights of sleep I had in years.

284
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,960
I felt especially close to my mom.

285
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:16,079
Sometimes family and blood ties

286
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,519
are just like that.

287
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:21,039
There is an invisible thread
between them,

288
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,680
one that never truly breaks.

289
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,440
Maybe it was fate.

290
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,200
How can all of this
be such a coincidence?

291
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,799
Once the truth is fully uncovered,
your life may change completely.

292
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:37,359
Are you afraid?

293
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:40,319
I was.

294
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:45,480
Because of that fear,

295
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,960
I avoided everything for far too long.

296
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,279
So now I want to understand clearly

297
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:54,359
what that thread of mine

298
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,920
really looks like.

299
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,279
While comparing
the biological relationship

300
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:03,599
between witness Wu Feifei

301
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:06,680
and the female body found in the attic,

302
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:07,990
we discovered they are not related.

303
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,400
However, unexpectedly,

304
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,000
the DNA comparison between

305
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,319
Wu Feifei and Gao Feng|
showed a very high match.

306
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,440
They also share a direct biological link

307
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,400
with the skeletal remains of Qu Meng.

308
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:21,880
We have preliminarily determined
that Gao Feng and Wu Feifei

309
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,559
are fraternal twins born to Qu Meng.

310
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:35,260
(Early 1990s)

311
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,079
Boy and girl twins.

312
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,880
Boy and girl twins.

313
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,200
You are truly remarkable.

314
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,319
Go to the hospital.

315
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:41,640
It is too late.

316
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,920
I know my own child.

317
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:51,680
Just now...

318
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,240
There is no way the baby can survive.

319
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:16,440
Fate really plays cruel tricks.

320
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,599
From the moment I became pregnant,

321
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,039
I carried this child with an intention.

322
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,960
In the end,

323
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,920
I still could not protect him.

324
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:35,200
I failed this child.

325
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:42,200
I am sorry.

326
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,839
I do not deserve
to be this child's mother.

327
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,000
This is fate.

328
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,920
All of it is fate.

329
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,960
What I owe my child,

330
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,160
in another life,

331
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:08,400
I will repay slowly then.

332
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:19,920
Qu Meng.

333
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,880
Give me the girl.

334
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,839
I will raise her.

335
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,039
Can you really let her go?

336
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,359
This is fate.

337
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:44,240
Stop crying.

338
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,640
From now on...

339
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,240
From now on, we are both mothers.

340
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:07,920
Names.

341
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,680
The children's names.

342
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:13,599
Have you decided?

343
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,319
The boy will be called Feng.

344
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:28,000
The girl will be called Fei.

345
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,519
I hope that they

346
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:36,839
can ride the wind

347
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,279
and soar high.

348
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,480
When did you first start sensing it?

349
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:45,240
I do not know.

350
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:47,799
To be honest, I used to think

351
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,559
that talk about twins having

352
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:52,839
some kind of telepathic bond

353
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:55,759
was just psychological.

354
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:56,720
I did not believe it.

355
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,640
But

356
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,960
once it actually happened to me,

357
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,720
up until today,

358
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,920
it feels like everything happening to me

359
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,519
is somehow truly connected to you.

360
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,599
Both of us can hear the song.

361
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:16,039
That day of the fire,

362
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,880
I actually dreamed of you.

363
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,400
And also,

364
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:29,559
you could even guess
where I hid the golden sphere.

365
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,280
It feels like,
even before we recognized each other,

366
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,279
there was always some unseen force

367
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:37,359
pushing us forward.

368
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:40,400
Back then, we just did not realize

369
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:42,640
what it all meant.

370
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:44,079
Yeah.

371
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,839
I always thought that person

372
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,319
was my only family in this world.

373
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,720
From a bloodline perspective,

374
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,160
I gained one more family member,

375
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,400
but I also lost one.

376
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:13,279
So my dad,

377
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,359
so Wu Guohao...

378
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:24,680
About Wu Guohao,

379
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,759
I need some time to accept it.

380
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:35,000
Me too.

381
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,200
After everything we have been through,

382
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,079
we should thank ourselves.

383
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,319
We did not become the people
we once hated.

384
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,799
And more importantly,

385
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,440
we finally found another version
of ourselves in this world.

386
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,680
Nice to meet you, Wu Feifei.

387
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:18,960
Nice to meet you,

388
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,960
Gao Feng.

389
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,279
Feifei.

390
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:35,519
Feng.

391
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,119
Happy birthday.

392
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:44,039
Live well.

393
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,920
Their parents are coming back.

394
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:52,079
I asked Gao Dahua
to take Zhang Jing to a movie.

395
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,119
No need.

396
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,000
Let us sing and blow out the candles.

397
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,279
Time to blow out the candles.

398
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:07,920
Come on, blow them out.

399
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:10,880
Happy birthday.

400
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:12,160
Happy birthday.

401
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,279
Come on, blow out the candles.

402
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,119
Let us sing a song.

403
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,090
You should be the one singing.

404
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,359
You should sing.

405
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,000
I heard that

406
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,519
for a child's first birthday,

407
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,079
the mother sings the song.

408
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:41,480
They will remember it.

409
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:44,640
Feifei,

410
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:47,359
let Mom sing you a birthday song, okay?

411
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,039
Okay.

412
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:52,720
I will sing it for you.

413
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,980
The criminals were extremely cunning.

414
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:50,000
They hid key evidence

415
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,319
far deeper than we expected.

416
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:54,680
This time, we discovered
two sets of female remains,

417
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:56,680
the remains of two aborted infants,

418
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,960
and one set of male remains.

419
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,720
Based on preliminary examinations,

420
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,559
the time of death for all these remains
predates Qu Meng.

421
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,870
Urban construction records show

422
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,519
that before the plaza was built,
the site was wasteland,

423
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,300
which fits the conditions
for burying bodies.

424
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:09,599
According to forensic analysis,

425
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:11,599
the male victim's skull

426
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:13,720
suffered blunt force trauma
before death.

427
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:14,559
At the same time,

428
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,599
we also found, among the remains,

429
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:17,680
a tooth

430
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,640
that did not belong to the victim.

431
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,519
We believe

432
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,559
this tooth

433
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:24,240
was knocked out
during a violent collision

434
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,640
suffered by the victim before death.

435
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:27,060
The task force requests authorization

436
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:29,640
to formally launch
an investigation into Wu Guohao

437
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,490
and other suspects from Penglai Group,
and to conduct DNA comparisons.

438
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:33,680
Request approved.

439
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,440
Yes.

440
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:59,200
Put a lion statue right here.

441
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:01,720
Mr. Wu, this location is different
from the original plan.

442
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,559
It will affect the entire plaza layout.

443
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:05,079
Do not talk to me about planning.

444
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:06,260
I am telling you, Mr. Xu,

445
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:07,519
the master
has already calculated everything.

446
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:08,719
(The stone lion statue coordinates)
The latitude and longitude are all set.

447
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,920
It must be built at this exact spot.

448
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,920
Fine, we will follow Mr. Wu's decision.

449
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,559
Have some tea.

450
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,880
It can go anywhere.

451
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,000
No, it has to be right here.

452
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,719
- It has to be. It absolutely has to be.
- Everything is marked.

453
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:22,719
It was all calculated.

454
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:30,559
(I never imagined that after
a lifetime of careful scheming,)

455
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,360
(in the end, the person I trusted most)

456
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,559

After Wu Guohao
burned the items on the outskirts,

545
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,360
we lost his phone signal.

546
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:41,039
He is clearly very familiar
with Binchuan's road surveillance system.

547
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,239
This is the last location

548
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:44,679
where he was captured on camera.

549
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,679
After cross checking SkyNet footage
and identity data,

550
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:50,679
we are certain Wu Guohao
has not left Binchuan.

551
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,639
What about the newly
discovered male body?

552
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,690
Has the identity been confirmed?

553
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,719
Based on information
previously provided by Gao Feng,

554
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,039
and combined
with the skeletal age indicators,

555
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:03,719
we suspect this body belongs to

556
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:05,920
Yang Wenyuan, who went missing in 1993.

557
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:08,039
We are expediting DNA comparisons

558
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:09,159
with Gao Feng and Wu Feifei.

559
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,119
Also,

560
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,559
the tooth found among the remains

561
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:15,079
that does not belong to the deceased,

562
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,079
must be

563
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,360
matched as soon as possible
with Wu Guohao's DNA.

564
00:40:18,679 --> 00:40:19,199
Yes.

565
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,440
Ensure the personal safety
of Gao Feng and Wu Feifei.

566
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,039
Yes.

567
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:31,679
Xiao Yang, once Wu Feifei
checks into the hotel,

568
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,430
you are responsible
for her full protection.

569
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:53,760
Do not move.

570
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,519
What a pity.

571
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,320
Such a pity.

572
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,719
You are quite sharp.

573
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,000
You are real talent.

574
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,090
If he has something to say,
have him tell me himself.

575
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:40,719
There are cameras everywhere now.

576
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,280
The citywide search has already begun.

577
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,400
There is a reward for tips.

578
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,000
Take a guess how much you are worth.

579
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:47,719
Five hundred thousand.

580
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:52,199
Do you have any proof?

581
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:54,880
Let me give you a heads up.

582
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,039
On the police side, they may already
have your latest evidence.

583
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,470
You used Xu Peng to take the fall
for the restaurant incident.

584
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,559
You buried the murders
beneath the statue.

585
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,760
But do you really think you have won?

586
00:42:10,519 --> 00:42:11,239
Chen Kang.

587
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,360
Give him the phone.

588
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,320
Yes, Mr. Wu.

589
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,840
I know I cannot get away anymore.

590
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:22,800
But still,

591
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,599
there are things I want to
say to you and the girl.

592
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:30,599
Chen Kang will tell you
the time and place.

593
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,430
If you have anything to say,
say it to the police.

594
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,039
Do you really not want to know

595
00:42:34,039 --> 00:42:37,000
how your biological father,
Yang Wenyuan,

596
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,440
actually died?

597
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,159
Do you not want to know?

598
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,639
