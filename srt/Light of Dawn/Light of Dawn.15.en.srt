(Everything that happened)

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,799
(was forced on me by him.)

00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,719
(The real satan is Wu Guohao.)

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,479
(It has always been him.)

(Gao Feng: I talked to your wife.
It did not go well.)

8
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,660
(Gao Feng: Come out.
Let us meet in person.)

(Gao Fei: Are you really going to let
Wu Feifei's family deceive you for your entire life?)

12
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,140
(Are you truly willing to believe
you have a father like that?)

13
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,500
(You are about
to become a father yourself.)

14
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,140
(Do you want your child to grow up
in a family built entirely on lies?)

(Xu Zhiyang)

16
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,960
You, Gao.

17
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,840
Why do you keep shamelessly

18
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:36,360
entangling yourself
with every member of our family?

19
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,800
If you continue like this,

20
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:41,400
do not blame me for responding in kind.

21
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,360
Where is your father's letter?

22
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:02,599
I stored it away.

23
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:04,159
If you want to know where it is,

24
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,759
that depends on how our talk goes today.

25
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,639
You already know everything
between your father and me.

26
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,390
What is left to talk about?

27
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,879
There were things
my father still dared not say,

28
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,890
and did not dare to write,

29
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,720
even at the very end.

30
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:24,959
What were those things?

31
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,680
What was worth killing
so many people for,

32
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,000
and spending
an entire lifetime pretending?

33
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:34,480
I need to know.

34
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,480
There are many things

35
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,839
I do not even want
to think about myself...

36
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:41,920
I still need to know!

38
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:01,839
Inside the spherical evidence
provided by Gao Feng,

39
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:03,480
we found a small amount
of hallucinogens.

40
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,920
At the same time, we learned that
around one year before Qu Meng's death,

41
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,500
the International Club underwent
a corporate transformation.

42
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:12,360
We are now facing an industrial shift

43
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,120
and must explore

44
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,000
a new industries and new fields.

45
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:18,399
The group will
be making major moves next.

46
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,190
Combined with the statements
from He Xiaohong

47
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,590
and other song and dance performers,

48
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,700
we have preliminary grounds to suspect

49
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:26,390
that the International Club is not only
involved in adult entertainment,

50
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,680
but that its core business chain

51
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,439
is very likely tied to drug trafficking.

52
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,879
Testing further revealed

53
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:33,600
that these hallucinogens are linked
to local drug transport leads

54
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,319
dating back to around 1995.

55
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:38,879
Juan.

56
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,319
You...

57
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,480
I will look for Ms. Hong.

58
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,560
Ms. Hong!

59
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,600
Ms. Hong!

60
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,959
I am sorry. We were wrong.

61
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:56,990
We will never do it again.

62
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:58,360
Please let us go.

63
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,759
We will never do it again.

64
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:00,759
Open the door.

65
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:01,959
Open the door!

66
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:06,680
Get a doctor. Find a doctor to save her.

67
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,319
Get away.

68
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,040
No.

69
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:13,600
Open the door!

70
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,270
Everyone downstairs is asking

71
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,759
where Ms. Hong, the one who could
solve everything, has gone.

72
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,319
Watching them with our own eyes,

73
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,800
using every trick to harm the girls,

74
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,879
the one thing we most wanted to do

75
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,879
was something we could never accomplish.

76
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,879
Then what kind of Ms. Hong am I?

77
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,480
Xu Peng used Feifei
to force you and Mr. Wu.

78
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,480
That was not your fault.

79
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,079
I did not stop it.

80
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,160
That is my fault.

81
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,100
Keeping them company

82
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:52,680
was never enough.

83
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,879
They still had to be transported.

84
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,040
I could not stop it.

85
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,000
That is my sin.

86
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,199
Hongyue.

87
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,040
You cannot fall apart.

88
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,040
If you collapse,

89
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,040
then no one will have any hope left.

90
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,159
May I ask something?

91
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,440
Why?

92
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,879
For this company to survive and grow,

93
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,120
it has to choose

94
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,600
the path with the greatest returns.

95
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,240
What the club did before

96
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,600
was that not enough?

97
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:11,679
What happened to Tian Juan
was an accident.

98
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:14,320
The other girls were doing fairly well.

99
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:16,440
Doing this,

100
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,919
they earned more
than working in restaurants.

101
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:20,519
Making more money?

102
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,200
That is a road that leads to ruin.

103
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,639
After all these years,

104
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,600
I have finally seen through it.

105
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,000
I do not want to play along anymore.

106
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,159
I have only one request.

107
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,960
They have already been sent out.

108
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,000
They already risked their lives
to help you make money once.

109
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,360
Let them go home
with their children, okay?

110
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,600
Yue.

111
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,559
Drugs are not like other businesses.

112
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,399
Whether it is once, twice,
or countless times,

113
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:53,600
its nature never changes.

114
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:55,799
No one gets out.

115
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,000
No one gets out.

116
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,519
Do not worry. The company
will take care of them for life.

117
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:12,919
Hongyue.

118
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:17,679
Calm down.

119
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,759
If anything happens to the girls again,

120
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,759
I will stake my life
and fight you to the end!

121
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:29,240
Alright.

122
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,919
Go upstairs and get some rest.

123
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,240
Stop wiping here.

124
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:07,480
You just lost the baby.

125
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,080
Go back and focus on recovering first.

126
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:13,320
You are all in this together.

127
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:15,960
You, Hongyue,

128
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,759
you are all in it together with them.

129
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:20,559
Having us entertain
and accompany clients,

130
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:21,720
was not enough.

131
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:23,720
You even made us handle drugs.

132
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:29,120
One of you plays the queen,

133
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:30,559
the other plays the angel.

134
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,480
You are not as innocent
as you pretend to be.

135
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,000
I am barely surviving now,

136
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,759
all for the sake of avenging the girls.

137
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,240
We only learned
about the drugs today as well.

138
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,190
Ms. Hong has already gone
to look for a solution.

139
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,940
But with just the two of us,
there is no way we can truly stop them.

140
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:48,360
Tian Juan is already gone.

141
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,900
We do not want anything
to happen to you again.

142
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,799
Go back and focus on recovering.

143
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:55,159
You do not need to worry about me.

144
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:58,080
My life has never been worth much.

145
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:00,679
No matter how tightly
you bind me with wealth,

146
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:01,919
nothing will truly change.

147
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,559
If my life,

148
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,490
together with the lives
of two of them can end this,

149
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,440
then it is worth it.

150
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,480
Look at this.

151
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:22,480
It is what Tian Juan left behind.

152
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:26,679
Those who are gone
cannot be brought back.

153
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,360
Those still alive
must live well for her.

154
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,360
Get out.

155
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,360
If hatred alone could solve everything,

156
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:11,720
I would have burned
this place down long ago.

157
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,120
Revenge takes patience.

158
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:16,639
We need a plan.

159
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,360
Why should I trust you?

160
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:21,879
If it comes to hatred,
I feel it more than anyone.

161
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:23,799
So why should I trust you?

162
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,080
I have a child.

163
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:37,480
With Yang Wenyuan.

164
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,039
If they find out

165
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,480
that there is a child
between Yang Wenyuan and me,

166
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,919
you know exactly what will happen to me.

167
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,320
That child is my life.

168
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:54,039
I am placing my life in your hands.

169
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:56,519
Is that enough?

170
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,519
The child...

171
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:13,919
Alright.

172
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:17,000
I will follow your plan.

173
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,639
I will follow your plan.

174
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,759
And bring them down.

175
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,039
Mr. Xu, you have worked hard.

176
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,279
It is hard work now,

177
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:35,720
so you can enjoy the rewards later.

178
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:40,519
Here.

179
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,120
Sign these as well.

180
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:50,399
Wu.

181
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:54,759
Some business ventures,

182
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:57,639
even when they come with serious risks,

183
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,240
once we decide to do them,
we commit fully...

184
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:02,240
But drugs are different.

185
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,639
This is not a business
only we are involved in.

186
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:08,240
If you keep hesitating like this,

187
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,440
one day you will not even
get a share of what others

188
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,440
leave behind.

189
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,639
We are already on this boat now.

190
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,039
If we force a hard turn,

191
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,440
the boat will capsize.

192
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,320
And if it capsizes,
we will be destroyed.

193
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,919
You need to think this through.

194
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:27,240
Our families are still on board.

195
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,900
(Cargo Transaction Contract. Xu Peng.)

196
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,159
Continue.

197
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,580
(Transaction Contract. Xu Peng.)

198
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,519
Back then, I had no choice.

199
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:15,440
I only wanted a full meal,

200
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:16,759
just enough to survive.

201
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:20,480
But now, I want to live with courage.

202
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,720
To truly live.

203
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,240
Atonement.

204
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,399
Starting now,

205
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,399
we fight them to the very end.

206
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,399
What else do you want to know?

207
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,319
Turn yourself in.

208
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:07,720
If you do not,

209
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,720
I will hand the letter to the police.

210
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,920
The words of the dead alone

211
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,480
cannot be used as evidence.

212
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,680
You know that,

213
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:20,599
otherwise you would not
have come to talk to me.

214
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,319
By the way,

215
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,640
you are recording this, right?

216
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,920
Take it out.

217
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,319
Secret recordings
have no legal standing.

218
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,640
The number you have dialed
is currently unavailable.

219
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:47,079
Please try again later.

220
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,599
The number you have dialed
is currently unavailable.

221
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:56,960
Please try again later.

222
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:00,480
Xu Zhiyang is in danger.

223
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,650
Get in the car. Come with me.

224
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,839
Trust me one more time.

225
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,119
Yang.

226
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:15,640
All these years,
how Feifei and I treated you,

227
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,799
you know very well.

228
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:19,240
So no matter what I do,

229
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:21,720
I am supposed to be grateful for it?

230
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:26,000
Wear a mask long enough,
and it becomes your face.

231
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:28,079
You ruined my father's entire life,

232
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:30,440
and in the end
you still expect me to call you Dad?

233
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:34,720
I truly raised you as my own son.

234
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,000
I am not a fool.

235
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,100
After my mother passed away,
I lived in your home all those years.

236
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:42,599
But look at this house yourself.

237
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:43,480
From top to bottom,

238
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:44,920
is there any trace of me at all?

239
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,119
I hardly got to see my dad all year.

240
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,559
And every time I did,
your people were watching.

241
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:51,319
Do you really think I felt nothing?

242
00:18:57,279 --> 00:18:59,319
I just did not want to assume the worst.

243
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:02,440
After my dad passed away,
I truly became an orphan.

244
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:07,079
I did not want to lose
the father I still...

245
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:11,160
Yes,

246
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:13,359
this cannot be used as evidence.

247
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,720
But I can send it to Feifei.

248
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,720
I want her to know

249
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,079
what kind of person

250
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:21,559
the father she protects really is.

251
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,559
The two of us
are already trapped in this fire pit.

252
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:24,319
Is that not enough?

253
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,039
Do you still want to drag her in too?

254
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,519
Go to my study
and take a look at something.

255
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:08,240
(Cargo Transaction Contract. Xu Peng.)
These are all internal records related to

256
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,319
drug trafficking.

257
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:13,480
Every single one
bears your father's signature.

258
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:16,920
Once drugs are involved,

259
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:19,279
everything changes in nature.

260
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,519
You would not want your father

261
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:25,319
to be labeled
a drug trafficker in the end.

262
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,559
Of course I would not.

263
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:29,559
In a single night,

264
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:32,799
decades of hard work
could be completely ruined.

265
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,559
The trafficker is you.

266
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,440
You forced him into it.

267
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,359
In your father's letter,

268
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,599
I was only mentioned once.

269
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,599
Just one line,

270
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:52,319
calling me a satan.

271
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,160
Is that evidence?

272
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,000
Is it?

273
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,400
Then what is this?

274
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,839
This is irrefutable proof.

275
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,000
That letter is not important.

276
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,119
If an outsider came to me shouting

277
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:12,640
about handing the letter to the police,

278
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,599
I would not waste words on him.

279
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:20,559
But you

280
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,319
are different.

281
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:30,720
You entered this family
over twenty years ago.

282
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,599
You grew from a child
into an adult here.

283
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,720
You married my daughter.

284
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:39,279
And you are about to become a father.

285
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,519
Yang,

286
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:43,599
you carry responsibility.

287
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,920
You have responsibility to this family.

288
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,720
Once that letter is handed over,

289
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,319
it will not clear your father's name,

290
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:55,759
it will only bring more trouble.

291
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:57,880
When that happens, this family,

292
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,880
you and Feifei,

293
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,559
will fall apart.

294
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,559
Even if we take a step back,

295
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:08,720
and assume you find evidence
you believe proves my guilt,

296
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:11,720
how would Feifei's case be defined?

297
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:14,799
She knew
I was involved in the attic fire,

298
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,039
yet she told the police I was innocent.

299
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,519
Why do you insist
on dragging Feifei into this?

300
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,480
You are a smart kid.

301
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:26,799
You know how to do things in a way
that works in your favor.

302
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,119
You should know
how to weigh the pros and cons.

303
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,119
These things,

304
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,640
I will take care of them.

305
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:41,519
You, Feifei, and your child

306
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,279
can go on living a calm, peaceful life.

307
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:49,319
Give me your father's letter.

308
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,559
Delete every backup photo

309
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,559
you still have.

310
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:58,640
What I want from this is one thing only,

311
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,559
loyalty.

312
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:03,119
Loyalty to your family.

313
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:04,559
Loyalty to this home.

314
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,000
That is the attitude I want.

315
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:08,160
Living under the same roof,

316
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:10,039
eating from the same pot,

317
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,079
without loyalty,

318
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:15,759
you will never feel secure.

319
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:20,359
Yang, if you leave this family,

320
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:23,319
you will truly have nothing left.

321
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:43,420
(Recording deleted.)

322
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,420
(Deleted.)

323
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,119
Officer Su, is there something you need?

324
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:15,880
Mr. Wu, we have new leads.

325
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:18,180
Please come back to the bureau with us
and assist with the investigation.

326
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,559
You are a young woman.

327
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,590
What are you doing running around
so late at night?

328
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:27,720
Where is Xu Zhiyang?

329
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,640
Your husband is at home waiting for you.

330
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:35,119
Mr. Wu.

331
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,559
Alright.

332
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:38,279
I will go with you.

333
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,759
Go home and stay there.

334
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:46,319
Take good care of Yang.

335
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:54,400
Xu Zhiyang.

336
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,559
What are you doing, Gao Feng?

337
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,799
Xu Zhiyang!

338
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,559
Xu Zhiyang, why do you
not dare to step forward?

339
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:02,160
Control this mad dog.

340
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,400
You can tell the police

341
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,460
what you have been hiding.

342
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,920
Or at the very least,
you can tell your wife.

343
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,759
Go inside first.

344
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:18,720
I have nothing to say to you.

345
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:20,119
Get out.

346
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:24,519
What are you hiding?

347
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,000
What are you afraid of?

348
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,920
What exactly do you want me to do?

349
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,720
What do you think I can do?

350
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,079
- What are you afraid of?
- Why? Why are you forcing me?

351
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,519
Why are you forcing me?

352
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:32,319
Why?

353
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,880
Alright.

354
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,400
Do you have anything
you want to say to us?

355
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,720
Yes, Yang.

356
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:52,000
Is there anything you want to say
to Officer Su?

357
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:57,319
If not, take good care of your wife.

358
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,279
She is still pregnant.

359
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:14,640
Officer Su.

360
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,720
My husband is a bit
overwhelmed right now.

361
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:18,920
Could you give him some space?

362
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:23,880
Let us go.

363
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,960
Where is your car?

364
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,480
Let us go.

365
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,079
Can we talk?

366
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,000
What exactly did you say to my dad?

367
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,680
What are you all hiding from me?

368
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:55,880
Why did Gao Feng say you were in danger?

369
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:00,880
Tell me.

370
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,460
You are not saying anything, are you?

371
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:11,720
Fine.

372
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,319
None of you are telling me the truth.

373
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,759
Things between Wu and me
have already become like this.

374
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:23,519
We cannot even speak honestly anymore.

375
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,000
Dawg.

376
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,680
Are we going to end up like that too?

377
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,039
Honey.

378
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,000
Can you trust me one more time?

379
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,960
I swear I will protect you.

380
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:55,519
Protect our child.

381
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,200
And this family of ours.

382
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,480
You will understand eventually.

383
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,880
For a man, the most important thing
is knowing how to weigh his choices.

384
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,119
Your father weighed his options too.

385
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,039
That is why
he gave you a solid background,

386
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,119
a stable family,

387
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:29,279
and a good education.

388
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,920
That letter was nothing
more than a dying man

389
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:36,759
trying to leave behind
a better image of himself,

390
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:40,160
a final comfort left for his child.

391
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,039
The day your father passed away,

392
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,359
you locked yourself in the bathroom
and would not come out.

393
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,119
No one could talk you into it.

394
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,519
It was Feifei who knocked on the door
and pulled you out.

395
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,200
So many years have passed,

396
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,480
yet I still remember that afternoon.

397
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,960
The sunlight was warm,

398
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,000
falling softly on both of you.

399
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:06,680
You held Feifei and cried.

400
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,319
Some things in life

401
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,920
are simply fate.

402
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,640
Yang, your life

403
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,359
has long been standing on Feifei's side.

404
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,100
(Recording deleted)

405
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:50,160
Dad.

406
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:52,720
Did the group,

407
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,500
at any point in the past,
really deal in drugs?

408
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:58,440
I heard the police are investigating.

409
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,119
How could that be?

410
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,319
If that were true,

411
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:04,690
would I have been released
from the Public Security Bureau?

412
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,599
Yang,

413
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:15,119
you know your father very well.

414
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,920
Something as serious as drugs,

415
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,559
do you really think he would do that?

416
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:25,960
No.

417
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,640
As for the drug rumors,

418
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,119
they are unsubstantiated.

419
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:40,599
The police will continue investigating,

420
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,799
but the matter

421
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:44,200
has already spread
among the shareholders.

422
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,400
I will go to the group today.

423
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,640
Dad, I will handle it.

424
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,880
Even though I have handed
the group over to you,

425
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,400
this matter is different.

426
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,200
I should go.

427
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,079
- Dad, I...
- Feifei.

428
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,400
Listen to Dad.

429
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,720
Let's eat.

430
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,279
For the next few days,
neither of you should go out.

431
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,279
No one knows how far this will spread.

432
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,000
The media and our rivals
both need watching.

433
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,720
Whatever you need to eat or use,

434
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,519
Mr. Cao will arrange everything.

435
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,390
He will take care of it for you.

436
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,920
For safety reasons,

437
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,920
do not use your phones for now.

438
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,690
If anything comes up, talk in person.

439
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,480
Dad.

440
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:58,279
I should go with you.

441
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:00,640
Why?

442
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,200
Zhiyang told me

443
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,920
what you talked about last night.

444
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,160
He said he would do exactly as you said.

445
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,400
What did you actually say to him?

446
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:13,990
If you do not want to tell me,
I will not press.

447
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,480
But we are family.

448
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,640
Let us not turn on each other.

449
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,680
We should pull together first,

450
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,640
and get through this rough stretch.

451
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:25,839
You have a point.

452
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:27,400
Go change.

453
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,880
I will wait in the car.

454
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,820
(Xu Zhiyang, why are you not answering?)

455
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:50,380
(Come meet me.)

456
00:32:53,799 --> 00:33:00,839
Hello. The number
you have dialed is powered off.

457
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,880
These past few days,
while flipping through a dictionary,

458
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,890
I came across a character

459
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,559
that I think would be perfect

460
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,559
as our child's name.

461
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:19,720
Jun.

462
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:22,400
The Jun from towering mountains.

463
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,920
I hope our child

464
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:27,240
can be like a mountain peak,

465
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,400
strong and steady,

466
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:31,240
unafraid no matter what happens.

467
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,759
Are you not worried that will spoil him,

468
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:35,720
making him reckless?

469
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:37,880
Is it better to always hesitate?

470
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:43,119
I just hope we do not place
too many expectations on our child,

471
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,079
especially if it is a boy.

472
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,240
I hope that whatever path
he wants to take,

473
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,880
he can choose it himself.

474
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:56,240
If it is a boy, Jun.

475
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,200
What about a girl?

476
00:33:58,319 --> 00:33:59,799
A girl can be called Jun too.

477
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:03,920
A girl

478
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,960
needs to be strong even more.

479
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:16,639
The shareholders have all arrived.

480
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:19,800
Let us go.

481
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,679
Dad, have you ever been afraid?

482
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,800
I am not afraid of heights.

483
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,440
From the attic fire,

484
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,199
to denying my mother
in the forensic room,

485
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:36,639
and later helping the group

486
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,840
get through all this turmoil safely,

487
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:42,990
always putting the bigger picture first,
always making things look right,

488
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:47,119
Dad, I am becoming
more and more like you.

489
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,880
But I feel more and more uneasy inside.

490
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,119
Because I suddenly realized

491
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,000
that not everything

492
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,119
can end exactly the way you planned.

493
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,079
Everyone has their own trial to face.

494
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:10,840
Everyone has their own fate.

495
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,400
In this world, whether good or bad,

496
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:18,159
everyone must choose
between right and wrong.

497
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,360
Dad.

498
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:28,559
I hope you are a good man.

499
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,639
Let us go. The meeting is starting.

500
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:59,199
Hello. The number
you have dialed is powered off.

501
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:08,060
(Bestie)

502
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:14,199
Hello. The number
you have dialed is powered off.

503
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,310
Let us stop ahead and buy some flowers.

504
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,880
I want to visit my dad at the cemetery.

505
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:30,880
One last time.

506
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,800
After that, I will go back to the Wu family
and be a dutiful son.

507
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:50,800
Rest here.

508
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:51,990
I will buy the flowers for you.

509
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,890
I will visit my dad
but you go buy the flowers?

510
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,320
Call Mr. Wu for me.

511
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,039
Give me the letter.

512
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:35,440
Call Wu Guohao.

513
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,280
Give me the letter.

514
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,400
Call Wu Guohao!

515
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,159
Wu Guohao.

516
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,880
Did you not want to test my loyalty?

517
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,559
Did you not want Feifei and me
to obey you forever,

518
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:54,599
to submit for good?

519
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,770
You are afraid now, are you not?

520
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,239
You are afraid we will join forces
and push back,

521
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:01,480
because you know Feifei and Gao Feng

522
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:04,679
will uncover the filth you have hidden
for thirty years.

523
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,639
You are afraid
we will stand against you,

524
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:08,520
because you also know
that justice will prevail.

525
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,199
Go home.

526
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,320
Did you hear me?

527
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:17,159
I am telling you this one last time.

528
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:19,760
Go home.

529
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:23,039
I will pretend
none of this happened today.

530
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:25,920
My dad said you were a satan.

531
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:27,920
But today I want to tell him

532
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,119
that once I stand
close enough to the satan,

533
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,280
I am no longer afraid of anything.

534
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:35,239
Every step leaves a trace.

535
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:37,519
Dragging me back will not help you.

536
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:39,360
As long as we are here,

537
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,119
every crime you committed, one by one,

538
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:43,599
can never stay buried forever.

539
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,679
Gao Feng, based on the location signal,

540
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,840
Xu Zhiyang is very close to you.

541
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:56,519
We are moving in on your position.

542
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,360
Gao Feng, do not do anything rash.

543
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:03,239
The letter.

544
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,679
Get down.

545
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:22,519
Get down now.

546
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:23,800
Move. After him.

547
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:26,440
Go. Go.

548
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,679
This way.

549
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:34,660
♪Cobwebs are woven into a net♪

550
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:37,340
♪Each strand is a lead♪

551
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:43,000
♪Fate hangs above your head
like a suspended blade♪

552
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,679
Stay on him.

553
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,400

Xu Zhiyang!

568
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,639
Before the incident,

569
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,400
your son-in-law
appeared to be restrained.

570
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,000
Our assessment is

571
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:52,480
that the accident happened
while he was trying to seek help.

572
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,000
Mr. Wu,

573
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,280
the night before it happened,

574
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,320
when I went to your home,

575
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,679
Xu Zhiyang
was already behaving unusually.

576
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,719
What do you want me to do?

577
00:41:01,719 --> 00:41:02,519
What could I possibly do?

578
00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:04,880
- What are you afraid of?
- Why? Why are you pushing me?

579
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,320
Why are you pushing me?

580
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,000
Why?

581
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,920
Before we arrived,
only you and him were there.

582
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,039
Something happened to Yang.

583
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,519
This is on me.

584
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,480
These documents

585
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,960
were found
among his father's belongings.

586
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,480
There is also
Xu Peng's written confession.

587
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,800
As for Xu dealing drugs,

588
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:39,199
Yang knew about it.

589
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:42,320
How could Xu do something like this,

590
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,559
something as serious
as drug trafficking?

591
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,599
How were the children supposed
to face it once they knew?

592
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:52,119
That Gao Feng kept pressing Yang

593
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:53,920
to hand these things over.

594
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,760
Yang is a good kid.

595
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,159
He kept weighing
whether to turn them in or not.

596
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:00,360
He was torn.

597
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,599
He asked me what I thought.

598
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,400
I told him not to hand them in.

599
00:42:05,719 --> 00:42:07,400
Those were matters of the past.

600
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:11,400
But Yang could not let it go.

601
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,239
I was worried
something would happen to him.

602
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:17,079
So I had Chen Kang
stay with him at all times.

603
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,039
In the end, something still happened.

604
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,920
As for Xu dealing drugs,

605
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,320
I only found out recently.

606
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,440
I knew but did not report it.

607
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,239
I am guilty.

608
00:42:31,159 --> 00:42:32,559
You can arrest me.

609
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:34,440
Mr. Wu,

610
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:35,760
at this point,

611
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:37,599
everything will be made clear.

612
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,039
It is only a matter of time.

613
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,400
We will not wrong the innocent,

614
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,960
and we will never let

615
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:45,079
a guilty person go.

616
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:47,199
Every detail must
be thoroughly investigated,

617
00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:49,360
until the truth is fully uncovered.

618
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,519
But I still have one request.

619
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,360
Please do not disturb Feifei anymore.

620
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,840
She is pregnant,

621
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,480
and she is under
immense mental stress right now.

622
00:43:01,559 --> 00:43:02,199
Alright?

623
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:04,480
If there is anything,
come to me or my lawyer.

624
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:06,119
Please do not involve her again.
