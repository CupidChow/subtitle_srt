2
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:56,400
(People's Public Security)
The 1009 Penglai Plaza Case

3
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,920
has entered a new phase.

4
00:01:57,933 --> 00:01:59,920
The investigation
has two main lines of inquiry.

5
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,870
First, Wang Dan,
who drove the car into the statue,

6
00:02:02,911 --> 00:02:04,688
was very likely instigated
by another person.

7
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,470
The statements of
Xu Zhiyang, Wu Feifei, and Wu Guohao

8
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,360
are inconsistent.

9
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,750
They'll be questioned on suspicion
of obstructing official duties.

10
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,750
The remains were identified as the
mother of a local resident, Gao Feng.

11
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,520
It's worth noting

12
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,400
that Gao Feng's
adoptive father, Gao Dahua,

13
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,310
died by suicide
on the day of the incident.

14
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,520
(The person who prompted
Gao Dahua's suicide)

15
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,240
(is connected to
the first line of inquiry.)

16
00:02:26,244 --> 00:02:27,111
(We suspect)

17
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:29,630
(that someone deliberately merged
these two lines of inquiry.)

18
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,149
(Case Briefing)
The motive remains unclear.

19
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,080
(Adoptive father, Gao Dahua (suicide))
The key individual is Gao Feng.

20
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,750
She said something strange to me.

21
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:37,590
After the old man's death,
the person who follows me

22
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,430
is her.

23
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,030
She's the same person

24
00:02:40,066 --> 00:02:42,488
who deliberately led him
to the Penglai Plaza incident site.

25
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,870
Based on statements
from Zhang Jing and Gao Feng,

26
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:47,222
as well as surveillance footage
from Wang Dan's hospital,

27
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,680
we've made a preliminary determination
that the person who approached Wang Dan,

28
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,960
(Scammed Gao Dahua)
the scammer who targeted Gao Dahua,

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,822
and the person who provided leads
to Gao Feng

30
00:02:53,822 --> 00:02:54,750
are all the same woman.

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,680
She

32
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,030
once stayed at a guesthouse
in West City

33
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,310
using a forged ID.

34
00:02:59,355 --> 00:03:01,360
The guesthouse owner referred to her
as Madam He.

35
00:03:01,511 --> 00:03:03,822
On the day we confirmed that
the remains inside the statue

36
00:03:03,822 --> 00:03:05,470
belonged to Gao Feng's
biological mother,

37
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,933
she checked out of the guesthouse.

38
00:03:06,955 --> 00:03:08,030
She's currently missing.

39
00:03:08,444 --> 00:03:11,460
Surveillance footage from the ferry
terminal, bus stations, and the airport

40
00:03:11,466 --> 00:03:13,120
shows that she did not leave Binchuan.

41
00:03:13,222 --> 00:03:16,200
Besides, further review of surveillance
footage from Wang Dan's hospital

42
00:03:16,222 --> 00:03:18,560
(Road Surveillance Camera)
and surrounding hotels indicates

43
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,360
that a young woman frequently appeared
together with Madam He.

44
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,066
(Passage)
Plus, Zhang Jing also mentioned

45
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:25,711
that someone else was staying
with Madam He at the small hotel.

46
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,840
We believe

47
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,360
that this young woman
is Madam He's accomplice.

48
00:03:31,066 --> 00:03:33,500
It'd be ideal to find the person
who put Wang Dan up to this

49
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,080
and settle it privately ahead of time.

50
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,590
Not just that,

51
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,360
we need to figure out what she's after.

52
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:41,590
Understood.

53
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,240
I'll draft a plan.

54
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,240
If it's a relative or family member,

55
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:48,430
we'll focus on calming things down
and minimizing social impact.

56
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,590
If it's a business rival,

57
00:03:50,822 --> 00:03:52,360
we prepare for a commercial fight.

58
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:56,120
Feifei, if you hear anything,
get in touch immediately.

59
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,800
Be careful with communication tools.

60
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,590
If possible, talk face-to-face.

61
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,030
Use personal connections
as little as possible.

62
00:04:02,066 --> 00:04:04,022
The fewer people who know, the better.

63
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,510
Gao Feng.

64
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,120
You didn't sleep again?

65
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,190
Scared, aren't you?

66
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,040
My mom's been dead for years.

67
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,430
She's been buried under the statue.

68
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,310
For over twenty years.

69
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,240
Just now, your other mom came to see me.

70
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,480
Give me a shot.

71
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,560
Tim, get Madam a glass of juice.

72
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:03,480
Alright.

73
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,480
No need for the trouble.

74
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,680
It tastes the same.

75
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,360
Not worth that much money.

76
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,390
I'm not someone who drinks juice.

77
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,800
Gao Feng hasn't come into work yet.

78
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,070
If you have something to say,

79
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,630
you can talk to him yourself.

80
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,020
(Dog's Nose)

81
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,830
I came to see you.

82
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,720
Madam Zhang.

83
00:06:23,644 --> 00:06:25,133
About what happened to Gao Feng,

84
00:06:26,466 --> 00:06:27,750
I can't talk him out of it.

85
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:30,920
Honestly,

86
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,360
after all this turmoil these past days,

87
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,920
I actually think he feels
more like a real person now.

88
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,310
I don't really care

89
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:44,720
whether his case will be fully cleared
in the end.

90
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,040
But when someone's young,

91
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,920
if they can devote themselves
to one thing

92
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,510
and fight for it,

93
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,120
even being crushed repeatedly,
it's not a wasted life.

94
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,310
Girl,

95
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,310
if Gao Feng can't settle down,

96
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,040
don't wait for him.

97
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,390
There's nothing I can do to stop him.

98
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,800
You're a fine young lady.

99
00:07:19,088 --> 00:07:20,240
Don't let this hold you back.

100
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,190
Some things only hurt more
when you force them.

101
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,430
Thanks to you,

102
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,040
I have to fight

103
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,920
against the law of attraction
every single day.

104
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,720
You

105
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,630
and everything around you

106
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,430
are something else, really.

107
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:41,630
You have to overcome your own hurdle.

108
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,000
Sirs,

109
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,800
the case is getting more closely tied
to the Gao family.

110
00:07:50,111 --> 00:07:51,360
I think I should step aside.

111
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,160
The lead on Wang Dan

112
00:07:54,177 --> 00:07:56,040
and all information
related to the Wu family,

113
00:07:56,044 --> 00:07:57,377
I'll hand over to He Xiaoyang.

114
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,160
As for Zhang Jing and Gao Feng,

115
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,270
Zhao will follow up.

116
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,480
On the technical investigation side,

117
00:08:02,688 --> 00:08:04,390
Jiaqi and Jiang are stronger than I am.

118
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,310
Asking for approval
after everything's arranged?

119
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,040
No.

120
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,510
Give me a reason.

121
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,310
(Brave in spirit, elegant at heart)

122
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,270
Gao Dahua and I...

123
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,720
This is an objective reason.

124
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,560
Objectively speaking,
you're not related by blood.

125
00:08:16,066 --> 00:08:17,933
So there's no need to recuse yourself.

126
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,800
But if it's a subjective reason,

127
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,040
give me your reason.

128
00:08:23,533 --> 00:08:25,666
It's because of my relationship
with the Gao family.

129
00:08:25,866 --> 00:08:27,400
I'm worried it'll affect my judgment.

130
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,510
If I were you,

131
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,430
I'd make good use of that connection,

132
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,120
not back away from it.

133
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,150
Gao Feng is a key figure.

134
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,000
Our first priority is to keep him safe.

135
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:37,790
Besides,

136
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:41,270
if we need him to cooperate
with the investigation,

137
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,720
who should talk to him

138
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,480
and how?

139
00:08:44,244 --> 00:08:46,120
Is there really anyone
more suitable than you?

140
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:55,670
Are you afraid your personal feelings
for Gao Dahua

141
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,390
could compromise your objectivity?

142
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,720
As policemen,

143
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,000
we're bound to face things
that stir our emotions.

144
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,910
Carrying out our duties calmly

145
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,600
is the best and only way.

146
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,440
This case is also
part of your own trial.

147
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:21,620
(Kind Father Gao Dahua)

148
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,320
Godfather,

149
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,510
take care of yourself over there.

150
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,550
Go easy on the salt.

151
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,150
If you're bored,
you can chat with my parents.

152
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,670
Once I wrap things up,

153
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,670
I'll come and drink with you.

154
00:09:45,733 --> 00:09:46,888
Since you're already here,

155
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,030
don't hide anymore.

156
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:50,790
Come out.

157
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,910
These are the contact details
of all employees

158
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,480
from the period
when the incident happened.

159
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,320
This is the list
of the construction workers.

160
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,670
Back then,

161
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:09,720
I also reached out to some in public
security and the medical system.

162
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:10,870
They said

163
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,600
that after the incident,
a lot of people were contacted.

164
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,600
But the ones who knew
there was a body inside the statue

165
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,910
are probably just these people.

166
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,000
Some of these connections

167
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,720
were the ones I smoothed over.

168
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,133
I thought I'd cleaned everything up.

169
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,630
Never thought

170
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,870
something would slip through.

171
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,480
Your dad was a mid-level officer
at the subdistrict office.

172
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,870
He only went to work with Mr. Xu
after he resigned.

173
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,750
In those days, doing business
mostly depended on connections.

174
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,720
Don't make it sound so mysterious.

175
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,390
Back then, if you were in business,

176
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,840
people who'd worked in government

177
00:10:52,888 --> 00:10:54,149
understood the rules better.

178
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:57,090
They knew how to get things done better
than figuring it out from scratch.

179
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,000
That was normal.

180
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,720
Say,

181
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,840
Lawyer Cao hasn't been with the company
for long.

182
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,390
Explain it to him.

183
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,200
Tell him not to
settle everything privately.

184
00:11:08,222 --> 00:11:09,630
We should do things the right way.

185
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,200
Follow proper procedures.

186
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,240
We're not the mob.

187
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,600
Understood.

188
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,550
Feifei.

189
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:23,000
Leave the older generation's mess to us.

190
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,440
You go abroad and take a break.

191
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:28,670
No.

192
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,240
If someone here has a problem,

193
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:34,870
that's your responsibility.

194
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,270
Figuring out who knows Wang Dan

195
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,270
and who has ties to her,

196
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,240
that's my responsibility.

197
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,750
Dad,

198
00:11:47,155 --> 00:11:48,670
that day Su Min asked me something.

199
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,080
She said,

200
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,870
"Besides the person in the photo,

201
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,790
Miss Wu, have you encountered

202
00:11:54,266 --> 00:11:56,444
any other suspicious people
or incidents lately?"

203
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,200
Don't you find that strange?

204
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,440
I think

205
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,240
there's more than one person involved.

206
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,550
And someone might be right next to me.

207
00:12:20,133 --> 00:12:22,733
You stood up for your mom
at the police station that day.

208
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,360
That was pretty manly.

209
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,150
Do you all think I'm being dramatic?

210
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,200
I want to pretend nothing ever happened.

211
00:12:32,422 --> 00:12:33,960
I want my family to live peacefully.

212
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,630
But I just can't.

213
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,480
Ever since I can remember,

214
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,080
it's like I've been wound up tight.

215
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,960
If I don't figure out who I am

216
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,120
and what happened in the past,

217
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,440
I can't stop.

218
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,670
That's my fate.

219
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,440
This number was found
on the old man's phone.

220
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,390
That woman's phone
has been off the whole time.

221
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,600
Stop calling.

222
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,910
We're monitoring that number.

223
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,960
She came well-prepared.

224
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,320
She won't be easy to track down.

225
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,840
There's always a way.

226
00:13:14,511 --> 00:13:16,200
Gao Feng, I'll say this one more time.

227
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,720
Don't do anything reckless.

228
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,750
You're a key figure in this case now.

229
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,320
I've been ordered

230
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,440
to protect you.

231
00:13:23,711 --> 00:13:25,360
If anything happens on your end,

232
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,750
report it to us immediately.

233
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,000
This is a society of laws.

234
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,422
No matter how deep criminals hide,

235
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,150
they'll be dug out sooner or later.

236
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,870
Actually,

237
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,840
I warned Mr. Gao long ago

238
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,240
that the woman might be a scammer.

239
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,270
But he was completely taken in.

240
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,440
He wouldn't listen to me.

241
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,720
Now that he's gone,

242
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,510
I'm frustrated as well.

243
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,240
I feel the same as you do.

244
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,390
I have to get to the bottom of this.

(Interrogation Room)

246
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,870
Relax. It's not poisoned.

247
00:14:07,133 --> 00:14:09,688
You were still young
when your father passed away, right?

248
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,910
Fourteen or fifteen?

249
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,577
What kind of business
was he involved in?

250
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,840
Did he fall out with anyone?

251
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,580
My dad rarely talked to me
about business.

252
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:17,630
I don't know anything.

00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,910
(any other suspicious people
or incidents lately?")

257
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,670
And someone might be right next to me.

258
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,080
Wu Feifei, we've known each other
for over ten years.

259
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:45,670
Are you suspecting me

260
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:47,550
of sending Wang Dan to ram the statue?

261
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:51,000
(Why aren't you suspecting
Amy or Jingjing?)

262

265
00:15:34,358 --> 00:15:35,150
I'm fine.

266
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,030
Come in.

267
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,510
Boss,

268
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:49,030
we pulled some strings

269
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,390
and got the forensics result.

270
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,080
The person inside the statue
had a child.

271
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,200
A son.

272
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,030
He's in Binchuan.

274
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,000
You knew everything,

275
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,111
and you kept it from me
till the day you died.

276
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:16,670
But a child looking for his mother
is only right.

277
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,840
I can't stop him anymore.

278
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,750
If you can see him from up there,

279
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:27,480
watch over him.
Don't let him get into trouble.

280
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,270
Nothing can happen to him.

Go back and get some rest.

Don't blow up my kitchen again.

288
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,440
No need. I'll grab a coffee later.

289
00:17:10,111 --> 00:17:11,270
We found something, Sir.

I remember now.

A few days ago, when I visited Mr. Gao,

297

298
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:26,480
there was someone besides Madam He

who had been leading him on.

She also works at a café.

What else do you know?

307
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,350
Stop the car.

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,790

She ran?

315
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:38,720
She's just a girl.

You can't even handle this.

318
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,030
What can you do?

319
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:49,510

- No, Sir.

we're looking for.

Feifei,

332
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,110
tell me the name.

333
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,830
I'll have someone check.

334
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,200
What's wrong?

335
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,440
I don't know his name.

336
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,000
I don't know anything about him.
I'm sorry.

337
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,960
I thought he was just a normal friend.

338
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,440
He... He couldn't be

339
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,640
connected to this.

340
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,440
Did you tell him about Wang Dan?

341
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,880
No. We agreed

342
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,755
that we wouldn't ask anything
we shouldn't.

343
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:49,440

00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,830
Enough, Feifei.

348
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,030
pick one.

350
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,440
Let me try on my own.

00:20:04,888 --> 00:20:06,200
Leave as soon as possible.

00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,640
This is my mess...

356
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:20,830
Just let me handle it!

357

Feifei,

358
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:24,310
calm down.

359
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:33,400
You and your daughter are doing this
for each other.

360
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,590
Don't ruin your relationship over it.

361
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:40,510
I saw her photo at the police station.

364
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,440
our nightmare is back.

365
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:55,750
It's back.

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,640
I'm using some old contacts
to look into it.

367
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,480
Lawyer Cao warned us before.

368
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,830
We should keep a low profile.

369
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:07,880
That's why progress has been slow.

370
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,240
Feifei is a lead, one way or another.

371
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,680
Why not take a chance?

372
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,880
It's too dangerous.

373
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,350
Risk is like a wave.
Run from it, and it'll crash you.

374
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,200
But face it head-on,

375
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,350
and things might turn around.

376
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,310
That's what you taught me back then.

377
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,240
The trouble's already there.

378
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,240
We can't dodge it.

379
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,030
Feifei really takes after you.

380
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,310
If you don't let her try,

381
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,160
she'll never be at peace with it.

382
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,790
Feeling better now?

383
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,440
Not shouting at me now?

384
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:11,880
Dad, I...

385
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,680
You should thank Mr. Ming.

386
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,880
He spoke up for you.

387
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,680
But let me be clear.

388
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,750
This is the only time.

389
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,160
If it doesn't work out,
leave immediately.

390
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,400
Alright, Dad.

391
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,200
Tell us your plan.

392
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,550
The strangest thing about this person is

393
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,550
that ever since the incident,
he's been keeping out of sight.

394
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,350
We need to draw him out first

395
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,240
and figure out his intention.

396
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,440
Only then can we decide
how to deal with him.

397
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,270
Mr. Wu.

398
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:42,640
Feifei.

399
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:43,590
Lawyer Cao.

400
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,240
Mr. Ming.

401
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,000
When we tried to track him down,
the police caught on.

402
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,480
They put you two under surveillance

403
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,550
on suspicion of giving false testimony.

404
00:22:52,866 --> 00:22:54,590
The police are stationed outside
right now.

405
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,030
Boss, there are three cars outside.

406
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,480
Su Min is in charge.

407
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,160
Mr. Ming, buy two dragon fruits for me.

408
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,880
Lawyer Cao, I need a backup phone.

409
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,830
Feifei, as for communication tools...

410
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:15,960
Do exactly as she said.

411
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,440
Let her try.

412
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,270
The number you have dialed
is powered off.

413
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,070
Please try again later.

414
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,200
No matter where you are,

415
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,590
I'll find you.

416
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,909
(Bestie: I know
what you're trying to do.)

417
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:36,666
(Let's meet tonight at nine.)

418
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:53,580
(Unknown number: Do you want to know
what happened at Penglai Plaza?)

419
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,750
What's wrong?

420
00:24:05,155 --> 00:24:06,688
She's allergic to dragon fruit.

421
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,160
We're usually very careful.

422
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,920
We've been too busy and overlooked it.

423
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,510
Officer Su,

424
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:16,310
why don't you come with us?

425
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,110
Alright. We'll lead the way.

426
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,270
Thank you so much.

427
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:38,220
(Emergency Medicine Department)

428
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,940
(Jiren Hospital)

429
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,240
You'll leave through
the rear safety passage later.

430
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,030
Thank you, Dr. Lu.

431
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,160
Send my regards to your father.

432
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,750
Hello.

433
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,640
How can I help you?

434
00:25:28,355 --> 00:25:29,800
Let me take a look at the patient.

435
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:40,020
(Where are you?)

436
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:44,420
(Bestie: I'm here.)

437
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:59,900
(I'm inside. I don't see you.)

438
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:03,260
(Bestie: Back door.)

439
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,240
They've arrived.

440
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,030
Yeah.

441
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,480
Yes, right here.

442
00:26:23,511 --> 00:26:24,822
- Let's go.
- Why are you so late?

443
00:26:24,844 --> 00:26:25,577
I've been waiting.

444
00:26:25,577 --> 00:26:26,030
Let's go.

445
00:26:26,066 --> 00:26:26,990
The traffic is terrible.

446
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,400
Don't get anxious.

447
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,480
It's packed tonight.

448
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,400
I've been waiting for you!
What took you so long?

449
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,310
Alright.

450
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,310
Let's go.

451
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,000
You know what?

452
00:26:34,688 --> 00:26:36,422
We're going to drink
to our fill tonight.

453
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:51,590
Hello?

454
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,260
(Bestie)

455
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,030
Bestie?

456
00:27:04,533 --> 00:27:05,550
I'm just as surprised

457
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:06,680
as you are.

458
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,350
This phone belongs to another person
connected to the case.

459
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,200
He claims he received messages

460
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,310
that are crucial to the investigation.

461
00:27:14,688 --> 00:27:15,960
What's your relationship

462
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,640
with the bestie you mentioned?

463
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,310
Wu Feifei,

464
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,110
stop hiding things from us.

465
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:27,350
Why do you call him your bestie?

466
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,200
We met drinking.

467
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,088
Are you two close?

468
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,750
We got along pretty well,
so we became friends.

469
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,590
You met here?

470
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,160
Take a look. Is this the bestie
you've been looking for?

471
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:17,220
(Flashback)

472
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,350
Boss, I've settled the bill.

473
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:21,400
Alright.

474
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,790
Sorry. Sorry.

475
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,720
Excuse me.

476
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:33,880
Sit for a bit. Come on.

477
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,622
Let's make friends.

478
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,030
It's fine.

479
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:38,920
Go away!

480
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,830
Sit.

481
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,110

00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:38,580
(Wu Feifei)

552
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,380
(Bestie)

553
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:58,240
The bestie is Gao Feng, right?

554
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:58,711
(Unlocking)

555
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,920
Why aren't you answering his call?

556
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,200
I don't really know

557
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,110
how to talk to him right now.

558
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,150
But the police said

559
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:13,760
Wang Dan had nothing to do with him.

560
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,070
I was overthinking it.

561
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,510
It was the woman in the wheelchair

562
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:20,110
who told Wang Dan to ram the statue.

563
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,590
But the body inside the statue,

564
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,670
her son, is my bestie.

565
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,960
Dad, do you think
all of this is a coincidence?

566
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,880
Do you know anything else?

567
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,670
I... I know a little.

568
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:41,070
I didn't tell you before

569
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:42,911
because I didn't want you
to worry too much.

570
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,920
Gao Feng's mother

571
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:48,880
wasn't a construction worker's
family member.

572
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,920
She was a singer-dancer
at the International Club.

573
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,440
Then why did she...

574
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,920
She probably offended someone
she shouldn't have.

575
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,510
Mr. Xu?

576
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,760
Don't ask anymore.

577
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,190
I don't know the details either.

578
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,800
Then who is the woman in the wheelchair?

579
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,630
Who is she? What does she want?

580
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,360
I don't know.

581
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,800
Dad, can we leave together?

582
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:18,400
Feifei,

583
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,110
don't be afraid.

584
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:23,510
When Mr. Xu and I
first started our business,

585
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,840
it was like clearing wasteland.

586
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,760
No matter how hard the rock was,

587
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,577
we had to dig it out
with our bare hands.

588
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,550
Once, a worker had an accident.

589
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,440
The family came to make trouble.

590
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:36,510
I knelt in front of the memorial,

591
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:39,230
and let them curse me, point at me.

592
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:43,360
I didn't eat or drink
for seventy-two hours straight.

593
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,110
Things are different now.

594
00:35:48,244 --> 00:35:49,288
You should go overseas.

595
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,230
Lawyer Cao registered a company
in Hong Kong, China,

596
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,670
two years ago.

597
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,440
You're the executive director.

598
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:01,960
Aren't there plenty of
unresolved issues waiting?

599
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,030
This is the right time
to deal with them.

600
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,280
I'm not asking you to run away.

601
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,670
But these old problems

602
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,030
are mine

603
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,110
to face.

604
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,320
The company's future
will bring new challenges.

605
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:23,480
You'll handle them
in your own younger way.

606
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,400
You'll take the lead.

607
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,440
Feifei.

608
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,510
All your mom

609
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,800
and I want

610
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,840
is for you to grow up safely

611
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,710
and live a safe life.

612
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,320
Do you understand?

613
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,110
I do.

614
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:01,840
These are the club's
materials and documents.

615
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:05,480
I didn't know much about

616
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,066
how the International Club was run.

617
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,840
People called me a vice president.

618
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,550
But actually, I was working for Mr. Xu.

619
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,480
I handled external communications.

620
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,480
The overall management

621
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,030
was under Mr. Xu's control.

622
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,800
Why didn't you mention this earlier?

623
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:22,400
Mention what?

624
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,888
The first time we asked you

625
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,590
about the Penglai Plaza car crash

626
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:29,955
involving Wang Dan and Xu Zhiyang.

627
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:32,000
Why didn't you bring up
the International Club?

628
00:37:32,111 --> 00:37:33,230
The International Club

629
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:36,190
is a side business of our group.

630
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,840
A subsidiary.

631
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,070
You asked about Mr. Xu this time,

632
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,230
so I mentioned it then.

633
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:44,670
As a vice president,

634
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:47,230
not knowing anything
about the club's operation

635
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:49,000
doesn't make much sense, does it?

636
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,070
You're new here?

637
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,710
Captain Meng,
you should brief your new colleague

638
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:57,480
on how things work in Binchuan.

639
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,880
I know Mr. Wu's background.

640
00:37:59,155 --> 00:38:00,177
He used to be a director

641
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,280
at the Supply and Marketing Cooperative
in the International Club district.

642
00:38:03,288 --> 00:38:04,288
I was a deputy director.

643
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:06,630
Deputy directors usually
handled the real work.

644
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,510
But a deputy is still a deputy.

645
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:10,333
There was no room for advancement.

646
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:12,510
The director had backing.

647
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:13,840
So you resigned.

648
00:38:14,066 --> 00:38:15,755
Business conditions were good back then,

649
00:38:15,755 --> 00:38:17,760
and you stayed on working
under Xu Peng ever since.

650
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,760
I'm grateful that Mr. Xu took me in.

651
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:22,280
I left the civil service

652
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,000
and still had some connections.

653
00:38:25,311 --> 00:38:27,466
I worked my way up step by step
to where I am today.

654
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:29,070
It wasn't easy.

655
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:32,800
Thankfully, Mr. Xu valued me

656
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,070
and gave me
a department manager position.

657
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:39,190
To be honest, my main job was

658
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:41,190
socializing, eating, drinking,

659
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:43,880
and maintaining relationships.

660
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,230
As for the core business,

661
00:38:45,622 --> 00:38:47,044
if Mr. Xu didn't bring them up,

662
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:48,960
I wouldn't dare ask.

663
00:38:49,333 --> 00:38:50,600
You're being modest, Mr. Wu.

664
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,110
The once cooperative director

665
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:54,070
is now overseeing the entire group.

666
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,150
Mr. Xu trusted me.

667
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:57,800
He even let you raise his son.

668
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:00,360
That kind of trust is rare these days,

669
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:00,920
Mr. Wu.

670
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:03,800
Mr. Xu has done me many favors.

671
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,800
But most importantly,

672
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:07,150
without him,

673
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,550
I wouldn't have met my wife.

674
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,960
She used to be a manager
at the International Club as well.

675
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:17,550
When it comes to making money,

676
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,377
she was more driven than I was.

677
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,800
I agree that making money

678
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,800
matters.

679
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:26,000
But what I value more is our family.

680
00:39:28,201 --> 00:39:29,551
As matters stand,

681
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,710
if Mr. Xu has problems,

682
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:34,550
I can't stay clear of them.

683
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,000
If he doesn't,

684
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,510
am I free to go now?

685
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,070
Please sit, Mr. Wu.

686
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:43,320
Let me finish first.

687
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,070
I'll make my stand here.

688
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:51,030
Business comes second.

689
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,440
Running a company these days

690
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,510
is extremely difficult.

691
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:57,920
As long as the group
keeps moving forward,

692
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,230
I'm satisfied.

693
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,400
I also have a suggestion for you two.

694
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,150
There's no need to spend so much
police manpower.

695
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,550
It makes it inconvenient for my daughter
to go out and buy medicine.

696
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:10,320
Also,

697
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,550
my son-in-law, Xu Zhiyang.

698
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:15,550
His issue with that woman

699
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:18,150
is nothing more
than a relationship dispute.

700
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:20,960
I want to apply for bail,

701
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:23,760
so my family can reunite.

702
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,320
Procedurally,

703
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:29,360
I hope you can cut me some slack.

704
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:33,510
Su Min,

705
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,440
stay and have a meal with us later.

706
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:38,960
Go Feng should be back soon.

707
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,510
Have some tea first.

708
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:41,510
I'll go cook.

709
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:43,822
Madam Zhang, don't trouble yourself.
We can't stay long.

710
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,110
I just wanted to talk with you.

711
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,840
Young lady, find a seat.

712
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,800
Thank you, Madam Zhang.

713
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,150
How's your leg recovering?

714
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:52,920
Does it still hurt?

715
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:54,510
Much better.

716
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:57,400
It wasn't a serious injury.

717
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:59,190
Still, injuries take time to heal.

718
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:00,630
Be careful

719
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:01,590
not to catch a cold.

720
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,920
Su Min, you came for something specific,
didn't you?

721
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,510
Well, I wanted to ask about something.

722
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,960
Before Mr. Gao ran the food stall,

723
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:17,480
did he work anywhere else?

724
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,400
Quite a few places.

725
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:25,630
Most of the well-known restaurants
in the city.

726
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,880
He worked at many of them
for a while.

727
00:41:27,911 --> 00:41:29,110
Do you remember which ones?

728
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,230
I don't

729
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,760
really remember.

730
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,960
Many of those restaurants

731
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,110
either shut down or changed names.

732
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:38,320
The International Club.

733
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,670
Does that ring a bell?

734
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:47,320
Well.

735
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:49,590
About the Penglai Plaza car crash,

736
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,960
all the leads now point
to the International Club.

737
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,400
We found

738
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,150
part of the club's employee
contact list.

739
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,710
Mr. Gao's name

740
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:00,960
is on it.

741
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:04,670
According to the records,
he started working there

742
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:06,000
in 1991.

743
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,000
We believe

744
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:13,360
Mr. Gao and Gao Feng's biological mother

745
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:16,030
were very likely working there
during the same period.

746
00:42:16,488 --> 00:42:17,590
Did you know about this?

747
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:21,320
Of course.

748
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:22,670
That was back in the 1990s.

749
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:24,280
The club had a lot of employees then.

750
00:42:24,377 --> 00:42:26,177
They may not all have known each other.

751
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,110
But the case is very complicated.

752
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:31,320
I want to know,

753
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,880

Gao Feng's biological mother before?
