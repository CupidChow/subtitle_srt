I asked you to keep Uncle Zhao
company and talk to him.

17
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,750
I am getting the red seal ready.

18
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,520
Certified Public Accountant Wu,

19
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,710
what are you looking for?

20
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,710
Are you looking for this?

21
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,910
The CPA exam.

22
00:02:45,177 --> 00:02:46,590
Six subjects passed in one year.

23
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,080
That's impressive.

24
00:02:48,222 --> 00:02:50,000
Not many in the nation
can do that.

25
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,840
You're amazing.

26
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,120
Just like you.

27
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,630
I'm not well-educated.

28
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,400
I graduated from the school of life.

29
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,910
Unlike you all,
graduates of top schools.

30
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,120
Alright.

31
00:03:00,244 --> 00:03:01,870
Find a spot and get ready for photos.

32
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:02,800
Okay.

33
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,960
By the way, Wu...

34
00:03:07,066 --> 00:03:08,933
I want to take a photo with you.

35
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,520
(I'm Wu Feifei.)

36
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,310
(Objectively speaking,)

37
00:03:21,311 --> 00:03:22,710
(my family background is good.)

38
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,840
(In my circle,)

39
00:03:24,844 --> 00:03:26,430
(young people fall into two types.)

40
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,466
(One type drags their parents down.)

41
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,430
(The other is dependable.)

42
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,360
(This type enjoys exams,)

43
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,000
(enjoys self-improvement,)

44
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,150
(and enjoys challenges
in modern society.)

45
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,630
(And spends money on these things.)

46
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,080
(I always thought
I was the second type.)

47
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,400
(Until just now...)

48
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,150
(I killed a woman.)

00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:11,340
=Episode 2=
=Princess=

50
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:41,600
What's wrong?

51
00:04:42,933 --> 00:04:44,190
Let's go. Something happened.

52
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,830
(The root of everything)

53
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,510
(was a plate of
undercooked fried yellow croaker.)

54
00:04:51,088 --> 00:04:52,240
(Uncle Zhao Qiang was)

55
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,844
(Mr. Zhao Qiang Memorial Service)
(a major shareholder of Penglai Group.)

56
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,360
(At a farmhouse restaurant,)

57
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,390
(he ate undercooked
fried yellow croaker,)

58
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,950
(triggering an old illness)

59
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,270
(and passed away.)

60
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,830
(Uncle Zhao had no children.)

61
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,720
(The ownership of his shares
became an issue.)

62
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:10,190
(And we hoped his widow, Li Ling,)

63
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,800
(would stand with us.)

64
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,800
President Xu's opinion

65
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,977
is what matters most, right?

66
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:16,120
Then wouldn't he listen to President Wu?

67
00:05:16,288 --> 00:05:18,160
Li Ling has no right
to inherit the shares.

68
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,120
- Exactly.
- Then what will she do?

69
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,510
Why didn't Vice President Liu come?

70
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:23,920
He wouldn't come.

71
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,000
Why would he?

72
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,310
The shares became
the target of everyone.

73
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,040
It still depends on President Wu.

74
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,390
President Wu.

75
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:37,955
Please accept our condolences.

76
00:05:39,911 --> 00:05:40,680
Our condolences.

77
00:05:42,088 --> 00:05:42,955
Our condolences.

78
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,190
Vice President Liu came last night.

79
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,680
He said he had other matters today

80
00:05:50,977 --> 00:05:51,920
and wouldn't come.

81
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,040
Next, please welcome the chairman,

82
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,480
Mr. Wu Guohao, to give a speech.

83
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,430
Most of those here today are my elders.

84
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:24,830
By rights,

85
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,000
it shouldn't be my place to speak.

86
00:06:27,755 --> 00:06:29,644
But Uncle Zhao passed away suddenly.

87
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,310
My father is deeply saddened.

88
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,240
I believe everyone present

89
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,240
is also deeply saddened.

90
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,510
After all, we fought and bled together

91
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,488
(Mr. Zhao Qiang Memorial)
for Penglai Group.

92
00:06:42,511 --> 00:06:44,920
We're brothers and family
who made great contributions.

93
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,800
If anyone has anything to say,

94
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:53,600
you should at least show
some respect to the chairman.

95
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,800
If everyone wants to talk,

96
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,190
then let's talk today.

97
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,000
Go on, say it.

98
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,950
How do you plan to divide
Zhao's shares?

99
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,270
Vice President Liu.

100
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,630
Why don't you start?

101
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,390
Let them fight over it.

102
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:08,480
Uncle Zhao and I never registered
our marriage till the end.

103
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,120
If we had, I could've
helped your father.

104
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,680
Now you're in the same position as me,

105
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,680
without legitimacy or standing.

106
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:27,950
Have you ever thought there's a way

107
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,190
to help your father?

108
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,600
I know.

109
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,600
Where's Uncle Ming?

110
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,170
Get the car.
Let's go to the hospital.

111
00:08:40,177 --> 00:08:41,111
Your father fainted.

112
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:41,720
Hurry!

113
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,980
(Emergency Department)

114
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,510
You are awake.

115
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,910
How did I fall?

116
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,200
Do I look bad?

117
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,670
Looks like you're fine.

118
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,440
I'm fine now.

119
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,910
Alright.

120
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:23,910
Then let's talk business.

121
00:09:24,066 --> 00:09:25,977
Li Ling and Zhao Qiang
weren't legally married.

122
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,080
So Li Ling

123
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,360
has no right to the shares.

124
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,670
Zhao Qiang has no other heirs.

125
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:31,670
His shares

126
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,150
will be up for purchase and transfer

127
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,390
at the shareholders' meeting.

128
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,080
Uncle Ming found out

129
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,910
(that Liu Bin is fully prepared.)

130
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,550
(He's arranged funds and bids,)

131
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,630
(but to make the final move,)

132
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,480
(he still needs approval
from all shareholders.)

133
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,870
(Among them,)

134
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,750
(only He Mingli and Gao Lin
are on your side.)

135
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,720
Liu Bin is easy to manipulate.

136
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,670
So what we need now

137
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,480
is the support from Uncle Xu's old team.

138
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,550
Very good.

139
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,150
You've thought this through.

140
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,960
It's time to hand the company

141
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,200
over to you young people.

142
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,600
Wu.

143
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:18,870
I'm going to marry Xu Zhiyang

144
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,630
immediately.

145
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,240
Then do you

146
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,750
love him?

147
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,630
(Have you ever thought there's a way)

148
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,550
to help your dad?

149
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,480
If it's for love,

150
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,550
and you're marrying to build a family,

151
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,440
then Dad support it.

152
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:08,200
But if it's for the company's benefit,

153
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,480
that's why you're marrying...

154
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,080
Come in.

155
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:20,790
Uncle Ming.

156
00:11:22,977 --> 00:11:24,533
The shareholders' meeting is set.

157
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,240
Tomorrow afternoon.

158
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:43,220
(Penglai Group)

159
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,844
Uncle Liu,
let's get straight to the point.

160
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,910
I heard you're good at Guan Dan.
Is that right?

161
00:12:35,511 --> 00:12:36,870
So can I understand it this way?

162
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,030
You were my father's secretary.

163
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,150
That's your strongest card.

164
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,870
I was raised in the Wu family.

165
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,720
That's the Wu family's strongest card.

166
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,510
So you should partner with me.

167
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,440
President Xu Jr., smart move.

168
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,270
The biggest secret of Guan Dan
is cooperation.

169
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,440
You can't each play your own cards,

170
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,670
singing different tunes.

171
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,360
Are you really sure

172
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:04,750
the Wu family
will always be on your side?

173
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,720
Yang.

174
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,910
Penglai used to belong to the Xu family.

175
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,840
It was taken over by others.

176
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,840
In the future, it should still be Xu.

177
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,360
Be the Wu family's puppet prince,

178
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:24,870
or become Penglai's true President Xu

179
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,000
and build something real...

180
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,200
The choice is yours.

181
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,270
The shareholders' meeting vote result.

182
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,510
Director Xu Zhiyang

183
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,320
accepts General Manager
Zhao Qiang's shares.

184
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,790
(Xu Zhiyang, let's get married.)

185
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,240
I only recently realized

186
00:14:02,755 --> 00:14:05,240
that we have been heading toward
marriage since childhood.

187
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,870
So now that we're here,

188
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:09,870
this should be

189
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,910
the best time for us to marry.

190
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,240
Then you're not here to talk marriage.

191
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,120
You're here to talk business.

192
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,600
What's wrong with that?

193
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,840
Let's treat marriage
like a business deal.

194
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,240
Business people are great.

195
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,840
They follow rules and keep their word.

196
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,390
In business,

197
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,000
both sides benefit.

198
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,630
Feifei.

199
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,270
Can our marriage be purer?

200
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,200
A pure marriage.

201
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,960
Pure freedom.

202
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,360
I hope I can have at least one.

203
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:50,960
Feifei, please tell Mr. Wu the result,
on my behalf,

204
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,390
and take good care of his health.

205
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,790
Sorry, everyone.

206
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:00,910
Please wait a moment.

207
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,620
(Groom: Xu Zhiyang, Bride: Wu Feifei)

208
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,270
I can tell everyone is quite surprised.

209
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:28,550
Right?

210
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,150
Indeed, it was unexpected,

211
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:32,600
but also reasonable.

212
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,910
Over the years,

213
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,510
Penglai has had
many big and small problems.

214
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,510
But in the end,

215
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,720
it all came down to one question,

216
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,200
the Xu or the Wu.

217
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,670
But from today, from this moment on,

218
00:15:45,866 --> 00:15:47,511
that question no longer exists.

219
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,150
Because we are family now.

220
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:56,444
Everyone, please give us
a round of applause. Thank you.

221
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,360
(Since my dad passed away,)

222
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,080
(I've been living with your family.)

223
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,720
It seems that from then on,

224
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,840
we were forced into
this marriage arrangement

225
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,910
and lived with it.

226
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,960
Yes, I should accept this reality.

227
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:25,840
Don't worry.

228
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:29,390
My dad and I won't treat you

229
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,377
like the puppet prince
people talk about.

230
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:32,750
If

231
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,480
you still have concerns,

232
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,840
we can sign a prenuptial agreement.

233
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,080
There's a saying,

234
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,320
the only constant truth in this world

235
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,600
is change.

236
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,240
The future is long.

237
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,320
Let's settle the company matters first.

238
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,480
As for our relationship,

239
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,790
we can figure it out slowly, okay?

240
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,440
(If it's because of love)

241
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,550
(that you two are getting married
and starting a family,)

242
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,480
(Dad supports you.)

243
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,830
(But if it's because
of company interests)

244
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,030
(that you're getting married,)

245
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,000
(I'd rather give up those shares.)

246
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,440
(This concerns)

247
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:41,110
(my daughter's entire future.)

248
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:45,110
(Do you understand what I mean?)

249
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,920
(Miss,)

250
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,880
(do you know who I am?)

251
00:18:12,511 --> 00:18:14,070
(Ever since I had a mobile phone,)

252
00:18:14,644 --> 00:18:16,750
(my password has always
been your birthday.)

253
00:18:20,777 --> 00:18:22,750
I want everyone
who came to this wedding,

254
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,977
even those already married,

255
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,440
to want to get married again.

256
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:30,790
(I love you.)

257
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,160
(I want to marry you.)

258
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,030
(I can't promise)

259
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,000
(I'll be a perfect husband,)

260
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,240
(but I'll do everything I can
to treat you well.)

261
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,070
(Thank you, Big Dog.)

262
00:18:43,777 --> 00:18:45,240
(Thank you for telling me all this.)

263
00:18:45,888 --> 00:18:47,933
(I've called you Big Dog
since we were kids.)

264
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,640
(People say)

265
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,830
(only close buddies
call each other that.)

266
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,000
(But I call you that because)

267
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,550
(I feel you're always by my side.)

268
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,480
(Whenever I need you the most,)

269
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,070
(you're there.)

270
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,070
Wang Dan, right?

271
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,070
Congratulations.

272
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,720
What should I call you now?

273
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,200
Miss Wu as before,

274
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,240
or Mrs. Xu instead?

275
00:19:41,711 --> 00:19:43,022
Two hundred thousand.

276
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:44,480
Take the money and leave.

277
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,400
Leave Binchuan.

278
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:52,310
The young lady's way of thinking

279
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,720
is really different from others.

280
00:19:54,577 --> 00:19:57,070
This bag alone must be
worth tens of thousands.

281
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,720
You might as well bring a trash bag

282
00:20:00,844 --> 00:20:02,733
and stuff three hundred thousand
in it for me.

283
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,750
If money can solve it,

284
00:20:07,688 --> 00:20:09,755
why should I waste effort
on anything else?

285
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,070
I came to talk to you sincerely.

286
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,510
I know

287
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,400
you urgently need money.

288
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,000
So why not be more realistic?

289
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:27,200
Three hundred thousand
or five hundred thousand,

290
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:29,750
I can do either.

291
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:34,070
But I want a win-win result.

292
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:35,920
Otherwise,

293
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,160
I guarantee you won't get a single cent.

294
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,070
Is that so?

295
00:20:53,755 --> 00:20:56,790
If these videos were
accidentally uploaded online,

296
00:20:58,133 --> 00:21:00,044
when do you think would be appropriate?

297
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,880
Would it be trending
on your wedding day?

298
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,160
That's blackmail.

299
00:21:07,688 --> 00:21:09,440
What exactly am I blackmailing you for?

300
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,590
I haven't even stated my terms yet.

301
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,000
What terms?

302
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,270
I...

303
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,720
can also be Mrs. Xu.

304
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,440
Do you believe I'll kill you?

305
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,160
You really overestimate yourself.

306
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,310
He was just impulsive,

307
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:32,155
looking for someone
to sleep with, understand?

308
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,830
But sleeping
with the same woman continuously

309
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,920
is a different matter.

310
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,680
And what makes you so special?

311
00:21:44,111 --> 00:21:45,355
Having a powerful dad?

312
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,480
You were just born lucky.

313
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:49,880
Yes.

314
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,750
Right now, Xu Zhiyang treats me

315
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,844
like someone he can summon
or dismiss at will.

316
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,680
So what?

317
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,590
I truly cared about him.

318
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,830
He could hold me and cry,

319
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,510
and tell me a few heartfelt words.

320
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,270
I also know

321
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,400
that your Penglai Group
originally had the surname Xu,

322
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,200
not Wu.

323
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,720
Did he ever tell you that?

324
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,350
Did he even dare to mention it?

325
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,510
Miss,

326
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,750
he married you for the company.

327
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,830
Your body isn't even
as attractive as mine.

328
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,640
If my story gets exposed,

329
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,720
(what will you lose? Love?)

330
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,640
(Your dignity?)

331
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,350
(Or the company's image?)

332
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,440
(Or maybe all of that...)

333
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,880
You never had anyway.

334
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,440
Men

335
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,310
won't follow you

336
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:45,030
forever.

337
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:47,830
You evil lady!

338
00:23:16,911 --> 00:23:20,111
(The root of everything wasn't the
undercooked fried yellow croaker.)

339
00:23:20,644 --> 00:23:22,600
(It was that I myself
wasn't fully mature.)

340
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,380
(Xiangbin Tunnel)

341
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,660
(Wu)

342
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,620
(Wu)

343
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:01,460
(Wu)

344
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,240
Everyone is waiting for you at home.

345
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,350
Li Ling even brought a pufferfish.

346
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,590
What's wrong?

347
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:16,750
What's wrong?

348
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,720
Stay where you are.

349
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,200
I'll ask Uncle Ming to find you.

350
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,240
I'm fine.

351
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,680
I'll be home soon.

352
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,350
Feifei,

353
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:42,750
about this marriage
between you and Yang,

354
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,270
you grew up together and are close.

355
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,680
We all know that.

356
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,590
But outsiders don't.

357
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:56,070
Not just the whole group,

358
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,110
but all of Binchuan

359
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,070
are watching closely.

360
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,070
So it must be handled properly,

361
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,030
steadily.

362
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,110
Otherwise,

363
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:13,920
the group will be affected as well.

364
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,830
(A close friend once told me)

365
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,510
(that someone named Locard said,)

366
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,240
(every crime)

367
00:26:39,244 --> 00:26:41,577
(is inevitably accompanied
by material exchange.)

368
00:26:42,311 --> 00:26:43,680
(This place is remote enough.)

369
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,350
(No one around.)

370
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,720
(No surveillance nearby either.)

371
00:28:24,822 --> 00:28:26,444
(Wang Dan: Fine, Xu Zhiyang, just wait.)

372
00:28:26,444 --> 00:28:30,260
(Xu Zhiyang: Why aren't you
answering my calls?)

373
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:40,140
(Xu Zhiyang: Why aren't you
answering my calls?)

374
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,560
(I've made it very clear. We're over.)

375
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,700
(Don't pull this sneaky revenge crap.)

376
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,440
Sorry,

377
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,350
the number you have dialled
is unavailable.

378
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,590
Please try again later.

379
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,750
(Tell me the truth.)

380
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,510
Did you see Wang Dan?

381
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,880
Why did you go see her?

382
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,510
I cut it off for you.

383
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,400
You don't know...

384
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,000
She has videos of me.

385
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,110
I know.

386
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,030
She even showed me.

387
00:30:17,933 --> 00:30:19,310
What did you do to her?

388
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,160
Feifei, Wang Dan is my mistake.

389
00:30:26,777 --> 00:30:28,844
I promise I'll cut her off completely.

390
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,440
Let me handle this.

391
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,070
Please.

392
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,240
Xu Zhiyang, can I still trust you?

393
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,480
Yes, I know.

394
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,920
I know you're very angry right now.

395
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,880
Later, take it all out on me.

396
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,830
I won't fight back or talk back.

397
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,000
But right now, we must stand together.

398
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,590
Let me meet her once.

399
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,070
Okay?

400
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,000
You still want to see her?

401
00:31:01,555 --> 00:31:02,640
You can't let her go?

402
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,030
Can you stop being so impulsive?

403
00:31:04,244 --> 00:31:05,590
You don't understand her at all.

404
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:07,790
If you push someone like her,
she's capable of anything.

405
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,111
What kind of person is she then?

406
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,590
You know her best, right?

407
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,720
I told you I cut her off completely,

408
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,890
yet you still want to see her.

409
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,333
Do you even want this marriage?

410
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,400
Feifei, we've been together
for so many years.

411
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,720
How I feel about you,

412
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,310
you should know better than anyone.

413
00:31:32,533 --> 00:31:34,333
But you never gave me any response.

414
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:35,830
Honestly,

415
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:37,030
I never even hoped

416
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,440
that we'd end up together.

417
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:42,070
I know Wang Dan is vain and shallow.

418
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,880
Once she grabs a man, she won't let go.

419
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,960
I know all of that.

420
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,880
But I have to admit,

421
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,400
what she gave me

422
00:31:51,822 --> 00:31:53,755
is something you never wanted to give.

423
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,790
You asked if I don't want this marriage.

424
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,480
How could I not want to get married?

425
00:32:00,644 --> 00:32:01,790
You have no idea that day,

426
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:04,200
when you told me about
getting married, how happy I was.

427
00:32:04,266 --> 00:32:06,244
But I felt guilty.
I was scared to marry you.

428
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,070
It's all my fault for causing trouble.

429
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,160
I have to see Wang Dan.

430
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,350
Trust me.

431
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,000
I must meet her face to face

432
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,030
and end it completely.

433
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,400
But if you don't agree,

434
00:32:16,622 --> 00:32:18,488
I really don't know what might happen.

435
00:32:18,777 --> 00:32:20,750
Then we'll have to postpone the wedding.

436
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,111
And don't transfer
your dad's shares yet.

437
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:30,420
(Hospital Ward)

438
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,200
What's wrong, girl?

439
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,240
Something happened?

440
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,200
You seem distracted.

441
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:45,480
No.

442
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,830
I can tell your mind's elsewhere.

443
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,350
If something happened

444
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,200
and you can solve it yourself,

445
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,270
that's an ability.

446
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,790
If you can't solve it yourself,

447
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,440
look for a friend.

448
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,310
That's skill.

449
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,310
If even friends can't help,

450
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:11,270
look for your dad.

451
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,030
What's that called?

452
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,200
That's family.

453
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:19,480
Your dad isn't old yet.

454
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:24,440
Yes.

455
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,750
Let's calm down for a while.

456
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,750
Take care of yourself.

457
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,200
Do whatever you want.

458
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,070
Just don't let my dad know

459
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,270
about your mess.

460
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,480
Go wherever you want.

461
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,110
Sorry.

462
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,000
Lan.

463
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:21,920
Yun.

464
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,480
Not wearing a jacket? Aren't you cold?

465
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,190
Not cold.

466
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:29,670
Lan.

467
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:30,840
Heading out?

468
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:48,760
Where is she?

469
00:34:48,844 --> 00:34:50,933
She went back to her hometown
half a month ago.

470
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,550
She still owes rent.

471
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,760
Half a month ago?

472
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,630
You see,

473
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,670
no one's here.

474
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,960
Lan,
I won't beat around the bush.

475
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,280
You're a well-known landlady here.

476
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,480
But your apartments

477
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:25,920
are only rented to single women.

478
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,920
What they do,

479
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:29,880
I know very well.

480
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,400
You know?

481
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:36,110
Then you walked into the tiger's den.

482
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,630
I'm just the landlord.

483
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:41,000
They're tenants.

484
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,670
I only care about money.

485
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,710
What they do is none of my business.

486
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,920
Late-night food delivery,
and door-to-door.

487
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:58,000
We checked this number.

488
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:00,760
It's under your brother's name.

489
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,440
There are six cars in total.

490
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,840
Your brother's job

491
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,190
is to drive these girls

492
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:07,070
back here every night.

493
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,590
Their earnings go into your account.

494
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,920
You say you don't manage
what happens inside,

495
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,230
but you close your eyes and
open doors to make money.

496
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:17,800
What you're doing,

497
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,000
am I not clear enough?

498
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:29,480
How big a deal is this Wang Dan
to your family,

499
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,280
to investigate her so thoroughly?

500
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,000
Is it necessary?

501
00:36:32,155 --> 00:36:34,030
I'm not trying
to make things hard for you.

502
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,800
I just want to know where she is.

503
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,480
Three years ago, she rented my place.

504
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,000
I never raised her rent.

505
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,630
Consider it a good deed.

506
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,630
Mainly, she's not a bad person.

507
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,510
We became close, like sisters.

508
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,000
Also,

509
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:52,230
that girl is really pitiful.

510
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,550
How pitiful?

511
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:56,110
Digging for men in the trash every day.

512
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,400
How could she not be pitiful?

513
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:58,840
Earlier on,

514
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,880
she met a vice president
of a small bank.

515
00:37:00,977 --> 00:37:02,440
He said he was getting a divorce.

516
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,590
Then she got pregnant,

517
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:05,590
and had an abortion.

518
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,800
He paid her some money and ran off.

519
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:10,440
Later, she met a freight company owner.

520
00:37:10,488 --> 00:37:11,670
She said he was single.

521
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,710
I thought they'd finally make it.

522
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:15,360
Turns out his wife showed up

523
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,280
with a group of people.

524
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,280
They broke two of Wang Dan's ribs.

525
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,670
After that, there was your man.

526
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:23,320
I even thought Wang Dan was lucky.

527
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,800
Lan, none of that concerns me.

528
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,840
I just want to know where she is now.

529
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,710
You're really talking light
while standing on safe ground.

530
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,760
That won't work with me.

531
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:51,230
Someone already paid
to make Wang Dan disappear.

532
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,360
I'm a person with principles.

533
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:55,630
People like you walking on land

534
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,230
will never understand

535
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:59,440
how hard it is to survive underwater.

536
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,960
You upper-class people, what do you
think Wang Dan is to you?

537
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,880
She thought she'd grabbed a lifeline,

538
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,760
but in the end, you people

539
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,710
just spat her out.

540
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,360
Even so,

541
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:12,630
I bet she'll rise again.

542
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,960
Don't expect to get

543
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,030
any information about Wang Dan from me.

544
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:18,840
Hello?

545
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:21,710
Miss, we've located Wang Dan.

546
00:39:35,711 --> 00:39:37,244
Why did you hide it from me?

547
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:41,840
Say something.

548
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:45,800
Is it fun playing me?

549
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:56,550
(When something happens,)

550
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:00,320
(if you can handle it yourself,)

551
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:02,440
(that's an ability.)

552
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:04,550
(If you can't,)

553
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,280
(look for a friend.)

554
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,280
(That's skill.)

555
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,400
(If friends can't help,)

556
