[Episode 8]

3
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,030
Changing one's name...

4
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,030
Truly pathetic.

5
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,630
Your brother changed his name.

6
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,960
He took my surname.

7
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,420
His name is Xiao Zhiyu now.

8
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,310
From now on,

9
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,660
you can't call him by his original name.

10
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,800
Mr. Xiao.

11
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,400
Should we call everyone for a meeting

12
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,990
to discuss the project requirements
Lyman just mentioned?

13
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,520
Let's talk when we get back.

14
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,560
Zhuling

15
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,310
has several branch offices
in prefecture-level cities.

16
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,840
They're small operations,

17
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,610
perfect for someone to keep a low profile.

18
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,710
Pick one

19
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:52,990
and report there next week.

20
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,010
Thank you, Mr. Pei.

21
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,070
Thank you, Mr. Pei.

22
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,560
When a dog is starved for three days,

23
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,690
it will naturally look for leftovers.

24
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,870
The difference between humans and dogs

25
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,680
is that humans

26
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,870
can't wait that long.

27
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,560
Let's go.

28
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,520
Why was Mr. Xiao unhappy just now?

29
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,540
Wasn't the meeting going smoothly?

30
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,000
That's because our opponent this time
is Zhuling again.

31
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,800
Zhuling again?

32
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,730
What do you mean?

33
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,060
You just joined us, so you don't know yet.

34
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,560
Previously, several projects at our studio

35
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,520
were won by Mr. Xiao

36
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,630
from Zhuling.

37
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,710
Honestly,
we've been speculating in private

38
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,710
that he's deliberately targeting Zhuling.

39
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,240
But why Zhuling?

40
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,360
Just because they're the industry leader?

41
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,800
That we don't know.

42
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,150
They're all big shots.

43
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,240
Whatever conflicts they have,

44
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,500
there's no way they'd air them publicly.

45
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,360
Do you think

46
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,130
what happened to Jiang Tianyi

47
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,190
could be related to Zhuling?

48
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:12,230
Could it be?

52
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,970
Did you miss me?

53
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:34,680
I did.

54
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,560
What's got you in such a good mood?

55
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,360
The new company registration.

56
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,680
It was all settled today.

57
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,620
That's wonderful.

58
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,290
Once this current project is completed,

59
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,950
Kanghua and I will leave the group.

60
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,920
Dad, what's your company called?

61
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,800
It's called...

62
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,930
Zhuling.

63
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,190
"Ling" means

64
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,159
the most beautiful feathers on a bird.

65
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:54,800
Xiaoyi,

66
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,320
my company

67
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,480
will build many grand buildings
in the future

68
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,740
and adorn them with the finest feathers.

69
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,120
Mr. Xiao, you're still as early as ever.

70
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:21,410
Well, I don't have any old ties
to catch up on.

71
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,360
I know what you did.

72
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,530
And I know Jiang Tianyi
was acting on your orders.

73
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,130
Acting on my orders?

74
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,240
Have you ever considered that you've

75
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,900
simply made too many enemies?

76
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,330
Not as many as the ones you're wary of.

77
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,040
You used Jiang Tianyi this early.

78
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,000
Has Zhuling become nothing
but a hollow shell,

79
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,409
so much so that you don't even dare
let me into the game?

80
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:52,580
At the end of the day,

81
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,280
you're just not very fond

82
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,830
of my little greeting gift.

83
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,250
How about this?

84
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,220
Once Zhuling wins this round,

85
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,560
whatever you want,

86
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,120
I'll be sure to give it some thought.

87
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,670
Over the past five years,

88
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,670
I've heard that promise many times.

89
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,300
I hope it can come true this time.

90
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,680
Good luck.

91
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,610
Not everyone is like Jiang Tianyi.

92

Don't get too happy yet.

93
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,610
People's hearts
aren't as unbreakable as you think.

94
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,159
This looks nice.

95
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:45,920

the best times
to post for maximum traffic—

with more building material suppliers

He farmed them himself.

156

My leg isn't fully healed yet,

160
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:59,910
so I can't eat anything
that could cause inflammation.

161
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,570
I can only treat you with them.

Got it.

166
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,750
According to the geological survey report,

167
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,200
most of this area

168
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,670
has good foundation conditions.

169
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,800
It belongs to Zone N.

170
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,890
Only the southern part over there—

171
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,550
that's Zone S.

172
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,000
Shanghai has a lot of soft soil;

173
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,540
it's unavoidable.

174
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,360
That means foundation treatment costs

175
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,510
for the southern area will be higher.

176
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,030
I'm not sure

177
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,960
if it will affect our overall plan.

178
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,960
Or we could move
these 2 originally planned buildings

179
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,000
to the south.

180
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:55,150
But Mr. Xiao is a perfectionist.

181
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:58,370
He'll definitely want
to rearrange the orientation.

182
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,120
What's wrong?

183
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,790
I'm thinking...

184
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,000
that no matter where we build them
or how we build them,

185
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,270
ultimately we have to consider

186
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,270
how to deal with that soft soil area.

187
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,320
That's another budget item.

188
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,720
But this expense

189
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,480
is unavoidable.

190
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:16,370
That's right.

191
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,530
Mr. Xiao always emphasizes

192
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,490
that when it comes to designing,

193
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,660
safety issues are non-negotiable.

194
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,320
We definitely need to consider
soil replacement.

195
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,780
It's to thoroughly improve the foundation.

196
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,720
But soil replacement
requires a lot of labor,

197
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,870
and our design costs are already high.

198
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,120
It's quite challenging.

199
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,510
You are nervous?

200
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,870
What are you talking about?

201
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,000
Aren't you nervous?

202
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,790
I'm... I'm fine.

203
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,520
You know our competitor is Zhuling, right?

204
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,150
Yes, I know.

205
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,030
You're quite something.

206
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,750
I'm impressed, Hu Xiu.

207
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,070
You've got quite strong nerves.

208
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,720
I believe in Mr. Xiao's design.

209
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,670
Of course.

210
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,800
I believe in him too.

211
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,320
Mr. Xiao's designs

212
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,720
have always been unique.

213
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,600
After competing with Zhuling
for so many years,

214
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,930
we're not necessarily at a disadvantage.

215
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,200
But Zhuling...

216
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,000
is a big, well-established company.

217
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,800
Their strengths lie elsewhere.

218
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,840
Secretary Li.

219
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,080
Thank you for coming.

220
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,840
Mr. Pei.

221
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:33,870
Please, this way.

222
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,130
Watch your step.

223
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,750
The environment here is quite nice.

224
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,390
Yes.

225
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,360
We plan to utilize
the entire water system.

226
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,250
That person
is from the Construction Bureau.

227
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,390
The area we're looking at now

228
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,720
is the core landscape zone.

229
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,380
Supporting facilities
will be at the entrance.

230
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,630
Try as much as you can to avoid the part

231
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,150
where clay is under the water.

232
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,810
The foundation must be solid.

233
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,550
So Zhuling's advantage

234
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,050
is their connections.

235
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,240
Having connections makes things easier.

236
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,300
And it helps keep project costs down.

237
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,720
Like I just said,

238
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,200
Mr. Xiao's skills are top-notch,

239
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,330
but the corresponding costs are high.

240
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,990
In terms of cost-effectiveness,

241
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,450
we might not have the edge.

242
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,270
So the only thing we can rely on

243
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,600
is Mr. Xiao's design?

244
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,120
Right.

245
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,370
Good luck.

246
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:33,920
Take this.

247
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,770
If that's the case,

248
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,170
this area will be wasted.

249
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,720
We need to do it over there,

250
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,510
because it allows for future extension.

251
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,640
The other side is...

252
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,130
Hello, Ms. Zhou.

253
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,170
A meeting?

254
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,030
Now?

255
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,870
I'm on the site.

256
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:05,690
It's fine.

257
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:07,440
We'll head back now.

258
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,220
What happened?

259
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,650
Some details in the previous plan

260
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,400
aren't fully aligned
with Ms. Zhou's budget.

261
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,000
Mr. Xiao and Ms. Zhou
need to have a meeting

262
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,460
to reconfirm everything.

263
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,080
We need to get back quickly.

264
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,630
You go back first.

265
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,530
I'll stay here.

266
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:24,630
It's getting late.

267
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,230
Is it okay for you to be alone?

268
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,720
Since I'm already here, and...

269
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,980
based on the materials I have,

270
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,360
the difference between the site elevation

271
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,940
and the road elevation on-site
is a bit large.

272
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,400
I want to measure it again.

273
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,270
You go back.

274
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,570
And this too.

275
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,480
Here.

276
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,060
I can handle it.

277
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,180
You're excellent.

278
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,580
I am excellent.

279
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,550
Be careful on your own.

280
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:50,210
Okay.

281
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,750

Mr. Xiao.

287
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,910
We have these ideas
for the three-dimensional

288
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:05,380

Where's your colleague?

307
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,560
He had to leave early.

308
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,210
How about I give you a ride home?

309
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:28,630
It's fine.

310
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,020
I'll take a taxi.

311
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:32,320
Thanks.

312
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,640
It's hard to get a taxi here,

313
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,950
and it's raining now.

314
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,380
I'll wait.

315
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,180
I can go to the main road.

316
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,170
Ms. Hu, do you dislike me?

317
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,300
I...

318
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,040
Given the relationship
between our two companies,

319
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:13,980
I completely understand if you want

320
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,470
to keep your distance from me.

321
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:16,800
But for safety reasons,

322
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,250
there's no way I, a grown man,

323
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,720
would let a girl

324
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,070
stay here alone.

325
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,980
Let's go together.

326
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:34,890
Hu Xiu,

327
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:35,650
are you home?

328
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,480
It looks like it's raining outside.

329
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,210
Don't worry.

330
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,620
I'm already in the car.

331
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:40,740
Alright.

332
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,380
Then let me know when you get home.

333
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,140
It's Hu Xiu?

334
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:45,350
What's wrong with her?

335
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,970
Didn't I go to the site today?

336
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,340
I couldn't find an assistant at the time,

337
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,800
so I asked her to go with me.

338
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,150
She's not back yet?

339
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,360
She insisted on staying there

340
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,650
to verify the elevation differences
on site.

341
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,870
But she just said
she's already in the car.

342
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:56,910
Okay, I got it.

343
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,510
Sun,

344
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,790
you really don't go easy on newcomers.

345
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,270
Hu Xiu has been here for so long.

346
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,670
She's hardly a newcomer anymore.

347
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,130
Besides, you have no idea,

348
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,020
but the people from Zhuling
were also there today.

349
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,150
It was quite a scene.

350
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,060
Young man,

351
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,369
you should feel some sense of crisis.

352
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:13,760
Get to work.

353
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,530
Ms. Hu, you don't need to be so formal.

354
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,590
Actually,

355
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,790
we should have been colleagues.

356
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,920
How did you know?

357
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,830
An outstanding candidate like you

358
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,670
certainly leaves a deep impression.

359
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:39,910
It's just a pity

360
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,960
that you didn't choose us in the end.

361
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,960
Being able to interview at Zhuling

362
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,070
was an honor.

363
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,430
It was just that my career goals

364
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:53,450
might not have fully aligned
with Zhuling's needs.

365
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,940
That was our mistake.

366
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,720
HR's assessment of you was off.

367
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:02,290
If possible,

368
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,020
I wonder if you'd be willing to

369
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,830
give me another chance.

370
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,520
You're too kind, Mr. Pei.

371
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,920
I'm already really grateful

372
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,780
that you drove me back in the rain.

373
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,810
It was no trouble.

374
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:18,680
As a boss,

375
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,070
I would never leave my employee

376
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,270
alone at the site.

377
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,510
Indeed.

378
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,220
My colleague wanted me to leave with him.

379
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:28,730
It was my fault—
I just wanted to hurry a bit.

380
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:30,750
Sounds like you've been

381
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,510
fairly happy

382
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,750
at Dynamism.

383
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,640
Of course.

384
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,960
After all, working in this field

385
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,510
has always been my dream.

386
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,550

is a

388
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,560
very open-minded place.

389
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,080
Open-minded?

390
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,720
What about Mr. Xiao?

391
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,460
Is he open-minded too?

392
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,310
Even before I started working,

393
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,040
I already admired his designs.

Mr. Wu,

00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,030
long time no see.

437
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,200
Yes,

438
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:04,000
I asked Zhou Yan to contact you.

439
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:14,940
The park's identification system
often malfunctions.

440
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,900
I'll walk back.

441
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,110
I'll get an umbrella

442
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,510
and walk you downstairs.

443
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,970
The Lyman project is very important to us.

444
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,160
I don't want any mistakes to happen.

445
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,510
Of course.

446
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:35,060
That's why
we went to check out the site today.

447
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,750
What I mean is...

448
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,990
as a member of the project team,

449
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,170
you should keep a distance from them.

450
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,370
Today I got into Mr. Pei's car

451
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,720
only because it was raining

452
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,120
and I couldn't get a taxi.

453
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,830
I'm sorry, Mr. Xiao.

454
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,490
I wasn't thinking it through.

455
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,100
You've probably heard about Jiang Tianyi,
right?

456
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:58,610
Zhuling is definitely involved in this.

457
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,810
During this project,

458
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:02,070
it's best to stay away from their people.

00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,070
So, Mr. Xiao,

460
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,680
you came to the site

461
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,410

00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,400

If I'd known they wouldn't be here,

474

I wouldn't have brought so many dishes.

475
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,850
Don't mention them.

476
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,400
They were all exhausted.

477
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,310

478
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,690
You ordered so many dishes today?

479
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,830
Ms. Zhao,

480
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,980
did you land a big deal?

481
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,160
I'm in a good mood today.

482
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:15,870
Didn't the park say
they were going to raise the rent before?

483
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:16,410
I took care of it.

484
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:17,440
They won't do it now.

485

486

with the park.

488
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,960
In the future,
when the companies in there hold events,

489
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,480
I can provide catering

490
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,960
and venue support.

491
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:26,870
The costs—

492
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,270
have you checked the costs?

00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:28,920
Of course.

494

495
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:33,470
I've been thinking

496
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:36,660
we could make
employee membership cards for them.

497
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,880
There are so many holidays
throughout the year.

498

Our shop's cards

499
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:42,210

wants us to develop

515

a business park
management software product.

516
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,110
When I asked further,

517
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,310
I found out he's from Fangyun Group—

518
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,740
the one in charge
of your park's operations.

519
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,960
He's just been transferred there

520
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,510
and is extremely interested

521
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,910
in murder mystery games.

522
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:24,200
So you want to take him to play?

523
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:24,960
Yes.

524
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:28,550
But I know nothing
about murder mystery games.

525
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:31,190
I'm afraid it might get awkward by then.

526
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,210
What's so hard about playing a game?

527
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:33,760
Here's the plan:

528
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,160
let's call Hu Xiu along.

529
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:36,160
More people means more fun.

530
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,640

The food you prepared today is delicious.

535
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,650
Then have some more.

536
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:54,660
Mr. Xiao.

537
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,030
The southern part near the river
is all soft soil.

538
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,480
Foundation treatment costs will be high.

539
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,470
I think what Sun said before has a point.

540
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,110
Why don't we move
the detached houses in the plan

541
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,570
over to the southern part?

542
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,400
What about the orientation and lighting?

543
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,920
Orientation can be adjusted.

544
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,030
Having the side facing the water
is actually not a problem.

545
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:20,750
The most important thing

546
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:23,550
is to make the waterfront concept
work to its fullest.

547
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,270
In Shanghai's modern architecture,

548
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:27,480
there are many riverside buildings,

549
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:28,750
but most

550
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,950
have a certain distance from the water.

551
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:33,080
Designs like a fitness path
along the river

552
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:33,920
are too conventional,

553
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,270
and they don't fit the lane-style elements
we're aiming for.

554
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,720
You mean...

555
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:39,140
waterfront lanes?

556
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:39,960
Yes.

557
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,230
In Shanghai,

558
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:43,210
most lanes are in the city center.

559
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,210
Apart from some nearby ancient towns,

560
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:47,400
waterfront lanes are actually very rare.

561
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,400
Since Lyman's site is by the water,

562
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,550
we could consider

563
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,200
this kind of waterside-perching layout,

564
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,260
creating a contemporary version
of a waterfront lane.

565
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,240
This proposal is worth considering.

566
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:03,810
It has practical potential.

567
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,160
Hu Xiu,

568
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,310
your ideas are bold,

569
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,100
but they're very creative.

570
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,010
Thank you, Ms. Zhou.

571
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,740
Boldness brings innovation.

572
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,160
At Dynamism,

573
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,420
there's no need to stick to conventions.

574
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,210
Well, Ms. Zhou,

575
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,620
I'll get back to work now.

576
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,440
Not bad, this girl.

577
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:36,080
She keeps her emotions in check.

578
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:36,950
Yesterday,

579
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,750
seeing so many people
from Zhuling go there

580
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,590
and how they have connections
to the Construction Bureau,

581
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,920
she was really worried.

582
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,350
She insisted on checking and verifying

583
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,750
all the site conditions before going home.

584
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:49,040
Alright, let's settle on this for now.

585
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,440
Next, I'll handle the coordination.

586
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,830
Mr. Xiao, Ms. Zhou, see you tomorrow.

587
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:52,700
Goodbye.

588
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,440
What's wrong?

589
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,510
Nothing.

590
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:14,440
Why are you still working after hours?

591
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,700
I need to grow up

592
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,300
in the shortest time possible.

593
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,230
I want those who don't believe in me

594
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,180
to see what I'm really capable of.

595
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,550
What upset you this time?

596
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:28,150
Nothing.

597
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,370
You need to balance work and rest.

598
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,170
How about this?

599
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,110
Wang is taking his client

600
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,590
to a murder mystery game tonight.

601
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:35,350
Let's join them,

602
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,410
just to relax a bit.

603
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,560
Can I skip it?

604
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:43,040
Wang is going there for business.

605
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,790
It'll be boring for me if I go alone.

606
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,530
Didn't you like playing that game before?

607
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:47,990
Just come with me, please?

608
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:51,750
I had a falling out with Qin Xiaoyi there.

609
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,530
It'll be awkward if I see him.

610
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,790
When I went to the club
to pick up the tickets today,

611
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:57,880
it was Li Yue there.

612
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,610
It should be his session today.

613
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:00,940
Li Yue?

614
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,160
Fine, I'll go.

615
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:10,090
That's my friend.

616
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,400
Are these the most expensive beans?

617
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,200
Yes.

618
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:18,870
Mr. Qian.

619
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:19,710
Mr. Guangming.

620
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:20,740
Just call me Qian.

621
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,820
Alright, Qian.

622
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,440
I brought you some coffee.

623
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,000
Thanks.

624
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,680
Let me introduce you.

625
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,810
This is Qian Jinxin.

626
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,730
He's in charge
of operations for the entire park.

627
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:30,690
This is my wife,

628
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,680
Zhao Xiaorou.

629
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,240
The café

630
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:32,590
across the street,

631
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,160
Regard,

632
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,070
is hers.

633
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,790
I saw it when I passed by earlier.

634
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:37,650
It's very nice.

635
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,940
Thanks. Feel free to drop by anytime.

636
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:41,650
And who is this?

637
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,330
My best friend, Hu Xiu.

638
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:45,240
Hello.

639
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:46,350
Hello.

640
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:48,910
Let's go get our tickets checked first.

641
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:49,460
Sure.

642
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:50,870
Let's check in first.

643
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,160
Honey,

644
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,920
teach me how to play now.

645
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,120
I don't want to embarrass myself later.

646
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:05,840
Ms. Hu,

647
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,000
you have such elegant poise.

648
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,530
Did you study dance before?

649
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,000
No.

650
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:13,940
You should explore more in the arts.

651
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,480
You're so young.

652
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,040
You should try more new things.

653
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,500
You're really funny.

654
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,270
I'm not joking.

655
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:24,880
Alright, players for the next session,

656
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,240
you may start choosing your boxes now.

657
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:26,880
Attention,

658
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,440
drinks

659
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,790
are not allowed in the game area.

660
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:29,920
If you need to store them,

661
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,520
there's a locker over there.

662
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,110
Qian!

663
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:38,520
Choose a box.

664
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,340
What were you guys talking about?

665
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,270
Nothing.

666
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:46,230
Is that guy Guangming's client?

667
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,680
They're discussing a collaboration.

668
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,550
Qian Jinxin

669
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:51,550
was recently transferred to this park.

670
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,960
He wants Wang to develop

671
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,510
a park management software product
for him.

672
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:56,750
Later,
things like access control, parking,

673
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:57,750
and property management

674
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,860
can all be handled through this software.

675
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,120
How do you know so much?

676
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,290
I have no choice.

677
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,020
Wang is in the early stage of his startup.

678
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,790
I want to provide all the support I can,

679
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,000
and help him secure

680
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,330
any potential clients.

681
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:10,640
Let's go.

682
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,990
Let's go pick our boxes.

683
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,150
Ms. Hu! Ms. Hu!

684
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,270
Ms. Hu, let's go together.

685
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,270
Rongcheng is too dangerous.

686
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:23,510
No need.

687
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:24,870
Let's not get separated.

688
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:25,400
It's fine.

689
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,000
No need.

690
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,540
I'm sorry.

691
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,680
What?

692
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,490
Is this a welcome gift for me
in Rongcheng?

693
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:55,870
Why is it you?

694
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,940
You're surprised?

695
00:31:59,200 --> 00:31:59,960
This is my wife.

696
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,960
I haven't been able to keep her in line.

697
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,760
My apologies.

698
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:12,510
Mr. Qian.

699
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,590
Reporter Han Yingzhi and Mr. Miyazaki

700
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,720
are indeed married,

701
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,480
but it's a fake marriage.

702
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,440
I understand.

703
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,770
Like Mr. and Mrs. Smith.

704
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,400
Though compared to Angelina Jolie,

705
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,030
you're missing

706
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,210
a little bit of that sexy factor.

707
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,030
Although we're on different sides,

708
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,790
the people we're up against are the same,

709
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,350
right?

710
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:31,080
Let me see your character card.

711
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,160
-Let me see.
-Xiu.

712
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:35,560
How is it?

713
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:36,830
Not bad.

714
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,510
Guy,

715
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,220
it's getting late.

716
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:41,930
Let's head into the city.

717
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:43,580
Let's go.

718
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:44,400
Let's go.

719
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,460
Please.

720
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,830
Well, well, well, Reporter Han,

721
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,960
I've heard so much about you.

722
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:05,990
What's my mission?

723
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,190
I need you

724
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:10,350
to get close to Qin Xiaoyi

725
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:11,680
under the pretense of an interview

726
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,760
and steal his pocket watch.

727
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,350
Pocket watch?

728
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:17,960
I found a very important lead.

729
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,920
Qin Xiaoyi's father
was an economic criminal.

730
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:22,940
That pocket watch is his heirloom.

731
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,920
Once we expose his background,

732
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:29,020
he'll be finished.

733
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,840
Don't rush.

734
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:42,080
He's at the theater. He can't get away.

735
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,150
Ms. Hu!

736
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:46,400
Ms. Hu!

737
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,200
Ms. Hu!

738
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:48,920
Ms. Hu.

739
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:51,290
Looks like I wasn't mistaken earlier.

740
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:52,620
You did go to the casino.

741
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:53,880
Ms. Hu,

742
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,480
as a young woman,

743
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,860
it's not really appropriate for you

744
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,680
to keep going to places like that.

745
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,550
Mr. Qian,

746
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,770
in Rongcheng, players can go anywhere.

747
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,830
I understand.

748
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,550
Then let me take you somewhere fun.

749
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:06,210
No thanks, I've got a mission.

750
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:08,489
It's just nearby.

751
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:10,909
When I passed by earlier,

752
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,230
I saw a clothing store.

753
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,719
Actually,

754
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,150
I wanted to tell you this

755
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,760
right after we got off the train.

756
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,190
The outfit you picked

757
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:21,230
is a bit outdated.

758
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,760
But it's okay.

759
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,730
We can get you something else.

760
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,630
Girls like you

761
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:29,280
should wear pretty dresses.

762
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:32,630
I know that store.

763
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,400
But it doesn't sell clothes—

764
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,360
it sells identities.

765
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,630
But a new identity is too expensive.

766
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:37,880
I don't have that money.

767
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,480
Who says we don't have money?

768
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,690
I have plenty.

769
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:43,620
When we entered the game,

770
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,460
Mr. Guangming gave me his props.

771
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:47,440
He's just too kind.

772
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,110
It's just a game,

773
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,710
yet he takes such good care of me.

774
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,320
Someone as reliable as him—

775
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,080
his company is bound to succeed.

776
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:57,250
Wang is in the early stage of his startup.

777
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:59,190
I want to provide all the support I can,

778
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,360
and help him secure

779
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,710
any potential clients.

780
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:04,370
Alright, let's go take a look.

781
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:05,780
This way, Ms. Hu.

782
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:10,700
Welcome.

783
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:14,880
How about this one?

784
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,680
A young lady who studied abroad.

785
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,060
This one's nice.

786
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,280
A nurse.

787
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:25,740
Saving lives and helping the wounded.

788
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,000
This looks good.

789
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,190
When playing this kind of game,

790
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,420
you need to wear clothes like these.

791
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,820
That's what makes it fun,

792
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:36,880
right?

793
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:39,410
Just a moment, Ms. Hu.

794
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,730
Try this one.

795
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,230
Size S.

796
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:45,840
A qipao

797
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,150
is meant to show the curves.

798
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,880
That's what makes it look good.

799
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,760
Mr. Qian.

800
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,630
When I came in just now,

801
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,070
I noticed

802
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:06,280
an indigo suit on that rack.

803
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:07,550
It's just as good as any big brand

804
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:08,750
and really suits you.

805
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:11,360
Why don't you try it on?

806
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,820
If you wear it, you'll totally
outshine all the other players.

807
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,900
Really?

808
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:18,230
Alright, I'll go take a look.

809
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:22,900
All of our suits
are made with the finest fabrics,

810
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,960
and the craftsmanship is excellent.

811
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,010
Ms. Hu,

812
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,330
which suit were you talking about?

813
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:32,120
Ms. Hu?

814
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,670
Ms. Hu?

815
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:08,820
Reporter Han,
what brings you to a movie today?

816
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:16,550
I'm here for an interview.

817
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,730
That's rare.

818
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,320
Rare how?

819
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:22,550
I invited you
to the military office for an interview,

820
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:25,110
but you ignored me for days,
Miss Reporter.

821
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,630
What invitation?

822
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:36,440
It clearly says here that Reporter Han
requested a meeting with Qin Xiaoyi.

823
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,910
When has Qin Xiaoyi
ever been the one to reach out first?

824
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:40,440
Let's start, Reporter Han.

825
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,140
General Qin,

826
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,840
don't you need
to check my press credentials first?

827
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,590
No need.

828
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:51,070
It's pitch-dark in this theater.

829
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:53,320
You can't even see my face clearly,

830
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:55,710
and you're not
confirming my identity either.

831
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,950
Aren't you afraid
I'm using the title of reporter

832
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,360
to do something shady?

833
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,580
I never allow anyone I don't trust

834
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,940
to come near me.

835
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:10,140
As a member of the project team,

836
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:12,190
you should keep a distance from them.

837
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,280
During this project,

838
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,520
it's best to stay away from their people.

839
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,780
The competition for the mayor is fierce.

840
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,590
Aren't you afraid that one day

841
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:21,760
someone close to you
might be bought off by your rivals,

842
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,480
or tricked into
leaking critical information,

843
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,680
ruining everything at the last moment?

844
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,360
So, Mr. Xiao,

845
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,240
you came to the site

846
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,790
because you don't trust me?

847
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,070
No.

848
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,000
Everyone around me is smart.

849
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,280
And she knows

850
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:43,970
who will win in the end.

851
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,630
Reporter Han,
you've finished all your questions.

852
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:56,960
Now I have a few of my own.

853
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,400
Are you and Mr. Miyazaki

854
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,380
very close?

855
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,770
Why are you asking that?

856
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:07,230
I saw you two
sticking together at the city gate.

857
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:08,650
Even between husband and wife,

858
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,220
the husband doesn't always

859
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:11,850
stand on the wife's side—

860
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,630
let alone a fake marriage.

861
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,190
I've known for a long time

862
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,880
that he's not on my side.

863
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,680
Sooner or later, he'll betray me.

864
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,610
So, why do you...

865
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,460
I'm doing this for my friend.

866
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:23,510
My friend has business to discuss

867
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:24,590
with Mr. Miyazaki.

868
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:26,950
Otherwise,
I wouldn't bother dealing with him at all.

869
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:28,800
Your friend needs to rely on him?

870
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:29,710
It seems

871
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,530
his career is doing quite well.

872
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:33,650
I don't know how his career is going,

873
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:34,700
but as a person,

874
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,320
he's just questionable, to say the least.

875
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,480
He doesn't even know what manners are,

876
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:40,660
and he doesn't
follow Rongcheng's rules either.

877
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,880
Don't let me run into him again.

878
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,030
Otherwise, I won't be able to stop myself
from hitting him.

879
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:45,230
Then things will get ugly for everyone.

880
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:45,950
Okay.

881
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:49,240
What?

882
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:52,190
I won't let you run into him.
