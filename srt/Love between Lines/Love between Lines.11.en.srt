[Love Between Lines]

00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,759
[Episode 11]

3
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,040
Develop it further according to the plan

4
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,100
we just discussed.

5
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,210
Sure, Mr. Xiao.

6
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:06,680
Mr. Xiao,

7
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,240
this needs your signature.

8
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:08,800
Okay.

9
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,560
Mr. Xiao,

10
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,150
this proposal needs your confirmation
as well.

11
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:13,590
Sure.

12
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:18,230
The closing period

13
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,560
will be a difficult one.

14
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,170
I'll give everyone a break

15
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,620
after the design competition concludes.

16
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,020
-Thank you, Mr. Xiao.
-Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

17
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,810
I was worried...

18
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,430
that your injured hand

19
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,800
would affect our progress.

20
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,750
I didn't expect you

21
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,310
to be so efficient.

22
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,590
So, Xiaorou,

23
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,360
that slap guy really got fired.

24
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,430
Slap guy?

25
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,970
What a nickname.

26
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,480
Mr. Gong didn't mention this at the store?

27
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,320
He never mentioned it.

28
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,260
He does good deeds without seeking credit.

29
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,350
But Xiaorou,

30
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,420
you're amazing.

31
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,270
If I encountered someone like that,

32
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,530
I'd be scared to death.

33
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,120
Did you tell Guangming about this?

34
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,830
I heard that guy was brought

35
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:09,850
to the club by him.

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,680
I didn't.

37
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,640
Didn't you add him

38
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,170
on WeChat at the karaoke room last time?

39
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,230
Don't you dare tell him either,

40
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,890
or I'll take all of these away.

41
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,550
What is he not supposed to say?

42
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,210
Weren't you supposed
to be back only at night?

43
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,560
That meeting was boring,

44
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,560
so I slipped away.

45
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:31,870
Thanks.

46
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,310
What were you two secretly talking about?

47
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,400
I gave him

48
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,240
the most expensive beans

49
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,120
at no extra charge,

50
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,020
so I told him not to
tell others in the shop.

51
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,020
Yes, Guangming.

52
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,500
I can't say that.

53
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,840
Otherwise I wouldn't get
such perks in the future.

54
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,770
I'm leaving now.

55
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,560
Come around when you're free.

56
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,490
What are you looking at?

57
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,430
There were too many people
at the karaoke that day,

58
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,490
so I didn't notice.

59
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,930
Li Yue is quite handsome.

60
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,680
Well,
he is studying to be an actor after all.

61
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,120
Just because he's handsome,

62
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,720
you switch to the most expensive beans
for him?

63
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:21,930
Why else?

64
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,740
For his acting skills?

65
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,720
What are you thinking?

66
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,080
He's just a kid who hasn't even graduated.

67
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,830
I thought you went to Jinshan—

68
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,830
they don't produce lemons, do they?

69
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,159
Why so sour?

70
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,270
Have some lemons.

71
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,120
What is it?

72
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,360
This is from
the most famous dessert shop in Jinshan.

73
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,310
I brought it back especially for you.

74
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,240
See if it inspires you.

75
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,640
You must've queued for really long!

76
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,490
It's fine.

77
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,860
I can slip away
from the conference

78
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,720
for a few hours.

79
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,070
How is it?

80
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:03,410
It's delicious.

81
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,760
By the way, honey.

82
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,560
Can you come with me next week

83
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,620
to a class reunion?

84
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,890
That's so sudden.

85
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,680
I ran into Cheng Han at the conference.

86
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,510
He said he's been wanting to organize
this reunion for a long time.

87
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,910
He's insisting that I go.

88
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,240
Okay.

89
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:18,840
Great.

90
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,630
Zhan Jie is awake.

91
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,380
I need to get back to the office.

92
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,390
About the reunion,

93
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,520
we have a deal, right?

94
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,180
Be careful.

95
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,680
Just brought this back from abroad.

96
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,880
It's the last bottle.

97
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,550
To have you open up your collection,

98
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,890
looks like the steel order went smoothly.

99
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,350
It's thanks to your help.

100
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,630
But this trip

101
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,640
has brought a bigger reward.

102
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,630
For the past two years,

103
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,830
that steel mill director

104
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,750
you kept asking me about,

105
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,510
I finally got news of him.

106
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:07,800
Unfortunately,

107
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,260
he's no longer around.

108
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,280
According to his daughter,

109
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,800
after the Xincheng Stadium incident,

110
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,070
their steel mill was severely impacted.

111
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,430
It went bankrupt shortly after.

112
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,690
Less than two years after moving abroad,

113
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,750
he passed away

114
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,000
from illness.

115
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,840
No wonder
we couldn't find him all these years.

116
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,640
You've been looking for him all this time—

117
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,870
why?

118
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,850
You don't owe him money, do you?

119
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,270
Uncle Xu.

120
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,360
That consent form
couldn't have been signed by my father.

121
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,560
The stadium collapse wasn't his fault.

122
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,600
Yu.

123
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,950
I worked with your father
for many years.

124
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,800
I also believe

125
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,560
there's something suspicious about him
signing that consent form.

126
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,950
With his professional expertise,

127
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,120
he definitely would have noticed

128
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,780
something's off
with the hardness of the steel.

129
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:05,510
But

130
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,040
the case has been closed for so long now.

131
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,270
That consent form

132
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,430
was indeed signed
by your father's own hand.

133
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,720
What you just said

134
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,230
has no evidence to back it up.

135
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,590
I'll definitely find it.

136
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,800
Help me look for the people

137
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,200
who worked with him.

138
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,360
Some things

139
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,560
must be thoroughly investigated.

140
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,220
Mr. Xiao.

141
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,340
Why did you leave the company first?

142
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,870
Are you already home?

143
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,310
No,

144
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,380
I'm at a bar.

145
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,260
Take the car back after you finish work.

146
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:53,750
The doctor said you shouldn't drink
while your injury is still healing.

147
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,220
I already...

148
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,140
Old Mr. Li that lives in the lane

149
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,380
also had a fracture before.

150
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,140
He didn't listen to the doctor

151
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:58,950
and drank,

152
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,480
so his condition got worse.

153
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,550
I got it.

154
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,010
No, thanks.

155
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,270
Mr. Xiao.

156
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:34,950
Mr. Xiao?

157
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:45,070
I brought you something.

158
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:45,750
What is it?

159
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,390
You can't eat seafood
if your hand is injured.

160
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,580
So I brought you a substitute.

161
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,860
Crab shell pastries.

162
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,920
You don't know what crab shell pastries are?

163
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,910
Green onion, seaweed,

164
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,340
sugar, and red bean.

165
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,830
See which flavor you like.

166
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,760
Can you tell them apart?

167
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,220
I think...

168
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,270
I can't.

169
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,220
I prepared a gift for you too.

170
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,590
One final revision.

171
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,560
You always say "final revision."

172
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,670
What's going on?

173
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:38,790
Mr. Wang!

174
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,920
You're always so loud?

175
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,270
What about it?

176
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,360
The power keeps going out.

177
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,230
At this frequency,

178
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,700
there must be a problem
with the circuit itself.

179
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,900
Let's go check it out.

180
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,550
Hu, you're here!

181
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,100
Can you help us take a look?

182
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,340
Didn't you study architecture in college?

183
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,980
You must know electricity.

184
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,700
Actually...

185
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,460
-Yeah.
-I...

186
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,100
Hu,

187
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,070
you're a professional.

188
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,620
Please help us.

189
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,580
I need to follow along
with the TV to learn

190
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,610
the Jia Mu Si Aerobics.

191
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:12,250
Exactly.

192
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,620
Okay, I'll try.

193
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,240
Let me do it.

194
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,020
No need.

195
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,010
I can handle it.

196
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,250
I'll try.

197
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,670
Um...

198
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,800
What's happening?

199
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,740
-What happened?
-What's wrong?

200
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,820
-Why is it out again?
-It's out again.

201
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,340
These are all tight.

202
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,190
Well...

203
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,790
Are you sure
as someone who studied architecture,

204
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,520
you also understand circuits?

205
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,950
Of course.
I even have an electrician's license.

206
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,980
Don't question
your landlord if you can't help.

207
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,100
I wouldn't dare. Take your time, landlord.

208
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:46,700
Everyone's got some certificate
these days.

209
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,340
Here. The insulation is broken.

210
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,790
It's probably a short circuit.

211
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,740
That's our Hu for you. So professional.

212
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,270
She finds out the problems so quickly.

213
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,340
What should we do now?

214
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,340
Do we still need to find a repairman?

215
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,950
I already called the building manager.

216
00:10:58,950 --> 00:10:59,740
They said

217
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,140
the technician won't come until tomorrow.

218
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,030
I thought you were

219
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,620
on good terms with the manager.

220
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,620
Why can't you get them to come today?

221
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,390
Fine.

222
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:08,880
Well,

223
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,460
does anyone have insulated gloves?

224
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,270
I can wear the gloves,

225
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,030
wrap it up with electrical tape,

226
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,860
and then cover it with a plastic bag
as a temporary fix.

227
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,670
We can wait for the technician tomorrow.

228
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:17,860
I have them. I'll go get them.

229
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,150
Okay. Go get it.

230
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,790
Hurry up!

231
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:21,430
Hu Xiu.

232
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,880
I think the problem is here.

233
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:27,070
The wiring looks fine.

234
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,580
The insulation is peeling off.

235
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,100
The covering is damaged,

236
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,070
but it's minor,

237
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:33,070
not enough to cause a short circuit.

238
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:34,550
This part isn't damaged at all,

239
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:37,340
all the more it wouldn't have caused
the short circuit.

240
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,340
I got them!

241
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,620
The gloves are here.

242
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,100
Thank you.

243
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,460
-Here's the tape.
-Let me try.

244
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,550
You stew meat every single day,

245
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,070
causing the short circuits,

246
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,800
but have all the things needed.

247
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,740
Why isn't it working yet?

248
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,820
What's going on?

249
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,910
Let me check again.

250
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,110
This cable is fine.

251
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,460
It's back.

252
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:20,790
Great.

253
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:23,120
We have to count on young people
nowadays.

254
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,700
Thank you.

255
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,740
You're welcome.

256
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:27,790
I'll go back to my class now,

257
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,150
my Jia Mu Si Aerobics.

258
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,950
Young people are really something.

259
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:32,500
Mr. Xiao.

260
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,790
Your hand is healed?

261
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,100
Hey.

262
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,100
Don't.

263
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:00,550
Don't.

264
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,550
Please, don't.

265
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,180
If you push harder,
my old injury will flare up.

266
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:09,450
Look,

267
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,840
I think some of my strength is back now.

268
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,700
Stop pretending.

269
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,270
You're completely healed.

270
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,640
Yet you're still ordering me around.

271
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,700
How can you call that ordering you around?

272
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,500
I drive and wash the car.

273
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,980
I serve you in the day

274
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,740
and work overtime drawing plans at night.

275
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,910
These are all because of
your injured hand.

276
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,790
Fine, it's not ordering me around—

277
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,190
it's playing the victim.

278
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,310
Playing the victim is one thing.

279
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,310
Your hand was injured

280
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,510
and that was my fault,

281
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:42,410
but isn't it too much to hide that
you've recovered?

282
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:43,550
It is.

283
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,070
So,

284
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,740
who's driving tomorrow, you or me?

285
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:50,740
Me.

286
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:53,980
Then,

287
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,790
who's drawing these plans, you or me?

288
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:56,430
You.

289
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,460
After all,

290
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,520
you're improving.

291
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,620
Indeed.

292
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,720
There's improvement.

293
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,150
So sudden?

294
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:51,950
Regard Café

295
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,210
hasn't launched a new cake in a while now.

296
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,640
I just suddenly got inspired.

297
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,270
Hu Xiu.

298
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,720
Mr. Xiao is looking for you.

299
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,590
Wh-What happened?

300
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,290
I can't say much.

301
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:11,040
You'll know when you get there.

302
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:12,070
Anyway,

303
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,550
good luck.

304
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,030
Mr. Xiao.

305
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,340
Come in.

306
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:48,670
Mr. Xiao.

307
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:51,310
I-I was only slacking off
for a little while just now.

308
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:54,310
I was working hard
on the drawings the rest of the time.

309
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,800
It's not about that?

310
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,390
Then...

311
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:03,460
It's because I sneaked a bun

312
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,070
in your car

313
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:07,310
before you came down in the morning?

314
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:10,990
I opened the window
for ventilation immediately.

315
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,800
What did Sun Yifei tell you?

316
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,580
Nothing much.

317
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,840
He just told me good luck.

318
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,390
You thought I'd retaliate?

319
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:25,570
Mr. Xiao, you're not that kind of person.

320
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,500
So...

321
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,740
why did you call me in?

322
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,390
I discussed with Ms. Zhou
and several designers,

323
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,450
and we decided that

324
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,810
for the Lemon project,

325
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,390
we'll give you a designer credit.

326
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,030
Of course,
your name will be at the very end.

327
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,160
Can you accept that?

328
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,190
Yes,

329
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,250
of course I can.

330
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:44,820
Everyone did more work than I did.

331
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,340
I'm just the one enjoying the shade
under the tree.

332
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:47,940
All right,

333
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,530
that's all. You can go now.

334
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:51,330
Th-That's it?

335
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:52,990
What else?

336
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,790
Thank you, Mr. Xiao.
I shall take my leave.

337
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,530
Anything else?

338
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,030
Mr. Xiao,

339
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:05,089
will you be home tomorrow afternoon?

340
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,420
I want to treat you to a meal.

341
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,349
I heard the new restaurant
at the lane entrance

342
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:11,260
is quite good.

343
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,540
You're being nice for no good reason.

344
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,430
I'm just showing my gratitude.

345
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,430
Look at you.

346
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,260
Your hand got hurt because of me.

347
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:21,020
But you didn't deduct my money
and shared the rent with me.

348
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,500
Now you're allowing me
to hitch your ride to work,

349
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,099
and now you're giving me credit
on the project.

350
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,210
When you put it that way,

351
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:31,900
indeed,

352
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,380
I should accept this meal.

353
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:35,390
Send me the address.

354
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,120
What time tomorrow afternoon?

355
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,220
As for the time,

356
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,420
I haven't set one yet.

357
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:42,190
Mr. Xiao,

358
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,910
tomorrow is Saturday anyway.

359
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,190
If you're home,

360
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:45,870
you can come down

361
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,070
after I holler at you.

362
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,000
I might not be at home then.

363
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,910
You're either in the lane
or at the company.

364
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,300
At most, you might work part-time
at the murder mystery game place.

365
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,630
Where else would you go?

366
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,110
What I mean is,

367
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,390
just wait for my message.

368
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,650
So it's settled, okay?

369
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,500
You're done with your drawing?

370
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,060
I came to bring you this.

371
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,150
The attic space is limited.

372
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,390
Given how one would go in and out,

373
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,830
this is your path to the bed

374
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,510
and where you're most likely
to hit your head.

375
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:47,000
With something this eye-catching here,

376
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,060
you'll definitely notice it, right?

377
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:52,460
Mr. Xiao,

378
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,560
you need to protect that head of yours

379
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,610
or how else are we going to win?

380
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:08,590
[Aunt]

381
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,220
Auntie.

382
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,630
Xiu,

383
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:12,690
have you been busy?

384
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,020
Not too bad.

385
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,740
What's up? Why the sudden call?

386
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,980
Did your dad tell you

387
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,390
about the blind date?

388
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,230
He mentioned it.

389
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,780
Tomorrow is Saturday.

390
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:22,980
That young man

391
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,630
wants to meet you.

392
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,350
Where should you meet?

393
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,910
Best if it's afternoon,

394
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,020
so you can have dinner together.

395
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,740
Auntie, I've told my dad about this.

396
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,000
Let's forget it.

397
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,700
You told him that?

398
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,060
Your father didn't mention it to me.

399
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:44,590
Look,

400
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,950
how am I supposed to
explain this to them now?

401
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:47,700
No.

402
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,620
I have to talk to your father.

403
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,270
Auntie,

404
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:51,960
don't bother my dad.

405
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,430
He's probably stressed out lately.

406
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,590
Forget it. Send me that guy's WeChat.

407
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,260
Don't be late, then.

408
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,540
I know.

409
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,780
I'll be there on time.

410
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:02,700
Okay.

411
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,220
Xiao.

412
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,630
Want to pick up a shift tomorrow?

413
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,740
It's been a while.

414
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,470
I'm not free.

415
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,670
Why? Got a date?

416
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:27,870
I did,

417
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,910
but now it's probably canceled.

418
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,020
So you got stood up?

419
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,060
What kind of client

420
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,260
would dare to do that?

421
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:36,210
Anyway, come over if you're free.

422
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,140
Forget it.

423
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,880
Haha! Idiot! Idiot

424
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:43,630
Haha! Idiot! Idiot

425
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,280
Haha! Idiot! Idiot

426
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,110
Haha! Idiot! Idiot

427
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,740
Haha! Idiot! Idiot

428
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:52,220
Haha! Idiot! Idiot

429
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,220
Haha! Idiot! Idiot

430
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,880
Haha! Idiot! Idiot

431
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,220
Mr. Xiao,

432
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,190
is your head okay?

433
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:01,930
Haha! Idiot! Idiot

434
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:02,870
Shut up!

435
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:03,950
Haha! Idiot! Idiot

436
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,720
Haha! Idiot! Idiot

437
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,200
Haha! Idiot! Idiot

438
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,620
Haha! Idiot! Idiot

439
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:11,670
Mr. Xiao,

440
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:14,250
twist its ears
and it will stop laughing at you.

441
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,920
Haha! Idiot! Idiot

442
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,570
Haha! Id—

443
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,460
I'm waiting for you.

444
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:18,020
You...

445
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,110
Well,

446
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,060
I can only go out when you get there.

447
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,830
I don't even dare to face him now.

448
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:37,030
I'm afraid he'll ask when I'm going out.

449
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:39,640
So can you give me a definite time

450
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,160
you'll get there.

451
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,670
I finished my work ages ago.

452
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:44,630
It's the delivery guy
who hasn't shown up yet.

453
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,030
I've already rushed him.

454
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:46,870
Zhao.

455
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:49,060
If you want to start this new business,

456
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,540
you need more practice.

457
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:53,080
That's why I'm using you for practice.

458
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,390
My husband who's been missing all morning

459
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:02,150
has finally replied to my message.

460
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,060
He's so busy?

461
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:05,360
Yes, we never see each other these days.

462
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,110
We're almost like roommates now
instead of spouses.

463
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:07,700
I'll get cracking.

464
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,590
I've got to go.

465
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:12,540
Your coffee.

466
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:13,670
This isn't mine.

467
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:14,630
I'll order now.

468
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:15,870
Mr. Pei.

469
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:16,770
I'm sorry.

470
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,440
Good afternoon, Ms. Zhao.

471
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,300
Mr. Pei, what would you like to have?

472
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,950
I'll have an iced Americano.

473
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:24,950
Sure.

474
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:28,430
Your place has quite a unique decor.

475
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:29,870
Yes.

476
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:35,350
Mr. Pei,
you didn't come in to get a coffee

477
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:37,190
because you just happened to pass by,
did you?

478
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,910
I had some business
around this industrial park.

479
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,260
You mentioned in your WeChat

480
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,590
that you opened a café here,

481
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,920
so I thought I'd drop by.

482
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:44,890
Oh, and congratulations.

483
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,080
I heard the car issue was resolved.

484
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:50,040
Thank you so much for your help last time.

485
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,390
Is your car fixed?

486
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,740
And has the insurance claim
been processed?

487
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,430
It's fixed.

488
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,740
That's good.

489
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,150
I'll make your coffee first.

490
00:23:59,150 --> 00:23:59,540
Go ahead.

491
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,070
Okay, please wait a moment.

492
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:07,190
I just heard you on the phone.

493
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,700
You're already married?

494
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,430
I got married right after college.

495
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,150
That's quite rare.

496
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,780
Most young people nowadays

497
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,240
don't want to marry early.

498
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:18,910
Like Ms. Hu.

499
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:21,350
She's probably part of that majority.

500
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,150
Xiu?

501
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:24,590
She's single.

502
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,390
Boss,

503
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,520
you have a delivery order for cake?

504
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:30,870
You're finally here.

505
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,460
No. 27, Lane 9, Yanhua Road.

506
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,460
Hu Xiu, right?

507
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:35,670
Yes, that's right. It's over there.

508
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,190
Here,

509
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:37,740
this is it.

510
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,430
[Thank you, Mr. Xiao.]

511
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,060
Take it carefully.

512
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:42,670
Thanks.

513
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,150
Go to No. 27, Lane 9, Yanhua Road.

514
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:27,190
Mr. Xiao,

515
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,060
could you send me that rendering

516
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,590
you took for optimization last time?

517
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:31,990
It's on my work computer.

518
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:33,110
That's fine.

519
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:33,830
Give it to me on Monday.

520
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:35,230
I can go to the office now.

521
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,230
Leaving without saying anything.

522
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,180
How rude.

523
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:04,720
Young man,

524
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,450
heading out?

525
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:06,500
Yes.

526
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:10,550
I'm free.

527
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,260
Go ahead.

528
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,350
Why is he here?

529
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,150
Hello, Ms. Hu.

530
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,700
I'm not sure which building it is.

531
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,150
Well,

532
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,540
do you see number 27?

533
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:27,060
It's here.

534
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:27,630
I see it.

535
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,980
Go up to the second floor
using these stairs.

536
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:29,830
Okay.

537
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:42,670
Your cake.

538
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:43,270
Thank you.

539
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:52,150
Mr. Xiao,

540
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:54,110
we can get ready to leave now.

541
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:58,870
Mr. Xiao?

542
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:05,350
Mr. Xiao?

543
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:08,670
Mr. Xiao?

544
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:10,670
I'm coming in.

545
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,060
Mr. Xiao.

546
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:22,910
He's not here?

547
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,830
Sorry,
the subscriber you dialed is busy now.

548
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:29,970
Please try—

549
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,060
How rude.

550
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,910
I was just a little late.

551
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,670
Tell me,

552
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:47,430
if a man and woman
aren't in a relationship,

553
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,630
but live together,

554
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,420
what could be the reason?

555
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,270
It's actually quite common.

556
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,990
They could be roommates.

557
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,020
However,

558
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,390
if we're talking about Xiao Zhiyu,

559
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:02,120
that possibility is ruled out.

560
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,300
He's likely pursuing
his female subordinate.

561
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,500
Go check

562
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,870
if he lives here,

563
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,220
and if so,

564
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,540
when he moved in.

565
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:16,110
Okay.

566
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:34,060
Sorry,
the subscriber you dialed is powered off.

567
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,390
Please try again later. Sorry—

568
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:38,670
Never mind.

569
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:39,500
I was planning

570
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,260
to treat you to a nice meal.

571
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,830
I'll just eat by myself.

572
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:08,540
Mr. Xiao.

573
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,720
What a coincidence.

574
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:14,480
How convenient for you.

575
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,430
You don't even bother
looking for another location.

576
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:19,070
Your date didn't show up?

577
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,970
What are you talking about?

578
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,020
Mr. Xiao, I admit

579
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,150
I left a bit late today.

580
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:25,010
It was my fault.

581
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,150
But that's no reason to stand me up.

582
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,460
If you had something to do, fine,

583
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,870
but you're already eating here.

584
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:31,930
What's this about?

585
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,610
You have the nerve to blame me?

586
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:36,730
Weren't you meeting some blind date?

587
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:45,700
Mr. Xiao,

588
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,980
eavesdropping on others' conversations

589
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,390
isn't a good habit.

590
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,980
That was a shared area.

591
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:54,060
Besides,

592
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,150
you were the one
who put it on loudspeaker.

593
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:57,280
You said things like

594
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:00,400
you couldn't get out
of a blind date set up by relatives.

595
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,460
I understand.

596
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:02,980
I had things to do this afternoon too.

597
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,110
I went to the office.

598
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:09,870
But shouldn't you

599
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:11,200
have told me in advance?

600
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:13,460
I didn't tell you in advance

601
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,320
because I wanted to surprise you.

602
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,430
Surprise me?

603
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,960
It's quite a surprise.

604
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:32,540
Stop looking.

605
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,200
The blind date didn't show up.

606
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,040
Auntie,

607
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,700
don't bother my dad.

608
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:41,150
He's probably stressed out lately.

609
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,730
Forget it. Send me that guy's WeChat.

610
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:46,780
Also,

611
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,980
next month
is our baby's first birthday party.

612
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,220
I've sent you the address.

613
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,920
Don't run off to work overtime again

614
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,020
like you did last time
at the full-month celebration.

615
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,220
Okay, I'll definitely be there on time.

616
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:03,780
Hello.

617
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:04,950
I'm Hu Xiu.

618
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:07,020
Aunt Xiuying introduced me.

619
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,350
I'm sorry,

620
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:09,890
I can't meet you tomorrow.

621
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,700
But in the afternoon,

622
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:15,300
weren't you waiting for someone
to pick you up?

623
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:17,540
I was waiting for the delivery guy.

624
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:19,260
My friend is mainly a barista.

625
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,060
She doesn't usually make desserts.

626
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,590
The ingredients will only arrive at noon.

627
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,110
She's not sure when she'll finish.

628
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,910
I'm not sure when I can leave.

629
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:29,290
So it turned
into this whole misunderstanding.

630
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:40,420
Waiter.

631
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,830
Take a look
and see what you'd like to eat.

632
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:50,950
This one,

633
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,740
this and this.

634
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:53,550
I'll have all of these.

635
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,180
Thank you.

636
00:31:59,190 --> 00:31:59,830
Mr. Xiao,

637
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,830
can I ask you something?

638
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:02,740
Go ahead.

639
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,700
If you suspected I was standing you up,

640
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:08,460
why didn't you confirm with me beforehand?

641
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,430
There was nothing to confirm.

642
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:14,500
I'm not that free.

643
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:17,220
You thought

644
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,830
I stood you up,

645
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:20,890
yet you still sat here and had dinner.

646
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:29,950
Mr. Xiao,

647
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,670
you actually
wanted to have this meal too, didn't you?

648
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:35,870
But you were too embarrassed to show it,

649
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:38,540
so you didn't contact me first.

650
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,020
That's right.

651
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,350
It's rare for this somebody
to treat me to a meal.

652
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,910
If I seemed too eager,

653
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:47,480
I was afraid she'd think

654
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,060
her boss is taking advantage

655
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,660
and trying to get a free meal.

656
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,110
Excuse me.

657
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,030
Don't worry.

658
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,950
This meal

659
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:03,390
is to thank you.

660
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:04,980
Whatever you say goes.

661
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,300
Do we eat the cake now?

662
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,190
What else?

663
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,590
If we eat dinner first,

664
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:15,120
we won't have room for cake.

665
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:22,720
No need for the candles.

666
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,240
How can you make wishes without candles?

667
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,030
Mr. Xiao,

668
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:29,630
don't you have anything special

669
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:31,800
you absolutely want to come true?

670
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:46,150
Then I'll go ahead.

671
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,230
My first wish:

672
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:51,080
I hope we don't have to revise
the drawings again.

673
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,290
My second wish:

674
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:56,300
I hope the design competition

675
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:59,220
will be successful and go smoothly.

676
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,300
My third wish...

677
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:18,100
Why don't you make a wish?

678
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:21,440
What wish did you make?

679
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,350
I'm not telling you.

680
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:24,949
It won't come true if I say it.

681
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:27,710
Never mind.

682
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:30,639
If you're not making a wish,
just blow out the candle.

683
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:58,690
♪ Under the streetlight,
I grow increasingly weary ♪

684

are you seeing my parents?

698
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:40,700

how will you fulfill your third wish?

705
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,660
It's Saturday today.

706
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:53,810

only when we resolve our internal issues,

713
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:06,350

I'll take a taxi.

721
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:23,540
I'm going now.

722
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,100
Go ahead.

723
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,270
Xiu!

724
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,020
Mom.

725
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:39,350
Why are you here?

726
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:42,020
Come in, come in.

727
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:50,430
Your father and I

728
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:52,020
were planning to
bring you some food tomorrow.

729
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,270
I was about to text you

730
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:54,330
when you showed up.

731
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:58,200
I'll pack up some dishes from the kitchen.

732
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:17,540
Dad,

733
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:20,100
last time you came to see me,

734
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,310
you went down and came back up—

735
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:25,390
what did you want to tell me?

736
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:27,980
Your aunt's little baby

737
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,840
is having a first birthday party.

738
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:35,910
You didn't come all this way

739
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:37,640
just to ask about that, did you?

740
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:38,660
No.

741
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,830
I have good news to share

742
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:45,430
with you both.

743
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,410
Our firm

744
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,770
is currently working on

745
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:51,310
a design competition for a hotel project.

746
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,750
It's quite a big project.

747
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:54,810
When it concludes,

748
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,110
I'll be credited

749
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:58,210
as the designer.

750
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:06,980
Then you must win.

751
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:18,880
Dad.

752
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:19,870
Xiu.

753
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,100
Ever since

754
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,140
I injured this leg

755
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:31,870
of mine,

756
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,590
I've always thought

757
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,750
that in this life,

758
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,350
I won't be able to walk properly anymore.

759
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,350
But I never expected

760
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,670
that I would end up holding you back...

761
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:54,790
Holding you back

762
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:57,800
from taking the path you wanted to.

763
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:00,540
Dad, I...

764
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:02,870
All right, all right.

765
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:03,910
Let's not talk about it anymore.

766
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:06,230
Take these dishes back with you

767
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:07,830
and head home early.

768
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,710
Let me know when you win

769
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,700
the project.

770
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:14,660
Dad, I've barely sat down

771
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,620
and you're already sending me away?

772
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,580
That's because if you don't leave soon,

773
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:21,180
your father
won't be able to hold back anymore.

774
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,620
Before I came, my boss told me

775
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:28,830
it's Saturday today
and I don't have to work tomorrow.

776
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:30,390
It's the perfect time to visit you both.

777
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:31,430
What does that mean?

778
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:32,580
It means

779
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:36,040
I can cry, make a scene,
or even threaten dramatically.

780
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,230
If it's not resolved,
we can keep talking.

781
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:39,890
It's okay if we get emotional.

782
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,140
I don't have work tomorrow anyway,

783
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:43,540
so I have a whole day
to process everything.

784
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:45,870
But,

785
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:47,830
he probably doesn't know

786
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,710
that my parents are

787
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,500
the most reasonable people

788
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,790
in the world.

789
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:53,910
They understand

790
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:55,720
everything right away.

791
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:01,420
Your boss seems quite interesting though.

792
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:02,870
I didn't embarrass myself

793
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:04,530
when I met him last time, did I?

794
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:05,910
No.

795
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:06,820
Wait, wait.

796
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:07,530
Speaking of

797
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,540
your boss,

798
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:11,660
there are many people

799
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,500
who rent instead of buying
when they're starting

800
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,140
their businesses.

801
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:14,870
But

802
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,160
to be living in that

803
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,350
rundown attic

804
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:18,500
is really unusual.

805
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:20,950
Is he reliable?

806
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:22,580
Of course he is.

807
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,980
This guy,

808
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:27,060
at first glance,

809
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:29,060
his personality may seem ordinary.

810
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:31,390
But after spending time with him,
you'll find

811
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:33,790
he's actually quite easy
to get along with.

812
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:36,230
He's kinda similar

813
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:38,020
