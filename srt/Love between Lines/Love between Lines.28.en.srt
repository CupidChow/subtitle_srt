00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,690
[Episode 28]

3
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,300
The weather is nice today.

4
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,380
Perfect for a date.

5
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,490
But...

6
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,960
I still need to find inspiration.

7
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:10,880
Let's go.

8
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,210
I'll take you to a place.

9
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,380
My mom and I have decided

10
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,920
to leave next Wednesday.

11
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,190
So soon?

12
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,520
There are some houses there

13
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,920
and paperwork to handle.

14
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,730
I might need to stay longer than planned.

15
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,310
During this time,

16
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:35,780
move back to my place.

17
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,630
It's convenient for going to work.

18
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,290
And I'll leave the car for you.

19
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:41,590
Besides,

20
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,680
I'll feel better knowing my plants

21
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,000
are in your hands.

22
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,079
Also,

23
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,870
that way, when I get back,

24
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,530
I'll get to see you right away.

25
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,340
So I'm your free gardener now?

26
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,430
Alright.

27
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,390
For the sake of

28
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,770
the big house,

29
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,740
I'll reluctantly say yes.

30
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,410
Then it's settled.

31
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,290
Will you miss me?

32
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,600
Probably not.

33
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,140
After all, I'll have

34
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,310
a king size bed

35
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,360
all to myself.

36
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,600
Then promise
you won't secretly move out again,

37
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,160
okay?

38
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,610
That depends on your behavior.

39
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,870
If you dare

40
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,800
hit on some blonde beauty over there...

41
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,870
Speaking of that,
I just remembered something.

42
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,560
My mom said

43
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,560
there's a very friendly...

44
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,920
70-year-old Cuban man
living next to our new home.

45
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,480
Then you'd better let him teach you

46
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,409
the salsa dance.

47
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,000
Salsa?

48
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,159
It's a...

49
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,680
very passionate dance.

50
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,530
Can you dance?

51
00:04:58,530 --> 00:04:59,330
Show me.

52
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,390
Like this.

53
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,480

I've always been thinking about designing.

109
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,630
Do you want to hear about it?

110
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,120
Sure.

111
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,120
These are different areas
of the cultural center.

112
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,310
This is a café.

113
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,560
This is a bookstore.

114
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,620
This is the lounge.

115
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,480
I want to fill this place with trees

116
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,410
to create a tropical natural vibe,

117
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,830
turning the building

118
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,680
into an urban oasis.

119
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:24,480
Here.

120
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,870
Let me use your hand for a sec.

121
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,750
This

122
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,549
is the exterior wall.

123
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:37,450
But the wall can't be too high.

124
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,870
That way,

125
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,880
the whole visual field stays open,

126
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,320
and people

127
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,440
can still feel close to nature

128
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,390
inside the building.

129
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,750
Why don't you use your own hand?

130
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,750
Yours is bigger,

131
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,150
and the proportions are perfect.

132
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,680
It's perfect
for modeling the exterior wall.

133
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,630
Fine,

134
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,630
Ms. Designer Hu.

135
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,200
Where else

136
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,360
can I be of service?

137
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,720
Let me see.

138
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,790
This is the jogging path
next to the leisure center.

139
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,510
Going further up,

140
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,920
I remember there's an overpass.

141
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,720
Going up the overpass,

142
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,800
you can see

143
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,870
the city's utility network
that runs everywhere.

144
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,030
Turn left ahead.

145
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,840
There's a lake.

146
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,510
And an... ecological floating island.

147
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:45,510
Perfect.

148
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,440
Don't frown.

149
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,040
You're affecting the flatness
of the terrain.

150
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,150
Geological movement detected.

151
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Ms. Designer Hu,

152
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,670
can you add

153
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,690
a seismic isolation bearing?

154
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,080
Sure, no problem.

155
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,120
Installation complete.

156
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,370
Isn't your flight tonight?

157
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,000
Why are you going back so soon?

158
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,600
I'm going back to pack first.

159
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,920
Then I'll head straight to the airport.

160
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,150
You'll have to handle things here alone.

161
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:05,670
Don't worry.

162
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,600
I'll keep you updated

163
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,200

So this is why

200
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,140
he rushed back.

201
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,550
I thought that since Xiao Zhiyu left,

202
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,840
we'd get to see each other more.

203
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,650
But he's been gone a week already...

204
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,080
It's half a month.

205
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,550
Fine.

206
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,840
He's been gone for half a month,

207
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,360
and we haven't met once.

208
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,120
Well, I've been busy.

209
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,230
This proposal is really important to me.

210
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,230
I have to win it.

211
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,870
Alright, you go ahead with your work.

212
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,790
I'll keep checking out
new store locations.

213
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,120
Are you okay on your own?

214
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,870
I'll come join you
after I finish with the proposal.

215
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:22,930
Who said I'm alone?

216
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,400
I'm hanging up now. Bye.

217
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,190
That store we just saw was great.

218
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,030
It's spacious.

219
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,750
You could run murder mystery games

220
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,810
of any scale there.

221
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,360
Plus,

222
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,480
if you sign today,

223
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,340
you'll get one month's rent free.

224
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:43,490
But...

225
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,910
Most importantly,

226
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:45,440
it's just

227
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,030
a few steps from the store

228
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,120
your girlfriend likes.

229
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,240
Super convenient.

230
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:49,930
You...

231
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:50,910
Well...

232
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,240
My boyfriend

233
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,080
is a businessman,

234
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,150
not a philanthropist,

235
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,000
right?

236
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,620
The space in that store

237
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,630
is quite large,

238
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,550
but the location is too out of the way.

239
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,670
There isn't much foot traffic there.

240
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,550
It's obviously a place
that's hard to lease out.

241
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,950
There's no way
we'll take it at a high price.

242
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:06,600
Well...

243
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,150
Yes.

244
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,500
I'll listen to you.

245
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,200
How about this?

246
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,120
Let's check with other agents

247
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,080
and compare the options.

248
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,320
Okay.

249
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,550
Let's think it over some more.

250
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:14,960
Sorry.

251
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,550
Wait, wait.

252
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,390
Sir, ma'am.

253
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:16,840
I...

254
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:17,790
Excuse me.

255
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,150
Is it

256
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,150
about the price?

257
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,440
The price is negotiable.

258
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,270
Really.

259
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,150
Thanks to your quick reaction earlier,

260
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,480
we got such a good price.

261
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,120
Money shouldn't be wasted.

262
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,580
Every penny saved counts.

263
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,650
Yes.

264
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,440
Did Xiao Zhiyu

265
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,480
really leave

266
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,480
everything to you with this new store

267
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,750
and stay completely out of it?

268
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,390
I just want to try

269
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,960
doing it on my own this time.

270
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,390
I just didn't expect us

271
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,850
to end up neighbors again.

272
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,080
Honestly,

273
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,870
I had my own selfish reasons

274
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,730
for helping you bargain just now.

275
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,320
I'm used to being neighbors with you,

276
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,050
and I don't want that to change.

277
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:06,240
It's actually nice.

278
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,550
Besides,

279
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,440
you're a big client of mine.

280
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:20,750
So when are you signing the contract?

281
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,240
Why?

282
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,920
I'll go with you.

283
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:24,829
This time,

284
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,550
I plan to focus more

285
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,280
on experience and perception,

286
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,480
rather than sticking to the earlier idea

287
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,310
of ecological
and architectural coexistence.

288
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,640
Instead, the buildings

289
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,640
grow out of the oasis themselves.

290
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,510
So this design balances coverage

291
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,880
with residents' needs
for natural activity spaces.

292
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,940
The research results were positive.

293
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,950
Let's take a short break.

294
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:48,920
About the greenery,

295
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,590
do you have

296
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,250
any other design options

297
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,270
or alternative plans?

298
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,590
Wait for me.

299
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:58,990
Do you want some?

300
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,680
Ms. Zhou.

301
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,160
Take a break.

302
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:34,350
Even in the final stretch,
you need to take care of your health.

303
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,200
It's fine.

304
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,480
I'll summarize their feedback

305
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,070
and make adjustments right away.

306
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:38,880
Don't be so nervous.

307
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,200
You've already done a great job.

308
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,480
Just present it like this

309
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,270
when you meet the client.

310
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,070
It'll be fine.

311
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:47,140
Come on,
let's go outside and get some air.

312
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,550
Oh right, what is this?

313
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,080
The designers' group chat.

314
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,640
Why am I not in it?

315
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,110
Everyone, come.

316
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,640
This is a treat
from Mr. Xiao for our hard work.

317
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,310
Mr. Xiao is so thoughtful.

318
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:11,190
He's all the way in the US
and still thinking of us.

319
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,360
Share them around.

320
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,200
Take a look.

321
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:17,920
We've received your warm gesture,
Mr. Xiao.

322
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,110
Everyone is happy.

323
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,680
But it's already this late.

324
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,140
Why aren't you asleep yet?

325
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:26,480
Soon.

326
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:28,610
Before I go to sleep,

327
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:30,010
do you have 3 words to say?

328
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:41,850
Just sleep early.

329
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,400
I also have 3 words to say.

330
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,030
They're on the little cake I got for you,

331
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:51,590
the one in the pink box.

332
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,640
Look, I got a pink one.

333
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,070
Look.

334
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,470
Sun!

335
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,100
Sun! Don't eat that!

336
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,290
Why? Is it poisoned?

337
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,440
Can you take another one?

338
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,400
I want this one.

339
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,400
What's the difference anyway?

340
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,730
What's the difference?

341
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:08,820
I like pink.

342
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,440
Fine, you can have it.

343
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,680
You can have this.

344
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,310
This one's good too.

345
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,400
Give me this one. Yes.

346
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,200
This one.

347
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:16,830
And this one.

348
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,270
Can you get it for me?

349
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,000
Get it for me.

350
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,880
What flavor is this?

351
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,640
Let's take a photo together.

352
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,720
Yes, let's take a photo.

353
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,310
Send it to Mr. Xiao.

354
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,030

Let's take a photo.

357
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:24,830
Okay.

358
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,110
It's recording.

359
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,200
Let's say something to Mr. Xiao.

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,000
So cool!

376
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,400
-Thank you, Mr. Xiao.
-Thanks, Mr. Xiao.

377
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,240
Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

378
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,030
Mr. Xiao,

379
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:48,440
we're all working really hard.

380
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,750
Please take care of yourself, Mr. Xiao.

381
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,880
Work hard, eat well.

382
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,830
We've received the treats.

383
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,070
Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

384
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,730
How about one more?

385
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,480
Go to sleep.

386
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,550
Don't you need to confirm the design plan

387
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:16,010
with the client tomorrow?

388
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,510
I can't sleep.

389
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,680
The bed is too big.

390
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,480
When I left,

391
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,540
didn't you say the bed was just right?

392
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,960
That's because you were holding me.

393
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,680
Now,

394
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,940
half of it is empty.

395
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:39,480
Xiao Zhiyu,

396
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,190
I was wrong.

397
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,030
What?

398
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,550
Is there a problem with the design plan?

399
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,960
When I said before

400
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,910
that I wouldn't miss you,

401
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,810
I was just pretending to be strong.

402
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,610
When we are watching movies
and variety shows together,

403
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,590
I don't even want to skip the end credits.

404
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,110
On my way home from work,
passing a convenience store,

405
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,880
I instinctively

406
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,310
grab the mint candies you like.

407
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:13,640
Even when the weather forecast says
there'll be rain tomorrow,

408
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,080
I want to remind you to take an umbrella.

409
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,160
Xiao Zhiyu,

410
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,670
I think I seriously underestimated

411
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,400
how much space you take up in my life.

412
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,960
Even now,

413
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:38,090
being able to look at you like this,

414
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,590
I still miss you.

415
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,450
Go to the study.

416
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:47,830
The desk.

417
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,400
The drawer on the far left.

418
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,160
Open it.

419
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,160
This one?

420
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,790
"Architecture in Love"?

421
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,400
Compared to static spatial relationships,

422
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,310
I believe more

423
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,640
in crossing every time zone

424
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:27,480
to see you.

425
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,000
When...

426
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,110
When did you...

427
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,400
On the day

428
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,340
you said you wouldn't miss me.

429
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,590
It's getting late.

430
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:43,440
Go to sleep.

431
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,210
Tomorrow's proposal

432
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:46,610
will surely go smoothly.

433
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,270
I want to create
a community cultural space

434
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:13,730
that grows naturally from its environment.

435
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,110
The circular building forms
are soft and inclusive,

436
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:18,760
and the irregular windows
act like picture frames,

437
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,170
letting people inside

438
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,860
experience different views.

439
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,920
I want it to be

440
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,480
not just a building,

441
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,160
but an exploration

442
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,820
of future urban public space.

443
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:30,490
Using nature as a medium,

444
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:32,070
culture as the core,

445
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,700
and community as the soil,

446
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,350
it grows into

447
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,590
a green micro-settlement

448
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:37,510
in the city's fabric—

449
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,440
a place to rest,

450
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,200
communicate, and co-create.

451
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,270
Ms. Hu,

452
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,000
I really like your proposal.

453
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,730
And I'm happy

454
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:50,160
to entrust the project to your studio.

455
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,520
Thank you for your approval.

456
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,000
Ms. Zhou.

457
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,930
I'd like to briefly go over

458
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,920
the next steps for the collaboration
with you.

459
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,920
Okay, no problem.

460
00:24:59,160 --> 00:24:59,890
So, Ms. Zhou,

461
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,030
I'll...

462
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:01,810
Go back first.

463
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:03,540
See you at the office tomorrow.

464
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,200
Great job.

465
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,340
Everything went well today.

466
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,240
The client really liked my proposal.

467
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,400
And Ms. Zhou is already talking to them
about the contract.

468
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,460
I'm not surprised.

469
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,520
What's wrong?

470
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,070
It's raining today.

471
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,200
I happen to have an umbrella.

472
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:28,430
It's raining over there too?

473
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,480
Shouldn't it be early morning there
right now?

474
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:32,960
Why are you out?

475
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,330
Why aren't you saying anything?

476
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:38,170
Where are you?

477
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,120
Scattered showers.

478
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,980

I can manage it on my own.

506
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,650
I knew it.

507
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,820
Why did you fall asleep again?

508
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:15,920
I wasn't sleeping.

509
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,720
-I… I sat for a while.
-Alright.

510
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,270
Alright.

511
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,530
You weren't sleeping.

512
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:29,730
Here.

513
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,490
Brush your teeth properly.

514
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,240
Smells so good.

515
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,270
Here.

516
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,510
Where do you want to go today?
I'll go with you.

517
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,510
Anywhere is fine.

518
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,000
As long as I'm with you.

519
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,700
Did you hear that?

520
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:26,110
Where did that little kitten come from?

521
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,200
Xiao Zhiyu!

522
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,160
There's a kitten.

523
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,190
It looks like a stray cat
that ran in from outside.

524
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:39,320
I'll call property management to ask.

525
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:41,720
They said

526
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,060
it's probably an abandoned kitten.

527
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,320
You must be so thirsty.

528
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,370
Are you afraid of cats?

529
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,000
No.

530
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:54,610
So you...

531
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,600
don't like cats?

532
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:58,830
I've just

533
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,240
never had a pet before.

534
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,280
I don't know how to be around one.

535
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,720
Have you never thought about

536
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:07,110
having a cat or a dog of your own?

537
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:10,160
Once you form a bond,

538
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,830
you have to face loss someday.

539
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:13,640
So it's better not to form

540
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,640
that kind of bond in the first place.

541
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:21,170
What about me?

542
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,880
I'm a bond too.

543
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:24,230
You're different.

544
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:25,330
Why?

545
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,510
Because I'm special?

546
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,960
Because you're not a pet.

547
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,270
That trick again.

548
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:38,750
When I was little,

549
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,350
we had a dog.

550
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,280
We kept it for many years.

551
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,610
Its name was Qiuqiu.

552
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,580
Later, when I was in high school,
it passed away.

553
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,530
Were you sad for a long time?

554
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,850
But that's just how life is.

555
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,440
Whether

556
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,640
it's pets or people,

557
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:04,590
they can only walk with you
for part of the journey.

558
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,750
Once you understand that,

559
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:09,150
you won't be afraid
