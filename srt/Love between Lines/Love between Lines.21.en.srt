[Episode 21]

3
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,680
I've finished editing
the promotional copy.

4
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,759
I'll send it to you

5
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,760
to see if anything needs to be modified.

6
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,510
If you think everything looks good,

7
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,070
we can find a peak traffic time

8
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,350
and post it all at once tonight.

9
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,070
Hey, Ms. Zhao,

10
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,750
can you take a break for a while?

11
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,150
I just had an iced Americano
on an empty stomach,

12
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,750
and my stomach is killing me.

13
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,120
Wait a second.

14
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,520
This is right up my alley.

15
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,120
Aren't you tired?

16
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,430
Tired of what?

17
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,030
I'm full of energy right now.

18
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,890
Stomach-soothing special blend.

19
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,840
Is this alcohol?

20
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,079
It's for your stomach pain.

21
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:43,910
No alcohol.

22
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,470
Thanks.

23
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,410
I was wondering,

24
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,360
all this work you're doing—

25
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,160
is it just to distract yourself?

26
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,650
Distract myself from what?

27
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,960
You're feeling emotionally empty,

28
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,660
so you're finding other things
to fill the void.

29
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,310
So in your eyes,

30
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,630
I'm the kind of person

31
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,470
who feels empty without a man and romance?

32
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,310
No, that's not what I meant.

33
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,470
Look, before,

34
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,360
you were always very family-oriented.

35
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,520
But now you've suddenly
become a workaholic.

36
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,910
That's why I asked.

37
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,800
Relax.

38
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,030
I'm not upset.

39
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,980
I don't think your impression
of me is wrong either.

40
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:25,880
Tell you what,

41
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,780
you can keep an eye on me

42
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,280
and see how dedicated I can be,

43
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,610
how long I can keep it up,

44
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,079
and whether it's just a passing phase
to distract myself.

45
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:33,810
Sounds good.

46
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,960
By the way,

47
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,320
in your eyes,

48
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,700
what kind of person am I?

49
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,650
A spoiled rich kid?

50
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,710
A playboy?

51
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,280
Or maybe

52
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,630
a tech genius?

53
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:51,880
None of those.

54
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,430
None of them?

55
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,590
Then what?

56
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,470
You're just

57
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,190
a

58
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,080
virgin.

59
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:09,910
Vir...

60
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,750
Since I was young,

61
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,870
from America to China,

62
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:13,910
I've had...

63
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,830
had countless girlfriends.

64
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,829
If you don't believe me,
ask anyone in my circle.

65
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,750
Every time I get a new car,

66
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,310
I also get a new girlfriend.

67
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:21,720
I...

68
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:22,870
Perfect timing.

69
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,670
If you don't believe me, ask him.

70
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:27,480
Zhao,

71
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,480
we came to help.

72
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,760
What's going on?

73
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,560
May I ask,

74
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,420
how many times have you seen
Mr. Gong change his car?

75
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,430
If not 10, at least 8 cars.

76
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:41,150
See?

77
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,310
How could I lie to you?

78
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,630
You've misjudged me.

79
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,390
Have you ever seen

80
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,050
a woman in his passenger seat?

81
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,690
Never.

82
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,510
You...

83
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:05,680
No, well,

84
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,430
this is a misunderstanding.

85
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,030
I...

86
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,000
Well, I

87
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,560
prefer not to bring female companions
to meet them,

88
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,190
you know?

89
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:12,680
One must

90
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,140
maintain some mystery...

91
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,570
Exactly. Mystery.

92
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,950
Stop pretending with me.

93
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,830
None of you understand.

94
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,240
In our circle,

95
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:00,920
we need

96
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,800
to maintain a certain image.

97
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,270
Don't act like that.

98
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,530
You're not helping me.

99
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,220
I'm just telling the truth.

100
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,860
That's the image I have

101
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,990
carefully crafted and maintained
for over 10 years.

102
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,860
Over 10 years?

103
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,190
You're quite dedicated.

104
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,560
The club's

105
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,890
most skilled veteran actor. That's you.

106
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,390
Fine, fine.

107
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,510
You're all ganging up on me,

108
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,170
aren't you?

109
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,560
-Yes.
-Yes.

110
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:28,950
I...

111
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:30,240
Cheers.

112
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:30,790
Come on.

113
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:36,550
Give me a break.

114
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:37,930
Put it down.

115
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,830
How are the project receivables

116
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,030
I asked you to follow up on coming along?

117
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,570
Some should come through early next week.

118
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,750
However,

119
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,180
it might not meet your requirements.

120
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,520
I understand.

121
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,960
Let's fill the gap first.

122
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,630
What if...

123
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,930
Let's do it this way.

124
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,120
Go.

125
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,190
Please take more photos for us.

126
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,240
This is our coffee. Try it.

127
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,190
Thanks for your support.

128
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,000
Thank you.

129
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:55,480
Here.

130
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,600
This is our coffee.

131
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:57,530
Give it a try.

132
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:58,170
Try it.

133
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,030
These photos look great.

134
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,640
Come on, try our coffee.

135
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:02,560
Remember to tag our location

136
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,310
when you post them.

137
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,970
You're really good-looking.

138
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,000
You should have him take photos here

139
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,630
with our logo.

140
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,390
He looks even better.

141
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,240
Remember to tag our location
after taking photos.

142
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:11,560
No problem.

143
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,160
Thank you.

144
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,000
Our collaboration event
will last for one month.

145
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,310
If you're interested,

146
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,370
you can follow our official account.

147
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,430
This is the updated...

148
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,480
Excuse me, please make way.

149
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,080
Excuse me.

150
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,680
Each beverage...

151
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,720
Coffee's here.

152
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,040
Chief Feng,

153
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:26,800
yours.

154
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,400
Thank you.

155
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,530
You're welcome.

156
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,750
Thanks.

157
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:30,880
You're welcome.

158
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,720
Thank you.

159
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,059
Perfect Partners.

160
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,030
What would you like to drink?

161
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,750
I'd like a hot Rongcheng Snowy Night.

162
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,240
Okay.

163
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,840
A hot Rongcheng Snowy Night.

164
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:40,549
What about you?

165
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:40,960
Perfect Partners.

166
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,320
The shop is really busy.

167
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,290
Do you still have time to come?

168
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,630
I have a last-minute meeting.

169
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,030
I probably won't make it.

170
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:50,550
You can each take

171
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,000
a postcard.

172
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:52,950
Just a moment.

173
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,510
Okay.

174
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,550
Take it easy. Have you burnt yourself?

175
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,630
It's fine. It's fine.

176
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,830
Hello, who ordered the flower baskets?

177
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,440
Who sent these?

178
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,270
[Wish Regard & ME event a great success]
[Pei Zhen]

179
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,200
Just put them outside for me.

180
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,510
Okay.

181
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,510
Behind that standee.

182
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:11,790
Got it.

183
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:12,390
Thank you.

184
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,630
Mr. Pei.

185
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,840
I saw Ms. Zhao's post on social media.

186
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,960
I happen to be free today,

187
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,290
so I came to join the fun.

188
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,740
The flowers you sent are beautiful.

189
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,270
Thank you on behalf of Zhao.

190
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,220
You...

191
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,750
I spilled coffee just now.

192
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,080
I'll take you to see her.

193
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,000
Mr. Pei is here.

194
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,330
He brought you flowers.

195
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:36,710
Mr. Pei,

196
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:37,790
your presence is more than enough.

197
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,670
There was no need to bring anything.

198
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,510
For an event like this,

199
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,550
you need some ceremony.

200
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,610
Thank you, really.

201
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,300
Excuse me, I'd like to order.

202
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:44,820
Okay.

203
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,990
Mr. Pei, I need to attend to something.

204
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,990
Hu Xiu, please look after him for me.

205
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:48,930
No problem. Go ahead.

206
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:49,450
Okay.

207
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:52,670
This

208
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,120
is the themed board game

209
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,870
specially designed

210
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,070
by Regard for the collaboration event.

211
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,750
So is this board game design

212
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,000
related to the murder mystery game?

213
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,670
Of course it is.

214
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,080
It's derived from the murder mystery game.

215
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,120
Look at these 4 main characters.

216
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,250
They're from the murder mystery game.

217
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,400
Why is Pei Zhen here?

218
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,440
I don't have enough time
to clean all this up.

219
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,440
Can you check if the hygiene is okay?

220
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,510
For example, if there are 6 people today,

221
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,440
whoever loses has to drink coffee?

222
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,480
Your stepbrother
is also here for the event.

223
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,170
Mr. Xiao.

224
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:44,910
It's your first time

225
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,670
in Dynamism.

226
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,670
How do you like it?

227
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:56,910
Never mind.

228
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,110
I'm gonna do it later.

229
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:02,550
Mr. Pei.

230
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,360
Do you need the restroom?

231
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,630
The men's room is inside.

232
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,630
I came to find you.

233
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,360
What's this?

234
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,200
A silk scarf.

235
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,440
Put it on.

236
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,930
Isn't this spot dirty?

237
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,730
Where did you get this from?

238
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,810
I had it delivered from the mall.

239
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:21,610
Just arrived.

240
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,240
Gaining followers so quickly.

241
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,620
Look how happy you are.

242
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,200
So, Ms. Zhao,

243
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,000
should you buy me a cup of coffee?

244
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,080
Gong Huaicong,

245
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,210
thank you for today.

246
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:56,670
Your promotion today is really effective.

247
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:59,770
Just one day
and I've gained so many followers.

248
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,960
At this rate,

249
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,690
I should reach about 50,000 followers
in a month.

250
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,720
You know,

251
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,200
you seem pretty careless usually,

252
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,280
but when working together,

253
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,480
you're quite responsible

254
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,080
and make people feel at ease.

255
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,550
Well...

256
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,080
Well...

257
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,480
That's an exaggeration.

258
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,840
I'm serious.

259
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,960
This event

260
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,420
is a success thanks to you.

261
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,390
Actually,

262
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:36,440
you have quite a talent for management,

263
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,600
and on top of that,

264
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,600
you know some technical stuff.

265
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,390
I believe your club

266
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,590
will definitely get better and better.

267
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,670
Well, I've been busy here all day,

268
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,670
and I should get back
to check on the club.

269
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:55,670
I'll head out now.

270
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,510
Take care.

271
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,120
It's fine.

272
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:05,170
Why is he being so shy now?

273
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:39,910
Walking without watching
where you're going.

274
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,170
Are you sleepwalking?

275
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,550
I was taking a photo of the moon for you.

276
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,390
I was about to send it to you

277
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,450
when you showed up.

278
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,550
You still need to watch
where you're going.

279
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,550
Why are you angry?

280
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,570
Did Pei Zhen come today?

281
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,630
How did you know?

282
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,670
That's what he gave you?

283
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,320
You don't like it?

284
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:05,620
It's too ugly

285
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,370
and doesn't suit you at all.

286
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,790
No, I think it looks nice.

287
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,150
I really like it.

288
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:15,010
Come here.

289
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,230
Stop messing around.

290
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,200
This isn't from Pei Zhen.

291
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,320
It's a custom napkin from Zhao's shop.

292
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,960
If someone thinks it's too ugly

293
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,550
and unsuitable,

294
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,680
then I won't wear it.

295
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,890
You're deliberately teasing me.

296
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,080
Are you playing with me?

297
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,150
I'm not.

298
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,910
Are you playing with me?

299
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:47,360
I'm not.

300
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,320
Are you playing with me?

301
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:48,720
No.

302
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,200
Are you?

303
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,120
I'm losing my balance.

304
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,450
Are you playing with me?

305
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,720
Will you dare to do it again?

306
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,390
I won't dare.

307
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,000
I won't.

308
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:55,400
Look.

309
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,320
Don't we look just like

310
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,030
a compass at this moment?

311
00:14:59,030 --> 00:14:59,670
Compass?

312
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,530
Then try drawing a circle.

313
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,400
Draw a circle?

314
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,720
Don't move.

315
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,550
Stay still.

316
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,280
I won't move.

317
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:10,370
It doesn't really look like one.

318
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,150
Come.

319
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:13,080
Yes?

320
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,680
Come here.

321
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:14,960
♪ I moved closer to you,
and you moved closer to me ♪

322
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,020
What are you doing?

323
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,240
Drawing a circle.

324
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:24,200
♪ It felt as if two lonely islands
had finally ♪

325
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:30,360
♪ Held hands and slipped into
the flow of time together ♪

326
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,690
♪ I won't wander anymore ♪

327
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,510
Stop right there.

328
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,730
I heard you took the company accounts.

329
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,250
What are you going to do?

330
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,090
As the general manager of the company,

331
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,400
don't I have the right to review these?

332
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:06,400
Mr. Pei,

333
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,790
thank you for your kindness,

334
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,160
but I can't accept this.

335
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,880
It's just a scarf.

336
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,109
My 300-yuan shirt

337
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,660
really doesn't match
such a high-end scarf.

338
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:17,680
Mr. Pei,

339
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,550
some things are too valuable.

340
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:22,020
I can't appreciate fine things.

341
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,060
It would be a waste to give it to me.

342
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,170
Are you full?

343
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,280
Thank you for the meal, Mr. Xiao.

344
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,600
Glad you enjoyed it.

345
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,720
Then I'll wash the dishes.

346
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,180
No need.

347
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:07,990
I'll clean up.

348
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:09,900
How thoughtful.

349
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,970
After all, I stood you up earlier today.

350
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:13,370
I should make it up to you.

351
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,400
Well...

352
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:18,000
Can I look around your living room?

353
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,590
I was too nervous last time I was here.

354
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,200
I didn't get a chance
to look around properly.

355
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,730
Go ahead.

356
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,250
I'll join you in a minute.

357
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,980
Can you play the piano?

358
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:18,880
No.

359
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,260
My dad gave this to me when I was young.

360
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,680
Unfortunately,

361
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:25,960
I was naughty

362
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:28,170
and slacked off when learning piano.

363
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,000
Later...

364
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,790
This piano is well-maintained.

365
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,780
It's even tuned regularly.

366
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,850
I asked my uncle in China
to keep it for me,

367
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:51,050
and I moved it here
after returning to Shanghai.

368
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,400
So...

369
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,400
Would you like to learn?

370
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,000
You know how?

371
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,350
I know a little bit.

372
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,550
Would you like to try?

373
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:16,910
In the future,

374
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,570
I'll teach you
how to play the piano, okay?

375
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,920
Then I'm counting on you,

376
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,550
Ms. Hu.

377
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:12,950
Come.

378
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:22,830
Is everything okay between you and Zhen?

379
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:23,640
I've noticed these days,

380
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,370
he doesn't eat with us anymore.

381
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,060
Don't be too hard on him sometimes.

382
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:31,210
What problems could there be
between father and son?

383
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:31,820
Then,

384
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,970
could there be some issue at work?

385
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:34,620
No.

386
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:36,270
No?

387
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:39,630
Could it be because of that girl?

388
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,270
What girl?

389
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,380
Nothing. Let's eat.

390
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,760
Looks like
we don't have to work overtime today.

391
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,350
Last time was just an accident.

392
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,950
What kind of job requires overtime
every day?

393
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,110
However...

394
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:18,180
Don't you think Lyman's feedback process
this time

395
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:19,610
is ridiculously slow?

396
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,520
Our studio is already done,

397
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,320
but Forma still needs more time.

398
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:26,580
Forma is a big company after all.

399
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:29,000
The process may be more complicated.

400
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,310
That's true.

401
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:00,640
Okay.

402
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:02,590
See you later.

403
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,220
I'll send you the location on your phone.

404
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:15,550
Mr. Xiao.

405
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,710
Why are you here?

406
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,480
Mr. Pei left his lunch box here before.

407
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,680
I was wondering if you could

408
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:26,760
return it for me.

409
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:31,510
Mr. Pei probably doesn't need
this lunch box back.

410
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,200
Yes,

411
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,200
but no matter what,

412
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,960
I think it should be returned.

413
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:43,200
If it's inconvenient for you,

414
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:45,590
then I'll just...

415
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:51,120
Call a FlashEx service
to send it to Forma.

416
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,160
Fine.

417
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:58,240
Give it to me.

418
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,370
I'll take care of it.

419
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,240
Zhao asked me
to go to her shop after work.

420
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,100
What about you?

421
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:04,760
I have an appointment,

422
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,820
so I won't be going.

423
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:15,090
I'm leaving.

424
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:21,990
Running so fast.

425
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,400
Zhiyu.

426
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,480
Uncle Xu.

427
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:52,080
Look.

428
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,110
Huang Yide.

429
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:58,310
The owner of Xinde Building Materials.

430
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:00,640
He's in the cement and concrete business.

431
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,400
He is the owner of that company

432
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,730
Pei Kanghua is desperate to terminate

433
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:04,720
the contract with.

434
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,920
Judging by his build,

435
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:08,550
he looks a bit like that person
from back then.

436
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,110
This person's age

437
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,440
is about the same as Pei Kanghua's.

438
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,930
He speaks with a Nancheng accent.

439
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,030
Nancheng accent?

440
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,200
Rest assured.

441
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,550
I promise,

442
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,610
everything we just discussed

443
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:25,700
will die with me.

444
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,180
Good that you understand.

445
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,200
Then I...

446
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:31,060
The accent and build both match up.

447
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,830
He must be the one from back then.

448
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,440
This Mr. Huang

449
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,670
is in the cement and concrete business.

450
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:41,640
His factory has been poorly managed
these years.

451
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,160
The fact that it's still running

452
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,420
must be thanks to Pei Kanghua's support.

453
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:46,920
Logically speaking,

454
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,420
Pei Kanghua terminating their contract

455
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,910
shouldn't be good news.

456
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,050
But this Mr. Huang

457
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,590
seems quite spirited.

458
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,160
I checked and found

459
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,420
that during the period
when the contract was terminated,

460
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,870
he just took an order

461
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,630
to supply materials
for a reservoir dam project.

462
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,050
A reservoir dam?

463
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,490
That's a huge contract.

464
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,330
His factory can't handle it at all.

465
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,990
He's added a lot of new equipment.

466
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,750
Must be expanding production.

467
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,540
Talk about biting off
more than you can chew.

468
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,060
Zhiyu,

469
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,790
what's our next move?

470
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:27,550
I want to take a gamble.

471
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,440
Zhao.

472
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:40,400
You've been checking these accounts
for an hour now.

473
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,200
Can't help it.

474
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,520
Business has been too good lately.

475
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:46,830
Someone

476
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,680
is just obsessed with money.

477
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:51,130
Gong Huaicong,

478
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:52,320
if you're tired,

479
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,550
just go home

480
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:54,640
and get some sleep.

481
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,050
Sleeping is so boring.

482
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,310
We've been working so hard for so long.

483
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:07,790
Don't you think

484
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,680
we deserve to reward ourselves?

485
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,420
What are you planning now?

486
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,850
I was thinking

487
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,750
we should go out this weekend.

488
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,350
Find a place with nice scenery

489
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,480
and have a good rest.

490
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,240
My treat.

491
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:27,720
Think about it.

492
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,680
When was the last time you had

493
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,220
a really good time?

494
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:36,490
No way.

495
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,990
I'll invite Hu Xiu.

496
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:45,960
No problem.

497
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:47,410
How about this?

498
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:49,010
Ask Hu Xiu to invite Xiao too.

499
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,490
Alright.

500
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,000
Time to go.

501
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:54,840
Let's go.

502
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:05,560
Are you home?

503
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:07,480
Yes, I am.

504
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,100
Get some rest early.

505
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,600
By the way,

506
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:29,390
are you free this weekend?

507
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:31,720
Yes, I am.

508
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,560
What's up?

509
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,760
I want to go to Zhejiang for fun.

510
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,930
For 2 days and one night.

511
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,680
Don't you want to go?

512
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:57,590
Okay.

513
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:01,680
Okay.

514
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:04,850
He said okay.

515
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:07,730
Good night.

516
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,680
Xiao Zhiyu.

517
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:33,180
Let's go.

518
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:34,700
And...

519
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:47,320
Why are you here?

520
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:01,840
Hu Xiu.

521
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,510
You didn't tell Xiao

522
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,910
that the four of us
were going out together?

523
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:07,880
I guess I didn't mention it.

524
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,590
I have to call you out on this.

525
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:12,050
Who do you have to call out?

526
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,270
Me.

527
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:18,360
Look at me.

528
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,240
It's all my fault.

529
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,030
I'm to blame.

530
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,270
I didn't tell you.

531
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,990
Now I understand

532
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,840
why you've been managing
the club all this time.

533
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,360
Why?

534
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,230
You're quick to grovel.

535
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,210
Perfect for the service industry.

536
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:35,650
Hey,

537
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,680
do you really need that much sunscreen?

538
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,000
Even the sun outside
isn't as harsh as your words.

539
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,720
Sunscreen is something

540
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,290
you need to apply all year round.

541
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:43,920
If you don't understand, just keep quiet.

542
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,920
How could I not understand?

543
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,000
Of course, I understand.

544
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,350
UV rays are present all year round,

545
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:47,880
right?

546
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:49,630
I even know about that thing,

547
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,640
the SPF, sun protection factor.

548
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:52,680
Yes, yes, yes.

549
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,270
You know best.

550
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,000
You know everything.

551
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,960
Mr. Know-it-all.

552
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,550
No,

553
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,830
I just didn't expect

554
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,680
that you would be so...

555
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,840
I can't bear to watch.

556
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,350
Hello,

557
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,750
are you checking in?

558
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,160
Yes.

559
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,030
What room types do you have available now?

560
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,160
I'd like spacious rooms

561
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,090
with a nice view.

562
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:31,680
Certainly.

563
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,920
How many nights will you be staying?

564
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,550
Just one night.

565
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:34,000
Okay.

566
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:35,000
We currently have

567
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,310
suites and rooms with views available.

568
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:38,770
How many rooms do you need?

569
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,380
How would you like to arrange your room
as a couple?
