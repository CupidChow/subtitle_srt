[Episode 16]

3
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,510
Mr. Xiao.

4
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,310
Mr. Hu is right.

5
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,190
Hu Xiu.

6
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,240
I wish you a new year

7
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,890
free from all worries.

8
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,020
Cheers.

9
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:21,530
Cheers.

10
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:00,150
Celebrating the New Year
in the lane this time

11
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,880
feels pretty nice, doesn't it?

12
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,950
All those wishes

13
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,430
my parents made at dinner just now weren't

14
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,120
what I truly wanted.

15
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,830
Rather than a peaceful and smooth life,

16
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,079
I prefer challenges.

17
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,840
This year,

18
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:22,280
I want to complete
Lyman's projects perfectly.

19
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,910
If I get the chance,

20
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,790
I also want to work
on projects of my own design.

21
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,150
I want to

22
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,240
hone my professional skills.

23
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,410
I want to do more things

24
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,470
I haven't tried before.

25
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,000
I want...

26
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,100
What about you?

27
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:47,090
Is there anything you're determined
to accomplish this year?

28
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,800
I want to...

29
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,000
Find that answer.

30
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,360
Don't torment yourself.

31
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,240
I believe you'll find it.

32
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,210
-When did I...
-Watch out.

33
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,100
The Design Competition is over.

34
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,210
I'll move out

35
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:46,350
in a few days.

36
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,600
What do you mean?

37
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,880
I'll terminate my lease early.

I scared him so much
that he doesn't even dare to show up.

50
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,080
Mr. Gong?

51
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,630
What are you doing here?

52
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,890
Happy New Year, Hu Xiu.

53
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,720
I'm here to help Xiao Zhiyu move.

54
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,340
He's moving out today?

55
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,440
Yeah.

56
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,010
Can you believe it?
During the New Year holiday,

57
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,470
he's asking me to work
like a moving company.

58
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,770
He didn't tell you that?

59
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,480
What do you mean?

60
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,280
I've been busy these days,

61
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,260
so I asked him to go there to help.

62
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,660
You know that's not
what I'm talking about.

63
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,120
Fine,

64
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,140
I get it.

65
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,480
Hu Xiu.

66
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,240
I've finished moving everything.

67
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,360
This key of his...

68
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,030
I...

69
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm hanging it by your door.

70
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,600
See if there's anything else
you need to check.

71
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,120
This is his stuff.

72
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:54,790
Take it away.

73
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:55,270
Okay.

74
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,530
So, for the New Year...

75
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,270
What's wrong with you?

76
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,880
You are actually free today.

77
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,910
But why did you still boss me around?

78
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:21,670
Well, I can tell
even if you don't tell me.

79
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,930
The faces of you two already gave it away.

80
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,780
What's up with her?

81
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,960
She's like a firecracker
that didn't get set off on New Year's Eve,

82
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,100
ready to blow any minute

83
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,360
without holding back.

84
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:32,870
Listen, Xiao,

85
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,480
did you provoke her again?

86
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:38,580
Or why would anyone throw a temper tantrum
during the New Year holiday?

87
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,000
So...

88
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,670
You mean

89
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,970
you want to seek cooperation with me?

90
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:16,720
Yes.

91
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,190
But I have 1 condition.

92
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,160
Our cooperation
needs to be kept confidential.

93
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,640
Hu Xiu, good luck back at work.

94
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,900
Good luck back at work.

95
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,240
Mr. Sun, good luck back at work.

96
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:44,600
Mr. Xiao,

97
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:45,440
morning.

98
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:47,440
Morning.

99
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,000
You terminated your lease early.

100
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,290
I'll refund you the unused rent
based on the remaining days.

101
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:56,220
There's no need.

102
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,570
I got your bank account number
from Mr. Gong.

103
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,350
It's not much money anyway.

104
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,720
I just don't like leaving things unclear.

105
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,770
Mr. Pei, this way please.

106
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,120
Good morning,

107
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:22,960
Mr. Xiao.

108
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,240
Ms. Hu.

109
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,390
Mr. Xiao.

110
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:47,330
This way, please.

111
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:48,960
Thank you.

112
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:52,630
Mr. Pei,

113
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:55,440
Everyone here is part of the core team
making Lyman's projects.

114
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,480
Sun Yifei.

115
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,150
Tan Siyu.

116
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:57,790
Hu Xiu.

117
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,410
Hello everyone.

118
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,020
Mr. Pei, you only brought

119
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,440
one assistant with you today?

120
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,480
Actually, no.

121
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,600
Let them in when they're ready.

122
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,860
Just a moment, please.

123
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:11,970
Mr. Pei.

124
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,800
Since this is our first collaboration,

125
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,280
and it happens to be the New Year,

126
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,480
I've prepared some gifts for everyone.

127
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,430
This doesn't seem appropriate.

128
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,630
Don't worry, guys.

129
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,290
These gifts aren't expensive.

130
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:28,290
Just a small token of sincerity.

131
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,960
Ms. Zhou,

132
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,030
this is for you.

133
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,320
I've long heard

134
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,440
that you graduated
from the Wharton School.

135
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,750
Not only are you professionally competent,

136
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,550
but you also
handle things very efficiently.

137
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,360
So,

138
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,720
a beautiful career woman's shoes

139
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,840
must be well-maintained

140
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,390
so that they can help you go

141
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,200
more steadily

142
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:45,930
and further.

143
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:47,870
Thank you.

144
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:48,750
Happy New Year.

145
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,490
A few years ago, in Pudong,

146
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,410
there was a theater project

147
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:54,740
that I wanted to work on
with Engineer Sun.

148
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,310
Unexpectedly, D Studio got ahead of us.

149
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,240
This time,

150
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,600
I can finally fulfill one of my wishes.

151
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,860
Open it and take a look.

152
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,440
It's a luxury brand.

153
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,210
This...

154
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,120
This is

155
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,790
from a very famous Italian design company.

156
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:08,390
That's right.

157
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,990
This is the ruler
their designers use for work.

158
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,770
I heard that you, Engineer Sun,
love collecting work tools.

159
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,120
Their director is my friend,

160
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,780
so I specially got one for you.

161
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,290
Thank you, Mr. Pei.

162
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:23,170
That's so nice of you.

163
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,120
Don't mention it.

164
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,920
Engineer Tan,

165
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,510
this one is for you.

166
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,150
Thank you.

167
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,410
Everyone, have a seat.

168
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,350
I learned that you like sweets

169
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,030
at the cocktail party that day,

170
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,960
so I had my staff
ask the chef from that day

171
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,490
to make you some chocolate.

172
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,410
Give it a try.

173
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:51,720
Thanks.

174
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,490
Happy to work with you.

175
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,830
Mr. Pei, you're really thoughtful
about these things.

176
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,720
Well, I'm here for business after all.

177
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,920
It's what I should do.

178
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,360
By the way,

179
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,600
I know very little about you,

180
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,840
Mr. Xiao,

181
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,800
and I really don't know what you like.

182
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,000
I hope you don't mind?

183
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,830
Mr. Pei, let's skip the small talk.

184
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,080
Since we're working together,

185
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,490
let's focus on efficiency

186
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,750
and start the meeting.

187
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,430
I have no objections to today's agenda.

188
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,320
Zhuling will offer

189
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,720
the list of building material suppliers

190
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,030
and their qualification reports
to your company

191
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:36,840
as soon as possible.

192
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,260
Good.

193
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,770
Then we'll wait for Zhuling's submission.

194
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,390
There's one more thing.

195
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,390
Mr. Xie mentioned

196
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,910
that before the studio and Zhuling

197
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,510
formally sign the contract,

198
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,320
we need to submit our financial statements
from the past year respectively

199
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,840
to Lyman for review

200
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,100
so as to ensure transparency
in our cooperation.

201
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,150
We've already submitted
our financial statement.

202
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,480
Please submit yours soon as well, Mr. Pei.

203
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,240
No problem.

204
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,480
Well,

205
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:01,960
if there's nothing else,

206
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,820
let's conclude today's meeting.

207
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:04,910
How about

208
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:05,510
I treat everyone

209
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,840
to a meal?

210
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,730
We have many more meetings to hold,

211
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:11,930
so we'll have to pass.

212
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:18,400
Alright,

213
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,880
I will leave you to it then.

214
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,550
Let's exchange WeChat contacts

215
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,960
for future collaboration.

216
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,800
How about this?

217
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,580
I'll create a group chat

218
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,140
for the designers to add you.

219
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:28,800
No problem.

220
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:31,960
Mr. Pei,

221
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,000
I've created the group chat,

222
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,270
and all the designers have added you.

223
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:34,790
Okay.

224
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,120
Ms. Hu,

225
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,390
I've added you.

226
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,540
We couldn't have lunch together today.

227
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,470
Hope we can have a chance next time.

228
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,240
Take care, Mr. Pei.

229
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,569
This time, you did a great job

230
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:12,500
on the studio's background check.

231
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,640
It's my duty, Mr. Pei.

232
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,349
However,

233
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:19,069
regarding Ms. Hu's background check,

234
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:21,000
I couldn't find much information.

235
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,030
She?

236
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,900
You don't need to investigate her.

237
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:45,150
♪ I saw the tram

238
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,310

Mr. Xiao.

241
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:52,460
Ms. Hu.

Mr. Xiao,

248
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,430
I've checked today's schedule.

249
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:24,590
There are no other meetings at the moment.

250
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,070
♪ Talking about random topics ♪

251
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,310

Dad,

263
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,440
I'm home.

264
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,000
I heard from Shen Jie

265
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,440
that Lyman wants the financial statement
of Zhuling from the past year.

266
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,510
Yes.

267
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,270
Mr. Xie knows

268
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,300
my relationship with Xiao Zhiyu.

269
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,720
If the studio and Zhuling
want to collaborate,

270
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,860
we need to provide financial reports
for Lyman to review.

271
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,420
After all, they need to monitor
the safety of project funds.

272
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,950
It's a reasonable request.

273
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,210
This is my fault.

274
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,600
I should have reported to you first.

275
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,100
Securing the Lyman's project is
the priority.

276
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,510
I'll tell Shen Jie

277
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,890
to send you the financial report.

278
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:51,510
Okay.

279
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,530
I'll go upstairs first.

280
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:13,830
Mr. Xiao.

281
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,780
Zhuling has replied

282
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:22,410
that their financial statement will be
sent to Lyman 2 days late.

283
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:26,310
There's something else
I need to discuss with you.

284
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:28,000
According
to the preliminary cooperation process,

285
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,960
we need to send a liaison representative

286
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,790
to the construction site
managed by Zhuling

287
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:34,000
to conduct
a construction management inspection.

288
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,790
Afterward, Zhuling will provide

289
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,720
a complete list of suppliers

290
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,850
for us to recommend.

291
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,510
As for the liaison,

292
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,470
Mr. Pei

293
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,700
specifically wants Hu Xiu to follow up.

294
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,040
Mr. Pei has been paying a lot of attention
to Hu Xiu lately.

295
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,940
But if you think there's any issue,

296
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,030
I can find a way to decline

297
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,760
and send someone else instead.

298
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:57,590
No,

299
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,200
let her go.

300
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,000
Recently,

301
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,600
she's put in quite a lot of effort

302
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,930
looking for suppliers.

303
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,380
She's very familiar
with each one's situation.

304
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,920
She is the best choice.

305
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,270
Indeed.

306
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:14,000
Regardless of how Pei Zhen treats her,

307
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,960
we shouldn't ignore her contributions.

308
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,020
Otherwise, it would be unfair to her.

309
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,350
Besides,

310
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,570
she can handle it well.

311
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,350
Since she joined the company,

312
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:29,770
her capabilities have been
self-evident to everyone.

313
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,240
Zhou Yan from D Studio has replied,

314
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,240
agreeing to let Ms. Hu

315
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,770
handle the follow-up work.

316
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:40,790
Director Shen?

317
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,200
The Chairman is also here today?

318
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,240
Director Shen.

319
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,580
Mr. Pei.

320
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,700
Did something happen?

321
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,400
No.

322
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:55,510
It's just that these documents are
a bit tricky to work on.

323
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,510
Nothing serious.

324
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,000
Mr. Pei,

325
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,750
Chairman Pei just instructed me

326
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,550
to sort out the financial report

327
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,640
and give it to you.

328
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,680
However,

329
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,860
you'll need to wait a few days.

330
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,160
okay.

331
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,910
Go ahead with your work.

332
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,130
[Chairman's Office]

333
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:30,720
Hu Xiu.

334
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,830
I'm assigning you
to coordinate with Zhuling.

335
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:34,310
Later,

336
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:37,270
you'll go with Mr. Pei
to inspect Zhuling's construction site.

337
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:37,750
Well,

338
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,350
will Hu Xiu be going alone?

339
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,150
What about me?

340
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,680
One person is enough.

341
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:42,640
Besides,

342
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,590
Mr. Pei specifically requested

343
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,250
Hu Xiu to coordinate with him.

344
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,920
What's all the fuss about?

345
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,510
You don't have enough work to do

346
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,970
and want to work overtime?

347
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,070
Both Mr. Xiao and I

348
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,790
trust your work skills completely.

349
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:03,880
Do your best.

350
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:06,880
If there's anything inappropriate

351
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,570
from Mr. Pei's side,

352
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,990
let me know immediately.

353
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,240
Good luck.

354
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,030
Hu Xiu,

355
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,000
I've noticed something.

356
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,480
Mr. Pei treats you

357
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,270
quite differently.

358
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,310
No.

359
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,540
Yes!

360
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,230
Sun told us last time

361
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,270
that at the Lyman's cocktail party,

362
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:34,250
Mr. Pei specifically invited you to dance.

363
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,970
You two looked like a perfect match.

364
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:37,770
Wait, why are you giving me away?

365
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,070
Sun Yifei.

366
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,510
I've finished
reviewing the materials for you.

367
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,110
You're just way too idle.

368
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,550
Hey, but what I said is backed
by evidence.

369
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,720
During the meeting that day,

370
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,070
Mr. Pei gave us gifts, right?

371
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,830
He was giving very formal gifts
to the rest of us.

372
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:49,030
Yep.

373
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,290
But when it came to you,

374
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,440
it was chocolate.

375
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,830
How sweet and romantic.

376
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:53,670
Right?

377
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:56,960
Isn't it still sitting at your desk?

378
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,640
You quite value it, don't you?

379
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,240
And you put it on the left side,

380
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,000
the closest to your heart.

381
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,130
Value it? Nonsense!

382
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:03,880
I put it there,

383
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,310
so everyone can share it.

384
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:06,370
Come on.

385
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,830
L-Let me share it with you all.

386
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,190
There's chocolate to eat!

387
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,850
-Then give me one.
-I want one.

388
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,920
That's not what I meant.

389
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,750
I saw you laughing heartily just now.

390
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,360
I won't give any to you two either.

391
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,220
Here, catch it.

392
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,110
We're celebrating
our store's second anniversary.

393
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,830
Here's a customized gift for you.

394
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,880
We specifically asked a designer
to design it.

395
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,230
It's exclusive to our store.

396
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:36,960
Here you are.

397
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,510
You can put it in your café.

398
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,510
Happy second wedding anniversary.

399
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,060
I was charging my phone
in your car earlier

400
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,870
and forgot to take my cable.

401
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,560
When can you return it to me?

402
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,400
It's only charged to 60 percent.

403
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:44,190
Can you stay longer next time?

404
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,730
It's said that unplugging your phone
before it's fully charged

405
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:48,380
affects the battery life.

406
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,310
Chi Xin.

407
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:55,270
Do you remember her?

408
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,350
At the networking event back then,

409
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,160
Chi Xin specifically came over

410
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,090
to add Guangming on WeChat.

411
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,480
Guangming refused her immediately.

412
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,640
Later, she came to me

413
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,680
and asked me to give her his WeChat.

414
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,530
Go get some more sleep.

415
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:13,530
It's still early.

416
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,550
No way.

417
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:16,480
I thought of some new desserts last night.

418
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,740
I need to give them a try
at the shop today.

419
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:22,290
Why am I feeling so drowsy?

420
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,750
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

421
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,080
I'm helping you wake up.

422
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:36,880
That monitoring system you developed is

423
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,080
actually pretty good.

424
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,100
There's a project we're planning to launch

425
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,140
that's similar to what you're doing.

426
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,140
Let's talk about it in person later.

427
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:47,660
You didn't eat much.

428
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,280
Senior, I'll be there shortly.

429
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,680
I've brought all the project materials.

430
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,480
What's wrong?

431
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,850
Just a spam text.

432
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,110
Senior,

433
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:03,830
you made me come all this way

434
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,440
just to be your driver?

435
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,680
Let's find a place

436
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:08,720
to discuss the project.

437
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,830
My client is back from Germany

438
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,650
and wants to explore
Shanghai's snack shops.

439
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:24,910
Are you free to join us?

440
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:25,610
Yes, I'm free.

441
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,540
I submitted my resignation today.

442
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:28,930
That's great.

443
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,120
Now you can focus on our project.

444
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:33,280
Honey, what brings you here?

445
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,860
Should we go to the double-rice cake store
or the pan-fried bun restaurant first?

446
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:41,100
I haven't had carbs like these in ages.

447
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,720
The project is going so smoothly.

448
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,050
Don't you think I deserve a little reward?

449
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,070
Honey,

450
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,470
I was suddenly invited
to a business dinner tonight.

451
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,000
Get some rest early.

452
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,370
I just saw many people
still waiting outside.

453
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:58,070
You must've lined up for quite a while
for this restaurant, huh?

454
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,160
It's nothing.

455
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,890
I really appreciate your help
with this project.

456
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,030
Hello, sir.

457
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,160
Here's your receipt.

458
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,790
It's 1,314 yuan in total.

459
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:09,310
Okay.

460
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:09,720
Also,

461
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,440
today is our store's second anniversary.

462
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,770
This is a special customized gift for you.

463
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,590
Second anniversary?

464
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:08,350
Honey?

465
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,710
You didn't go to the shop today?

466
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:18,530
I-I didn't sleep well.

467
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,410
I want to get some rest at home.

468
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,640
Did I wake you up when I came home

469
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,830
this morning?

470
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:45,830
Are you going to the office today?

471
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:48,830
Yes, I'm leaving now.

472
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:50,770
Go get some more sleep.

473
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,150
I'm off.

474
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:17,720
Sir,

475
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,510
I called this taxi.

476
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,870
Please follow that car in front closely.

477
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:20,390
Okay.

478
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:02,140
Sleeping in this late,

479
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:04,400
you haven't eaten yet, huh?

480
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:06,590
Thanks.

481
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,020
Your lunch break is really long.

482
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,920
Thanks to you.

483
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,510
I told my boss I was coming out for work,

484
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:14,880
so he let me go.

485
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,400
After all these meetings this morning,

486
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:19,900
my battery has been running low.

487
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,680
If I didn't come out for some fresh air,

488
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,830
I'd shut down.

489
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,760
Take it for recharging.

490
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:30,960
Just this?

491
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,690
This is what I call recharging.

492
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:22,590
Zhuling's financial statement

493
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,250
hasn't been sent to Lyman yet.

494
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,600
They said
it would be delayed by 2 more days.

495
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,030
Zhuling is a large enterprise

496
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,050
with complex finances.

497
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:30,310
It's understandable.

498
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,640
Then I'll follow up on this.

499
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:35,270
Hu Xiu went out

500
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,400
to inspect Zhuling's construction site
with Mr. Pei.

501
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:51,270
Ms. Hu,

502
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:52,690
can't get a taxi again?

503
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,030
Mr. Pei,

504
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,830
weren't we supposed to meet
at the construction site?

505
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,350
I had some things to handle nearby.

506
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,170
Since it's on my way anyway,

507
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:02,230
let's go together.

508
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:12,430
[We're calling 7 types of cars for you.]

509
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,570
Thank you, Mr. Pei.

510
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:15,640
To avoid being late,

511
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,710
I'll gladly accept your offer.

512
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:33,870
Coffee.

513
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:43,110
Mr. Pei, you've been waiting for me
for a while, right?

514
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,200
Why do you say that?

515
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:47,480
The coffee isn't even hot anymore.

516
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:50,750
It's fine.

517
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,920
It's only been about half an hour.

518
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:56,070
It's rare for you to wait
for someone, Mr. Pei.

519
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,650
Then I won't refuse your kindness.

520
00:33:57,650 --> 00:33:59,110
Thank you for treating me.

521
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,550
When I suggested you as the liaison,

522
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:08,610
I thought Xiao Zhiyu wouldn't agree.

523
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:10,760
Since we're going to work together,

524
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,840
there will surely be

525
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,500
plenty of coordination work.

526
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,550
Mr. Pei,
you don't need to go to such trouble,

527
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:17,409
picking me up and dropping me off.

528
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:21,040
Seems like you want to draw the line
with me again, Ms. Hu.

529
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,800
Yes, of course.

530
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:25,650
I don't want to become
part of office gossip.

531
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,110
What gossip?

532
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,030
They say

533
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:32,070
you specifically requested me
to coordinate with you

534
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,400
because you're into me.

535
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,480
It's fine. Don't worry.

536
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:45,230
Well, then,

537
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:47,000
what do you think?

538
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,510
Mr. Pei,

539
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,730
I know my place.

540
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,320
I know

541
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:56,560
your focus has never been on me,

542
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,070
but on Xiao Zhiyu.

543
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,960
What makes you say that?

544
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,270
Mr. Pei, your time is too valuable

545
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:06,730
to waste
on insignificant people or things.

546
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,800
As a nobody,

547
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,230
the only reason I caught your attention

548
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:13,760
must be my relationship with Xiao Zhiyu.

549
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:19,110
You used me to probe him,

550
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,260
wanted to provoke him through me,

551
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,980
and smeared him in front of me.

552
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,030
I couldn't figure it out before.

553
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,710
It was just business competition.

554
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,640
Why were you targeting him so much?

555
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,410
But after learning
about your family matters

556
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,640
and the relationship between you two,

557
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,680
it finally made some sense.

558
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:42,230
Seems like I'm a villain

559
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,320
in your eyes, Ms. Hu.

560
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:48,550
I just want to do my job well.

561
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,620
What about Xiao Zhiyu?

562
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:53,760
Does he also see you

563
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,420
as just an ordinary employee?

564
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,260
Yes, of course.

565
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,710
Mr. Xiao

566
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,110
respects his employees.

567
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,070
He wouldn't deprive

568
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:08,070
any employee of work opportunities

569
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,030
due to the current conflicts
between you two.

570
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,150
So, Mr. Pei,

571
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,480
please don't use me

572
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,480
as a tool in your family infighting.

573
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,710
I never realized before

574
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,880
that you're so blunt, Ms. Hu.

575
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:30,770
Do you feel offended, Mr. Pei?

576
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,880
I'm just surprised.

577
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,700
You used to work as a GM assistant.

578
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:42,480
I thought you would be someone diplomatic

579
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,860
and cautious in handling things.

580
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:48,050
My idea of being diplomatic isn't

581
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:50,840
carefully crafting lies,

582
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,710
but rather

583
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,580
speaking the truth politely.

584
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,040
It seems that I don't know you very well.

585
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,420
Well, that being the case,

586
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,420
let's formally get to know
each other today.

587
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:10,760
Mr. Pei,

588
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,740
we'll be working side by side from now on.

589
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,150
I hope that between us,

590
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,710
there can be less pretense

591
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:17,840
and more sincerity,

592
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,730
so we can get this project done perfectly.

593
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,610
Sounds good.

594
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,620
Here they come.

595
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,440
Mr. Pei,

596
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,150
welcome.

597
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,180
Supervisor Xu.

598
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,480
Thank you for your work.

599
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:02,830
Let me introduce you.

600
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,800
This is Supervisor Xu from Zhuling,

601
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,920
in charge of the project engineering.

602
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,590
Hello, Supervisor Xu.

603
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:07,760
I'm Hu Xiu,
an assistant designer from D Studio.

604
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,590
Ms. Hu, welcome to inspect our site.

605
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:10,510
You're too kind.

606
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:11,110
Zhuling's construction sites

607
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:13,220
have always set the standard
in the industry.

608
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,220
I'm actually here to learn from you.

609
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:28,050
Mr. Pei needs to get changed.

610
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,840
He puts a set of clothes here

611
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,110
as he comes here to inspect every day.

612
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,110
For convenience.

613
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,610
You come here every day?

614
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,050
Seems like you don't

615
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:36,510
know me very well, either.

616
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:37,830
Take your time.

617
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:41,470
I'll take Ms. Hu there first.

618
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,380
Come on.

619
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,920
This way, please.

620
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,330
Let's go.

621
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:47,800
Ms. Hu,

622
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,570
let me give you a brief introduction.

623
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:49,930
This construction site is

624
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:50,550

625
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:51,110

642
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,090
The external elevators

643
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:31,490
and the material hoists.

644
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,030
The safety gates
of these unloading platforms

645
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,400
must be closed according to regulations.

646
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,280
We can't be careless.

647
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,360
Don't worry, Mr. Pei.

648
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,960
Yes, you remind us of it
every time you come.

649
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,800
I'm keeping a close eye on it.

650
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,590
There won't be any slip-ups.

651
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:40,800
Familiarity breeds neglect.

652
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,400
These reminders
can never be repeated enough.

653
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:45,510
There cannot be any accidents on site.

654
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,630
Safety is our bottom line.

655
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:47,150
Understood.

656
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:47,710
Yes.

657
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,750
You may get back to work now.

658
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:50,410
Please rest assured, Mr. Pei.

659
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:55,960
Ms. Hu.

660
00:39:59,480 --> 00:39:59,960
What is it?

661
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,510
Did you notice any problems?

662
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:02,110
Nope.

663
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:04,950
Zhuling really lives up to its reputation.

664
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:06,630
What reputation?

665
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,440
Everyone says

666
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,400
Zhuling's construction sites

667
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,110
have the most standardized management

668
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:12,770
and the best safety measures.

669
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:14,980
Isn't it the most basic principle

670
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,620
to ensure workers' safety?

671
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,620
If only every construction site
could follow this.

672
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:23,150
What?

673
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,710
Did you encounter any problems

674
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,770
with your previous projects, Ms. Hu?

675
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,290
It was about my dad.

676
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,960
He used to be a lighting engineer,

677
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,850
responsible for lighting installations
in many large venues.

678
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:37,180
He was injured in a construction accident.

679
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,710
It happened many years ago.

680
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,510
Accidents at construction sites are

681
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:42,040
always life-threatening.

682
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,530
Although your father was injured,

683
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:45,990
he actually lucked out
given the situation.

684
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,170
But as long as one is alive,

685
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:49,550
there is hope.

686
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,430
Mr. Xiao,

687
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,990
I'm clocking out.

688
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,120
Well...

689
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,800
Is Hu Xiu

690
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,580
still not done
inspecting the construction site?

691
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:15,910
I just called and asked.

692
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,590
She said the inspection was over,

693
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:20,190
but she needed to go
to Zhuling with Mr. Pei.
