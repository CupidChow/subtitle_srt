206
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,270

00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,960
You said you needed

383
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,000
an assistant who understood architecture,

384
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,790
so you had me fill the spot temporarily

385
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,550
and said you'd transfer me
to the design department later.

386
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,350
That's right.

387
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,770
It's been three years.

388
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,920
What about that transfer?

389
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:50,830
Hu.

390
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,920
That's not the right way to put it.

391
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,650
I've already transferred you.

392
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,860
Think about it.

393
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,470
You used to be an assistant.

394
00:23:58,590 --> 00:23:59,440
And now?

395
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,360
You're the general manager's assistant.

396
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:03,510
Right?

397
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,750
Isn't that right?

398
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,270
Hu.

399
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,110
The company

400
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,610
doesn't have many projects now.

401
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:24,740
We don't need designers at the moment.

402
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,030
Wait until we secure

403
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:26,960
another big client this year—

404
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,200
"Once we secure
a few more big clients this year,

405
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,400
"I'll definitely transfer you.

406
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,400
"Young people shouldn't be too impatient,

407
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,460
"or you'll end up at a disadvantage."

408
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,980
What are you trying to say?

409
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:41,730
Nothing.

410
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,510
As your assistant,

411
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,750
I take to heart

412
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,350
everything you say.

413
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,960
I'll head out now.

414
00:24:58,490 --> 00:24:59,940
I was at the end of my rope.

415
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,790
Won't you allow me to
find a way out of a desperate situation?

416
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:04,160
I hope in today's game,

417
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,000
you'll have the last laugh.

418
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:07,960
Mr. Xu.

419
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,110
What is it now?

420
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,790
I'm quitting.

421
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,240
Quitting?

422
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,670
Before I quit, let me warn you:

423
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,750
it's best not to drink that coffee.

424
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,330
Last month, several employees
in our department said

425
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:25,880
they found dead cockroaches
when cleaning the coffee machine.

426
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,740
How many was it?

427
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:29,160
Two or three?

428
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,410
Hu, why didn't you
tell me about this earlier?

429
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,080
I think there were four, Mr. Xu!

430
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,000
Zhao,

431
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,130
I was just using that to fool my boss...

432
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,720
No, my former boss.

433
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,610
Why do you actually believe that?

434
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,880
Hu Xiu, how did I never notice

435
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,920
that you're actually crazy?

436
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,240
Crazy?

437
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,680
I love that title.

438
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,410
Thanks for the compliment.

439
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:08,570
So you've decided to quit
without another job lined up?

440
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,680
You don't have any backup plans
for yourself.

441
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:15,410
It would be so much better
if you found another job before quitting.

442
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,750
Zhao.

443
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:23,670
Do you know what happens to someone
who stays with a bad option

444
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,650
while looking for better ones?

445
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,940
They end up spending their whole life

446
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:31,200
on that bad option without realizing it.

447
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,400
So,

448
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,720
I have to push myself

449
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,750
to start over fresh.

450
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,510
Start over fresh?

451
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,480
You mean...

452
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:44,480
I still want to be an architect.

453
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,240
Are you sure?

454
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,030
Then I support you

455
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:52,270
with all my heart.

456
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,110
You're so strong.

457
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,070
You're just too weak.

458
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,590
Who is it?

459
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,310
Don't look.

460
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,150
A murder mystery game?

461
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,950
There's a game in half an hour.

462
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,920
Going again? Didn't you win last time?

463
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,460
The fox didn't witness it last time.

464
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,550
It wasn't a perfect victory.

465
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,110
I'm off.

466
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,920
Fox?

467
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,880
Is that a new character?

468
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:29,440

470

to Rongcheng.

479
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:15,770
[Group B Warlord Commander Qin Xiaoyi]

480
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,140
The current situation in Rongcheng

481
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,770
is extremely complicated.

482
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:32,960
Chief Feng

483
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,570
has already established cooperation
with Pavlovich,

484
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:39,770
while Director Lin
has Mr. Kobayashi backing him.

485
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:40,830
Anna,

486
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,750
today,

487
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:45,440
if we can reach an agreement

488
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:48,680
and I get the support
from M's headquarters,

489
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:49,770
then I

490
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,960
will definitely lead you

491
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:55,000
to ultimate victory.

492
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,000
Anna!

493
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:02,940
This Qin Xiaoyi is so over-the-top.

494
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:07,960
Ms. Anna.

495
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:14,720
I'm sorry.

496
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,000
I'll think about

497
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,110
this cooperation some more.

498
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,480
Anna, Anna!

499
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,640
I don't think you understand what I mean.

500
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,480
If you have any concerns,

501
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,240
feel free to bring them up.

502
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,680
We will achieve victory.

503
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,480
Trust me.

504
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:32,830
This contract...

505
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:35,580
You can take it.

506
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,310
But, General Qin,

507
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,110
being too eager

508
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,430
only makes me doubt your abilities.

509
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,160
If you want me to sign this contract,

510
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,590
you need to show me your sincerity.

511
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:56,930
Wait a minute.

512
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,750
I don't quite understand what you mean.

513
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:03,750
What kind of sincerity
are you looking for?

514
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,960
How many candied hawthorns
would I need to eat

515
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,960
to make the 600 yuan worth it?

516
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:17,140
Let me go!

517
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:20,080
I've been framed! I've been framed!

518
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,240
Anna,

519
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,970
I'm so disappointed in you!

520
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,070
I'm so disappointed in you!

521
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,400
Anna!

522
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:27,710
Likewise.

523
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:41,490
Hello.

524
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,590
How come today's Qin Xiaoyi

525
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:45,350
is different from before?

526
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,310
We have two groups of actors, A and B.

527
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:48,710
They perform in rotation.

528
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:49,830
I see.

529
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,610
Do you have a schedule for the two groups?

530
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:54,240
Yes, we do,

531
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:56,350
but the actor you want to see

532
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,770
is our special guest performer.

533
00:30:57,770 --> 00:30:59,500
His work schedule is not fixed.

534
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:01,570
I don't know the details either.

535
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,430
Take care.

536
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:20,470
These aren't the same messages as before.

537
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:21,470
That makes sense.

538
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:24,460
They'll run out of room
if they don't switch them out.

539
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,510
Can it read my mind?

540
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:55,770
Does anyone know Qin Xiaoyi's real name?

541
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,510
All the other NPC actors
created social media accounts.

542
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:58,920
Only he's being mysterious.

543
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,920
He's not even on the official cast list.

544
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,510
I have a friend who used to work there.

545
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,830
Even he couldn't find any information.

546
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,750
They say he doesn't like public attention.

547
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:06,720
He's just an NPC actor.

548
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,830
It's not like he's some big celebrity.

549
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:08,880
Why be so mysterious?

550
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,480
Probably just a marketing strategy.

551
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,000
Whether it's a strategy or not,

552
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,790
the other actor is really not as good.

553
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:14,750
Indeed,

554
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,400
he's not quite as good.

555
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:21,880
Mr. Gong,

556
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,800
I need to tell you something.

557
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:26,920
Qin Xiaoyi from Group A
hasn't been coming these days.

558
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,920
Today, there was even a player

559
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,370
who specifically asked about his sessions.

560
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:31,850
Okay, I got it.

561
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,720
Hello, sir.

562
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,290
Do you have a reservation?

563
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,070
Yes,

564
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:39,930
I'm waiting for a friend.

565
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,310
Mr. Xiao.

566
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:46,960
My friend.

567
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:48,150
This way, please.

568
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,490
Been quite busy these days?

569
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:52,750
Looking for apartments everywhere.

570
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,640
No wonder you haven't been to the club.

571
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,790
Wait, if you're looking for apartments,

572
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:57,510
you can just have your agent
do the legwork.

573
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:59,170
Why are you going personally?

574
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,120
The rental situation there is special.

575
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,680
There are a lot of shared spaces.

576
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,260
The landlords want to
meet tenants before renting.

577
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:12,830
What's wrong?

578
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,680
I know you're busy.

579
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:19,200
You can come to the club
whenever you want.

580
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:20,310
It's just that...

581
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,880
An employee just called me.

582
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,000
He said there was a player today

583
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,200
who specifically asked about Qin Xiaoyi

584
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,110
and the schedule for Groups A and B.

585
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,970
Seems like they came just for you.

586
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:29,880
I'm just mentioning it.

587
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,880
But Xiao, don't worry.

588
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,070
When we first opened this club,

589
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,270
we agreed on everything.

590
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,770
It absolutely won't affect your work.

591
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:39,270
Your schedule and information
are completely confidential.

592
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:41,420
You won't have any private contact
with players.

593
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,220
Rest assured.

594
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,750
Take a good look

595
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,440
who the final winner really is.

596
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:05,790
[Qin Xiaoyi]

597
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,949
This is no problem at all.

598
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,320
Sure, sure.

599
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,770
It's just ahead.

600
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:21,889
This way.

601
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,150
Granny Chen.

602
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:26,880
Granny Chen!

603
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,900
I've brought a client
to see the apartment.

604
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:32,480
Excuse us.

605
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,710
Come in.

606
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:42,320
Thank you.

607
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,110
Here, watch your step.

608
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:46,920
It's fine.

609
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,150
Alright, it's fine.

610
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,960
The path is uneven. Take it slow.

611
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,920
Okay, don't worry.

612
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,480
Don't worry about me.

613
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,070
Just hold onto your things.

614
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:54,230
Coming to see Xiu?

615
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,130
You're back?

616
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,110
Yes, yes.

617
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,440
Watch out.

618
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,560
Where should I put this?

619
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,280
Young man,

620
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:05,650
how long are you planning to rent for?

621
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:07,480
I haven't decided yet,

622
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,010
so I'd like to rent by month.

623
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:11,630
Take it easy.

624
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,110
In...

625
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,190
Ex-in-law.

626
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:17,520
Don't call us that.

627
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,120
We don't deserve that title.

628
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,360
Is Xiu not here?

629
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,390
So, you're living in this house now?

630
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,100
This is all my family's property!

631
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,500
Why should an outsider
care who lives here?

632
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,630
I'm just asking if she's here.

633
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,830
Why are you shouting?

634
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:33,970
Don't worry.

635
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:36,550
Living here
is very convenient and comfortable.

636
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:38,400
All the neighbors
have been here for years.

637
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,510
Everyone gets along well with each other.

638
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,030
First, get that irresponsible son of yours

639
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:42,110
to come back to Shanghai

640
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:43,150
and apologize in person.

641
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,180
What do you mean irresponsible?

642
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,580
What's wrong with my son?

643
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,070
Is breaking up being irresponsible?

644
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,400
These days, people date

645
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,130
and break up all the time, okay?

646
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:53,110
What was he doing before this?

647
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,760
Did he have to do it at this point?

648
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,630
And now, he's not even coming back.

649
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:57,960
What kind of man is that?

650
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:58,960
Alright, alright.

651
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,160
Keep your voice down.

652
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,040
The neighbors are watching.

653
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,000
Well,

654
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:07,990
Normally,

655
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:10,620
the soundproofing
is quite effective, right?

656
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,280
That's Mr. Hu's daughter.

657
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,040
She was planning to get married,

658
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,170
but for some reason,

659
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:18,570
the groom ran away
on their engagement day.

660
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:19,440
If you ask me,

661
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,350
she's right to yell at him.

662
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:21,680
Um, Granny,

663
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,710
this is a special situation, right?

664
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:26,630
It's not usually this noisy.

665
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,680
It's not like this normally.

666
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,650
Your son broke off the engagement!

667
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,110
And you have the nerve
to come to our house, demanding answers

668
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:40,440
and wanting the first-meeting gift back?

669
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,960
I've never seen anything like this.

670
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,150
Let's break up peacefully

671
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,410
and part on good terms.

672
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,070
What's wrong with

673
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,550
settling accounts clearly?

674
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,020
Or would you like everyone
to judge who's right?

675
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:48,620
Hey!

676
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,590
Mom, Dad.

677
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,400
Xiu, you're here.

678
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:53,410
Don't be angry.

679
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,070
Go inside.

680
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,290
I'll talk to her.

681
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,400
Calm down.

682
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,810
Getting angry is bad for your health.

683
00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:59,010
Come inside quickly.

684
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,000
Auntie,

685
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:05,000
if you want
the first-meeting gift money back,

686
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,730
that's fine.

687
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,320
But I remember

688
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,550
when my parents first met Zhang Qiran,

689
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,360
they also gave him a gift

690
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,920
based on what you gave me.

691
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:14,550
Both sides are even,

692
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,940
yet you're demanding money today.

693
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,340
What's the logic in that?

694
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:19,630
That was received by Qiran.

695
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:20,440
It never went through my hands.

696
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,240
What about the engagement banquet?

697
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,840
You don't argue about that.

698
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:25,850
My parents upgraded the venue.

699
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:28,230
You didn't even mention the cost
and that's fine,

700
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:29,510
but you immediately added

701
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:31,440
another table for your relatives.

702
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,670
She has the nerve to ask for money?

703
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:34,200
Exactly.

704
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,880
You seem

705
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,590
more pitiful than me,

706
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,840
who got dumped.

707
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,280
I will never have
anything to do with your son

708
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,800
for the rest of my life.

709
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,400
But you and that kind of person

710
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:47,370
will probably be tied together forever.

711
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,320
Auntie,

712
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,500
I'll see you out one last time.

713
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,190
If you're looking for a short-term rental,

714
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,800
it's indeed a bit troublesome.

715
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,190
As soon as I hear from Granny Chen,

716
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,920
I'll let you know immediately.

717
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,190
Okay.

718
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,590
Please move.

719
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,280
Xiu!

720
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,590
Coming.

721
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,590
Oh, please.

722
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:38,320
Control your temper, will you?

723
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,070
Xiu lives here.

724
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,110
If you make a scene everywhere,

725
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,920
how can she continue living here?

726
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,920
Really.

727
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:46,550
Mom, Dad.

728
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,760
I'm sorry.

729
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,290
It's all because of me.

730
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,070
That's not right.

731
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,710
How could this be your fault?

732
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:54,230
It's like walking down the street

733
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:56,230
and stepping in dog poop
someone left behind.

734
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:58,630
You can't blame yourself
for your bad luck.

735
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:59,990
We're eating here.

736
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,760
Fine, I'll stop talking.

737
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,280
Here.

738
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,500
Have some soup.

739
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:05,670
Come sit down.

740
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,670
You should go back to work now.

741
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,590
You can't stay on vacation
at home forever.

742
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:13,590
This isn't right.

743
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:14,440
Besides,

744
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,510
no matter what,

745
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:18,400
your current job is quite stable.

746
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,070
We'll find you an even better man later.

747
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:22,710
He'll definitely be better
than that Zhang guy.

748
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:23,220
Right?

749
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:23,960
Dad,

750
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:26,210
actually, I've already qu...

751
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,120
What's wrong?

752
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,110
It hurts.

753
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:31,120
I think it's going to rain
in a couple of days.

754
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,190
What did you just say?

755
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:35,030
What's wrong?

756
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,060
I've made up my mind.

757
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,560
I'm fine. I'll work hard.

758
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,240
I just saw my parents off.

759
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:50,670
My mom brought you some side dishes.

760
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,070
Thank her for me.

761
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:54,360
I guess they're finally relieved now.

762
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:56,840
Did you tell them

763
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:58,400
about your job?

764
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,840
It's okay.

765
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:03,070
Once you find a new job in a few days,

766
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:04,930
they won't say anything about it.

767
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:07,150
I have to go to
the park managers' meeting tonight.

768
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,150
Talk to you later.
