I got it.

00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:41,880
That's good.

44
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,800
He found her. She's fine.

45
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,240
You must be hungry. Let's eat first.

46
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,390
Hello.

47
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,000
You were in your room all afternoon

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
and didn't go out?

49
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,670
I was tied up with work.

50
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:00,660
What about you?

51
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,850
I did a lot of things too.

52
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,080
Like what?

53
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,120
I sat on the terrace,

54
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,440
ate some fruit the hotel delivered,

55
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,310
drank a little wine,

56
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,960
and enjoyed the breeze.

57
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,430
And I cleared out some photos on my phone.

58
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,070
Anyway,

59
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,310
I've never felt as relaxed

60
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,310
as I do today during this whole time.

61
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,120
Alright.

62
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,830
Just for this relaxed mood of yours,

63
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,630
let's have a proper drink later.

64
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,680
I booked some good wine in advance.

65
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,550
Since they are not coming,

66
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,950
it's all for the two of us.

67
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,720
Xiu and Xiao aren't coming?

68
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,830
Xiao just told me on the phone.

69
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,570
Where did they go?

70
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:46,810
Where are we going?

71
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,530
You'll know when we get there.

72
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,700
How did you know
there's an observation deck?

73
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,050
I looked it up in a guide.

74
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:28,510
Looks like
Mr. Xiao took this quite seriously.

75
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,270
Actually,

76
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,560
I prepared something else too.

77
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:36,390
Come here.

78
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,280
You looked this up in a guide too?

79
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,110
Are you still angry now?

80
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,000
Angry?

81
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,520
I'm not angry.

82
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,190
I just...

83
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:18,950
I was just scared.

84
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,770
When I was very little,

85
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,250
my dad also suddenly disappeared one day.

86
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,640
When I saw him again,

87
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,750
something already happened to him.

88
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,450
That's why I was a bit...

89
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:03,870
Hu Xiu.

90
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,510
Do you still remember the balloons

91
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,240
that fell on your roof that day?

92
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,870
Yes.

93
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,560
Without you,

94
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,070
I think I'd be like those balloons.

95
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,920
I don't know where I'd have drifted.

96
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,310
So,

97
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,260
don't leave me not knowing where you are.

98
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,520
Let me always be able to see you.

99
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,040
I promise you.

100
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,170
And I will always hold you tight.

101
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,270
What kind of awful wine is this?

102
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,870
It's way too strong.

103
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,320
You...

104
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,600
You drank a whole bottle yourself.

105
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,820
Of course I had to catch up.

106
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,170
But it really is pretty strong.

107
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,560
Are you two doing alright?

108
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,420
This is the free hangover soup
offered by our hotel.

109
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:26,360
I'm sorry

110
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,360
for causing you trouble yesterday.

111
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,550
-Sorry for the trouble.
-Thank you.

112
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,670
At this hour,

113
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,290
Xiu probably isn't awake yet, right?

114
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,290
Probably not.

115
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,240
What's wrong?

116
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,540
I didn't come back all night.

117
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:53,870
Why are you feeling guilty?

118
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,630
Are you worried she'll misunderstand us?

119
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,880
Just relax.

120
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,090
How could there be anything between us?

121
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,550
Just hurry back and sleep.

122
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,540
Wait, who's thinking about that?

123
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,630
You haven't even been in a relationship.

124
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,460
You and me—

125
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:05,720
of course it's impossible.

126
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,030
Why are you bringing this up again?

127
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,510
I...

128
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,510
You little vir...

129
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:09,610
What...

130
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,360
are you two doing here?

131
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,330
Where did you go last night?

132
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,600
The quilt in the room

133
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,390
was folded neatly.

134
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,850
So where did you go last night?

135
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,910
You slept on the sofa without a quilt?

136
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:29,560
I won't tell you.

137
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,320
You tell me first.

138
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:30,720
You tell me.

139
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,790
Where did you two go?

140
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,470
What did you two do?

141
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:32,960
You tell me.

142
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,510
If you tell me, I'll tell you.

143
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,240
I'm curious. You...

144
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:34,810
You tell me first.

145
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:35,950
-You tell me first.
-I won't.

146
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:36,480
Let's go.

147
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,290
They were gossiping about us just now.

148
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,390
Look at them.

149
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,960
-Why?
-Being all lovey-dovey.

150
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,290
We didn't say anything.

151
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,380
We've arrived?

152
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:58,340
This is the parking lot in your community.

153
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:02,200
Driving all day is pretty tiring,

154
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,270
and the fuel is low.

155
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,670
So I drove straight back.

156
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,900
Then rest early.

157
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,130
I'll take a taxi home.

158
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,430
Don't go back.

159
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,280
It's already so late.

160
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,650
Just stay here tonight.

161
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,960
I... I didn't bring my things...

162
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,560
Your luggage is in the trunk.

163
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,780
I'll go get a bottle of water.

164
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,120
Is this still your home?

165
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,200
Last time you came here,

166
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,720
I didn't prepare anything.

167
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,000
So I learned my lesson.

168
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:21,750
Also,

169
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,200
I noticed
you often have stomach discomfort.

170
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,240
This medicine is good for your stomach.

171
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,700
I wanted to buy it earlier.

172
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,100
And don't drink icy water anymore.

173
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,240
I'll make you a cup
of dark plum and tangerine peel tea.

174
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,080
It's similar to this one.

175
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,510
Both are good for your stomach.

176
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,750
I'll make you something to eat too.

177
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,810
Come out and eat after you freshen up.

178
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:44,210
Just make something simple.

179
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,310
I'll go put away my luggage.

180
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,510
Um...

181
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,570
I only brought pajamas.

182
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,130
I didn't bring loungewear.

183
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You can wear mine.

184
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:02,910
There are new ones in the bedroom closet.

185
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:03,580
Go pick one.

186
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,600
How come I never noticed before

187
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,150
your clothes are this big?

188
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,030
If I walk around the room,

189
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,760
I could mop the floor with them.

190
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,510
There are no fresh vegetables
in the fridge.

191
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,580
Let's make do with what we have.

192
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,100
Come.

193
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,080
Thanks.

194
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,850
Here, wait a second.

195
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,210
Why aren't you eating?

196
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,580
I'm not hungry.

197
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,050
I'm not hungry either,

198
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,330
but eat with me anyway.

199
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:55,240
What dishes would you like tomorrow?

200
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,170
I'll go buy them.

201
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,740
Stay here for a few more days.

202
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:08,840
Why...

203
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:13,190
Why... Why are we suddenly...

204
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,200
g-going to...

205
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,470
I...

206
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,940
We are already together.

207
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,800
So what if we live together?

208
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,210
Don't you agree?

209
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:27,670
Why do I feel

210
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,800
you inviting me here today was a setup?

211
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,510
I just don't want to be apart from you.

212
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,240
No setup.

213
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,720
So Mr. Xiao, when you're in love,

214
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,970
you're this clingy.

215
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,550
Where is he?

216
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,880
You're here.

217
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,120
Are you sleepy?

218
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:02,000
If you've freshened up, go to sleep first.

219
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,510
What's wrong?

220
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,350
What happened?

221
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:07,810
Nothing.

222
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,300
Just work-related stuff.

223
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,590
Don't wait for me.

224
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,510
Go rest first.

225
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,050
Don't stay up too late.

226
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,540
He asked me to stay,

227
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,830
but he's busy with work now.

228
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,200
You're awake.

229
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,280
You've already washed up and gotten ready?

230
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,780
I haven't brushed my teeth.

231
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:16,580
It's okay.

232
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,020
Fine.

233
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:22,970
I made breakfast.

234
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,370
Eat before you go to work.

235
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,000
By the way,

236
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:26,960
later,

237
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,700
I'll register your fingerprint.

238
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,320
I need to go out
to handle some things today,

239
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,680
so I can't drive you to the company.

240
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,280
I'll call a car for you later.

241
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,040
After work, come back first.

242
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,410
I'll be back later.

243
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,760
You'll be busy all day?

244
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,040
Is it something very important?

245
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,650
Alright.

246
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,070
Mr. Pei.

247
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,350
Come in.

248
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,920
During the morning meeting today,

249
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,650
I noticed you didn't look well.

250
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,710
You should take some medicine.

251
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,520
Leave it here.

252
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:11,880
Mr. Pei.

253
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:17,510
Chairman doesn't want you involved
in the company's financial matters.

254
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,880
Why go against him?

255
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:27,850
I'm the general manager of this company.

256
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,060
What happened to the company,

257
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,400
how many things he's hiding from me—

258
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,030
I need to know.

259
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,260
I need to think of ways to handle them.

260
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:39,810
Over the past 6 months,

261
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:42,600
the entire industry has been struggling.

262
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,380
The current situation at Forma

263
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,580
isn't your fault.

264
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,840
I must protect Forma.

265
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:54,960
After all...

266
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,140
What's up?

267
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,160
Someone at reception wants to see Mr. Pei,

268
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,360
saying she's here to return a lunchbox.

269
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:09,790
Mr. Pei,

270
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:13,010
reception said
someone brought you a lunchbox.

271
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:18,110
Tell her to wait for me.

272
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,840
I'll be downstairs right away.

273
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,270
Mr. Xiao, it seems your workload

274
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:02,000
still isn't saturated enough.

275
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:05,130
You still have time
to run errands for someone else.

276
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,100
Using returning something
as an excuse to meet—

277
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,200
Mr. Pei, this little trick of yours

278
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,460
can't be more obvious.

279
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,640
Your plan failed,

280
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,810
so now you're angry?

281
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:27,190
Tell your father
to stop investigating Hu Xiu.

282
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:31,710
What?

283
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:35,480
These past few days,
someone has been tailing Hu Xiu.

284
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:37,810
From the studio to the area near her home,

285
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:40,340
her movements
have been under surveillance.

286
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:43,380
What makes you say my father did it?

287
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,310
A black Buick sedan,

288
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,190
with the plate ending BF69H.

289
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:48,350
If you don't believe me,

290
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,880
you can check for yourself.

291
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:53,790
Actually, this isn't the first time

292
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,470
your father has done something like this.

293
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,730
Back when I was abroad,

294
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,480
right after I left the Pei family,

295
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,240
there were his eyes watching me.

296
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,270
I warned you before:

297
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,590
don't make Hu Xiu

298
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,320
pay for your wishful thinking.

299
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,550
Those things you did for her—

300
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:22,210
for now, I believe
you did them out of sincerity.

301
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,160
But now,

302
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,540
you've seen the consequences.

303
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,380
Please stay away from her.

304
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,050
I will protect her.

305
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,550
Facing him—

306
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:50,170
do you dare?

307
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,200
Mr. Pei,

308
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,240
can you...

309
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,130
please say something?

310
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,660
What should... What should I do?

311
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,570
Follow
the regulatory department's requirements.

312
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,830
Since the factory's emissions
exceed standards,

313
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,470
the report against you is justified.

314
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:27,400
Just rectify it.

315
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,510
Well,

316
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:33,160
I'm not worried about the rectification.

317
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,790
For this order,

318
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:36,570
I mortgaged everything I own.

319
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,790
I took bank loans

320
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,380
to buy equipment and expand production.

321
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:39,860
I...

322
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,940
I even borrowed from loan sharks.

323
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:45,880
So...

324
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,080
So if the factory stops production,

325
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,480
the order falls through.

326
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,870
How am I supposed
to pay back such a huge sum?

327
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:55,070
Such a big piece of meat was given to you,

328
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:57,550
put right at your lips,
and you still starve?

329
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,200
I... I...

330
00:25:59,310 --> 00:25:59,920
Mr. Pei,

331
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,000
there's a loan shark debt due soon.

332
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:05,030
Can you please show some mercy?

333
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,830
I've supported you for 20 years.

334
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,070
Even a dog

335
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,160
should learn to find its own food by now.

336
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,600
Mr. Pei.

337
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,350
You... really...

338
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:26,000
can't refuse to help me.

339
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,060
Of course I can.

340
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,110
Aren't you worried I'll...

341
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,310
Worried you'll what?

342
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,070
What happened 20 years ago—

343
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:46,920
I've always...

344
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,250
Are you threatening me?

345
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,350
Just with your made-up story,

346
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:53,010
you think you can threaten me?

347
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,240
Did I make it up?

348
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,030
Pei Kanghua,

349
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:58,090
you'd better not push me!

350
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:58,970
Show him out!

351
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,640
Mr. Huang,

352
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:07,960
please.

353
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,110
If you won't leave,

354
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:13,320
I can have security escort you out.

355
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,200
From now on,

356
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:18,230
don't let this person come in again.

357
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:18,920
Yes.

358
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:22,270
Please.

359
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:40,430
Mr. Pei, what's wrong?

360
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,480
Mr. Pei! Mr. Pei!

361
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,200
Get out of my way!

362
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,110
Wait, Mr. Pei!

363
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:45,940
Mr. Pei!

364
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:53,010
I'm sorry, Chairman.

365
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,650
Why did you send people to watch Hu Xiu?

366
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:59,690
How did you find out about her?

367
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,810
Was it Xiao Wanyue?

368
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,350
What nonsense did she say?

369
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,830
She is your elder.

370
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,810
Don't you even know basic manners?

371
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,280
What you do every day,

372
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,200
who you meet—

373
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,370
is there anything I don't know?

374
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,400
Do I need others to tell me?

375
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,200
Hu Xiu...

376
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,920
has nothing to do with me.

377
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:47,800
It's just my wishful thinking.

378
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:49,240
Dad,

379
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:52,740
can you stop sending people to bother her?

380
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,970
Do you think I'm putting on some act

381
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,370
to break you two up?

382
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,880
You and that girl Hu Xiu
have been in contact

383
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,160
for quite some time.

384
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,590
Do you really not know

385
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:05,600
who her father is?

386
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,390
Too careless.

387
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:27,740
[Forma Group]

388
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,910
Are you blind?

389
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,310
Hu Xiu.

390
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,230
Much cuter than now.

391
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,360
You're back!

392
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:59,510
I haven't seen you all day.

393
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,710
How was your day?

394
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:04,370
Was your commute smooth?

395
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,940
I took taxis both ways.

396
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,320
Of course it was smooth.

397
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,320
It's just that the fare is a bit high.

398
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,840
I'll drive you tomorrow.

399
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,200
Have you had dinner?

400
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,310
No.

401
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,680
I'm at your place,

402
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,740
so of course I'm freeloading off you.

403
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:19,250
I want to eat what you cook.

404
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,720
I bought groceries.

405
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,980
They're in the fridge.

406
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:26,520
So that's what you really want.

407
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:27,710
By the way,

408
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:29,830
I also bought quite a few things.

409
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,440
Just daily necessities and such.

410
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,700
You don't mind, do you?

411
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,220
Of course I don't mind.

412
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:36,710
I like that you make yourself at home.

413
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,880
And I like...

414
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,390
that I can see you as soon as I come home.

415
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,160
I meant for you to carry me.

416
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:51,480
I forgot to put on slippers
when I came in just now.

417
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,210
Let's go!

418
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,870
Go to the kitchen to order!

419
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,640
Find the slippers first.

420
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,400
Where are your slippers?

421
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,640
I... I remember I put them here.

422
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:10,240
Where?

423
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:13,070
Are they... Are they under the sofa?

424
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:14,530
You're fooling me?

425
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,520
That's exactly what I'm doing.

426
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:20,420
You're fooling me, huh?

427
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,770
You're fooling me, huh?

428
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:23,070
No tickling. No tickling!

429
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,130
Are you fooling me?

430
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:24,750
Are you?

431
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,960
Who told you to come back so late?

432
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,560
Come here.

433
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:28,680
Go.

434
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,550
Go cook.

435
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,960
I'm starving.

436
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,440
Come here. Don't run.

437
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,400
Hurry, I'm getting hypoglycemic.

438
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,030
Come here.

439
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:36,260
I'm really dizzy right now.

440
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,520
I need to eat. Let's go.

441
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:58,520
What are you doing in the study?

442
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,000
I asked you to live here,

443
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,240
not to work overtime.

444
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,920
I came to put up a photo.

445
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,000
A photo taken when we were out having fun?

446
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,960
While I was tidying up,

447
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,320
I saw this photo

448
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:19,770
and thought it needed a frame.

449
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:22,280
So I ordered one online.

450
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,590
I didn't expect it to arrive so fast.

451
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:39,719
With a frame,

452
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:42,090
the photo can be preserved longer.

453
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,000
So it's okay

454
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:46,300
to display it.

455
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:48,590
What do you think?

456
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,190
Just put it here.

457
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,960
I think

458
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,190
you look a lot like your father.

459
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:59,070
Not just in looks—

460
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,030
you even have a similar style.

461
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,280
When you have time,

462
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:12,030
tell me about your dad.

463
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:16,880
Okay.

464
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,440
But there's no rush.

465
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,830
Whenever you feel like talking,

466
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:24,320
I'll be here.

467
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,960
Mr. Xiao,
a friend of yours is here to see you.

468
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,020
I asked him to wait in the lounge area.

469
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:05,230
Mr. Xiao.

470
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,710
What are you doing here?

471
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:12,050
It's about the new instance dungeon.

472
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:14,190
You haven't been at the club for days.

473
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:15,980
I didn't dare go to your home,

474
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,290
worried there might be a girl there.

475
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,110
Get to the point.

476
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,490
I have a meeting this afternoon.

477
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:26,220
Your big project is already settled.

478
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,030
Why are you still so busy?

479
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,230
Listen,

480
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:31,200
ignoring the collaboration event
is one thing.

481
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,460
But now you're not even playing anymore.

482
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,320
Even without me there,

483
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,250
doesn't everything run just fine?

484
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:37,480
That's not the same.

485
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:38,760
Xiao,

486
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:40,710
regarding the club matters,

487
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,770
you still need to make the decisions.

488
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,480
Recently, the collaboration event

489
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:43,880
with Regard Café

490
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,630
has been

491
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:45,830
well received, right?

492
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:46,790
So I'm thinking,

493
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,400
if we introduce a new instance dungeon
in the second half of the year,

494
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,000
should we try something new?

495
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,840
You decide.

496
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:55,740
You'll be in charge of the club
from now on.

497
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:56,960
Wait.

498
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:58,920
I...

499
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,320
I'll be in charge?

500
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:01,670
Then...

501
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,070
you're not getting involved anymore?

502
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:04,000
What do you mean?

503
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:05,550
I...

504
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,850
plan to step back from the club

505
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:08,850
and stop playing.

506
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:10,400
Wait, wait.

507
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,960
Don't... Don't joke with me.

508
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:16,630
You... You're just quitting like that?

509
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:17,630
If you quit,

510
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:18,400
what am I supposed to do?

511
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,200
The club will lose its backbone.

512
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:22,280
After running it for so long,

513
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,550
haven't you realized

514
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,810
you're the backbone of this club?

515
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:28,370
I only handled design-related stuff.

516
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,480
Besides, the operations

517
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,490
are basically stable now.

518
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:32,300
You can do it.

519
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,440
But...

520
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,150
your...

521
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,320
your decision is too sudden.

522
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,320
Before, playing as an NPC

523
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,120
was just a way to relieve stress.

524
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,670
But now...

525
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:51,440
Qin Xiaoyi

526
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:54,530
shouldn't be trapped in Rongcheng anymore.

527
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:01,510
Alright then.

528
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,050
Since you've made up your mind,

529
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:06,040
I won't say more.

530
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:09,110
Give me some time to prepare.

531
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:11,280
Mr. Xiao.

532
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:13,070
Zhiyu,

533
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,980
you haven't had lunch, right?

534
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:16,740
Mom.

535
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,230
Hello, Mrs. Xiao.

536
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,480
You are...

537
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,540
I'm Gong Huaicong,

538
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,480
Xiao Zhiyu's classmate in the U.S.

539
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:26,970
We met at graduation.

540
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,590
I came to deliver some food.

541
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:32,330
You can eat together later.

542
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:33,860
Okay. Thank you, Mrs. Xiao.

543
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,000
Zhiyu,

544
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,460
the soup you loved last time—

545
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,780
I made some more.

546
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:40,440
And I brought some side dishes too.

547
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,670
She came to see you.

548
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:43,770
Were you happy?

549
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,550
I think...

550
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:47,480
I was happy.

551
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:50,550
Then don't hide what you think.

552
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,400
That way, others will know

553
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,510
what you like,

554
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,590
what you need,

555
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:55,790
and what you hope for.

556
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:58,040
As long as the other person cares too,

557
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,520
your relationship can be rebuilt quickly.

558
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,320
Thanks, Mom.

559
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,530
Xiao.

560
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:09,550
Your mom is so good to you.

561
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,410
I can smell it even with the lid on.

562
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,300
I'll take this over there first.

563
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,550
Zhiyu,

564
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:23,500
do you remember our neighbor in the U.S.,

565
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,540
Mr. Wu?

566
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:26,380
His family came to Shanghai.

567
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:29,320
They want
to get both our families together.

568
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,280
Especially you—

569
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:32,590
you haven't seen them for years, right?

570
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:35,760
I haven't seen them since graduation.

571
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:39,720
Zhen now has someone he likes.

572
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:41,790
I also hope you'll have a companion

573
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:43,140
by your side soon.

574
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,670
Luna went to high school with you,

575
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:48,430
and you got along well.

576
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,760
You know each other's backgrounds,
and you were neighbors.

577
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,360
You should contact her more
when you have time.

578
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:56,920
Alright.

579
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:57,880
Mom, I got it.

580
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,070
Um...

581
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:02,800
Mr. Wu's family
is staying at Meilai Hotel.

582
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:04,070
Tomorrow evening,

583
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:07,010
we'll have dinner in a private room
on the second floor.

584
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:08,530
Come if you're free.

585
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,340
I'll be going now.

586
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,040
You stay seated.

587
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:15,340
Take care, Mrs. Xiao.

588
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,360
I'll walk you out.

589
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,230
This...

590
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:31,630
Stop pretending.

591
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:34,630
Um...

592
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:35,190
Luna...

593
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,120
Shut your mouth.

594
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:37,930
Let me tell you.

595
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,080
Don't mention

596
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:40,950
a single word about this to Hu Xiu.

597
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:42,540
Yes, sir.
