[Episode 6]

3
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:58,750
Slow down.

4
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,440
Slow down.

5
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,450
I...

6
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:04,950
I...

7
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,160
I...

8
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,330
D-Don't throw up on me.

9
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,050
Why do you have the key to my house?

10
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,510
Come on, come on.

11
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:23,420
Come on.

12
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,180
Up there is...

13
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,310
They're sleeping. Be quiet.

14
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:32,970
My house...

15
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,390
Open the door.

16
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,579
Did you bring the key?

17
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,320
Take it.

18
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,630
Mr. Xiao.

19
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,390
I'd rather lose

20
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,579
than run away.

21
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,980
Why am I here?

22
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,150
Hu Xiu,

23
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,240
is that you?

24
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,870
Yes, it's me.

25
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,120
I'm sorry. I...

26
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,700
I don't know why I'm here.

27
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:03,680
I remember I had a meal

28
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,770
and drank some wine,

29
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,460
and suddenly showed up here.

30
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:08,510
I know.

31
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,690
You know I'm here?

32
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,500
That's not the point.

33
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,740
Then what is the point? I...

34
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:19,030
The point is that the lock
of the attic is broken.

35
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,550
Why did you lock the door for no reason?

36
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,000
You were not trying to keep me out,
were you?

37
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,250
Do you have any idea
what you're like when you're drunk?

38
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,580
I still wouldn't barge into someone else's
room on purpose.

39
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,370
I don't care.

40
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,210
Get this door unlocked right now.

41
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:37,980
What time do you think it is now?

42
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,210
Where am I supposed
to find a locksmith for you?

43
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,060
I'm thirsty.

44
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,890
I can't even get water in to you.

45
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,250
Thanks.

46
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:55,590
You're welcome.

47
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:56,940
Mr. Xiao.

48
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,860
It's so late. Are you

49
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,740
still up, or did you

50
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:01,940
just wake up?

51
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:03,130
Still up.

52
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,010
Not comfortable staying in the attic?

53
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,300
No. Just working.

54
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,010
So dedicated.

55
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:13,010
You were busy with the Lyman project,
weren't you?

56
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:14,740
Mr. Xiao,

57
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,500
you moved into this lane

58
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,110
because of the Lyman's
project competition?

59
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:21,420
But I heard

60
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,810
Zhuling will also participate
in the competition.

61
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:24,660
So what?

62
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,030
You think I'll lose to Zhuling?

63
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,540
Of course not.

64
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,180
I believe

65
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,090
Dynamism won't lose.

66
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:32,730
Why?

67
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,330
It's only your first day on the job.

68
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,980
What's wrong with my first day?

69
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,620
I've been following

70
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,330
Dynamism

71
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,250
for 3 years.

72
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,659
My knowledge about it

73
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,800
is only slightly less than yours,

74
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,890
despite your position as founder.

75
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,060
Why did you suddenly drink tonight?

76
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,870
I wanted to apologize.

77
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:57,940
Apologize?

78
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,409
What did you do wrong?

79
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:03,940
If you can't even say

80
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:04,890
what you did wrong,

81
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,750
then why do you need to apologize?

82
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,160
I just felt I should make a gesture.

83
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:12,180
After all, I was too outspoken before

84
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,250
and said many

85
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,740
thoughtless things.

86
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:19,190
And I misunderstood
that you blocked my interview.

87
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,700
If you put it that way,

88
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,300
then I should apologize too.

89
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,740
The day we signed the leasing contract,

90
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,140
I originally wanted
to give you a heads-up.

91
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,620
Because this job

92
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,400
isn't any easier
than being a GM assistant.

93
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,100
Moreover, your family

94
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,740
doesn't even know about your decision.

95
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,800
That's definitely

96
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:39,770
trouble from both inside and out.

97
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,650
Then why did you pass me in the interview?

98
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,659
Was it because of
our landlord-tenant relationship

99
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:55,190
that you gave me a shortcut?

100
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,370
After hearing all my stories

101
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,690
about setbacks, regrets, and failures,

102
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:00,420
did you think

103
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,620
I was particularly miserable?

104
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,280
So you gave me the green light?

105
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:07,770
It was indeed a shortcut.

106
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,750
But what this shortcut didn't show me

107
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,960
what you said about setbacks,

108
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:15,660
regrets,

109
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,710
or failures.

110
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,410
Then what did it show you?

111
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:21,890

Of course, you're not worried.

170
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,850

at the lane entrance first.

171
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,650
Then you can ride with me to work.

00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,120
What are you doing?

173
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:39,020
That was our colleague
from the studio just now, right?

174
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,140
It's not good to be seen.

175
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,670
They might misunderstand our relationship.

176
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,330
I haven't accomplished anything yet.

177
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,970
If people say I got the job
through the back door,

178
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49,970
I wouldn't be able to defend myself.

179
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,180
Drive to the back of the studio,

180
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,440
and I'll get out there.

181
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,930
Do I look like someone
who would give people special treatment?

182
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,450
Mr. Xiao, remember to get out later.

183
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,490
I'm going first.

184
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:32,370
Mr. Xiao,

185
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,320
didn't you say you'd get off later?

186
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:36,450
I didn't do anything wrong.

187
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,800
Have you seen?

188
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,540
Yes.

189
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,490
Is it true?

190
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,090
Did Mr. Xiao really say that?

191
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,260
Is that the point?

192
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,820
The point should be
who the whistleblower is.

193
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:54,420
Look.

194
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:58,470
[Xinrui Design Chases Fame:
Newbie Xiao Zhiyu Sparks Controversy]

195
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,030
Lyman has disqualified us
from the competition.

196
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,930
Sun Daqin is in charge of
this project competition.

197
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,790
Have you been able to contact him?

198
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,690
I've called Mr. Sun several times,

199
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:22,060
but he's not answering.

200
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,300
Logically speaking,

201
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,810
even if there had been a debate
about those words,

202
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,810
they never would have caused a stir.

203
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,540
But shortly after this news was released,

204
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,900
a bunch of industry insiders
rushed in to discuss it.

205
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,180
The strangest thing is,

206
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,020
it's been brewing for a short while,

207
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,480
and Lyman has directly disqualified us
from the competition.

208
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:41,380
This news is deliberately targeted
at this competition.

209
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,850
Public opinion is just an excuse
for the disqualification.

210
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:46,380
Someone must be pulling strings
behind this.

211
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,090
You mean

212
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,660
someone deliberately wants
to sabotage our participation?

213
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,520
Who could it be?

214
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,450
If Dynamism is out,

215
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,260
whoever benefits

216
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,990
is naturally the one behind it.

217
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,090
Well,

218
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,170
I'll first activate our PR emergency plan

219
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:09,030
to suppress the media attention.

220
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,660
As for Mr. Sun at Lyman,

221
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,050
I'll figure something out.

222
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,290
For this matter,

223
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,340
no matter how many complications
are behind it,

224
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,470
you should focus on your design first.

225
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,780
Our company doesn't have

226
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,710
many employees.

227
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,020
Do you have any idea

228
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:30,930
who leaked the information?

229
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:33,970
Don't worry.

230
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:38,300
This person will expose themselves soon.

231
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,850
Mr. Pei, your tea ceremony skills

232
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,490
are improving day by day.

233
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,660
You flatter me.

234
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,340
Thank you. Thank you.

235
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:54,900
Please try it.

236
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:55,690
Thank you.

237
00:13:58,570 --> 00:13:59,540
For this matter,

238
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,600
I owe you a lot, Mr. Sun.

239
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,490
Mr. Pei, you're being too polite.

240
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:04,610
It was nothing.

241
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,450
Think about your relationship
with Mr. Xie.

242
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,860
Like father and son.

243
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:11,590
These are just formalities.

244
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,060
That may be true,

245
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,850
but I don't want to put Uncle Xie
in a difficult position.

246
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:16,570
Mr. Sun,

247
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,660
what if someone

248
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,690
goes to Uncle Xie

249
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:20,820
to plead their case?

250
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,120
What should Uncle Xie do then?

251
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,460
They wouldn't dare.

252
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,380
As you know,

253
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,770
he lives in seclusion,

254
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:31,690
and I handle all his daily affairs.

255
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,770
If anyone with ill intentions

256
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,310
wants to bother Mr. Xie,

257
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,570
they'll have to get past me first.

258
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,810
Rest assured.

259
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:42,970
Have some tea.

260
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,900
Mr. Pei, everything is done.

261
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,540
When can I start working?

262
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,640
This is the optimized profile.

263
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,700
Please take a look.

264
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:04,020
It's good overall, but

265
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:06,430
there are a few points
that need attention.

266
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:07,450
[Mom]

267
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,750
I need to take this call.

268
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,480
You can go ahead with your work.

269
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:26,940
Zhiyu,

270
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:29,330
am I interrupting you?

271
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,290
No.

272
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,350
It must be late there.

273
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,200
Did something happen?

274
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,460
Nothing.

275
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,760
Your uncle and I are doing fine.

276
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:41,300
Um...

277
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,890
I saw the news online.

278
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,380
Are you okay?

279
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:47,100
I'm fine.

280
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,990
You should still be careful at work.

281
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:52,430
Even when problems arise,

282
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,610
stay calm.

283
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,790
Don't act like your father did.

284
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:01,460
Don't worry.

285
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,260
I'll properly handle my own affairs.

286
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,140
That's good.

287
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:05,850
By the way,

288
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,150
after my discussion with your uncle,

289
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,450
we've decided to return to
Shanghai this year

290
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:12,020
and stay for a while.

291
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:12,900
This way,

292
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:14,330
our family

293
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,960
can reunite soon.

294
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:17,900
Got it.

295
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,320
Hanging up.

296
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:27,260
Sun.

297
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,310
I'm leaving.

298
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:29,390
I'll be off in a sec.

299
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,090
Has he already left work?

300
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:39,780
Xiu, are you off work yet?

301
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,490
I'm running errands near your studio.

302
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,090
Let's have dinner together.

303
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:13,339
I heard someone fell from upstairs.

304
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:15,990
I think it's the architect of this gym.

305
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,770
It must be suicide.

306
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:19,970
Jerk!

307
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,910
Suicide is too easy for you!

308
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:24,619
Don't think you don't have to
take responsibility this way!

309
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:26,730
That consent form
couldn't have been signed by my father.

310
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,660
The gym collapse wasn't his fault.

311
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,140
Is there nothing I can do?

312
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,410
There's one thing you can do.

313
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:35,530
Grow up well.

314
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,360
When you come of age,

315
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,780
and when you have the ability
and resources,

316
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,730
you'll have the chance to unravel

317
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,600
and discover the truth.

318
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,360
Time to clear out!

319
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:49,860
Is anyone still inside?

320
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:02,570
You know what,

321
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,720
the canteen in your park is quite good.

322
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,690
Guangming can get food
even when working overtime.

323
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,140
You bought this for him, right?

324
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,000
He's been working so hard lately.

325
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:12,940
One project just finished,

326
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,100
and now he's busy again.

327
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,560
He doesn't give himself
any breathing room.

328
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:18,420
He's famous for being intense.

329
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,620
Even though I
wasn't in the same department as him,

330
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,350
I've heard of his name long ago.

331
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,180
I know he works very hard.

332
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:26,690
He seems strange lately.

333
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:28,430
I can't put my finger on it.

334
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:30,140
You...

335
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,220
Wait for a sec.

336
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:34,290
What's wrong?

337
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,450
Something happened in the company.

338
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,820
Don't worry. I'll call a taxi for you.

339
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:59,140
He's really calm about this.

340
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,210
Zhou,

341
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:31,940
proceed with the Lyman proposal

342
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:32,970
as planned.

343
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:33,770
Ms. Zhou.

344
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,340
Actually, besides Lyman,

345
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:38,730
we have other projects.

346
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,050
Since we've been disqualified,

347
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,510
isn't it more appropriate

348
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,900
for us to focus our energy

349
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:44,990
on other projects?

350
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,900
Yeah, Ms. Zhou.

351
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,210
What if

352
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,620
we lose sight of other opportunities?

353
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:52,420
Everyone,

354
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:53,770
during our last dinner,

355
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:55,010
we just talked about

356
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,140
making sure our ongoing projects

357
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,270
have good outcomes.

358
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,020
This is just the beginning.

359
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,340
It's a small setback,

360
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,270
and you're already falling apart?

361
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:09,770
Ms. Zhou,

362
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,690
this is the assignment
Mr. Xiao gave earlier.

363
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:13,420
I've compiled all the ideas

364
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,080
regarding the Lyman project.

365
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,140
I'm not quite sure
about the courtyard garden part yet.

366
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,540
Everything else is done.

367
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,620
I see Mr. Xiao hasn't arrived today.

368
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,550
Would you mind taking a look first?

369
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,820
Come with me to Lyman.

370
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:38,730
Ms. Zhou,

371
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,670
isn't Mr. Xiao coming with us?

372
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,800
He'll meet us directly at Lyman.

373
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:05,860
Ms. Zhou.

374
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:07,090
He's here.

375
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,590
You're here.

376
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,420
Hello.

377
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,770
I'm Zhou Yan from Dynamism.

378
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,580
I have an appointment
with Mr. Sun from your company.

379
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,780
Please wait a moment.

380
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:18,010
Please follow me.

381
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:23,830
Okay.

382
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,730
[Lyman Group]

383
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,930
Mr. Sun is still in a meeting.

384
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:30,770
Please wait a moment.

385
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:31,940
Thank you.

386
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,180
You're welcome.

387
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:38,380
What did Sun Daqin say on the phone?

388
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:40,840
He didn't say anything,

389
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,500
just beating around the bush.

390
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,290
I felt this couldn't continue.

391
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:48,690
So I arranged to meet him.

392
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,340
He agreed quite readily.

393
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,620
Does that mean there's still hope?

394
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,520
It depends on how the conversation goes.

395
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:20,380
Hu Xiu, go ask again

396
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,710
what's really going on.

397
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:23,110
No need to ask anymore.

398
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:23,820
Let's go.

399
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,450
Why don't we wait a little longer?

400
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:28,450
Maybe something has held him up.

401
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,690
Mr. Sun never intended to meet with us.

402
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:35,940
I'll contact He

403
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,870
and ask him to bring the car around.

404
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,580
I'm sorry.

405
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:45,860
I made things seem too simple.

406
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,150
I promised you could focus on design,

407
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:49,980
but instead,

408
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:51,580
I dragged you here

409
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:53,270
only to get the cold shoulder.

410
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:54,750
This isn't your fault.

411
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,630
Don't worry,

412
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,170
I'll figure something out.

413
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,460
Why did you bring Hu Xiu here?

414
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:07,900
You know what,

415
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:09,950
that girl is quite clever.

416
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:11,060
And

417
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,810
she works very hard.

418
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:15,450
This is the assignment you gave her

419
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:16,770
on her first day.

420
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,100
After just a few days,

421
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,030
she completed it remarkably well.

422
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:31,730
I have something to attend to,
so I'll go first.

423
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:32,260
Mr. Xiao,

424
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,370
would you mind

425
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,520
giving Hu Xiu a ride?

426
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:38,010
Just drop me off
at the nearest subway station.

427
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:38,610
Thank you.

428
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:39,770
Bye.

429
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:43,780
Let's go.

430
00:23:58,530 --> 00:23:59,340
Let me tell you,

431
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,900
I rarely get a day off.

432
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:02,510
Who is that person?

433
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,580
Sun Daqin from Lyman.

434
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,630
Let's meet another day.

435
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:09,420
Alright.

436
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,250
Mr. Xiao,

437
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:29,170
are you coming back
to the lane for dinner tonight?

438
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:30,930
I know a really good restaurant.

439
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:31,790
I'm not hungry.

440
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,830
The weather is getting cooler.

441
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,810
Is everything okay with your place?

442
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:42,400
Yeah.

443
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,210
Celebrity architects like him

444
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:53,340
rely on marketing

445
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,340
rather than solid professional skills.

446
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,050
They use their popularity to get projects

447
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:59,380
and squeeze out traditional architects.

448
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,620
Just for popularity,

449
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,490
turning architecture
into mere photo backdrops

450
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:03,490
is truly
putting the cart before the horse.

451
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:04,950
Do you have plans tonight?

452
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:06,970
No.

453
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:08,860
Come with me somewhere.

454
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:20,100
Mr. Xiao.

455
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,210
She's with me.

456
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,480
Okay. Please come in.

457
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:31,990
I have a business meeting.

458
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,730
Go wait for me over there.

459
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:35,710
You can order whatever drink you want.

460
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,640
Except alcohol.

461
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,800
Put it on my tab.

462
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,480
Hello, what would you like to drink?

463
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:08,940
Sparkling water.

464
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,470
Okay, please wait a moment.

465
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,290
Mr. Xiao,

466
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,340
I'm sorry

467
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:27,760
for being late.

468
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:28,540
It's fine.

469
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:30,250
I know you've been busy these days,
Mr. Wang.

470
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,450
Have you set the date?

471
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:33,590
This Saturday.

472
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:35,380
You're our VIP guest.

473
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,640
We need your presence.

474
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:37,300
Of course.

475
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,060
Mr. Xiao,

476
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,250
you rarely attend social gatherings,

477
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,910
but you specifically asked me out today.

478
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:48,710
I assume it's not just for small talk.

479
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:53,090
Indeed, I have a favor to ask.

480
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:54,940
For the weekend wedding,

481
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,770
I would like to ask you

482
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:57,370
to invite Mr. Xie from Lyman.

483
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,600
What are you doing?

484
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:08,690
Fighting online.

485
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:09,620
I can't stand watching

486
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,530
these people
making something out of nothing.

487
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:12,970
I have to step in myself.

488
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:16,420
Let me see

489
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:19,190
how they're making
these false accusations.

490
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,820
You made good points.

491
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,210
It's useless, though.

492
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:38,010
My posts are all getting buried.

493
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,660
Don't waste your energy.

494
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,530
No way.

495
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:42,830
This kind of pathetic framing

496
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,010
is full of obvious holes
to anyone with eyes.

497
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:45,860
I've been thinking these...

498
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:46,690
I said it.

499
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:53,720
That statement

500
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:55,250
was from me.

501
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:57,380
W-Why?

502
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,970
H-How did you

503
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,310
-say...
-Let's go.

504
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:12,820
Mr. Xiao,

505
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,790
would you like me
to call a designated driver for you?

506
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:17,340
Goodbye, Mr. Xiao.

507
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,780
Aren't we leaving together?

508
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:21,740
I'll just get a taxi myself.

509
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,980
Then who's going to drive for me?

510
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:28,910
No wonder you didn't let me drink.

511
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,640
What?

512
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:34,850
Nothing.

513
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:35,760
I can drive.

514
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:58,690
Xiaorou.

515
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:00,860
Zhan Jie, are you at the office?

516
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,100
I am.

517
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:02,940
What's wrong?

518
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,540
I've been texting Wang all evening.

519
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,470
I can't find him.

520
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,710
He's not responding.

521
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:10,210
It's okay, Xiaorou.

522
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:12,450
He's working overtime at the office.

523
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,860
Probably busy coding.

524
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:15,340
He might not have noticed his phone.

525
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:17,340
I came out to buy late-night snacks.

526
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,720
I'll tell him when I get back.

527
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,480
Don't worry.

528
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:21,620
Okay, thanks for your help.

529
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,100
Miss.

530
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,380
There's traffic ahead.

531
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,490
Would it be convenient
for you to get off here?

532
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:30,420
It's only a few hundred meters
to your neighborhood.

533
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:31,900
Alright.

534
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,290
Thank you.

535
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,190
No problem. I've already paid.

536
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:35,730
Okay.

537
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:40,140
Zhan Jie?

538
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:40,880
Thank you, Sir.

539
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,740
Didn't he say he was working overtime
at the office?

540
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:18,100
Xiaorou?

541
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,930
What are you doing here?

542
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:23,450
Take me upstairs.

543
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:25,290
Wang is upstairs, right?

544
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:25,860
My place

545
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,030
is really messy.

546
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,760
It's not convenient today.

547
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,620
Since when did you

548
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,420
move near our place?

549
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:36,770
Just moved in.

550
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,450
I...

551
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,490
Fine,

552
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:40,140
I'll go up by myself.

553
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:42,570
Xiaorou!

554
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:46,930
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

555
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,530
Xiaorou!

556
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:04,690
Done!

557
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:07,900
Xiaorou.

558
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:13,530
The first one in so many days.

559
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:14,770
We can all testify to that.

560
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:15,490
Yes, that's right.

561
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:17,890
-The first one.
-Definitely the first one.

562
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:27,580
So you've been

563
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:29,070
busy with all this lately?

564
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:37,140
Why didn't you tell me you quit your job?

565
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,890
You weren't laid off, were you?

566
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,440
Don't laugh.

567
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:50,290
Were you really laid off?

568
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,040
I wasn't laid off.

569
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,500
And I didn't quit either.

570
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:58,530
We are planning to start a business.

571
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,210
I didn't tell you before

572
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,270
because things weren't on track yet.

573
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,080
I didn't want you to worry.

574
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,380
Since you didn't quit,

575
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,820
why do you start a business
when everything's going fine?

576
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,580
Many technical staff

577
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,860
eventually moved into management roles.

578
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:14,320
Although our company offers good benefits,

579
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,260
there's basically no hope

580
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,790
for me to switch positions.

581
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,800
I don't want to travel all the time,

582
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,530
constantly on business trips,

583
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:22,230
leaving you to live alone.

584
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:32,340
I've made up my mind.

585
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,860
If you really want to start a business,

586
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,010
just quit your job

587
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:35,820
and focus on it.

588
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,530
I support you.

589
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:37,770
I can't quit my job.

590
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:39,950
If I can earn extra money,

591
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,350
why should I give that up?

592
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,690
We still need to get a new house.

593
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:45,820
Have you forgotten?

594
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,050
I have a card.

595
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:49,820
Since the café started making a profit,

596
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,620
I've saved all the money

597
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,730
you've given me.

598
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:52,860
Take it and use it.

599
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:53,970
Consider it my investment,

600
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:54,450
okay?

601
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:55,180
No way.

602
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:56,820
I already have money.

603
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:58,180
Honey,

604
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,660
listen to me.

605
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,100
Our current life

606
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,700
is already satisfying to me.

607
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,380
As for money,

608
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,780
we can earn it gradually.

609
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:09,490
We'll get a bigger house

610
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:10,660
sooner or later.

611
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,730
Don't worry.

612
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,460
Don't feel pressured.

613
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:16,290
I believe our life

614
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:18,490
will definitely get better and better.

615
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,530
Okay?

616
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:23,110
Don't be sad.

617
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:23,730
Okay.

618
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:24,860
Don't think about it.

619
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,420
Alright.

620
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:26,660
Everything will be fine.

621
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,210
It will be fine.

622
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:28,410
Things will work out!

623
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,620
Things will work out!

624
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:37,090
[Xie Lin]

625
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:46,860
Where am I supposed to find this person?

626
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,210
Should I just camp outside the Lyman Group

627
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:49,210
every day?

628
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,010
Xie Lin.

629
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:01,380
Come with me to a wedding this weekend.

630
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:03,250
Instead of finding that person,

631
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,180
he actually plans to attend some wedding.

632
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,140
The spectator frets

633
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,340
more than the player.

634
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:20,420
Mr. Xiao.

635
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:23,270
Are you sure this navigation is correct?

636
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:26,110
Who would hold a wedding
in the middle of nowhere?

637
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,130
Now I understand

638
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,699
why you asked me to come along.

639
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:35,159
You're really treating me
like your driver.

640
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,070
Don't worry.

641
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:55,219
This is the place.

642
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:02,300
The wedding is on the island.

643
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,080
We need to take a boat
from the dock to get there.

644
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:04,940
Then, Mr. Xiao,

645
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,530
please tell me when it will end,

646
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:08,260
so I'll schedule to pick you up.

647
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,410
You're coming with me.

648
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,860
What would I do there?

649
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,920
I don't even know the bride and groom.

650
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:15,130
You're my date.

651
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:29,400

Let me take a closer look.

663
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:50,250

and the bride's father.

694
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:56,490
Congratulations, Mr. Wang.

695
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:57,380
Thank you.

00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:57,940
Welcome.

Double happiness.

00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:16,340
Dad.

708
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:17,460
Mr. Xiao is here.

709
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,770
Zhiyu.

710
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:20,090
Well then,

00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:21,050
you young people chat,

712
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:22,220
and I'll go attend to the other guests.

713
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:22,740
Okay.

714
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:23,860
Please go ahead.

715
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:24,520
Sure thing.

716
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:26,940
Zhiyu,

717
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:28,300
I knew you'd come today,

718
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,270
but I didn't expect you'd bring a date.

719
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:31,230
Hello, Ms. Wang.

720
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,940
I'm an assistant designer from Dynamism,

721
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:33,450
Hu Xiu.

722
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,220
Hello.

723
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,280
Congratulations.

724
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:41,710
Happy wedding.

725
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,420
Thank you.

726
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,130
The ceremony will be held here shortly.

727
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,740
What do you think of everything arranged?

728
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:47,300
I can see

729
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,010
a lot of thought went into this.

730
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:50,450
My husband prepared everything.

731
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:52,510
I just gave random directions today.

732
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,410
Oh right,

733
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:55,430
you haven't met him yet, have you?

734
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:56,900
Qiran,

735
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:57,830
come over here.

736
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:19,410
Hello.

737
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:20,090
Hello.

738
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,680
I was referred by Mr. Chen.

739
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,000
My name is Zhang Qiran.

740
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:24,730
I'm Hu Xiu.

741
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,540
Wait a moment, Honey.

742
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:49,910
Your strand of hair.

743
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,720
Zhang Qiran, my husband.

744
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:52,900
Qiran,

745
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,700
this is my senior
from when I studied in America,

746
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,900
and also the renowned architect
Xiao Zhiyu.

747
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:57,530
I've heard so much about you.

748
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:58,260
I often

749
00:38:58,450 --> 00:38:59,850
hear our Yue mention you.

750
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,740
Finally get to meet you in person.

751
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:02,870
Pleased to meet you.

752
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:10,890
What's wrong?

753
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:13,940
Is she feeling seasick?

754
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,300
I'll go check on her.

755
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:15,820
Okay.

756
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:19,070
Qiran,

757
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,710
let's greet other guests.

758
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:21,490
Okay.

759
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:25,260
Seasick?

760
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:30,300
No.

761
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:32,600
Just feeling nauseous.

762
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:36,750
Long time no see.

763
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:38,050
You look so cool today.

764
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:38,910
Happy wedding.

765
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:40,770
-Happy wedding.
-So beautiful.

766
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:46,910
Mr. Xie.

767
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:47,570
Mr. Wang.

768
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:48,340
Welcome.

769
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,570
Sorry to keep you waiting.

770
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:50,450
Nice place.

771
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,220
Take it easy for a moment.

772
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:54,020
I need to take care of something.

773
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,820
Facing the green mountains

774
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:03,170
and clear waters.

775
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:04,780
If you're free,

776
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:07,740
you can come out and enjoy the view.

777
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:08,900
Xie Lin.

778
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:11,650
Qin.

779
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,170
So you're the legendary

780
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,420
junior Mr. Qin?

781
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,400
Mr. Xie.

782
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,010
You are?

783
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:32,010
Hello.

784
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:32,970
I am...

785
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:35,490
Xiao Zhiyu.

786
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:38,220
So you're Xiao Zhiyu.

787
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:40,650
Mr. Xie,

788
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:43,180
could I have a word with you in private?

789
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:44,450
You see,

790
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:48,230
young people nowadays
are so straightforward.

791
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:51,380
I heard Mr. Xie values efficiency.

792
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:52,380
As it happens,

793
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:52,970
so do I.

794
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,280
Good.

795
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,060
Please.

796
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:25,570
Uncle Chen,

797
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:26,260
how have you been lately?

798
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,940
This is Mr. Zheng.

799
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:28,860
Let me introduce you.

800
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:29,780
Just call me Zhang.

801
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:30,090
Zhang.

802
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:30,530
Ms. Hu.

803
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:31,650
Shall we exchange contact information?

804
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:32,260
Sure.

805
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:35,700
Are you looking for Zhiyu?

806
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:39,030
Your father-in-law and I
do business together frequently.

807
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:41,820
My father said he went to chat
with Uncle Xie.

808
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,200
He should be back soon.

809
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:44,970
You can wait for him here.

810
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:47,700
Ms. Wang,

811
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:49,710
congratulations,

812
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:50,610
really.

813
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:52,820
Thank you.

814
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:54,860
To be honest with you,

815
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:57,450
I never thought I'd get married so early.

816
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,560
I was actually
a bit afraid of marriage before.

817
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:02,940
Indeed.

818
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,530
A flash marriage, in particular,
requires more courage.

819
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:07,490
Flash marriage?

820
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,060
How do you know that?
