00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,300
Ms. Xiao, I need to go now.

4
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,280
Mr. Xiao, I'm here to get my laptop.

5
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,680
Sorry for the intrusion.

6
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,590
I haven't formally introduced you
to each other yet.

7
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,050
I've already introduced myself
to Ms. Xiao.

8
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,170
Let me make a proper introduction.

9
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,190
This is my mother,

10
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:18,920
Xiao Wanyue.

11
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,210
Mom.

12
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,550
This is Hu Xiu,

13
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:28,870
the woman I love.

14
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,780
Mom.

15
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,310
This is Hu Xiu,

16
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,200
the woman I love.

17
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,960
He definitely did that on purpose.

18
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,200
Mom.

What brings you here all of a sudden?

20
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,100
I was worried about you.

21
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,860
I saw that statement.

22
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,000
You shouldn't have admitted it.

23
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,430
By doing this,

24
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,190
you've left yourself no room to maneuver.

25

I am Qin Yuze's son.

27
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,970
I don't feel ashamed to admit it.

28
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,030
It's just a fact.

29
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,120
I'm just worried that dredging up the past

30
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,590
might upset you.

31
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,520
It does.

32
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,520
I lost someone very important to me.

33
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,209
Was it because of that girl just now?

34
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:20,050
Did she turn you down

35
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,180
because of your father's situation?

36
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,620
How about I go explain things to her?

37
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,070
The only way to get her back

38
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,120
is to end all of this as soon as possible.

Have you ever been involved in
Forma's operations,

41

42

or through financial transactions?

43

Why do you ask?

44
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,230
No particular reason—

45
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,040
just asking.

46
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,530
Hello, Mr. Xiao.

47
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:09,530
How can I help you?

48
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,480
I'd like to arrange

49
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,000

for my family—

50
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,630
one with high cash value,
and it has to be irrevocable.

51
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:16,430
No problem.

52
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,630
We'll just need you to

53
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,630
provide the client's information,

54
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:22,020
bank account details and proof of assets.

55
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:22,700
Okay.

56
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:58,870
Why...

57
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,220
Why is it you?

58
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,600
Mr. Huang,

59
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,650
you seem surprised to see me.

60
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,360
Mr. Xu here told me

61
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,000
someone wanted to discuss business
with me.

62
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,130
I just didn't expect

63
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,480
it would be you.

64
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,310
You know me?

65
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,360
Mr. Xiao from D Studio.

66
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,160
Who in this industry doesn't know you?

67
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,430
But strangely,

68
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,160
I

69
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,270
have never had any dealings

70
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,160
with your studio whatsoever,

71
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,920
so how did you end up coming to me?

72
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,120
We actually had a chance to work together.

73
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,050
Unfortunately,

74
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,390
your company's name

75
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,360
didn't appear on

76
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,920

77
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,550
That's right.

78
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,000
I stopped working with Forma
a long time ago.

79
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,720
So there isn't really

80
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,600
any business for us to discuss, either.

81
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,720
How about this? You two carry on.

82
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,780
I'll take my leave.

83
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,830
You can leave,

84
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,190
but

85
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:51,350
I won't help you a second time.

86
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,159
After all, it's not just loan sharks

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,630
I recognize this car.

89
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,430
It belongs to Pei Kanghua's men.

90
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,950
I didn't expect them

91
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,190
to track me down there.

92
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,190
But

93
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,100
you weren't their target.

94
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,750
I really shouldn't have

95
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,770
told him I had those things.

96
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:30,720
What things?

97
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,480
Nothing.

98
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,120
It's just you really shouldn't

99

100

103
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,240
So annoying.

104
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,240
That makes sense.

105

They can't even plug their own holes.

106
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,659
Why would they spare any money on you?

107
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,270
What do you mean by that, Mr. Xiao?

108
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,360

How could that be?

112
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,600
Because

Mr. Huang, what you probably don't know

120
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,760
is that I already met you in America

121
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,200

122

I've tracked you down,

00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:20,530
do you think he'll trust you
as he always has,

00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,550
or eliminate you without hesitation?

Luckily, Huang Yide was shrewd enough

152
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,190
to photograph the evidence back then.

00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,330
that someone had discovered this place,

190
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:39,260
he seemed particularly panicked.

191
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,750
He's been dodging his debts
and hasn't even dared go home,

192
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,480
yet he came to the factory once.

193
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,890
There must be a reason.

194
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,200
This place is huge.

195
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,320
Where could he have hidden it?

196
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:58,250
It's like looking for a needle
in a haystack.

197
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,030
Let's split up and look around.

198
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:02,630
Okay.

199
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:20,740
Who's there?

200
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,210
Why are you here?

201
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,920
I could ask you the same.

202
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:53,510
Hu Xiu.

203
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,890
I know everything now.

204
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,370
You're investigating Huang Yide,

205
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,890
this factory,

206
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,480
and Pei Kanghua as well.

207
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,840
Pei Kanghua had worked with Huang Yide
for so many years,

208
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,840
yet when you asked for
the supplier information,

209
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,480
they hastily terminated their contract.

210
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,340
It was because Pei Kanghua was worried
you'd investigate him, right?

211
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,020
Are they connected to that accident—

212
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,350
to what happened to your father?

213
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,090
Whatever it is,
it has nothing to do with you.

214
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:31,610
If what you're investigating is
that accident from back then,

215
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,140
then it involves my father,

216
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,440
which means it involves me too.

217
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,750
I have the right to know.

218
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,910
So you took matters into your own hands

219
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,550
and came here all by yourself?

220
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,320
Do you know Huang Yide is in trouble?

221
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,120
What if the person you ran into today
wasn't me,

222
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,080
but a debt collector

223
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,150
or someone working for Pei Kanghua?

224
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,150
What then?

225
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,790
But the person I ran into was you,

226
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:49,670
Xiao Zhiyu!

227
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:53,150
I'm standing right here in front of you,

228
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,390
and I've asked you so many questions,

229
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,450
but you haven't answered any of them!

230
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:07,960
Hu Xiu.

231
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,720
I don't have any answers
for you right now.

232
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,830
But the way you're acting right now—

233
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,230
you're just making things harder for me...

234
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:50,560
I'll drive you home.

235
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,430
This place is remote.

236
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:54,290
I can't let you leave by yourself.

237
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,480
I'll get a taxi.

238
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,680
Save you the trouble.

239
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,360
Since you refuse to tell me anything,

240
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,390
then why are you grabbing me?

241
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,030
Let go.

242
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,080
Let go of me.

243
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,000
I won't.

244
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,600
On what grounds?

245
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:12,910
You've kept so many secrets from me.

246
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,770
Why are you acting all torn up now?

247
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,510
I only kept things from you

248
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:16,750
because I didn't want to
drag you into this.

249
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,870
If anything were to happen...

250
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,080
You always have so many excuses.

251
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,880
So I'm just supposed to
accept everything, right?

252
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:23,720
Xiao Zhiyu.

253
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:27,010
Do you know
what the most ridiculous part is?

254
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,550
Right here.

255
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,080
This place is filled with
secrets and hatred.

256
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,600
And yet you lied to me, telling me

257
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,200
that what was in there was me.

258
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,080
No, please...

259
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,060
You think

260
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,010
you're protecting me?

261
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,030
No.

262
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:45,000
This is the cruelest kind of betrayal.

263
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,320
You're making me feel like
a complete fool.

264
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:47,870
I

265
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,030
thought there were no secrets between us.

266
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:50,830
But in the end,

267
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,910
I don't even know who the one
I'm in love with is

268
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,860
or what he's really trying to do.

269
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,600
I...

270
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:04,640
Xiao Zhiyu.

271
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,109
As far as you and I are concerned,
I can say I have a clear conscience.

272
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:08,829
But you—

273
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:12,200
no matter how you say you like me,

274
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,640
you still make me feel like

275
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,880
I'm only getting your castoffs.

276
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:21,680
♪ It's true ♪

277
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:25,339

00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:31,660

That's not true.

282
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:51,420
♪ It's hard to accept but true ♪

283
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,680
Don't think of me that way.

284
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,160
Prove it to me then.

285
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,920
Either tell me everything,

286
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,640
or

287
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,110
let me go.

292
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,750
I've already told you

293
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,710
everything you want to know.

294
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,310
Is what you're doing now

295
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,310
dangerous?

296
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,190
Do you remember

297
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,510
what you said to me

298
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,400
during Spring Festival?

299
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,450
What about you?

300
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,620
Is there anything you're determined
to accomplish this year?

301
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,200
I want to

302
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,480
find that answer.

303
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,160
Don't torment yourself.

304
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:14,030
I believe you'll find it.

305
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,300
I'll definitely find it.

306
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,480
No wonder

307
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,720
he's held on so tightly to Qin Xiaoyi,

308
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,520
and to his father.

309
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,100
Will you be home tomorrow?

310
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,900
Gong Huaicong and I are planning to
come visit you.

311
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,720
So,

312
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,160
isn't this place nice?

313
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,680
We found this place when we were
checking out cafés a couple of days ago.

314
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,880
We figured we'd bring you here to relax.

315
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:35,600
You two went checking cafés out together?

316
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:36,390
Yes.

317
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,240
That's right.

318
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,590
Ms. Zhao and I just clicked.

319
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,750
We both want to open a new place

320
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,400
and keep the partnership going.

321
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,730
Might as well make money together, right?

322
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,480
So you two are business buddies now.

323
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,270
Uncle Hu has recovered,

324
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:59,240
so what's with the gloomy face?

325
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,280
Have something sweet.

326
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,270
Try this, it's their specialty.
It's really good.

327
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:02,850
Come on.

328
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:06,890
By the way,

329
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,510
once you're both free
in the next couple of days,

330
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:10,430
my club's new instance dungeon
should be ready.

331
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:12,030
Come join the internal playtest.

332
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,550
Think of it as a way to relax,

333
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,400
and you can give me some feedback
while you're at it.

334
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,730
A new instance dungeon?

335
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,720
That's right.

336
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,200
The story of Rongcheng
needs some new changes.

337
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,030
I'll be going on a business trip
in a few days.

338
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:26,560
I'll start working on it as soon as
I come back.

339
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:27,400
So,

340
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,580
will the characters change as well?

341
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,440
I didn't want to change them

342
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,470
at first,

343
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,790
but Xiao told me

344
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,750
he didn't want to play Qin Xiaoyi anymore.

345
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,550
With the key character gone,

346
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,680
there's no point keeping the rest.

347
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,490
You and Xiao still haven't made up yet?

348
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,510
Save that gossiping brain of yours

349
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,770
for designing the new instance dungeon.

350
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,200
Xiu.

351
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,500
How about changing it from snow to rain?

352
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,960
Snow is way prettier,

353
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,310
and rain would leave the players
soaking wet.

354
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,070
By the way,

355
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:06,800
it was Xiao who suggested snow
in the first place.

356
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:08,590
I thought it was too much trouble

357
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,750
and kept opposing it,

358
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,350
but he insisted.

359
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,000
Sometimes,

360
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,080
even when the game wasn't on,
he'd still come by,

361
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:15,920
do nothing,

362
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:16,950
and watch the snow

363
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,510
for hours.

364
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,600
It was snowing that day too.

365
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,240
It was my fault for not being thorough.

366
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,540
I got flustered that day—

367
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,760
heard a whisper of news

368
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,080
and rushed to tell you.

369
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,900
Before Lyman terminated
their contract with us,

370
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,590
they brought in a third-party auditor
to assist with the investigation.

371
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:48,000
One of them is my friend,

372
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,150
so I took him out for a private meal.

373
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,330
They have strict rules.

374
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,570
No matter how I tried,
he wouldn't spill anything.

375
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:57,040
But he let something slip:

376
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,330
the one who reported us

377
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,720
wasn't a supplier,

378
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:03,210
but someone who's completely

379
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,440
mapped out our suppliers' operations.

380
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,110
Mr. Pei,

381
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,010
do you think Forma's supplier details

382
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,130
might have been leaked?

383
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:19,580
The one who knows everything
about our suppliers...

384
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:26,480
Xiao Zhiyu?

385
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,820
Don't repeat the same mistake!

386
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,550
Dad.

387
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,870
The starving dog
you kindly took in years ago

388
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,110
has turned into

389
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:16,160
an ungrateful wolf.

390
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:36,680
Here.

391
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,310
Dad.

392
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,110
Mrs. Xiao.

393
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,790
It's been a while
since we had breakfast together.

394
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,030
My stomach's been acting up lately,

395
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,960
so I can't skip breakfast anymore.

396
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,480
A few days ago, Zhiyu mentioned

397
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,080
that my premium medical insurance
is offshore

398
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,920
and not very convenient in China,

399
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,880
so he wants to arrange
another policy for me domestically.

400
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,160
For that, I'll need to provide

401
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,830
all my bank account details,

402
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:04,190
proof of overseas assets,

403
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:06,210
tax records, and stuff like that.

404
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,610
You need this much paperwork

405
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:14,010
for an insurance policy?

406
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,140
They say it's to verify
my financial status.

407
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,200
Kanghua,

408
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,060
help me figure out

409
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:22,240
how to get
proof of my investment returns.

410
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,100
I'm not very clear on the process.

411
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,750
I'll go collect the paperwork now

412
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:29,130
before I forget again.

413
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,160
Xiao Zhiyu is sneaking a look at

414
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,590
Mrs. Xiao's accounts,

415
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,870
trying to see if she's involved with
our company.

416
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,920
[Outpatient]

417
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:56,750
I'm finally

418
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:58,450
seeing daylight again.

419
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,070
The doctor just said

420
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:03,030
that once you get home, you need to
behave and do your rehab properly.

421
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:03,690
Otherwise,

422
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:04,480
you'll have to come back.

423
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,210
Understand?

424
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,430
Mom, I'll get a taxi.

425
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,540
Did you get one?

426
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:12,070
The traffic's bad.

427
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,570
Hello, Uncle, Auntie.

428
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:17,830
My name is Gong Huaicong.

429
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,270
I'm Ms. Zhao's business partner

430
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,670
and also Hu Xiu's friend.

431
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,650
What's with the extra effort?

432
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,000
What do you mean extra effort?

433
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,110
I'm just here to help out.

434
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,720
I knew Uncle was being discharged today,

435
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,830
so I came specially to pick you guys up,

436
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:31,160
saving Hu Xiu the trouble of
hiring a taxi.

437
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,150
-That's really...
-Thank you.

438
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,410
Sorry for the trouble.

439
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,880
Please don't mention it, Uncle.

440
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,920
When I was organizing events
with Ms. Zhao before,

441
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,160
Hu Xiu worked very hard
and didn't ask for a penny.

442
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,480
So please,

443
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,680
give me this chance to return the favor.

444
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:42,690
Alright.

445
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,740
Thank you then.

446
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,500
My pleasure.

447
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,110
Come on, Uncle. Get in the car.

448
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,170
Alright, alright.

449
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:48,920
Alright.

450
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,600
Be careful.

451
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,550
Is this okay?

452
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,030
Yes.

453
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,030
Let me.

454
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,240
Watch your head.

455
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:56,970
Alright.

456
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:57,830
Watch your head.

457
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:58,270
Okay.

458
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,330
Alright, alright.

459
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:01,960
Watch your hand.

460
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:06,350
Everything's arranged so thoughtfully.

461
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:09,480
He must've been sent here by Xiao Zhiyu,
don't you think?

462
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,110
Uncle,

463
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,900
feeling comfortable?

464
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:19,760
Yeah, very nice.

465
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:23,810
I've really caused you guys
a lot of trouble.

466
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,030
During this time, due to my condition,

467
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,890
Xiu has been working really hard,

468
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,690
and it's affected Xiaorou too.

469
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,270
Did the business of your café

470
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,200
get affected?

471
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,550
Uncle, I've got an assistant
watching over things.

472
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:34,810
Nothing was affected.

473
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,920
Uncle, don't worry.

474
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:37,880
The caregiver

475
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,790
is hired long-term.

476
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,880
He'll stay until you recover.
Very professional.

477
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,770
And with this car at your disposal,

478
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:43,430
you can get around whenever you need.

479
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,300
This way,

480
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,830
Auntie won't have to exhaust herself,

481
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,000
Ms. Zhao won't need to
keep running back and forth,

482
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,010
and Hu Xiu can go to work
with peace of mind.

483
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:49,820
Right, Hu Xiu?

484
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,720
You look tired.

485
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,650
Have some water.

486
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:58,750
I'm not tired.

487
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,830
I haven't done much work.

488
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:02,290
I meant you look tired
from all that talking.

489
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,560
Here.

490
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,240
Alright.

491
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,910
Thank you so much for your help today.

492
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:33,960
Come upstairs for a rest, will you?

493
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,310
No thanks, Auntie. I don't want to impose.

494
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,240
I'm heading back to the shop.

495
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,680
Please, go upstairs and get some rest.

496
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,880
Go back and get some rest as well.

497
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,680
The caregiver and I
can take things from here.

498
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,280
Call me if you need anything.

499
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,990
Uncle, Auntie, we'll be going now.

500
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,470
Alright. Take care.

501
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:46,980
Once he's doing better,

502
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:48,240
come over for a meal, alright?

503
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:48,900
Certainly.

504
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,420
Please, go on upstairs.

505
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,310
Goodbye, Uncle.

506
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,200
Alright, take care.

507
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:52,730
Bye-bye.

508
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,260
Bye-bye.

509
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,260
Goodbye, Auntie.

510
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:58,170
Everything alright?

511
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:02,170
What happened in the car just now?

512
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,630
Did I say something wrong?

513
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,070
Don't tell me

514
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:07,160
that Hu Xiu's father

515
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,750
doesn't want her to
work at the studio anymore,

516
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,550
just because of what happened
with Xiao's father.

517
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,120
Let's talk on the way.

518
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:18,960
Li,

519
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,790
come and take a look.

520
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:20,920
The kitchen is here.

521
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,240
The kitchen.

522
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:22,590
Okay. Got it.

523
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,350
And this medicine kit

524
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:25,110
contains all our daily medications.

525
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:25,680
Everything's in here.

526
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,160
Okay.

527
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,540
And here is the bathroom.

528
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,540
Come take a look.

529
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,920
This is the master bedroom.

530
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:32,790
Alright.

531
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,550
And this is Xiu's room.

532
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,550
Okay, I got it.

533
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,160
Alright.

534
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:36,640
Xiu.

535
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,400
How are things arranged

536
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,510
with your work?

537
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:46,790
Xiu?

538
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:47,640
Hu.

539
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,920
She can't just walk out like that.

540
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,990
The handover will take at least a month.

541
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,390
I mean... I want you to...

542
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:02,830
Xiu.

543
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:05,940
As for your work arrangements,

544
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,100
there's no rush.

545
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,240
We need to

546
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,250
see things through properly.

547
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:13,920
I'll give you time

548
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,870
to sort things out properly.

549
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,800
No wonder Xiao told me

550
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:33,480
not to bring him up
in front of Hu Xiu's parents

551
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,730
or tell them he was the one who arranged
the car and the caregiver.

552
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:38,210
Because only this way

553
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:39,750
could Xiu's parents

554
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:42,280
accept his kindness
without feeling uneasy.

555
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
The problem between him and Hu Xiu

556
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,080
is just impossible to solve.

557
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,480
My Poor Xiu.

558
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,900
She finally found happiness,

559
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:54,350
but it has to be
like sugar coated with shards of glass.

560
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,880
Xiao is pitiful too.

561
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:59,490
The person he's determined to love
is the very person he can't.

562
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,000
How painful that must be.

563
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,500
Mom, I'm home.

564
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:09,310
You guys get some rest early too.

565
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,860
There's an emergency.

566
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,240
Hu Xiu?

567
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,960
Aren't you still on leave today?

568
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,240
I came to talk to Mr. Xiao
about something.

569
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,030
Is he here?

570
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:34,770
He just went upstairs.

571
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,120
Xiao Zhiyu.

572
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,830
Why are you here?

573
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,970
Thank you for taking care of
the arrangements

574
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,430
after my dad's discharge.

575
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,750
It's the least I could do.

576
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,120
If he hadn't seen the news online,

577
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,580
he wouldn't have gone out
that late at night.

578
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,610
I came to talk to you about this.

579
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:06,400
Pei Zhen came to see me at the hospital.

580
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,550
I think it was him

581
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,000
who released the news.

582
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,530
And these documents

583
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,780
were likely sent to my parents
by him as well.

00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:31,390
keep an eye on Pei Zhen too.

588
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:34,150
Who knows what his next move will be.

589
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:38,310
Mr. Xiao.

590
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:43,200
Investigators from
the Market Supervision Bureau are here.

591
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,550
They're right downstairs.

592
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,550
What happened?

593
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,920
Forma's supplier information
has been leaked online.

594
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,490
It involves the leak of
many confidential internal quotes

595
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:53,510
with our studio's watermark on them.

596
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:55,830
Forma, along with the suppliers,
lodged a complaint against us.

597
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:59,430
There's no way that information
could have leaked from our side.

598
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:14,469
Thank you for your cooperation.

599
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:20,520
Mr. Xiao, right?

600
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:21,699
Ms. Zhou.

601
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:23,830
This time,

602
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:25,920
all employees who have handled
Forma's supplier list

603
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,480
must cooperate with the investigation.

604
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,280
I understand.

605
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,590
I was the one
who handled the Forma project.

606
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:31,710
My work computer
has been at the office the whole time.

607
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:32,469
It hasn't been touched.

608
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:33,199
Understood.

609
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:33,920
During the investigation,

610
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,920
we'll keep this computer in our custody
temporarily.

611
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:37,400
Mr. Xiao,

612
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,600
you'll need to come with us separately.

613
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,710
Besides the complaint about

614
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:45,070
supplier information leakage,

615
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,960
Mr. Xiao, you're also suspected of
privately investigating

616
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,000
supplier data

617
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,909
and other infringement issues.

618
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:51,949
So you'll need to cooperate with us.

619
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:53,880
Mr. Xiao.

620
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,010
No problem.

621
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,230
The innocent have nothing to fear.

622
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,790
Go home

623
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,400
once the investigators leave.

624
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,130
I'll inform you of any updates.

625
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,840
How did this even happen?

626
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,070
It just got out.

627
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:54,070
If they slap a
leak-of-confidential-info charge on him...

628
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,400
Like father, like son.

629
00:35:57,870 --> 00:36:01,200
People out there will definitely
make a big deal out of this.

630
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,900
Both he and our studio will be in trouble.

631
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,070
I see.

632
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,110
Why are you here?

633
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,010
You're not welcome here now.

634
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,290
Are you out of your mind?

635
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,160
You could've just come after me.

636
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:30,320
But instead, you caused
her father's accident

637
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,230
and got her suspected of leaking info.

638
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,200
Is that your idea of protecting her?

639
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,330
I didn't cause her father's accident.

640
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,480
You were right.

641
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:40,110
Everything I've done...

642
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,800
Is because of you!

643
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,620
If you hadn't shown up,

644
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,290
she wouldn't have been dragged into this.

645
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:52,520
I never expected that, Xiao Zhiyu,

646
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,630
after all these years,

647
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:56,910
the first time I see you lose control

648
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:00,550
would be over a woman.

649
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:03,760
No.

650
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,150
It's to teach you

651
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:09,360
that there are lines you cannot cross.

652
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,020
Cross them, and I won't spare you either.

653
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,400
You? Teach me?

654
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,630
On what grounds!

655
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,210
Your miserable past?

656
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,800
Xiao Zhiyu,

657
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:28,770
listen carefully.

658
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,590
I've never done you wrong.

659
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,770
You're the one who owes me!

660
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,620
From the moment you came into our family,

661
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:44,440
my life was completely ruined.

662
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,280
As long as you're around,

663
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,110
no one ever sees me.

664
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,710
No matter how hard I try,

665
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:58,090
I'll never measure up to you
in others' eyes.

666
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,880
Even Hu Xiu is the same.

667
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:10,710
She knows exactly who you are

668
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,760
and still takes your side.

669
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,950
Why?

670
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,740
You should've spent your life
keeping your head down.

671
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,610
You wouldn't be who you are today
without the Pei family.

672
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,110
And what did you do?

673
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,280
You repaid kindness with betrayal.

674
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,910
You sold out the Pei family.

675
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,560
The one who's been crossing lines

676
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,670
has always been you.

677
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,760
Look at yourself,

678
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:57,280
shamelessly flipping the truth
on its head.

679
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,280
You really do look like Pei Kanghua.

680
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,480
How did I ever forget

681
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,760
that you and him

682
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,250
share the same blood?

683
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,670
Zhiyu!

684
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,840
Is what he said true?

685
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,580
Was it you who reported Forma?

686
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:32,590
You asked for my bank account information

687
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:35,150
just to take revenge on
Kanghua and Forma?

688
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,190
Zhiyu.

689
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,280
It's been 20 years.

690
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,590
I thought

691
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,060
you just didn't want to be close to us,

692
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,480
but I never imagined

693
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,410
you've been harboring
this kind of hatred all along.

694
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,880
You don't have to accept the decision
I made back then,

695
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,880
and you can even condemn me
for being weak and cowardly.

696
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,550
But do you

697
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,520
really have to make me

698
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,360
lose my family all over again

699
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:04,320
before you're satisfied?

700
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,480
Mom.

701
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:22,450
The "family" you just mentioned—

702
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,590
did that include me?
