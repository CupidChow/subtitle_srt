Xiu.

4
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,710
There's a customer coming to pick up
their pre-ordered coffee beans.

5
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,120
Help me go to the shop first
and open the door.

6
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,630
Ms. Zhao, you're ordering me around
already?

7
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,560
Of course.

8
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,750
How can I waste free labor?

9
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,780
Alright, I'm on my way.

10
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,190
By the way,

11
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,840
remember to take a photo of
your ID and send it to me.

12
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,870
I'll give it to the park's
property management for registration.

13
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,470
That way, you'll be able to enter
and leave freely

14
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,680
even outside business hours.

15
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,079
Alright, just a minute.
I'll send it to you.

17
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,080
Mr. Gong, are you in?

18
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,430
It's still so early.

19
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,170
He's already gone to work?

20
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,360
Mr. Gong.

21
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,520
Sorry to bother you.

22
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,560
When I came to
sign the contract yesterday,

23
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,150
I think I accidentally left my cardholder

24
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,280
on the sofa.

25
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,590
When would be a good time for me

26
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,920

Are you okay?

33
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,140
I've got some allergies—

34
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,220
can't really see people right now.

35
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,980
He just moved in
and he's already having allergies?

36
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,540
Mr. Gong.

37
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,470
I thought it might not be convenient
for you to go out,

38
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,710
so I bought you some allergy medicine.

39
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,440
I'll leave it at your doorstep.

40
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,720

They're all here for
the murder mystery game?

52
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,070
I asked,

53
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,120
and they said another post about it
went viral on the internet.

54
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,310

61
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,400
He has allergies, yet he still came so far
just to play a murder mystery game?

62
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:29,100
His license plate is also local.

63
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,840
Who ordered the coffee?

00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:34,920

But there are
quite a lot of people here today.

00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,720
We might not be able to get you in.

72
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,650
I noticed a player came in as soon as
he parked his car.

73
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,040
That's our boss.

That red car

76
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,190
belongs to your boss?

77
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,180
Mr. Gong's got a new car again?

78
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,100
Yeah.

79
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,000
He looks really happy today.

80
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,390
You have no idea.

81
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,610
Once he changes his car,

82
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,680
it means he's got a new girlfriend.

83
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,510
So everything he said about coming here

84
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,040
on a business trip was a lie.

85
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,850
Then what's his point in renting my place?

86
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,870
Gong Huaicong...

87
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,680

88
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,830
He's not home.

89
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:48,760
That matches up.

90
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,070
I-I must be overthinking it.

91
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:57,510
Why-

92
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,270
Don't talk.

93
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,590
I'm not talking.

94
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,430
Ms. Hu,

95
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,690
a fox can't be the winner here.

96
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,070
I can't just let it go.

97
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,920
Have Dong Qi report directly to me.

98
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,310
We'll discuss the rest when you get back.

99
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,120
That works.

100
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,240
Just park here.

101
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,120
Here.

102
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,360
Why is it so noisy over there?

103
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,960
Just deliver it to this door.

104
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,190
No. 27.

105
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,190
-It's the first door.
-Okay.

106
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,750
And then deliver it to the second floor.

107
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,920
Okay, okay. It's alright.

108
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,480
Be careful.

109
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,510
The doorway is a bit narrow.

110
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,120
Maybe just tilt it and slide it in.

111
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,310
The stairs aren't easy to climb, either.

112
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,770
Thanks for your hard work.

113
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,070
Watch out behind you.

114
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,240
Alright, alright.

115
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,680
Be careful not to damage it.

116
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,680
Alright, alright.

117
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,210
Be careful not to damage it.

118
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:34,960
Mr. Gong.

119
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,270
You're home, right?

120
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:38,840
It just occurred to me

121
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,320
that the bed in the attic is quite old,

122
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,580
so I bought a new one
and had it delivered.

123
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,990
What happened?

124
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,150
Are you okay?

125
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,670
Mr. Gong.

126
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:53,290
I was worried the bed might collapse

127
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,390
when you sleep at night,

128
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,870
so I rushed over here on purpose.

129
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,390
I know you're in there.

130
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,650
Is there anything inconvenient for you?

131
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,620
Just leave the bed at the door.

132
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,720
I'll carry it in myself.

133
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,440
That won't work.

134
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,960
The delivery guys
need to install it inside,

135
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,150
take photos, and confirm
with the store before they leave.

136
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:10,950
That's right.

137
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,520
It's our company policy.

138
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:20,420
Xiao, do you have time
to come by the club sometime soon?

139
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,430
Just hurry over. She's blocking my door.

140
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,910
Mr. Gong.

141
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,310
Mr. Gong?

142
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,030
Ms. Hu.

143
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,510
I still need to tidy up a bit.

144
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,680
Would you mind going to
the property management office?

145
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,790
There was a payment reminder
posted on the door yesterday.

146
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,450
I don't know what fee it's for.

147
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,550
Alright, I'll go check it first

148
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,790
and come by later.

149
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,720
Well, since

150
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,440
this hallway is narrow,

151
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,910
how about we leave it here for now?

152
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:47,960
I'll take you guys downstairs to wait,

153
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,480
and we can grab some water on the way.

154
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,240
After the tenant finishes tidying up,

155
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,510
we'll come back up.

156
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:53,790
Alright then.

157
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:54,670
Thank you.

158
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,390
Mr. Gong.

159
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,000
I just checked with property management,

160
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,200
and they said
there's no outstanding payment.

161
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,630
Could there be a mistake?

162
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,500
Have you finished tidying up?

163
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:33,390
Didn't you say you had arrived?
Where are you?

164
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,030
I

165
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,870
got the wrong door.

166
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,480
I'm next door to you.

167
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:41,480
Mr. Gong.

168
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,450
Mr. Gong.

169
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,490
Are your balconies next to each other?

170
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,080
I think so.

171
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,480
You're not thinking of...

172
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,210
I'm going all out for you today.

173
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,660
You almost scared me to death!

174
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,600
Go put on these pajamas.

175
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,670
Let's make this act convincing.

176
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,670
I'll go hide in the attic wardrobe.

177
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,550
Don't blow our cover.

178
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:10,790
But

179
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,750
this isn't even my usual dressing style.

180
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,910
Mr. Gong!

181
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,600
I'm sorry, Ms. Hu,

182
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,000
for keeping you waiting.

183
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,440
That's very thoughtful of you,

184
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,240
bringing a new bed.

185
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,270
Well, it's actually a coincidence.

186
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:29,120
Since I was thinking about
renting out this place a while ago,

187
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,550
I bought a new wardrobe.

188
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,510
W-Wardrobe?

189
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,390
W-What wardrobe?

190
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,670
The one in the attic.

191
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,240
It's the same brand as this bed.

192
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:38,960
And then I thought,

193
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,480
since they gave me a discount coupon,

194
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,320
I might as well use it.

195
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,270
So I went ahead and bought this bed too.

196
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:43,840
I see.

197
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,150
Thank you then.

198
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,150
No need to change your shoes.

199
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,150
Just come right in.

200
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,100
I'll have the delivery guys
come in to install it then.

201
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:51,650
Okay.

202
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,510
Come on in.

203
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,390
Thank you for your hard work.

204
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,190
It's nothing.

205
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,270
I need to use the restroom.

206
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,800
Please, go ahead.

207
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,440
The new bed is installed.

208
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,080
We'll take the old one downstairs.

209
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,030
Thank you for your trouble.

210
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,630
It's okay, no trouble at all.

211
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:31,670
Mr. Gong.

212
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,440
This bed replacement
was actually due to my oversight.

213
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,320
These old pieces of furniture
are prone to problems.

214
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,080
Now that

215
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,870
I'm here,

216
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:38,670
I might as well help you

217
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,080
check the rest of them too,

218
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,880
especially the one in the attic.

219
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,100
It's okay, Ms. Hu.

220
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,520
No need for such trouble.

221
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,790
There's actually nothing
that needs checking.

222
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,030
Apart from the bed,

223
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,880
the other pieces of furniture
are all fine.

224
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,720
It's okay.

225
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,320
Let's have everything checked,
so we can both have peace of mind.

226
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,200
Especially this wardrobe.

227
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:18,540
Mom.

228
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,750
Why didn't you reply to my messages?

229
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,370
It's finally the weekend.

230
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,480
Come back for dinner.

231
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,390
Okay, got it.

232
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,440
I'll be home soon.

233
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,560
Let's skip the wardrobe.
It's a bit inconvenient.

234
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,580
Personal stuff?

235
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,170
Yeah.

236
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:39,880
Understood.

237
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:41,910
I'll be going then.

238
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:42,910
I'll walk you out.

239
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:49,990
Bye-bye.

240
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:54,750
Dazhong.

241
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:56,430
Going out?

242
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,170
Bad cat.

243
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,850
She didn't close the door.

244
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,840
She's definitely thinking

245
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,910
there's something scandalous
in that wardrobe.

246
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,320
Seriously,

247
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,470
I already told her I'd handle it myself.

248
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,080
Do you think she's being well-meaning,

249
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,410
or she's just too naive?

250
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:20,550
You know what?

251
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,270
Good thing I showed up in time today.

252
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,510
Otherwise, you'd be finished,

253
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,440
I'd be finished too,

254
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,960
and my hard-earned reputation
would be ruined in one stroke.

255
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,840
She might even kick you out.

256
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,270
What's going on?

257
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,860
Still not back to your senses?

258
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,870
We've been exposed.

259
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,410
No way.

260
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:43,440
Everything was fine
when I saw her off just now.

261
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,240
If we had really been exposed,

262
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,870
she wouldn't have stayed silent.

263
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,840
Didn't she tell you
that wardrobe was newly purchased?

264
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,770
Yes, it's the same brand as the bed.

265
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,810
And didn't she say
she wanted to check the old furniture?

266
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,740
Why did she check the new piece too?

267
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,910
So you mean she...

268
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,390
Knew all along?

269
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,010
Then why didn't she just expose us?

270
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,790
I don't care what she thinks.

271
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,240
If this happens again,

272
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,030
I suggest you come clean.

273
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,200
No need to thank me
for helping you this time.

274
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,630
Just do one more show for me.

275
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,270
I'm leaving.

276
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,330
Let me walk you out,

277
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,240
so you don't end up
at the neighbor's again.

278
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,080
Xiu, you're back.

279
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,000
Dinner will be ready soon.

280
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,720
Is there anything I can help with?

281
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,550
No need.

282
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,080
You just got off work. You must be tired.

283
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,030
Go rest.

284
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,550
That's right.

285
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,150
Xiu.

286
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,360
You've been back
at the company for a while now.

287
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,480
How has it been?

288
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,840
After taking such a long leave,

289
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,430
has Mr. Xu given you any trouble?

290
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:00,150
It would be normal

291
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,630
if Mr. Xu gave her trouble.

292
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,080
What do you mean normal?

293
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,860
Our Xiu is so capable.

294
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,610
She never took a day off before.

295
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,950
What's wrong with taking a short break?

296
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,370
If you really think so,

297
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,400
then why did you prepare that thing?

298
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,220
What do you mean?

299
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,440
I've prepared a gift for you

300
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,840
to give to Mr. Xu on Monday.

301
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:25,550
What gift?

302
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,410
Two bottles of Moutai—

303
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,240
your dad's prized collection.

304
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,390
Remember to take them with you later.

305
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,750
Such expensive gifts

306
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,550
would be wasted on Mr. Xu.

307
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,720
As a GM assistant,

308
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,840
it's important to maintain
a good relationship with your boss

309
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,750
and show a positive attitude, you know?

310
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,600
Be a good girl.

311
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,310
I'll put them away first.

312
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,560
I-I'll find a bag to pack them.

313
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,180
Okay.

314
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:57,630
To part with that wine

315
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,000
makes my heart ache.

316
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,440
Dad.

317
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,410
Alright.

318
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:11,920
Dinner's ready.

319
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,579
Hello, this is Zhuling Group.

320
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,069
We've reviewed your resume

321
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:16,480
and would like to know if you could come

322
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,339
for an interview on Monday at 1 PM.

323
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:26,400
Where did you say
you were calling from again?

324
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,830
Zhuling Group.

325
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,650
I'll definitely be there on time.

326
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,240
What's wrong?

327
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,310
Who was that?

328
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,110
What's with all the secrecy?

329
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,880
If there's anything new going on,

330
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,590
remember to let us know.

331
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,960
When dating someone,

332
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,720
you need to keep your eyes wide open.

333
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,480
But it was just a spam call.

334
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,000
Let's eat. I'm starving.

335
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,350
So delicious.

336
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,550
Mr. Gong,

337
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,960
I sent you a message yesterday.

338
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,590
I need to go home to grab something today.

339
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,070
What time will you be there?

340
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,130
Here you are, Miss.

341
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,020
Thank you, Sir.

342
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:21,170
You can come over now.

343
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:21,700
I'm home.

344
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,000
He's home?

345
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,640
Aren't those two tired of

346
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:28,110
putting on a show like that all the time?

347
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,290
Are you sure this is the last time?

348
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,480
I am sure.

349
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,640
I'll come clean with her in a moment.

350
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,920
Why the sudden change of heart?

351
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,270
Maybe because

352
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,920
lies mess with the fengshui,

353
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,260
and the fengshui messes with my sleep.

354
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,790
What nonsense.

355
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,380
Remember to sign a new contract,

356
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,510
so your drama doesn't affect me.

357
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:54,200
You don't have to worry about that.

358
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:56,840
By the way,

359
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,680
what did you say
she was coming to get again?

360
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,730
Something big or small?

361
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:02,330
S-Something small, I think.

362
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:05,580
There's a box on top of the fridge
in the living room.

363
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,640
She said something about documents.

364
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,270
You're not planning to

365
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,830
get it ready for her in advance, are you?

366
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:11,270
Let me tell you,

367
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:13,800
flattery isn't supposed to be
done like that.

368
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,160
I just want to get this over with quickly.

369
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,440
Take your time getting it over then.

370
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,300
Just don't get yourself trapped.

371
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,920

and where did she work?

00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,000
Is she an architect?

375
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,200
I don't think so.

376
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,300
She doesn't look like
someone in your profession.

00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,680
She mentioned before

379
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,280
that she used to work as an assistant
at some real estate company.

380
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,720
Later, she quit that job,

381
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,280

Nothing.

it would be nice if our place

00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:37,370

didn't you?

508
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:38,570
You should know that

509
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,830
your resume

510
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:43,680
is actually more suitable for
an administrative assistant position.

511
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,480
Our company, Zhuling,

512
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,500
is a very established architectural firm.

513
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,110
Even a GM assistant

514
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,270
needs solid professional expertise

515
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,350
to be up to the job.

516
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,380
I see that you have more than 3 years
of experience as a GM assistant,

517
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,760
which makes you an even better fit
for this position.

518
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,220
But my plan is to change
my career direction.

519
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,480
If your company could give me
an opportunity,

520
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,040
I'm willing to lower
my salary expectations

521
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,890

If a car wants to reach its destination,

524
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,220
all it needs is some fuel.

525
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,360
But for a person to succeed,

526
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:17,310
driving force alone won't do.

You've been working for years.

528
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,310

than when you just graduated.

530
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,350
The position of GM assistant

531
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,480
offers far better salary and career scope

532
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,440
than an assistant architect.

533
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:30,420
Why give up the foundation
you've built over these years?

534
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,990
Those branching crossroads

535
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,200
have always been there,

536
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,440
but what lies ahead

537
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:36,720
is more likely a trap

538
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,920
than an opportunity.

539
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:40,330
I hope you give this careful thought.

540
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,970

00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,130
Please, sit down and have a try.

556
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,440
Tell me,

557
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,640
what can I help you with?

558
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,770
I heard Lyman is launching a new project.

559
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:08,750
What,

560
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,840
is Zhuling also interested?

561
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:11,960
Of course.

562
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:12,920
Zhuling won't miss out on

563
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,480
any of Lyman's projects.

564
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,110
I wonder which other companies

565
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:18,510
will be participating in the competition.

566
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:21,160
Are you trying to ask about

567
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,160
Dynamism?

568
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,050
As you expected,

569
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:27,140
they've also expressed interest.

570
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,610
I didn't expect that

571
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,200
a firm that gained fame through hype

572
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,790
is also joining the competition.

573
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:36,120
They've got some nerve.

574
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:36,790
Of course

575
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,310
Dynamism's got some nerve.

576
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,790
Otherwise, how would they have dared

577
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:41,000
to keep stealing projects

578
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,660
from Zhuling all these years?

579
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,380
Let's not talk about this anymore.

580
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,580
Today is just for tea.

581
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:46,440
Alright.

582
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:46,810
Here.

583
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,750
Ms. Hu.

584
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:59,550
If a car wants to reach its destination,

585
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:01,230
all it needs is some fuel.

586
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,160
But for a person to succeed,

587
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,920
driving force alone won't do.

588
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,440
Those branching crossroads

589
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,640
have always been there,

590
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,920
but what lies ahead

591
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:11,070
is more likely a trap

592
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,270
than an opportunity.

593
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,680
Hello, is this Ms. Hu

594
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,640
from No. 27, Lane 9, Yanhua Road?

595
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:25,950
Yes, speaking.

596
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,510
Stop here!

597
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,420
I've been watching you for days.

598
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,440
You've been wandering around our lane,

599
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,790
looking and taking notes.

600
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:38,900
What exactly are you up to?

601
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,840
I live here. What's wrong

602
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,460
with me walking around a bit?

603
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,720
I already checked with
property management.

604
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,960
There's no record of you at all

605
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,000
in the tenant information.

606
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,030
Whether I live here or not

607
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,480
is very easy to prove.

608
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:54,960
What's wrong?

609
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,280
What's going on?

610
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:56,850
Dazhong,

611
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,860
didn't you say someone broke into
your home the other day?

612
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,350
And there were men's footprints, right?

613
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,030
What's going on here?

614
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,110
They might be his.

615
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,360
What's happening?

616
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:05,830
Anyway,

617
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,160
this guy's very sneaky.

618
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,400
I don't feel comfortable

619
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,880
letting him stay here anymore.

620
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,960
Don't you all agree?

621
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,510
Right.

622
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,380
Yeah, that's right.

623
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,270
I never saw him here before either.

624
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,110
Don't leave!

625
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:16,750
Let go.

626
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,640
Running away? Feeling guilty?

627
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,680
Do you dare to show everyone

628
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,640
what's inside this?

629
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,370
Why should I show you anything?

630
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:25,010
How dare you cause trouble in my lane!

631
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,930
Hu Xiu, are you out of your mind?

632
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,530
Since when is this your lane?

633
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:30,920
Bullying my tenant in broad daylight—

634
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,790
do you think I'm invisible or what?

635
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,620
Look at the kind of tenant
you've rented to—

636
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,650
wandering around our lane all day,

637
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,750
looking and taking notes.

638
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:38,640
Who knows, maybe he's some kind of...

639
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,640
Some kind of what?

640
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,440
At least he's better than someone
like you, who just loafs around all day

641
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,200
and secretly taps into
the neighbor's electricity.

642
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,110
You're making false accusations!

643
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,160
False accusations?

644
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,330
Go check the electric meter right now.

645
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:47,220
You know what?

646
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:49,350
Dabao did steal electricity
from neighbors before.

647
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:49,680
Indeed.

648
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,140
Don't change the subject.

649
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,270
He wanders around the lane every day.

650
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,480
If something happens in the future,

651
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,210
will you take responsibility?

652
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:11,830
What is this?

653
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,200
It's just a painting.

654
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:14,630
Isn't this our lane?

655
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:16,510
So he's here for artistic inspiration.

656
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,880
It's painted quite nicely.

657
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,000
Then... What about those footprints

658
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,130
at Dazhong's house?

659
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:24,130
My friend came to see me the other day.

660
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,110
He wasn't familiar with
the lane's environment

661
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,750
and didn't know two households
share the same house number,

662
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:29,790
so he accidentally entered your house.
I apologize.

663
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:30,440
I see.

664
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,630
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

665
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,480
It's all cleared up.

666
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,740
You can all go home now.

667
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,110
Let's go.

668
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:38,960
Let's go.

669
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:42,420
Anything else you want?

670
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:12,780
Let's talk.

671
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,140
What brought you here today?

672
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,530
The property management reminded me

673
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:30,450
that I forgot to give my tenant,

674
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:33,880
Mr. Gong Huaicong,
a copy of the lease agreement.

675
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,260
I'm sorry.

676
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,480
I'm the one who's actually
renting your place.

677
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:44,750
I know that

678
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,680
popular NPCs like you want to maintain

679
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,980
an air of mystery

680
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,060
and don't want any contact
with players in private.

681
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:52,790
But

682
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,030
since you're renting my place,

683
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,680
you can't hide your identity from me,

684
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,720
the landlord.

685
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,480
Draft a new contract.

686
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,120
I'll sign it another day.

687
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,510
Okay.

688
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,840
What's wrong?

689
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,400
My interview today

690
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:28,530
didn't go well.

691
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,550
I'm a bit down.

692
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:33,560
Interviewing for an architect position?

693
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,510
How did you know?

694
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,150
That day when I helped you
get your things prepared,

695
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,880
I accidentally saw
your architecture portfolio

696
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,760
and trophies.

697
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,280
Yes.

698
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,090
And it was a really big architecture firm.

699
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,230
I wonder if you've heard of it.

700
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,489
The firm's name is Zhuling.

701
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,590
But they only wanted to hire me
as a GM assistant.

702
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,420
They didn't even take a single look at

703
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:03,980
the model I brought with me.

704
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,040
I noticed your model just now.

705
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,110
Being able to produce
a work like this as a student

706
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,840
is actually quite impressive.

707
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:17,630
You're just trying to comfort me.

708
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,250
I never comfort people.

709
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,880
As a bookstore design,

710
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:25,610
it at least has some memorable features.

711
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:27,570
You can tell it's a bookstore?

712
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,150
I designed it based on

713
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,360
the Jiangnan courtyard style.

714
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,020
Reading books in the corridor

715
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,780
not only creates a unique atmosphere,

716
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:38,170
but also brings people closer together.

717
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,030
That year,

718
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,130
Galaxy Bookstore was built on Binhe Road.

719
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:47,270
That designer became
an overnight sensation.

720
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,280
I thought to myself at that time

721
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,810
that I'd definitely design
something better than his someday.

722
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,080
What happened then?

723
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,840
Then...

724
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,760
That "someday" never came.

725
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,480
I gave up on design.

726
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,190
♪ Close your eyes for me ♪

727
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:04,960
Why?

728
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:07,810
Maybe some paths, once you miss them,

729
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:09,980
♪ Don't rush to wake up ♪

730
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:10,460

♪ Before the night ends ♪

732
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:16,490

a turning point.

♪ The reason we met ♪

737
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,520

If I continue to work as a GM assistant,

739
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:33,150

740

Mr. Pei,

794
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,190
regarding the recruitment deadline
for the GM assistant position,

795
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,840
we may need to extend it a bit.

796
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,230
So far,

797
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:12,630
we haven't found a suitable candidate yet.

798
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,620
What about the girl
who came in yesterday afternoon?

799
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:15,390
How was she?

800
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:16,080
She...

801
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:17,880
She was pretty good,

802
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:19,360
but

803
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:20,800
she declined our offer.

804
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,400
What was her reason?

805
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,360
She wants to be an architect.

806
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:09,610
Careful, it's hot.

807
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,770
So you're giving up on Zhuling like that?

808
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:18,230
This might actually be a good thing.

809
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:19,010
I did the math—

810
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:20,930
from here to Zhuling,

811
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:22,410
the commute alone would be exhausting.

812
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:23,000
Besides,

813
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:25,320

814
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,570

to take a taxi.

00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,810

00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,150

last time.

836
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,940
I was out on an errand, and...

837
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,660
I figured it was about time to
get off work anyway, so I clocked out.

838
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,790

839
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,590
