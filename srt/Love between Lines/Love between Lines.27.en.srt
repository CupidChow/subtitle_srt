00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,840
If you're too formal with him,

190
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,200
he'll feel awkward.

191
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:09,730
Alright.

192
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,200
Then I'll accept them.

193
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,980
I'm glad you like them.

194
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,740
Hu,

195
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,850
he's here!

196
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,200
Wasn't Dad just here calling for us?

197
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,460
Why did he go back into the bedroom again?

198
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,160
He's putting on airs.

199
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:29,340
Uncle.

200
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,170
Have a seat on the sofa.

201
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,920
I've already seen the news.

202
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:18,390
Uncle,

203
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:19,790
I came here specifically

204
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,270
to apologize to you.

205
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,670
When I started dating Hu Xiu,

206
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,440
I didn't tell her who I really was.

207
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,700
I planned to tell her everything
once things were settled.

208
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,240
But I never expected...

209
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,410
If I had said it earlier,

210
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,960
that car accident wouldn't have happened.

211
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,760
You wouldn't have had to suffer.

212
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,380
And Hu Xiu wouldn't have been so upset.

213
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,290
It's not all your fault.

214
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,120
You had your difficulties too.

215
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,090
And thanks to you,

216
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,030
we finally got the truth.

217
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:11,870
Alright.

218
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,040
Let bygones

219
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,200
be bygones.

220
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:19,790
Do...

221
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,850
Do you know how to play Chinese chess?

222
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:23,760
A little bit.

223
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:25,400
Play a few games with me.

224
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,910
I'll teach you properly.

225
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,150
Sure.

226
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,510
Okay.

227
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,550
You...

228
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,510
You really didn't know how to play before?

229
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,060
Wait...

230
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,510
W-Were you just humoring me?

231
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,600
You just won again.

232
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,910
That's because you taught me well.

233
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,440
Again. Let's have another round.

234
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,840
Dinner will be ready soon.

235
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,120
Have some fruit first.

236
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,400
If you keep winning,

237
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,810
my dad will play with you until tomorrow.

238
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,420
I can't just lose on purpose, can I?

239
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,599
What if he notices?

240
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,750
Just bring out a tenth of
the acting skills you use

241
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,150
in murder mystery games.

242
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:24,720
Last month,

243
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,740
your mother went back to the lane.

244
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,590
I didn't know that.

245
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,780
She waited for you for a long time.

246
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:35,570
Where did you stay that night?

247
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,350
I...

248
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,570
Neither of you is getting any younger.

249
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:51,510
I understand.

250
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,130
What are your plans for the future?

251
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,160
Have you two discussed
when you'll get engaged?

252
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,110
D-Dad, why are you asking about that?

253
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:58,680
Uncle,

254
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,310
please rest assured.

255
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,680
I'll take responsibility for Hu Xiu.

256
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,510
And in the future,
I'll definitely marry Hu...

257
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,170
This is quite sweet. Try some.

258
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,440
That's exactly
what I wanted to talk to you about.

259
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,790
Dad, can you please
stop being so old-fashioned?

260
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:13,880
We haven't been dating that long.

261
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,070
And you keep talking about
engagement and marriage.

262
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,470
That's a lot of pressure.

263
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,830
I don't feel pressured.

264
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:20,550
Anyway, just stay out of it.

265
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,680
We have our own pace.

266
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,310
Besides,

267
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,440
my career is just starting to take off.

268
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,100
I don't have any thoughts
about marriage at all.

269
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,800
All right, I'm going to help Mom.

270
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,250
Checkmate.

271
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,600
What are you looking for?

272
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,220
Where's the candy?

273
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:18,590
Here.

274
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:23,750
It's for you.

275
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,310
You drank so much just now.

276
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,240
Having something sweet will help.

277
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,310
My dad,

278
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:44,510
once he starts drinking, he can't stop.

279
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:48,270
You don't have to take drinking with him
so seriously.

280
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,010
You did drink too much.

281
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,800
I don't feel like taking a taxi home.

282
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,540
I'll just stay at your place tonight.

283
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,680
You can take my car.

284
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,480
I won't need it tomorrow anyway.

285
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:51,960
Nope.

286
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,090
I'm staying at your place tonight.

287
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,350
I'll wear your loungewear.

288
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,440
I've been meaning to buy

289
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:06,170
some loungewear and slippers
to leave here, but I keep forgetting.

290
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,030
What?

291
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,130
When it comes to relationships,

292
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,330
I'm a serious person.

293
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:38,380
W-Who's not being serious?

294
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:39,110
Obviously,

295
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:40,350
it's you.

296
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:41,790
Me?

297
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:46,690
Are you mad?

298
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,800
What did my dad say to you?

299
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,200
That doesn't make sense.

300
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,200
When you two left, the vibe was fine.

301
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,850
It has nothing to do with your father.

302
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,000
Then what is it?

303
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,960
Fine, don't tell me.

304
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:10,990
What do you mean by "having no thoughts
about marriage at all"?

305
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,440
I only said that

306
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,270
to help you out.

307
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:21,610
Otherwise, my dad would've
interrogated you for ages.

308
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:23,440
I understand

309
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,440
your dad's concerns,

310
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,700
and I can address them.

311
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,120
You have so little faith in me?

312
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,160
Of course not.

313
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,270
You're the person
I have the most faith in.

314
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,590
So...

315
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,510
that wasn't what you really meant?

316
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:41,590
I meant it.

317
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:45,190
It really is too early for us
to discuss those things.

318
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:47,880
What?

319
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,320
The master bedroom is
for the lady of the house.

320
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,050
The lady with no plans
can sleep in the guest room.

321
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,110
You're getting old.

322
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,300
And your temper's getting worse.

323
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,640
I can't sleep in my regular clothes!

324
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,130
Can I wear your bathrobe you left outside?

325
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,310
Go ahead.

326
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,830
Come out quickly!

327
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,880
There's a

328
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,200
super, super, super big spider
in the bathroom!

329
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,200
It's terrifying.

330
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:55,660
Three,

331
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:56,880
two,

332
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,320
one.

333
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,310
0.9,

334
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,880
0.8,

335
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:05,790
0.7...

336
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:23,310
Three,

337
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:24,830
two,

338
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:26,270
one.

339
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,030
Xiao Zhiyu,

340
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,640
we're out of toothpaste.

341
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,330
I can't sleep without brushing my teeth.

342
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:35,880
Who is it?

343
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,130
Convenience store delivery!

344
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:39,790
You just ordered toothpaste!

345
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,110
Gotcha.

346
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,680
Don't go.

347
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,800
So you still care about me.

348
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:47,350
Still mad?

349
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,070
I just want to talk to you.

350
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:55,480
Will you listen?

351
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,470
These past few years,

352
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,920
my life has felt like
following a preset template—

353
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,440
pursuing

354
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,150
a "stable" relationship

355
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,200
or a "secure" job.

356
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:15,450
In the end,

357
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,720
I couldn't satisfy others

358
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,030
or make myself happy either.

359
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,700
Until I met you.

360
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,660
Only then did I realize

361
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,310
what kind of life

362
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,640
and future

363
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,340
I truly want.

364
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,130
I chose my career path again—
one I actually like.

365
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,720
And then I met you.

366
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:45,690
Because of you,

367
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:49,400
I have more courage to chase my dreams

368
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,140
and make up for all my regrets.

369
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,920
So...

370
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:12,350
I understand.

371
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,640
Whatever plans you have for the future,

372
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,760
I'll support you as much as I can.

373
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,200
I just hope

374
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,350
your plans include me.

375
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,200
You're not part of my plans.

376
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:36,030
You're already written into my life.

377
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,180
Finally, you're smiling.

378
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,440
That wasn't easy.

379
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,270
So,

380
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,930
can I borrow your pajamas now?

381
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,270
Xiao Zhiyu.

382
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,480
You're not wearing shoes again.

383
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,460
What are you secretly looking at?

384
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,590
One of Ms. Zhou's projects.

385
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,960
The client wants to design
a community cultural center

386
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,200
based on the very popular concept

387
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,060
of a "community art living room."

388
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:37,510
I'm reviewing the client's requirements.

389
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,480
Ms. Zhou said

390
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,920
if I can secure this project,

391
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:46,000
she'll let me lead it.

392
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,030
She's testing me.

393
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:52,750
I need to figure it out myself.

394
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,750
Don't interfere.

395
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,200
I haven't said a word yet.

396
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,930
As a family member, you should know
when to step aside.

397
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:00,660
Understand?

398
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:02,890
"A family member"?

399
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,550
Fine.

400
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,400
Then can this family member

401
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,960
give me some independent creative space?

402
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,790
Go, please.

403
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,110
Come on, go.

404
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:23,640
Go.

405
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,830
You can use the study.

406
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:09,430
You don't look comfortable
sitting like that.

407
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,030
No, thanks.

408
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,720
That chair of yours

409
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,240
fits your figure,

410
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:16,110
but it doesn't suit me.

411
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,790
Being more comfortable

412
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,450
helps you think more clearly.

413
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,920
Let's meet.

414
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,680
What's wrong?

415
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,400
Pei Zhen.

416
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,270
He wants to see me.

417
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,160
Let's play together,

418
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:41,590
Qin...

419
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,070
Xiao Zhiyu.

420
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:55,670
Here.

421
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:01,720
You go first.

422
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,790
It's okay.

423
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,190
We can start over.

424
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:15,980
She's fine.

425
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,630
How is your mother doing?

426
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,480
She's doing fine.

427
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,510
So you came to see me just to ask that?

428
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,190
Forma recently held a board meeting.

429
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,260
I've decided to change the company name.

430
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,320
I just found out

431
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,710
that your father

432
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,110
chose the name.

433
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,330
Continuing to use it...

434
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,929
just doesn't feel right anymore.

435
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,710
The process will take some time.

436
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:03,440
Once I'm done with everything,

437
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,700
I'll leave this place.

438
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:14,190
You're just letting go like that?

439
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:15,400
No regrets?

440
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,780
All these years...

441
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,620
I've always wanted to beat you just once.

442
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:30,310
When we were young, it was about grades.

443
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,890
When we grew up, it was about the company.

444
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,630
Later on...

445
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:47,030
I even wanted to outdo you in hatred.

446
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,000
But it turns out, you never

447
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,200
even saw me as a rival.

448
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,320
Pretty ridiculous,

449
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:55,880
isn't it?

450
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,170
What are your plans after this?

451
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,160
I don't know yet.

452
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,670
But someone once told me—

453
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:17,440
what ultimately determines
what a building becomes

454
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:18,770
isn't the foundation,

455
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,110
but your own vision.

456
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,150
I'll go look for that.

457
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,840
Xiao Zhiyu.

458
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,830
We probably won't see each other again.

459
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,550
I'm sorry.

460
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:03,730
For everything...

461
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,920
everything I did to you.

462
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,800
I'm sorry.

463
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,110
