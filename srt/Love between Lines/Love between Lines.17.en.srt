00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:56,800
[Episode 17]

3
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:10,240
Mr. Xiao,

4
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,850
I'm leaving for the day.

5
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:13,810
Hold on.

6
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,430
Hasn't Hu Xiu

7
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,470
finished inspecting
the construction site yet?

8
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,750
I just called to check.

9
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,240
She said the inspection's done,

10
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,800
but she needs to make a run to Forma
with Mr. Pei

11
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,660
to pick up some supplier materials,

12
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,920
so she won't be coming back to the studio.

13
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:29,960
Alright.

14
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:30,550
Alright.

15
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,310
The steel and sand-and-gravel suppliers

16
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,280
are both reputable,
long-established manufacturers,

17
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,470
so there shouldn't be any issues.

18
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,430
As for the other suppliers and studios,

19
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,310
we'll discuss things internally first

20
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,110
and then get back to you, Mr. Pei.

21
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,900
It's already this hour.

22
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,829
Why don't we have dinner together?

23
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,079
I don't want to impose.

24
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,810
It's just staff meal.

25
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,870
You don't need to be so formal, Ms. Hu.

26
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,030
Besides,

27
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,030
our partner has come all this way.

28
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,560
If we can't even offer a meal,

29
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,590
word might get out

30
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,120
and make Forma look stingy.

31
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:09,870
Let's go.

32
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,280
I'll show you around

33
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,590
Forma's staff cafeteria while we're at it.

34
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,190
You'll be coming here often.

35
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,430
Alright.

36
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:10,870
So, what do you think?

37
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,930
Regret not choosing Forma back then?

38
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,400
Not at all.

39
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,940
Being Forma's partner is quite nice too.

40
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,079
Take more of whatever dishes you like.

41
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:30,880
Are you home yet?

42
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,240
Not yet.

43
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,450
Still haven't finished the inspection?

44
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,909
It's finished.

45
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,640
Just getting ready for dinner.

46
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,159
With whom?

47
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,360
With Mr. Pei.

48
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,510
Staff meal.

49
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:56,920
But

50
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,950
as far as I know,

51
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,750
employees aren't obligated

52
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,200
to report their after-work activities
to their boss, right?

53
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,520
Your sketchbook

54
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,160
has been packed into my box.

55
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,920
Come get it.

56
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,900
Done chatting?

57
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,770
Is there something urgent?

58
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,850
No, nothing.

59
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,310
Try this.

60
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,280
These are all signature dishes.

61
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,840
Since you took it by mistake,

62
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,470
shouldn't you be the one returning it?

63
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,130
Why am I the one going to get it?

64
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,270
Where exactly is it?

65
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:53,490
Xiaorou,

66
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,390
you're back.

67
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,480
Listen,

68
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,620
there's that dripping sound again.

69
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,160
Got it.

70
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,240
Let's call it a day.

71
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,070
Okay.

72
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,540
I'm leaving then, Xiaorou.

73
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,360
Mr. Pei, please stop here.

74
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,420
This is far enough.

75
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,240
It's getting late.

76
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,430
Let me drive you home.

77
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,830
That won't be necessary.

78
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,620
I'll see my own employee back, of course.

79
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,270
Mr. Xiao?

80
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:16,370
Mr. Xiao, are you also here
to visit Forma's cafeteria?

81
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,460
I've brought this here to you.

82
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,800
I didn't ask you to bring it here.

83
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,670
I'll give it to you in the car.

84
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,440
Why not let Ms. Hu choose for herself

85
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,970
whose car she wants to take?

86
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,240
Why force it, Mr. Xiao?

87
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,000
Ms. Hu?

88
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,790
Thank you for your hospitality today.

89
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,020
I won't trouble you further, Mr. Pei.

90
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,020
See you next time.

91
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:01,870
Goodbye.

92
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,020
Got the suppliers' information?

93
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,840
It's all here.

94
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,750
I've discussed and confirmed
the steel, cement,

95
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,549
and sand-and-gravel manufacturers
with Mr. Pei.

96
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:42,010
For glass and coatings,
Forma has two supplier options

97
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:43,669
with some price differences.

98
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,250
I've specified our technical requirements.

99
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,320
As for the details,

100
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,510
you can take a look at the materials
before making a decision.

101
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:53,000
As for 3D-printed ceramic
building material supplier,

102
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,340
there are even more options

103
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:57,270
since the technology
is controlled by Forma itself.

104
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,550
What's wrong?

105
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:06,960
Mr. Xiao.

106
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,300
I've finished reporting my work.

107
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,400
Do you have any other questions?

108
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:13,960
No.

109
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,360
I'll make a decision
after reviewing the materials.

110
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,160
If it wasn't so urgent, Mr. Xiao,

111
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,240
why did you rush all the way to Forma?

112
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,310
Are you upset

113
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,350
because I had dinner with Mr. Pei?

114
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,960
But we're partners with him now.

115
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,890
I shouldn't really need to
avoid meeting him, right?

116
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,500
Since you care so much,

117
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,850
why don't you just
kick me out of the project, Mr. Xiao?

118
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,650
You're doing well on this project.

119
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,650
I have no reason to kick you out of it.

120
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,030
Mr. Gong?

121
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,760
Why is he calling me?

122
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,780
What is it, Mr. Gong?

123
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:10,150
Hu Xiu.

124
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,750
You need to come right away.

125
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,990
Mr. Gong, what's wrong?

126
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:27,700
Follow me.

127
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,670
Why is the café already closed?

128
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,240
This isn't Zhao's usual closing time.

129
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:33,840
Exactly.

130
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,200
I was about to go home,

131
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,790
but when I passed by

132
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,320
and glanced over,

133
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,030
I saw her...

134
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,150
I'd never seen her
like that before, either.

135
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,410
It really startled me.

136
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:44,790
Look.

137
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,700
She's still like this.

138
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,410
She was already like this
when I passed by.

139
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,150
Think about it, that was
quite a while ago.

140
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,360
Even as someone who doesn't sell coffee,
I know

141
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,460
that once the beans are ground,
you're supposed to drink it right away,

142
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,630
otherwise the flavor disappears quickly.

143
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,910
The café's already closed,

144
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,970
so why is she grinding so much coffee?

145
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,100
Could it be

146
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:04,320
she's possessed or something?

147
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:13,130
Zhao.

148
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,870
Zhao, what happened?

149
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,910
What happened?

150
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,150
Zhao.

151
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,320
No matter what happened,

152
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,720
you can tell me.

153
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:33,720
It's okay.

154
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,050
I'm always here for you.

155
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:39,510
Stop grinding it.

156
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,510
Talk to me.

157
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,390
Stop grinding it, alright?

158
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,080
Zhao,

159
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,240
stop it.

160
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,140
Wang Guangming...

161
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,210
Is having an affair.

162
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,120
Does it hurt?

163
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:40,960
Honey,

164
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,910
are you still at the café?

165
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,530
It's already this hour.

166
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,950
I'll come pick you up.

167
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:47,850
Reply for me, please.

168
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,450
I don't know what to say to him.

169
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,550
Just tell him

170
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,130
I'm staying with you today

171
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,450
and not going home.

172
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:16,720
Zhao,

173
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,840
whatever decision you make,

174
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,840
I'll be with you.

175
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:24,460
Then right now, I just want to

176
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:29,850
sleep for a bit.

177
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,600
I'm tired.

178
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,380

Hu Xiu isn't here.

208
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,600
She went home early in the morning
to change clothes.

209
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,860
Said she had a meeting.

210
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,120
I see.

211
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,360
Thanks.

212
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:40,480
Mr. Xiao.

213
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,030
Even though I don't know

214
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,020
what exactly happened

215
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,850
between you and Xiu,

216
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,670
I know her well.

217
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,480
She may seem fine on the surface lately,

218
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,360
but actually, when you moved out,

219
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,420
she couldn't even enjoy the New Year.

220
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:01,910
Xiu

221
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,160
has always been very sincere and serious
with people

222
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,819
and with everything she does.

223
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,790
Maybe you should try

224
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,829
being a bit more honest with her.

225
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:24,859
Hello, Zhao.

226
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:26,030
I bought you breakfast.

227
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:26,720
It's on the table.

228
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,180
Try to eat at least a little

229
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,720
and get some proper rest.

230
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,510
Don't worry.

231
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,350
I'm okay.

232
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,200
You didn't get to work late, did you?

233
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,710
No, I timed it perfectly.

234
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,180
I'm already at Forma now.

235
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:37,880
I'll come find you at the café

236
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,750
after I get off work.

237
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,410
Bye-bye...

238
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,320
Take it slow.

239
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,610
We still have time.

240
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,680
Thanks a lot, Mr. Pei.

241
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,170
Didn't sleep well last night?

242
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:04,340
Let's go.

243
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,640
Mr. Xiao.

244
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:22,510
Sun.

245
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,640
Morning, Engineer Sun.

246
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,550
Mr. Pei.

247
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,000
Hu.

248
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:28,960
I'm sorry

249
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,820
for being late.

250
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,350
If my watch is correct,

251
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,270
we're not late.

252
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,240
Right on time.

253
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,000
Mr. Pei,

254
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,890
although we're working together,

255
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,310
you're from the engineering side

256
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,170
and our studio is the design side.

257
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,110
The way you used the word "we" just now

258
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:44,110
wasn't really appropriate, was it?

259
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,680
Sure.

260
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:48,310
Everything you say is correct, Mr. Xiao.

261
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,710
The elevator is here.

262
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,860
Mr. Pei, which floor is
the meeting room on?

263
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:14,100
Mr. Pei.

264
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,900
Do you usually press the elevator button
for your employees too?

265
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,900
Not really.

266
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,590
Ms. Hu is the only exception.

267
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,320
It's not the first time anyway.

268
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,960
Ms. Hu, you might not remember.

269
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,150
It was when you came to  Forma
for an interview

270
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:27,680
and were taking the elevator down
afterward.

271
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,100
So you were that person
in the elevator that day.

272
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,830
Sorry, I didn't really notice.

273
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,080
It's alright.

274
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,440
It's just a pity

275
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:46,070
that you didn't choose Forma
in the end, Ms. Hu.

276
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,660
But aren't you working together now
anyway?

277
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:50,590
That shows Mr. Pei and Hu
were meant to cross paths...

278
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,200
It only shows Forma failed to
recognize talent

279
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,460
and couldn't keep her.

280
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,550
All I can say is that
Ms. Hu is very outstanding—

281
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:02,350
she ended up becoming a partner
of Forma after all.

282
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,320
Thank you.

283
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:30,970
This helps replenish
your energy and blood.

284
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,500
It's the healthier option.

285
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,300
Thank you.

286
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,240
I'll begin now.

287
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,640
The suppliers provided by Mr. Pei cover
a very comprehensive range of categories.

288
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,480
This is the shortlist our studio
put together after an initial evaluation.

289
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,680
For steel, cement, and sand and gravel,

290
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,550
as I discussed with Mr. Pei yesterday,

291
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,400
we'll go with state-owned enterprises
with absolute quality guarantees.

292
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,070
Taking all factors into account,

293
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,480
I've compiled a shortlist of manufacturers

294
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,880
as reference recommendations.

295
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,110
For waterproofing
and insulation materials,

296
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,510
we recommend Shunke Chemical;

297
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,310
and for timber,

298
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,960
Qisheng Timber.

299
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,580
Excuse me, let me interrupt.

300
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,160
I see that Qisheng's quotation
is relatively high.

301
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,820
Why do you recommend Qisheng?

302
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,030
Because timber has
relatively high requirements

303
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,640
for temperature and moisture,

304
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,190
the shorter the transportation distance,

305
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,060
the lower the transport costs.

306
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,160
Qisheng's factory

307
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,310
is very close to Shanghai,

308
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,920
so the transportation losses are minimal.

309
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,790
When you factor everything in,

310
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:37,450
their overall cost actually ends up lower
than other factories'.

311
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,940
Do you have any other questions, Mr. Pei?

312
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:43,290
Your analysis is very professional,
Ms. Hu.

313
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,160
As for decorative stonework,

314
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,880
we recommend Mingzhu Building Materials,

315
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,720
because their product range
is very comprehensive,

316
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,590
and their colors and textures

317
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:53,390
can better reproduce
the intended design effect.

318
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,370
Ms. Hu's analysis is indeed
very comprehensive.

319
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:03,840
Do you have any
different opinions, Mr. Xiao?

320
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,790
I think we have better options.

321
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,820
So which supplier do you prefer, Mr. Xiao?

322
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,680
You might as well say it outright.

323
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,160
At the end of last year,

324
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,400
Forma took on a hot spring hotel project

325
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:16,510
and used materials

326
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,030
supplied by Jiahao Stone.

327
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,520
For the library project
the year before that,

328
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,670
the timber supplier was
China Resources Industrial.

329
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,640
And the amusement park project
from some time ago—

330
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,880
although it wasn't publicly announced—

331
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,780
I recall the supplier was Fenghe,

332
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,400
right?

333
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,330
What do you mean by that, Mr. Xiao?

334
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,680
What I mean is

335
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,420
that this set of supplier information
is incomplete.

336
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,870
I need the full list of Forma's
partner manufacturers

337
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:41,000
before I can give
the most appropriate recommendation.

338
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:45,600
Forma works with a number of suppliers

339
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,200
and we update them frequently.

340
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,000
It's difficult to list them all.

341
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,400
But we can guarantee that

342
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,790
for the Lyman project,

343
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,240
only the best ones will be used.

344
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,900
Since we're working together,

345
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,160
I'd still like to take all suppliers
into consideration

346
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,890
and select the optimal option.

347
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,510
Alright.

348
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:05,300
Since you've requested it, Mr. Xiao,

349
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,970
Forma will recheck everything

350
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,770
and prepare a complete set
of supplier materials.

351
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,040
Alright then.

352
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:13,830
We'll wait until
Mr. Pei has all the materials ready,

353
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:16,090
and we can discuss it further afterward.

354
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:38,590
Xiaorou.

355
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,480
Why did you grind so much coffee?

356
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,210
Do we have a big order coming in?

357
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,150
Xiaorou?

358
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:49,590
What's wrong?

359
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:51,170
Nothing.

360
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,230
[Honey, let's have dinner together
tonight. I've got good news to share.]

361
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,160
Xiaorou,

362
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,230
the pipe has burst.

363
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,100
What happened now?

364
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:27,660
Oh my.

365
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,550
This...

366
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:31,850
Ms. Zhao,

367
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,250
where are your water meter
and main switch?

368
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,070
Upstairs.

369
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:43,910
Are you here yet?

370
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:48,970
Boss, what are your orders?

371
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:49,890
Quick, come in.

372
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,240
You and Fei,

373
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,030
go over there

374
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,990
and move all the furniture upstairs.

375
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:55,680
Hurry up, you two!

376
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,340
Mop up all the water over here.

377
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,590
Remember to turn on
the air conditioner's heating

378
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,070
and let it run for a couple of days
to dry things out.

379
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:00,720
Otherwise, all these

380
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,510
wooden floors and wooden furniture

381
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,310
will be ruined.

382
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:02,910
Got it.

383
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,590
Ms. Zhao,

384
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,710
I've contacted the industrial park's
property management.

385
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,380
The repair technician
will contact you directly.

386
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,880
You should close the café for today.

387
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,750
Thank you.

388
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,060
No problem.

389
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,990
Just think about how you'll thank me
properly later.

390
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,550
Fei, you can't do it that way.

391
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:47,880
Ms. Zhao.

392
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,240
Everything's mostly cleaned up.

393
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:49,880
Well...

394
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,090
Ms. Zhao.

395
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:04,610
Are...

396
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,990
Are you okay?

397
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,770
I was too careless.

398
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,550
A long time ago,

399
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:17,030
my assistant mentioned to me

400
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,680
that there was a dripping sound
in the café,

401
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,680
but I didn‘t pay much attention.

402
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,720
Later,

403
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,240
the dripping became more frequent,

404
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,900
and I could hear it too,

405
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,840
but I didn't think
it was anything serious.

406
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,240
And today,

407
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,080
the pipe finally burst.

408
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,480
In fact,

409
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,440
the cracks had been there all along,

410
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,980
and the warnings had been given.

411
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,480
I just failed to notice them.

412
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,030
It's understandable

413
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,080
that you didn't pay much attention

414
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,190
to such a small matter.

415
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,060
Besides,

416
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:20,820
it's not too late
now that you've realized it.

417
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,240
If it really can't be fixed,

418
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,170
just replace it—

419
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:24,200
no big deal.

420
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,750
Right.

421
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,270
It wasn't a big deal.

422
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,280
I just didn't pay attention.

423
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,080
Stop squatting here.

424
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:48,350
Hurry and go change your clothes.

425
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,410
Don't catch a cold.

426
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,270
Okay.

427
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:00,650
These...

428
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,960
These shoes of yours can't get wet,
can they?

429
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,290
They're all soaked now.

430
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,140
Let me compensate you for them.

431
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:06,820
No need.

432
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,480
These are just old shoes anyway.

433
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,480
Besides, we are neighbors.

434
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,030
Don't worry about it.

435
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,920
It's really nice to be rich.

436
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,640
He just bought those shoes
the day before yesterday,

437
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,970
and now, they're "old."

438
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,640
Okay.

439
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,660
Let's meet at the usual place.

440
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,260
Mr. Xiao.

441
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:07,980
Xiaohe and the others went to get the car.

442
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,040
We can just meet them at the entrance.

443
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,160
Mr. Pei.

444
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,440
Please stop here.

445
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,350
Once the materials arrive,

446
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,760
I'll coordinate the timing with you.

447
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,690
Also, thank you for the jujube tea.

448
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,440
You look much more energetic now.

449
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,440
Get some good rest when you get back.

450
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:21,680
Mr. Xiao.

451
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,350
There will be plenty of work interactions
going forward.

452
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:28,270
I don't have to report
every single contact

453
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,070
between Ms. Hu and me to you, do I?

454
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,370
Being so controlling as a boss,

455
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:35,520
be careful—you might end up
losing your employees too.

456
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,790
Although Mr. Xiao
proposed a new plan today,

457
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:39,110
it doesn't take away from the fact

458
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,240
that Ms. Hu was well-prepared.

459
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,030
Your presentation today
was very substantial.

460
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:42,720
I believe

461
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,000
our cooperation will be very pleasant.

462
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:46,680
Thank you for your recognition.

463
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,430
Goodbye, Mr. Pei.

464
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:48,030
Take care.

465
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,020
By the way, Mr. Pei.

466
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:59,160
Let me answer your question from earlier.

467
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:02,210
From now on, any contact you have
with Hu Xiu

468
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:03,470
must be reported to me.

469
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:04,980
Also,

470
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:08,040
could you please
vary your poaching tactics?

471
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:10,510
Apart from expressing slight regret,

472
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,170
don't you have any new tricks?

473
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:14,710
How about

474
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:17,320
I sign you up for a training course?

475
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,770
I'll cover the tuition.

476
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:36,160
Xiu.

477
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:38,150
No need to come to the café today.

478
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,470
I want some time alone.

479
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:40,350
Okay.

480
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:42,350
Let me know if you need anything.

481
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,950
In the meeting just now, I...

482
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,250
Mr. Xiao.

483
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,050
What was that?

484
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,530
What about the meeting?

485
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:55,590
Nothing.

486
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,000
Xiaohe,

487
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:13,110
let's not go back to the office yet.

488
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,040
To Lanjing Park.

489
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,100
Get off.

490
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,800
No need to bring your laptop.

491
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,330
What are we doing here?

492
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,790
This is a new project we're working on.

493
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:43,940
There's a trendy pop-up store

494
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,470
that contacted our studio.

495
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:46,830
They want to build

496
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,680
a themed structure in this park.

497
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,240
The project isn't finalized yet,

498
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,840
so we're just checking it out first,

499
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,920
mainly to relax a bit.

500
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,350
Right.

501
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,680
Let's shoot more footage here.
When we get back,

502
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,680
help me with the composition, will you?

503
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,880
After our last site visit,

504
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,920
I realized your aesthetic sense
is amazing.

505
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,280
It's excellent, you know?

506
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,480
Let's take lots of photos

507
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,440
to put in the project proposal.

508
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:04,920
-No problem.
-Do you have the proposal?

509
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,750
Actually, it's not that urgent...

510
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:06,110
Sure I do.

511
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,170
I'll send it to you.

512
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,270
Why didn't you send it to me earlier?

513
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:11,000
There's also a famous attraction here

514
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,920
called the Dark Corridor.

515
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,790
If we have time later,

516
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:13,510
we should check it out too.

517
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:14,740
Maybe we can find inspiration from

518
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,920
that designer. What's his name again?

519
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,850
Let me think.

520
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,920
His name is... That foreign designer...

521
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,510
He even won an award

522
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:21,000
for this design, you know?

523
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,680
Come here!

524
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:33,130
Coming.

525
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,280
Sun, shoot from this angle.

526
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,500
Shoot that.

527
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,630
Check out this pic I just took.

528
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:41,160
How is it?

529
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:42,340
Not bad.

530
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:42,920
Of course.

531
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,270
Wait, wait.

532
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:44,640
Y-Your focus was off.

533
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:45,440
Was it?

534
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,440
The focus should be on the foreground,

535
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,310
but you focused on the background.

536
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,550
Your focal length wasn't right.

537
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,880
You need to select this.

538
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:52,110
Oh, I see.

539
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,230
The exposure is also clearer this way.

540
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:53,830
Sun Yifei!

541
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,350
Next time...

542
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,550
Sun Yifei, come here.

543
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:58,300
Go up a bit.

544
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,160
You can capture the east side
of the project site there.

545
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:01,760
Is that so?

546
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,640
Is it here, Mr. Xiao?

547
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,570
A little higher.

548
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,810
Is it here, Mr. Xiao?

549
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:14,480
A little higher.

550
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,130
Come with me.

551
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:26,410
I still can't see the project site
from here.

552
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,300
Mr. Xiao...

553
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,930
Just now in the meeting,

554
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:46,720
I didn't mean to say
your supplier choice was bad.

555
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,590
It's my fault.

556
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:52,590
I didn't check

557
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:55,050
Forma's previous collaboration projects.

558
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,860
Is this what you wanted to say in the car
just now?

559
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:01,810
So

560
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,780
we didn't come to the park for work?

561
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,410
I was worried about your mood.

562
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,480
Mr. Xiao.

563
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,150
I won't get carried away just because

564
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,610
a competitor flatters me,

565
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:18,040
nor will I hold a grudge
simply because my boss

566
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,070
points out my mistakes.

567
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:20,469
You're overthinking it.

568
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:27,480
I'm just

569
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:28,989
a bit worried about Zhao.

570
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,440
If you're really concerned,

571
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,540
I can drive you to the café later

572
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,000
and give you half a day off.

573
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:41,840
No need.

574
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,260
She said she wants some time alone today.

575
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,840
She's an adult.

576
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,030
I think

577
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,730
she knows what she's doing.

578
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,650
She's the type of person

579
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,550
who's strong-willed

580
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,320
and brave.

581
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,360
She always says with love,
even water is filling;

582
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,960
and with love comes ability.

583
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:02,920
I thought she had finally met someone

584
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,850
who wouldn't let down her courage.

585
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,840
But now I see

586
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,120
she deserves better.

587
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,360
Of course, I'm no better

588
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,760
in this regard myself—

589
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,180
just about the same as her.

590
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:20,910
I wonder how long it takes

591
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:23,190
to truly see someone for who they are.

592
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,620
I'll go buy some water.

593
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,800
There's also

594
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,150
a famous attraction here
called Dark Corridor.

595
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,360
We should check it out later
if we have time.

596
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:09,880
Here in this park?

597
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,440
Yes.

598
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,630
When we go there,

599
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,030
we can look for project inspiration,

600
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:13,510
right?

601
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,000
Hu Xiu?

602
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:36,110
[Please touch the wall with your left hand
and bravely move forward]

603
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:39,110
[through the darkness, until you reach
the realm of love and light.]

604
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,280
Hu Xiu?

605
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:26,880
Xiaoyi.

606
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,490
Put your blindfold on,

607
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,670
count to ten,

608
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,030
and then come find Daddy,

609
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:31,670
okay?

610
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:32,710
Okay.

611
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:39,510
Ten.

612
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,000
Nine.

613
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,400
Eight.

614
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:43,960
Seven.

615
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,320
One!

616
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:46,920
Dad?

617
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,030
Dad?

618
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:51,320
Dad?

619
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,480
Dad?

620
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:57,560
Dad?

621
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,190
Dad?

622
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:00,840
Dad?

623
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,590
Dad?

624
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,110
Xiao Zhiyu.

625
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:34,320
Xiao Zhiyu.

626
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:23,440
Xiao Zhiyu.

627
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,490
Are you alright?

628
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,590
Xiao Zhiyu.

629
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Are you alright?

630
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,030
I'm fine.

631
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:54,830
This must be the Dark Corridor
Sun just mentioned.

632
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,200
It's pretty intimidating.

633
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:00,320
I've taken some photos.

634
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:00,960
Let's go.

635
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:09,200
You're not afraid of the dark, are you?

636
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:10,960
Of course not.

637
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:13,880
Right.

638
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:16,950
You were the one who saved me
back in Rongcheng.

639
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,730
Don't walk so fast.

640
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,180
Just admit it. You're afraid of the dark.
