[Episode 14]

3
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,030
I got drunk and blacked out?

4
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,310
I ate poisonous mushrooms

5
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,750
and got mildly poisoned?

6
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,840
Mr. Xiao,

7
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,470
s-sorry for the trouble last night.

8
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,200
Are the other colleagues okay?

9
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,150
They're fine.

10
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:50,670
Well...

11
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:54,550
I didn't do anything inappropriate
last night, did I?

12
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,360
In such a hurry
to clear yourself of it, huh?

13
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,420
It's not like that.

14
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,320
I just completely blacked out.

15
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,860
Did I curse at you?

16
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:04,750
No.

17
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:08,450
I hit you?

18
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:11,960
I'm sorry, Mr. Xiao.

19
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,710
I really can't recall anything.

20
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,190
If you're upset about it,

21
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,850
you can hit me back if you want.

22
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,570
Are you sure?

23
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:38,870
Dream on.

24
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,190
I'm going out for a while.

25
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,590
Remember to eat it later.

26
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,960
He could at least eat before leaving.

27
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,970
What delicious food did he make?

28
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:00,990
You're awake?

29
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,710
Go get some more sleep.

30
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,710
It's still early.

31
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,120
No way.

32
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,310
I thought of some desserts last night.

33
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,570
I need to give them a try
at the shop today.

34
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,950
Why am I feeling so drowsy?

35
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,800
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

36
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,130
I'm helping you wake up.

37
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:27,650
Here it comes.

38
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,159
Boss.

39
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:44,830
My mom sent you
these eight-treasure pastries.

40
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,230
Did your mom visit your place?

41
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,630
No, she had them delivered to me
by FlashEx.

42
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:51,800
I see.

43
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,970
After all, you have someone
living at your place now.

44
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,680
That's just my regular roommate.

45
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,040
I never said otherwise.

46
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,550
I'll text your mom on WeChat.

47
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,190
Mrs. Bai, I received the pastries.

48
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,190
Thank you so much.

49
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,970
I haven't even tried them yet.

50
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,360
Now that the Design Competition is over,

51
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,270
I feel so empty inside.

52
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,310
I can tell.

53
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,070
You're showing up here from time to time.

54
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,390
I can't keep you company tonight.

55
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,870
Wang is clocking out early today.

56
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,600
We're having dinner together.

57
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:22,130
The two of us haven't
had a proper meal together in ages.

58
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,120
I understand.

59
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,750
First come, first served.

60
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,270
I fully understand.

61
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:27,950
How about this?

62
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:28,800
In order to make it up to you,

63
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,750
I'll treat you to a murder mystery game.

64
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,410
No, thanks.

65
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,310
You can go play with Li Yue.

66
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,800
I heard they're
having special events these days.

67
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,720
I'm wondering where they get
all these creative ideas from.

68
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,380
No worries,

69
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,390
I have coupons.

70
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:41,680
Three.

71
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,270
Two.

72
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,159
One.

73
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,020
He comes to buy coffee
at this time every day now.

74
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,680
Oh, you're here, too!

75
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,240
The usual?

76
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:54,510
The usual.

77
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,120
Okay.

78
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:55,960
Alright.

79
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,040
The promotional leaflets
have all been handed out.

80
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,510
Remember to give me the coupons later.

81
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,190
No problem.

82
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,400
When did you two
form this strategic partnership?

83
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,600
It's nothing like that.

84
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,390
I'm simply

85
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,390
helping Li Yue meet

86
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,050
his promotional KPI targets.

87
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,390
Your next round is about to kick off.

88
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,390
You should go now.

89
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,070
See you.

90
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:21,760
Bye-bye.

91
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,430
Song Lina,

92
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,000
a spy funded by a mysterious person.

93
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,070
Your first mission is

94
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,920
to stop the new Commander
from entering the city.

95
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,430
Look!

96
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,560
It's actually Qin Xiaoyi from Group A!

97
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,260
Group A?

98
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,000
So he ended up here?

99
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,210
It's actually Qin Xiaoyi!

100
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,870
This look is

101
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:56,650
quite dope.

102
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,390
Hold on.

103
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,120
I remember I have a mission.

104
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,830
Commander Qin!

105
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,270
Please wait a moment!

106
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:18,720
My dad...

107
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,240
My father was wrongfully imprisoned.

108
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,120
He's suffering greatly from illness now.

109
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,630
Commander, please help me

110
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,290
deliver this medicine to him.

111
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,240
I

112
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,070
cannot do you this favor.

113
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,360
What kind of attitude was that?

114
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,840
Is it because of what happened last night?

115
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,920
What on earth happened last night?

116
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:44,830
Miss Song,

117
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,110
I have something for you.

118
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:51,920
Here you are.

119
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,340
How did I not notice before

120
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,070
that there was sponsorship here?

121
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,380
Even when drinking water,

122
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,180
you should also stay observant.

123
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,430
Miss Song,

124
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,390
see you at the ballroom at 9 tonight.

125
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,400
Your ex-lover will invite you to dance.

126
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,950
Please help him win the position of mayor.

127
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,380
Ex-lover?

128
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,100
How melodramatic.

129
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,510
Is he

130
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,580
my ex-lover?

131
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,070
No way...

132
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:06,670
Miss Song,

133
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,320
shall we dance?

134
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:23,000
You're such a master
of switching moods, Commander.

135
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,550
You were so aloof to me
on the street earlier.

136
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,720
And now you've invited me to dance.

137
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,150
You're way better

138
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,770
than me at switching moods.

139
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,200
Nonsense.

140
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,790
I'm always steadfast in principles

141
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,060
and consistent in ideas and actions.

142
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:40,190
Consistent in ideas and actions?

143
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,350
Does that mean

144
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,630
you do everything following your heart?

145
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:48,080
Yes.

146
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,320
By the way,

147
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,370
give me that medicine bottle.

148
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,670
You just rejected me on the street.

149
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,380
There were too many people watching.

150
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,840
I couldn't tell if they were good or evil.

151
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,350
Give me the medicine bottle.

152
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,610
I will find a way
to send it to your father.

153
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,960
I'm not

154
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,820
like some irresponsible people.

155
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,000
Qin Xiaoyi.

156
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,130
Oh, no, it's a dead end.

157
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,930
Find that person at all costs!

158
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,820
Hurry and hide!

159
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,330
Get in here.

160
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,870
Go check inside!

161
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,670
Let's go

162
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,800
check over there.

163
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,270
Is he gone?

164
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,000
Well, then,

165
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,400
can you make some space now?

166
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,910
Desperate times
call for desperate measures.

167
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:06,040
I'm not taking advantage of you, okay?

168
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,000
It wouldn't be the first time anyway.

169
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,720
Watch your language. When did I ever...

170
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,320
Watch out.

171
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,860
Actually, there's something

172
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,490
I've always wanted to say.

173
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:26,860
You have

174
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,470
♪ Close your eyes for me ♪

175
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,110
a really good-looking face.

176
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,020
Wait.

177
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,730
Don't get me wrong.

178
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,600
That night, I was hallucinating

179
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,910
due to those mushrooms.

180
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:42,480
I was

181
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,080
not sober and made a mistake.

182
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,520
Anyway, don't take anything I did

183
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,010
seriously.

184
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,760
Of course not.

185
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,370
If I had taken it seriously.

186
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,570
I wouldn't be standing here right now.

187
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,500
So... Let's move on from this.

188
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:02,970
Where

189
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,210
are you going next?

190
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,810
To find Feng Youjin.

191
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,360
Here's all the intelligence
Feng Youjin needs.

192
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,320
If you want to seek cooperation with him,

193
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,650
it should come in handy.

194
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,400
I'm leaving.

195
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,380
What on earth did I do?

196
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,240
Honey.

197
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,510
My husband is home so early today.

198
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,200
Zhan Jie is taking my shift tonight.

199
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,990
I came home in a hurry to get some rest.

200
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,790
He'll probably stay up all night.

201
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:00,440
It's going to be exhausting.

202
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,550
Let me order some food for him.

203
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,480
No need. I've ordered some for him.

204
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,550
Tired?

205
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,200
Let me show you
the account I've been working on.

206
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,130
It's gained quite a few followers.

207
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,070
101 followers?

208
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:19,880
Yep.

209
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,390
So what?

210
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:24,790
With 7 more, they could play
the 108 heroes in "Water Margin."

211
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:25,750
Fine.

212
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,990
I'll ask some colleagues of mine tomorrow

213
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,650
to fulfill your heroic dream.

214
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:34,990
Is this it?

215
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,200
This, too?

216
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,730
Last night, I tried to contact Zhan Jie

217
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,440
to help me fix a bug,

218
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,320
but I couldn't get through to him.

219
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,660
This wasn't the first time recently.

220
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,600
Aren't you two good friends?

221
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:32,450
What's wrong with him?

222
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,080
I really don't know.

223
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:36,480
But

224
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,300
if there's any bug you want to fix,

225
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,720
you can ask me to do it as well.

226
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,240
Yes.

227
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,160
You were the first one
who popped into my mind.

228
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,270
However,

229
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,120
someone told me

230
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,390
that you've been
working extra hours outside a lot lately.

231
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,520
So you might not have time to come over.

232
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,030
Guangming,

233
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,590
you've been working for me,

234
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,300
and I've treated you well, right?

235
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,790
If you want to venture out on your own,

236
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,520
that's fine.

237
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,030
We can have a proper farewell party.

238
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:05,120
But you can't take outside jobs

239
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,080
while still getting paid by me.

240
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,070
That's simply improper,

241
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,370
right?

242
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,160
You have indeed treated me well.

243
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:18,150
The business trips were
always assigned to me.

244
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,960
I needed to be gone
for at least 2 months every time.

245
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:23,350
I assisted with every major project,

246
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,720
but when it came to payment,

247
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,600
suddenly I was counted
as "a friend helping out."

248
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,560
My phone must be on 24 hours a day,

249
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:30,470
just waiting for your orders.

250
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,270
Honestly, I really don't

251
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,620
want to live this kind of life anymore.

252
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,590
What are you doing?

253
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:42,990
I'll make sure the handover goes smoothly.

254
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,460
Honey, what brings you here?

255
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,780
These are all your favorites, right?

256
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,270
These shops are quite far from each other.

257
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,720
Didn't you just get off work?

258
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,260
How did you find time
to go to all these places?

259
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,670
I was working outside the office today.

260
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,130
A client came to Shanghai.

261
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,660
I took him around the city.

262
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,710
Don't you want to ask me

263
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,120
about how everything's going

264
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,480
with our company?

265
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,930
Didn't you promise
you wouldn't let the project fail?

266
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:27,410
I believe you, of course.

267
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,800
I was afraid that asking too much
would add to your stress.

268
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,360
Don't just sit there.

269
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,360
Have some food, too.

270
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,220
I'm not hungry.

271
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,390
I need to go back to the office
to meet with Zhan Jie.

272
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,360
You still have something to work on?

273
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,390
It's almost done.

274
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,800
Once we officially sign the contract

275
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,330
and hand over the project
to that big company,

276
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:47,180
everything will be wrapped up.

277
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,390
Okay.

278
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,240
Soon.

279
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,550
There you are.

280
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,010
I just wandered around

281
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,280
and bought you a gift.

282
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,550
I haven't

283
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,960
bought you anything in the past few years.

284
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,420
I don't wear these things.

285
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,770
Don't waste your money.

286
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:10,480
It's just a small gift.

287
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:12,170
Tomorrow morning,

288
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,260
I'll go pick you up.

289
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,099
I've got everything ready
for the grave visit.

290
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:17,030
You don't need to worry about that.

291
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,670
Is there a problem?

292
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,000
Zhiyu.

293
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,480
I'm afraid

294
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,440
I couldn't make it.

295
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,960
You couldn't make it when you were

296
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,820
abroad before.

297
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,720
But now you're back.

298
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,600
I'm not...

299
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,550
ready to visit your father's grave yet.

300
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,310
You still resent him?

301
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,400
He left without a word back then

302
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,910
and left everything to me.

303
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,110
How could I not resent him?

304
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,880
Kanghua?

305
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,920
Almost done.

306
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,360
I'm with Zhiyu right now.

307
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:17,030
Don't worry about me.

308
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:20,200
Wait for me tonight.
Let's go back together...

309
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:20,880
I have something to handle.

310
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,940
I'll take my leave.

311
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:07,790
Hu!

312
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,270
You bought so many things.

313
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,530
They're all for my dad.

314
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,030
Madam.

315
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,520
Can you grab those cherries for me?

316
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,400
There you go.

317
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:15,880
Be careful.

318
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,810
It is a bit heavy.

319
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:25,880
Hu.

320
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,070
Who won today?

321
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,060
We're drawing even.

322
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,110
Mr. Xiao.

323
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,470
You didn't go to the studio today.

324
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:55,070
Did you go shopping instead?

325
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:57,920
I accidentally

326
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,510
dropped this bag on the ground.

327
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,440
Do you want to check if it's broken?

328
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,070
It's fine.

329
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,030
I don't need it anyway.

330
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,690
If you like it, you can take it.

331
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,240
I can take it?

332
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,880
What is it...

333
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,960
I've seen this before.

334
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,400
It's said to support
a painless blood glucose monitor.

335
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,130
The ads are really hyping it up.

336
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,160
Try it out.

337
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,000
Mr. Xiao,

338
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,920
I must be honest with you.

339
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:30,750
This watch

340
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,200
offers quite a lot of functions,

341
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,350
but the watchband style is
way too old-fashioned,

342
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:36,480
like something my parents would like.

343
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,790
Forget it if you don't like it.

344
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:38,440
Give it back to me.

345
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,750
I haven't finished testing yet.

346
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,480
Give it back.

347
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,030
I'll return it to you
when I'm done testing.

348
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:42,720
Give it to me. Come on.

349
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,050
I'll give it back when I'm done testing...

350
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,440
I think it's malfunctioning.

351
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,170
Take it back.

352
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,480
Dad.

353
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:25,920
Xiu.

354
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,770
Did you get everything?

355
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,000
Don't worry.

356
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,930
I bought everything you asked for.

357
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:32,240
Get up early tomorrow.

358
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,350
Don't delay anything.

359
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,480
I won't delay. Just wait for me at home.

360
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,160
Okay.

361
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,160
There's nothing else. I'll hang up.

362
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:59,520
Mr. Hu, Mrs. Bai.

363
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,880
The car can't drive up here.

364
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,720
Carrying so many things,

365
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,790
you must be exhausted.

366
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,400
Mr. Hu, would you like to take a break?

367
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,800
It's okay. I'm not tired.

368
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,190
Han Xuan, you're back from school?

369
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:10,130
We're on vacation.

370
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:11,300
I just got here yesterday.

371
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:11,780
Come on.

372
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,790
New Year's lucky money.

373
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,960
Take it as an early gift from me.

374
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,160
He's grown up now.

375
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,480
There's no need to give him lucky money.

376
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,640
But he's still a kid.

377
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,550
College students need money to spend.
Take it.

378
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,550
Thank you, Mr. Hu.

379
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:22,990
Thank you, Mr. Hu.

380
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:26,790
Let's go then.

381
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,310
Okay.

382
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,290
Xiu, let me carry that for you.

383
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:31,820
Thanks.

384
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:35,030
How's your new job?

385
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,270
Not bad.

386
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,240
No matter how busy you are at work,

387
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,750
remember not to miss your meals.

388
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,410
Now you're giving Xiu advice.

389
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,790
You've grown even taller.

390
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,510
Han,

391
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:15,880
we've come to visit you.

392
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,430
[Here rests Han Chuan]

393
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:50,200
Mr. Hu,

394
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,140
please take care of yourself.

395
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:53,920
Mr. Hu,

396
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:55,810
please don't mind me saying,

397
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,790
but you should rest that leg more.

398
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,270
Or it'll keep flaring up,

399
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:01,200
and your knee won't heal properly.

400
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,240
Compared to Han,

401
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,560
my leg injury is nothing.

402
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:14,710
Bro!

403
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,030
The location of the distribution box

404
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,400
and the wiring route have been set.

405
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,400
You're so efficient with your work.

406
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,150
Bro.

407
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,600
Those dried fruits
you bought last time were so good.

408
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,450
Where did you get them?

409
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:24,250
Tasty, right?

410
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:26,190
I'll buy some more tomorrow.

411
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:27,760
My wife, Renzi, is picky about food.

412
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,290
She loved these fruits
when she was pregnant.

413
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,750
Okay. Thanks, bro.

414
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,720
Come on!

415
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,050
Why are you thanking me?

416
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,590
I should be the one saying thank you.

417
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,030
Your wife is pregnant now.

418
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:37,400
Right?

419
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,310
And you still agreed to work with me.

420
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,270
To be honest,

421
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:41,360
I'd feel uneasy

422
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:42,520
if you weren't here.

423
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,970
But who could have imagined

424
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,080
that the stadium would collapse?

425
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,540
The chief architect committed suicide

426
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,990
and left everything behind.

427
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,750
Yet Han

428
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,490
didn't even get to see his child.

429
00:24:59,140 --> 00:24:59,780
Jerk!

430
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,620
Suicide was too easy for you!

431
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,810
Don't think suicide can exempt you
from responsibility!

432
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:07,090
My husband is only 40!

433
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:10,310
How are we, a widow and an orphan,
supposed to survive?

434
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,910
You owe me my husband's life!

435
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,440
[Qin Yuze's memorial service]

436
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,030
You murderer!

437
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,000
This isn't over just because he's dead!

438
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,730
You, the Qin family,
must give us an explanation!

439
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,780
Don't try to shirk the blame!

440
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,160
Right!

441
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,960
His family must atone for our losses!

442
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,360
Otherwise, who will take responsibility?

443
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,060
My dad asked me

444
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:02,160
to come on behalf of him and Mrs. Xiao

445
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,160
to pay respects.

446
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:18,130
You are just as stubborn
as when you were a child.

447
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Unfortunately, there's something

448
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,590
you can't solve
by throwing a temper tantrum.

449
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:36,960
Don't you agree,

450
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:39,310
Qin Xiaoyi?

451
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:53,160
[Qin Yuze]

452
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,790
So you're Qin Xiaoyi?

453
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,510
Your younger brother has changed his name.

454
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:06,720
He took my surname.

455
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,250
He's called Xiao Zhiyu.

456
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:09,200
From now on,

457
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:11,680
you'll be the one to protect your brother.

458
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,470
Starting today,

459
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,560
do not call him by his old name anymore

460
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,600
or tell anyone who his father is.

461
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,570
Understand?

462
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,570
I'll keep that in mind.

463
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,830
After all these years,

464
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:44,280
you dare not use your real name.

465
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,720
You've changed your name,
but you can't let go of the past.

466
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,440
So you can only use
the name "Qin Xiaoyi" in the game

467
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,640
to comfort yourself.

468
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,450
How pathetic.

469
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,540
Be more careful in the future.

470
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:09,280
The Pei family
has kept your secret for years.

471
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,310
If your identity is exposed,

472
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,250
and it gets Zhuling involved,

473
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,170
I won't let you off the hook.

474
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:18,560
By the way...

475
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,750
If some people find out

476
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:24,400
that you changed your name and identity

477
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,200
to cover up the stains on you,

478
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:29,440
will they still see you
the way they do now?

479
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:31,960
With all that talk about justice,

480
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,490
yet you,
the Peis, are the ones playing dirty.

481
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,620
If there ever comes a day
when Zhuling falls,

482
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,730
it should be the Pei family
bringing it upon themselves.

483
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:47,130
What are you trying to say?

484
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:02,350
Dad,

485
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,840
I've sent the flowers

486
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,880
as you told me to.

487
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:06,960
Good.

488
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,310
However,

489
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,820
he didn't seem to appreciate it.

490
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,290
As long as the flowers were delivered,

491
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:17,690
and Wanyue can be at ease,

492
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,800
that's enough.

493
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,280
How's your waist?

494
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,030
Feeling better now?

495
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:28,830
Much better.

496
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:31,350
Did you finish those treatments
at the Chinese medicine clinic?

497
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,310
Not yet.

498
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,960
Renzi, please don't spend extra money
on me anymore.

499
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,840
It's fine.

500
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,530
How was your semester?

501
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,930
Just so-so, I think.

502
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,640
Xuan,

503
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,960
is something bothering you?

504
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,310
Xiu, I...

505
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,050
want to quit school.

506
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:56,830
Why?

507
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,350
Look,

508
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,160
nowadays,

509
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:03,070
the job market is so competitive,

510
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:05,030
and I'm just from a second-tier college.

511
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:07,510
I don't think I'll have any advantage
after graduation.

512
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:10,440
I just want to start working
to gain some experience.

513
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:11,690
The point is

514
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,420
that my mom is getting older,

515
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,350
and I can't bear to let her
continue working as a cleaner

516
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,680
to pay for my schooling.

517
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,330
Xuan, you've grown up.

518
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,440
Xiu, do you

519
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,830
support me?

520
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,720
I understand you,

521
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,670
but I don't support this.

522
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:34,720
I still remember
how determined and exhilarated you were

523
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,510
when you chose your major.

524
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,240
Yes, but...

525
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,570
I just think my mom is working too hard.

526
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,960
I feel like she is stuck

527
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,880
in this kind of life because of me.

528
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:49,040
So you think if you drop out now,

529
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,160
your mom will be relaxed and free?

530
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:53,830
Isn't that the case?

531
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:57,330
If you really drop out of school,

532
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:59,260
that's when she'll truly be stuck.

533
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,270
Trust me.

534
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,750
No parent in this world

535
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,960
would ever want their child
to give up their dreams

536
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,160
for their sake.

537
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,050
If only...

538
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:18,480
If only that accident had never happened.

539
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,200
That's all water under the bridge.

540
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,960
We need to move on.

541
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:29,750
Look,

542
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,790
I also used to regret
not being able to study abroad.

543
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:33,510
But now,

544
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,100
I'm back doing architectural design again.

545
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,590
Xuan, don't give up so easily, okay?

546
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,720
If some people find out

547
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,240
that you changed your name and identity

548
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,070
to cover up the stains on you,

549
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:02,270
will they still see you
the way they do now?

550
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,530
Can't fall asleep?

551
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,880
I had too much coffee.

552
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,020
What about you?

553
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:44,830
I...

554
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,000
Same here.

555
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,530
I can't fall asleep either.

556
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,820
Check your phone.

557
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:04,310
It's the song I listen to
when I need help sleeping.

558
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,000
If you have trouble falling asleep,

559
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,260
you could give it a try.

560
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,510
Then why are you still up?

561
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,200
I'm listening to it now.

562
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,390
It just hasn't kicked in yet.

563
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:27,110
♪ I saw the tram
driving under the sunset ♪

564
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:34,350

569
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:58,310
Mr. Xiao.

570
00:33:59,480 --> 00:33:59,590
♪ Leaving a hurried silhouette
for the dusk ♪

571
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:01,030
If there's a chance,

572
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,600
I can take you to their live show.

573
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:08,370
♪ Talking about random topics ♪

574
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:08,960
Okay.

580

Mr. Wu, please.

581
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,710
You're too kind.

582
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:42,760
You can take it easy.

583
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,760
We're just having tea and chatting.

584
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,150
I've heard
that your factory is doing well lately.

585
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,679
And you're even expanding.

586
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,550
Thanks to our partnership

587
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,150
with Zhuling in the past couple of years,

588
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,960
the factory is finally on the right track.

589
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,670
Though our business
has been okay these years,

590
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,630
I still have to go seek orders myself.

591
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,840
Everyone knows

592
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,920
that companies with 3D printing

593
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,440
and building material technology
in China are

594
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,370
all Zhuling's business partners.

595
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:05,190
I'm just riding on your coattails,

596
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:07,150
barely surviving.

597
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,600
You're being too modest, Mr. Wu.

598
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:11,550
I heard

599
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,370
that you're
taking on a big project recently.

600
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:18,190
Mr. Pei,

601
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:21,710
I've always valued our cooperation
with Zhuling.

602
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,400
If there's anything you need,

603
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,330
just let me know.

604
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,720
Have some tea.

605
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,600
It's my fault.

606
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,000
I should have urged Lyman

607
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,100
to push the cooperation process forward
with Mr. Wu.

608
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,100
I never expected

609
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,190
that even after we reached an agreement,

610
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,650
they would still back out.

611
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:42,070
They claimed to be unable
to meet the production demands.

612
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:42,950
All excuses.

613
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,070
I've contacted

614
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,400
all 3D ceramic technology companies

615
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,590
that I could find.

616
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,230
But they all have deep cooperation

617
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,590
with one company.

618
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,480
As soon as I mentioned our project,

619
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,840
they all politely declined.

620
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,040
Seems like they were warned in advance.

621
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:57,750
Zhuling.

622
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:01,160
I've also asked around.

623
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:02,670
Years ago, Zhuling started

624
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,630
laying the groundwork
in the building materials sector,

625
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,960
which led to its monopoly position today.

626
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,590
But we can't let supply channels

627
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,590
hold us back.

628
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,320
Let's sort out a Plan B.

629
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,460
For example,

630
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,680
we could change the facade design plan.

631
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,800
There is actually an alternative plan.

632
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,590
-No.
-No way.

633
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,800
The visual highlight of Lyman's projects

634
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,400
exactly lies
in the facade's layers and textures.

635
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,190
The 3D printed ceramic bricks can balance

636
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,550
both the vintage vibe
and the modern deconstructivist design.

637
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:34,550
Once we change the materials,

638
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:36,280
all our efforts will be wasted.

639
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,380
If we want to keep the design,

640
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,470
there's another option.

641
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:41,400
That is to cooperate with Zhuling.

642
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:48,420
Meeting adjourned.

643
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:49,630
I'll think it over.

644
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,480
Xiao Zhiyu can't find a supply channel.

645
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:12,630
And when it comes to design,

646
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,880
he's the kind of person
who never compromises.

647
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,760
At this point,

648
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,230
he must be caught
between a rock and a hard place.

649
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,000
This move of yours

650
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,130
has really cut Xiao Zhiyu to the quick.

651
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,840
I have no interest
in petty people gloating

652
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:26,500
over their success.

653
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,500
This one actually went out of business?

654
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:37,220
Mr. Xiao!

655
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:39,030
I-I'm sorry.

656
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,560
I didn't know you were here.

657
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,480
Why are you like a cat,

658
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,960
walking without making any sound?

659
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,160
The same goes for you.

660
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:47,540
You jumped up pretty fast like a rabbit.

661
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:04,810
Put some ice on it now.

662
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:17,440
Does it hurt?

663
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,490
I bumped into you that hard?

664
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,840
What do you think?

665
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,410
I-I'll do it myself.

666
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,590
Mr. Xiao.

667
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,290
I just

668
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:52,070
found a small company

669
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:53,920
that should be able to produce

670
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,050
the 3D printed ceramic bricks we need.

671
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,150
His company

672
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:59,080
used to make 3D artistic ceramics.

673
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,570
There's not much information available.

674
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:03,960
All we know is that the owner
returned from Jingdezhen

675
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,630
and has just entered

676
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:06,840
the building materials field
in the past couple of years.

677
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,990
This company may not be well-known,

678
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,630
but its craftsmanship

679
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,430
might meet our standards.

680
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:19,830
Why aren't you saying anything?

681
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:21,630
Is it

682
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:22,910
not suitable?

683
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,870
Factories with a background in crafts
like this one are

684
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:30,080
generally small in scale

685
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,880
and focus on quality over speed.

686
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,410
For projects as big as Lyman's,

687
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:36,540
they might not be able to keep up
with the supply demands.

688
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,290
Your head hurts from the bump?

689
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,480
I need to cool down.

690
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,440
You're right.

691
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,890
This production capacity issue is

692
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:49,440
indeed very important.

693
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,520
It's already 10 PM.

694
00:40:58,750 --> 00:40:59,610
Time to go home.

695
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,400
Let's go home.

696
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:08,560
Turn off the lights.
