00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,150
Uncle Han often came to our home.

191
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:17,370
His cooking was delicious.

192
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,880
Every time he brought food,

193
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,680
I could eat nearly an extra bowl.

194
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,070
My dad's signature dishes

195
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:27,350
were all learned from Uncle Han.

196
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,650
He was really good at cooking fish.

197
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:34,960
That year,

198
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,320
my dad took on the stadium's

199
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,750
lighting project.

200
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,110
Uncle Han's wife was pregnant then.

201
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,000
He had originally planned

202
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,330
to take time off.

203
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,940
But in order to help my dad,

204
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,820
he still joined him in the end.

205
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,920
All those happy days

206
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:07,850
ended on that day.

207
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,310
I was only 4 or 5 years old then.

208
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,440
The reason I know all this so clearly

209
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:28,200
is because for over twenty years,

210
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,540
my dad has kept talking about him,

211
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,480
mentioning him again and again.

212
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,480
It's almost like

213
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,520
as long as we remember Uncle Han,

214
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,160
he never really left us.

215
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,030
Every year,

216
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,400
our family will visit his grave,

217
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,480
rain or shine.

218
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,100
My dad has always felt guilty.

219
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,160
He has never forgotten the past,

220
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,480
nor did he ever forget

221
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,030
that accident.

222
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,400
But last night,

223
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,680
because of me,

224
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,930
he was deeply hurt again.

225
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,720
I had you bring me here

226
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,430
just to tell you all this.

227
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,030
These days

228
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,490
have been pure happiness.

229
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,400
It felt like a dream.

230
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,350
I felt like I had it all.

231
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,800
It was as though life
couldn't get any better.

232
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,400
Sure enough,

233
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,240
the heavens

234
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,160
are still

235
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,970
waiting to make a mockery of me.

236
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:10,840
Xiao Zhiyu,

237
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,060

Dad?

259
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,160
Dad...

260
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,790
How are you feeling?

261
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,200
Does it hurt a lot?

262
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:26,630
Dad!

263
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,240
Dad.

264
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,800
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

265
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:39,830
I'm sorry.

266
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,750
I'm sorry!

267
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:44,690
I'm sorry!

268
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,720
I'm sorry.

269
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,270
Don't cry.

270
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,120
Don't cry.

271
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,400
It's not your fault.

272
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:56,790
I know.

273
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,640
I can't force you to make any decisions.

274
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,350
It's just that I owe Uncle Han

275
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,480
far too much.

276
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,170
When I meet him someday,

277
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:19,050
I won't know how to explain it to him.

278
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,000
Xiao Zhiyu!

279
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,070
Hurry up!

280
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,600
The movie is about to start!

281
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,680
Hurry, hurry!

282
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,650
Hurry up!

283
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,830
Regarding the rumors circulating online,

284
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,960
I would like to formally address them.

285
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,790
My father is indeed Qin Yuze.

286
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,790
I sincerely apologize for
any inconvenience

287
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,120
caused to our partners.

288
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,940
I promise here and now,

289
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,030
if there are any concerns about
our cooperation,

290
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,270
I will personally

291
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,440
bear the corresponding losses.

292
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:20,010
This concludes my statement.

293
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:20,620
Thank you.

294
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:29,770
No wonder Xiao never mentions his father.

295
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:32,880
He was just a child
when the accident happened.

296
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,240
What could he have done?

297
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:39,190
He must be having a rough time these days.

298
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,110
Xiao hasn't been

299
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,930
answering my calls these days.

300
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,750
Hu Xiu must know what's going on, right?

301
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,210
Did she tell you anything?

302
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,680
Or how about this?

303
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,960
You contact Hu Xiu,

304
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,090
and we'll go check on

305
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:53,110
Xiao together.

306
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,450
I don't have time to worry about him
right now.

307
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:59,110
He's your best friend's boyfriend
at the very least.

308
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:02,400
How can you be so indifferent when
something like this happens?

309
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,550
Boyfriend?

310
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,210
That's questionable now.

311
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:07,720
What do you mean?

312
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,830
Don't tell me that

313
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,890
Hu Xiu is going to

314
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,730
dump Xiao just because of this?

315
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,640
This is exactly when

316
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,680
he needs support the most.

317
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,350
Is Hu Xiu really that cold-hearted?

318
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:20,790
More—

319
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,200
Moreover,

320
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:24,110
his father's incident happened
so many years ago.

321
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,720
Why is Hu Xiu enforcing
punishment by association?

322
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,070
Who's being cold-hearted?

323
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:29,800
Don't talk nonsense if
you don't know any better.

324
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,310
Anyway, Xiao hasn't done anything wrong.

325
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:34,570
And Hu Xiu has done nothing wrong either.

326
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,270
Get out of here.

327
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:37,030
Don't get in the way of my business.

328
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:37,510
How annoying.

329
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,880
W-Why should I leave?

330
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,270
I came here for coffee.

331
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,060
Who asked you to speak for him?

332
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,030
What's going on?

333
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,590
Are you going to punish me with him too?

334
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,160
Yes.

335
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:47,840
You are...

336
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,420
Mr. Xiao, you're here.

337
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,550
Good morning.

338
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:33,810
Morning, Mr. Xiao.

339
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,010
Good morning, Mr. Xiao.

340
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:37,640
Mr. Xiao,

341
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,740
will you be attending the design meeting
this morning?

342
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,350
Here are the preliminary plans
for several projects.

343
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,480
You can take a look before the meeting.

344
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:48,960
Well then...

345
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,690
Mr. Xiao, I will leave you to it.

346
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,160
I'm sorry.

347
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,890
You always catch people by surprise.

348
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:35,690
After working with you for so long,

349
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:36,950
I've gotten used to it.

350
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,890
You haven't had a good rest these days,
am I right?

351
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,060
Things aren't that bad right now.

352
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,550
Everyone is addressing and resolving

353
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:51,680
our client's questions and concerns.

354
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,750
We let our work speak for itself.

355
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,480
Projects have not yet been
impacted at this time.

356
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,720
And you!

357
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,440
You've been shouldering everything
by yourself,

358
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,770
trying to be a lone hero.

359
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,310
Don't forget,

360
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,790
you have the entire studio behind you.

361
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:08,750
Five years of understanding and trust

362
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:11,280
cannot be so easily shattered
by past events.

363
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:18,150
Thank you.

364
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:21,410
What did Lyman say?

365
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,880
Mr. Xie said he wants to
talk to you in person.

366
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:37,350
Mr. Pei.

367
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,020
How is your father?

368
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,710
The surgery was successful,

369
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,200
but he still can't get out of bed.

370
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,330
He just fell asleep.

371
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,070
Then I shall not go in and disturb him.

372
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:53,470
I brought him some gifts.

373
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,960
I've been messaging you these days,

374
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,030
but you didn't reply.

375
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,160
I was quite worried,

376
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,720
so I asked Ms. Zhao

377
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:08,070
and found out about your father.

378
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,270
Have a seat.

379
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,200
You aren't getting much rest
these days, have you?

380
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,800
Your eyes are all bloodshot.

381
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,970
I'm just glad my father is okay.

382
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,860
This is a pretty good lawyer.

383
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:39,160
You can contact him to get compensation
from the driver responsible.

384
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,200
I've already made the introductions.

385
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,270
No need, thank you.

386
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:44,020
The accident isn't complicated,

387
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,830
and the other party is being cooperative.

388
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:46,960
As for the compensation,

389
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,230
I can handle it myself

390
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:49,670
once my dad becomes well.

391
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:58,620
Have you seen what's

392
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,330
happening online?

393
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:09,320
So you and Xiao Zhiyu...

394
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,760
Mr. Pei, if you have questions,

395
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,620
please just ask directly.

396
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:21,750
About him...

397
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:25,170
I'm sorry for keeping it from you.

398
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,780
After all, what happened back then
was quite a scandal.

399
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:30,940
His father committed suicide
out of fear of punishment,

400
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,740
leaving behind a complete mess.

401
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:36,160
He and his mother left the country
soon after.

402
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,410
The Pei family chose to help

403
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,240
out of our long-standing friendship.

404
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,000
But him?

405
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:46,010
He's never been appreciative

406
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,550
of our help.

407
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,030
My father and I

408
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:52,310
still harbor quite a bit of resentment.

409
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,440
You were kept in the dark by him.

410
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,310
Being upset

411
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,880
is only natural.

412
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,310
Changing his name,

413
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,920
hiding his past -

414
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,100
these weren't his decisions.

415
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,560
He was so young at that time.

416
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,020
It couldn't have been decided
by him, right?

417
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,220
But what his father did

418
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,270
left a profound impact.

419
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:22,670
Even if his father had made
a terrible mistake,

420
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:24,530
what does that have to do with him?

421
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:27,940
It was his father who caused
your father to be disabled.

422
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,140
Does that not matter?

423
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,210
So it's true.

424
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:40,430
You knew all along.

425
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:48,150
The revelation about his background

426
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:50,480
was circulated by you, Mr. Pei, wasn't it?

427
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,880
What I said is just the truth.

428
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,140
I haven't hidden anything.

429
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,820
But you're far from innocent.

430
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,880
Take these gifts back.

431
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,850
My father wouldn't accept your kindness.

432
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:40,840
Mr. Xie,

433
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,560
whatever you plan you have,

434
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,590
I'll accept it.

435
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,630
Your father and I

436
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,510
met while fishing.

437
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,550
I had just returned to start a business

438
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,880
and had no connections.

439
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:59,910
Your father, however, was in his prime.

440
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,840
He happened to catch

441
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,840
the infrastructure boom in China.

442
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,210
There were so many opportunities.

443
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,400
He has always been

444
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,400
very generous with his help.

445
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,630
I had no idea

446
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,620
my father had such a connection with you.

447
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,880
He told me

448
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:19,710
that good design

449
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,760
gives a building its soul.

450
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,630
Only such buildings

451
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
can withstand the test of time.

452
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:28,840
Those words of his

453
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:31,120
had a profound impact on me.

454
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:34,000
It's no wonder I felt

455
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,510
his presence in you the moment I met you.

456
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,910
You two really do take after each other.

457
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,710
Your opinion

458
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,800
means a lot to me.

459
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:55,550
Actually,

460
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:58,270
I've been curious about

461
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,330
how your knowledge of Forma

462
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,110
seems unusually thorough.

463
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,620
Otherwise, how could you have detected

464
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,750
their financial problems in advance?

465
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:09,030
Are you...

466
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,190
Never mind.

467
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,040
I asked you here today

468
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,380
to let you know that

469
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:20,170
there will be no changes to
Lyman's project.

470
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:24,280
While it's true I invited you today
to catch up,

471
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,360
my decision to choose you

472
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:30,040
was never because you were someone's son.

473
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:50,840
Sun.

474
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,120
Hu Xiu,

475
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,660
the latest news is that

476
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,980
Lyman's project hasn't been affected.

477
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:58,920
That's great!

478
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,110
So,

479
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:03,280
um...

480
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,990
how is Mr. Xiao doing?

481
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:07,750
He came to the office,

482
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,230
but he didn't seem in the best of spirits.

483
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,000
But don't worry,

484
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,710
we've done exactly as you said.

485
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:13,550
When we see him,
we act like nothing has happened,

486
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:14,510
we make no fuss,

487
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,760
and we didn't gossip behind his back.

488
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,360
Good.

489
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,500
At least he knows

490
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,580
that all of you are standing with him.

491
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,280
How are things on your end?

492
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,880
When will you be back at work?

493
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:29,150
I'm...

494
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,590
not sure yet.

495
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,330
Alright.

496
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:33,660
Remember to update me

497
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,960
with the project materials.

498
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,480
Project materials...

499
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:42,470
You'll have to wait as I need to
go get my laptop.

500
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,230
Okay.

501
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:44,040
There's a girl at your place.

502
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:46,150
Mom,

503
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,500
please ask her to wait.

504
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,030
You're from Zhiyu's studio, right?

505
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,230
I've seen you before.

506
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:57,760
Yes.

507
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,480
I'm Zhiyu's mother.

508
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,280
I know.

509
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:06,960
Mrs. Xiao,

510
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,880
If there's nothing else,

511
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,740
I'll be going now.

512
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:11,490
Wait.

513
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:14,550
You're here to meet Zhiyu,

514
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:15,710
but he's not back yet.

515
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:17,310
Why don't you wait for him a bit longer?

516
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:17,940
No need.

517
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:21,160
I'm just here to pick something up.

518
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:23,230
By the way,

519
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,510
you know Zhen too, right?

520
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,320
We've worked together.

521
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,790
So you and Zhiyu are...

522
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:44,320
Mrs. Xiao, I need to go now.

523
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,280
Mr. Xiao, I'm here to get my laptop.

524
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,280
Please excuse me.

525
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,550
I haven't formally introduced you yet.

526
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:52,470
I've already greeted Mrs. Xiao.

527
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:59,160
Let me make a proper introduction.

528
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,230
This is my mother,

529
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:00,960
Xiao Wanyue.

530
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,190
Mom,

531
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:06,590
this is Hu Xiu.

532
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,840
She's the person I love.
