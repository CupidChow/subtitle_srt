00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,840
Ms. Wang,

4
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,820
congratulations,

5
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:02,710
really.

6
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,000
Thank you.

7
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,950
To be honest with you,

8
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,630
I didn't expect to get married so early.

9
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,330
I was actually afraid of marriage before.

10
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,030
Indeed.

11
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,490
Flash marriage, in particular,
needs more courage.

12
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,590
Flash marriage?

13
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,360
How do you know that?

14
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,400
I...

15
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,640
Keep in touch.

16
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,250
Please stay for a while.

17
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,310
Let me add you on WeChat.

18
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:30,870
Okay.

19
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:31,320
Okay.

20
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,310
Okay.

21
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:32,710
Okay.

23

take care of everyone for me.

24

Go ahead.

25

Congratulations.

30
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,000
Thanks to you.

31
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,190
I'm so jealous.

33

Yes.

Son!

35
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,080
He's too busy to hear me.

36
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,960
Wait for me.

37
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,770
Okay. Okay.

What were you doing?

40
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,520
You didn't answer when I called you.

41
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,590
Auntie Xu and others are here.

42
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,520
Go and say hello.

00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,150
Hu Xiu?

45
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:19,820
Why is she here?

46
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,670
Does she know that...

47
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:23,970
How about this?

48
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,380
Go and attend to the guests.

49
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,380
Leave Hu Xiu to me.

50

How do you know that?

53
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,320
But I don't think

54
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,810
it's an accurate description.

55
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,750
We've known each other for over a year.

56
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,390
We dated

57
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,650
for more than half a year
to decide on our marriage.

58
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:25,530
Half a year?

59
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:26,830
Yes.

60
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,920
A while back,

61
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,210
he gave up everything in Shanghai

62
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,610
and came to Suzhou for me.

63
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,470
He did really well.

64
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,040
That's why my dad agreed to our marriage.

65
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,290
I told him to arrange the wedding
as soon as possible,

66
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,550
so that my dad wouldn't keep testing him.

67

Send the tablet and information in the bag

on the third floor of the hotel.

69
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,800
Is he here for the Lyman project?

00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,520
Hold it.

71

Don't ruin the business.

76
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:40,610
You're here
for the design competition's sake?

77
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:41,720
Yes.

78
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,230
Your studio has already been eliminated.

79
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,360
Letting you rejoin the competition

80
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,360
would be unfair to other companies.

81
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,960
When this island was being developed,

82
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,820
Mr. Wang invited many designers.

83
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,350
But they all refused.

84
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,200
So why did you accept it?

85
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,420
Precisely because they all refused.

86
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,800
In others' eyes,

87
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,770
this was just wasteland.

88
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:10,060
But the more something is overlooked,

89
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,140
the more it deserves to be redefined.

91
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:21,640
Mr. Xie?

92
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:23,920
I'm sorry.

93
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,040
You just reminded me
of someone from my past.

94
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,430
Is that person your friend, Mr. Xie?

95
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,960
I suppose so.

96
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,580
It'll be late if I don't go now.

97

with the competition?

98
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,530
What are you trying to say?

99
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,810
I want to know your choice—

100
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,020
will you stick to the rules

101
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:10,890
or choose

102
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,430

103
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,210

After dawn breaks,

114
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,240
don't think about the past anymore.

115

Our only goal now

116
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,020
is Lyman's competition project.

117
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,720
Building architecture
is just about winning awards.

118
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,050
You said that yourself?

119
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,170
Yes, I did.

120
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,180
My goal in architecture

121
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:23,770
does partly involve

122
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,080
impressing the judges

123
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,510
and winning awards.

124
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,810
Every line drawn by an architect

125
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:30,990
is a statement.

126
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,260
And winning awards

127
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:35,390
is the best challenge
to break conventions.

128
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,320
I understand that this statement

129
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,560
might cause controversy,

130
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,290
and I respect others'
different interpretations.

131
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,680
But I've never felt

132
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:45,970
that wanting awards
and creating good architecture

133
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,440
are in any way contradictory.

134
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,440
That's my answer.

135
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,520
As expected from a young person,

136
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,890
ambitious

137
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,010
and driven.

138
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,720
Am I, as an old man, appearing

139
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,920

Thank you.

141
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,870
What happened to you?

142
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,250
It's nothing.

145
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:26,620
Where did you lose them?

146
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:29,170
Forget it.

147
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:30,550
Don't bother looking.

148
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:32,960

00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,780
You knew Mr. Xie was coming today.

151
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,300

165
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,290
What exactly happened?

166
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:35,440
I'm just

167
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,080
tired.

168
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:39,990
Besides, going to the wedding
dressed like this

169
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,330
would be too embarrassing.

170
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,730

172
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:49,330
Wait for me near the dock.

173
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,530
Don't go too far.

174
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:11,920
This is ridiculous.

175
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,150
That person

176
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,320

00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,080
Hu Xiu.

179
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,080
I just saw Qiran's mother following her

180
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,140
to the lounge area.

181
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,220

182
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:25,140
No way.

186
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:52,320
Where to?

187
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:55,930
To the wedding venue.

188
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,170
Wang Yue's groom

189
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,740
is the one who broke off the engagement
with you,

190
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,260
right?

191
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,780
How do you know?

192
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,250
I just went to the security room.

193
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,690
The person who locked you
in the lounge area

194
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,150
was Zhang Qiran's mother.

195
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:17,960
Hu Xiu.

196
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,720
If you're doing this
for the sake of the studio,

197
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,850
I suggest you don't flatter yourself.

198
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:24,800
My reputation

199
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,320
won't be damaged

200
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,960
just because you don't have
the right shoes.

201
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,650
But if

202
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,530
you've been treated unfairly

203
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:33,930
and still think
you should swallow your pride,

204
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,790
believing that you're the one
who should hide away,

205
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,110
then just stay here and enjoy the breeze.

206
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,930
Today, we gather here

207
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,480
to witness

208
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,010
this important moment for the couple.

209
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:11,680
I now declare

210
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:13,080
that Ms. Wang Yue

211
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,890
and Mr. Zhang Qiran's wedding ceremony

212
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,110
officially begins.

213
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,290
Look how perfect they are together.

214
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:34,080
Yes, they're a perfect match.

215
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,050
Qiran,

216
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:37,290
I'm entrusting Wang Yue to you.

217
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:38,450
Don't worry, Dad.

218
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:46,010
-Good!
-Good!

219
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,910
Mr. Zhang,

220
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,930
do you take Ms. Wang Yue to be your wife?

221
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:54,890
I do.

222
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:57,200
Now, Ms. Wang,

223
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,200
do you take Mr. Zhang Qiran
to be your husband?

224

thank you to all the seniors

I am very happy

282
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,480

283
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,089
Thank you.

00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:25,890
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

285
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:27,240
Thank you. Thank you.

286
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,740
Thanks and congratulations.

287
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,410
Mr. Wang, congratulations.

288
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,680
Having a good time today?

289
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,880
Thank you. Thank you.

290
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:45,200
Renzi.

291
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:46,890
Qiran.

292
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:49,270
I'll take the kids to make a toast.

293
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:50,010
Alright. Alright.

294
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:50,400
Dad.

295
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:51,890
Auntie Zhang.

296
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:52,720
Okay. Okay.

297
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,040
Mr. Xiao.

298
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:58,400
Ladies and gentlemen,

299
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,390
thank you all for attending
my daughter's wedding.

300
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:02,090
I'm here with my daughter and son-in-law

301
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:03,330
to toast to all of you.

302
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,520
Thank you for coming.

303
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:04,980
Cheers.

304
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,010
You're too kind.

305
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:07,440
Here.

306
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:08,970
Thank you. Thank you.

307
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:14,410
Mr. Xiao,

308
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,660
hope we can get along well.

309
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,730
Is that okay?

310
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:28,280
Of course.

311
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,240
Ms. Hu,

312
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,590
what's going on with your shoes?

313
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:41,350
Why don't I have someone
bring you a new pair?

314
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:43,000
Yes, Yue,

315
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:44,520
I think you should have someone

316
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,180
take her to the changing room.

317
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,840
I think the way she's dressed

318
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,330
might not be appropriate
for this occasion.

319
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,170
Yes, indeed.

320
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:52,130
I'll take you to change your shoes.

321
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,330
It is inappropriate.

322
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,090
So I hope this lady

323
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,800
will return my date's shoes.

324
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,020
S-Shoes?

325
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,170
What shoes?

326
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,750
How would I know?

327
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:13,240
Mr. Xiao, I think

328
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,810
there might be some misunderstanding.

329
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:16,000
Whether it's a misunderstanding,

330
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,200
your mother

331
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:18,410
knows perfectly well.

332
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:18,810
Well,

333
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,090
what's going on here?

334
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,200
Dad,

335
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,330
I don't really understand

336
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,130
what Mr. Xiao was talking about.

337
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,040
I just checked the security footage.

338
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,040
This lady

339
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,480
locked my date

340
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,280
in the lounge area for no reason,

341
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,520
forcing her to climb out the window.

342
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,610
I'd like to know

343
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,290
what on earth happened.

344
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,570
Is this true?

345
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,330
I didn't do it on purpose.

346
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,930
It's just a lounge area.

347
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,040
How could I know if anyone was inside?

348
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,080
It should be locked if no one's inside.

349
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,540
Are you here for a wedding,

350
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,330
or are you a hotel staff member?

351
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,650
What's exactly going on?

352
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:57,100
You know Ms. Hu?

353
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:00,280
Yue.

354
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,260
Actually, Dad...

355
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,850
I was his fiancée

356
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,930
until he suddenly broke up with me
3 months ago.

357
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:09,610
What?

358
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,570
Three months ago?

359
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,410
No, darling.

360
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,960
When it comes to relationships,

361
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,360
things are never simple.

362
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:25,090
I never expected that after we split,

363
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,000
I would so quickly meet

364
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,330
the person I truly love.

365
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:27,810
No.

366
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,720
Mom, Dad,

367
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,380
I really love your daughter.

368
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:31,440
You don't actually think

369
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,930
that calling your two-timing

370
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,170
a seamless transition
to a new relationship

371
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,770
makes you look noble, do you?

372
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,940
You waited until the engagement day
to break up,

373
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,410
then disappeared without any apology.

374
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,810
Zhang Qiran, how can you
live with yourself being so shameless?

375
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,090
No, Dad.

376
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,000
Yue.

377
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,410
I'm sorry

378
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,310
for disrupting your wedding.

379
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:57,090
But I'm also grateful

380
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,720
that I came here today.

381
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,240
Heaven helped me see the truth.

382
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,490
I hope you can cut your losses now.

383
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,200
Qiran.

384
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:14,640
Yue.

385
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,320
Dad.

386
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,470
Zhang Qiran, you jerk!

387
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,890
How dare you lie to me?

388
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:28,010
You made me the other woman
without me knowing!

389
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:29,000
Let me explain.

390
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,400
What else is there to say?

391
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:33,300
Qiran had no feelings for her long ago.

392
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,720
It's just that he was too soft-hearted,

393
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,650
so he kept putting off telling her.

394
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,090
I-I'll handle this myself.

395
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:01,760
Don't move.

396
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,570
Thank you.

397
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:39,300
Let me carry you.

398
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,990
No, I...

399
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:41,740
I...

400
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,570
Get on.

401
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:02,370
Hold tight.

402
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,170
Will what happened today

403
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:17,240
affect your relationship

404
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,280
with the client?

405
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:20,480
Maybe.

406
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:27,130
Worst case,

407
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:31,010
I'll design something award-winning
for him.

408
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:00,890
Where do you live?

409
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:01,950
I'll take you home.

410
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:05,200
Just drop me off
at the murder mystery game club.

411
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:05,930
Thanks.

412
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,440
Your foot is in this condition,

413
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,520
and you still want to play
murder mystery games?

414
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,980
Besides, it's too late
for the last session.

415
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,000
That's my best friend's café.

416
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,960
I live upstairs.

417
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,000
If there's nothing else,
I'll be going now.

418
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,570
You don't look well.

419
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,850
I probably haven't had time
to eat all day.

420
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:44,050
I'll feel better after I eat something.

421
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,960
What about your foot?

422
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,950
It's much better after resting.

423
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:44,040
[Opening Hours]

424
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:01,480
Zhao.

425
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,810
What are you doing here?

426
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:05,570
Your colleague called me,
saying you had a stomachache

427
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:06,610
and injured your foot.

428
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:07,680
Let me see where it is.

429
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,570
Colleague?

430
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,760
Here?

431
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,490
It's nothing.

432
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,040
When I got upstairs

433
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:20,940
and saw the lights were off,

434
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:22,240
I thought something else
had happened to you.

435
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,480
You scared me to death.

436
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,810
Speaking of the lights,

437
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,760
do you know the electricity bill
hasn't been paid?

438
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,000
Send me the payment details quickly,

439
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,760
so it'll be easier for me to live here.

440
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,170
Sure.

441
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:33,530
I'll send them to you later.

442
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:35,480
I'll make up the medicine with hot water.

443
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,210
It'll warm your stomach
and make you feel better.

444
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,650
Later, you need to tell me

445
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:41,650
what exactly happened to your foot.

446
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:51,200
Zhang Qiran is really a piece of work.

447
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,570
Why didn't you curse him out more?

448
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,960
You should have yelled at him

449
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,560
and pointed at his face,
calling him a scumbag.

450
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,820
I actually thought before

451
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,090
that our breakup

452
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:05,000
might have been partly my fault.

453
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,890
But today I found out

454
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:11,570
I was just his placeholder
until he found someone better.

455
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:13,740
So I had nothing more to say.

456
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,280
And the one who should be cursing him out
shouldn't be me;

457
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,480
it should be Ms. Wang.

458
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,800
I could tell from so many details

459
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,810
that she was really looking forward to

460
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:24,610
and excited about this wedding.

461
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,720
She never expected something like this
would happen.

462
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:37,440
Xiu.

463
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:39,260
Think of it this way:

464
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,330
Zhang Qiran

465
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:42,280
is like what you call in architecture,

466
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,480
a dangerous building.

467
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,000
If you or Ms. Wang

468
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:46,680
wants to deal with him,

469
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,330
you'd need department approvals,

470
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:49,170
institutional assessments,

471
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:50,900
and all sorts of certificates.

472
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:52,650
When you've lived in a house
for a long time,

473
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:54,250
you develop feelings for it.

474
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,520
During that long waiting process,

475
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:58,490
you might soften your heart.

476
00:27:58,890 --> 00:27:59,810
But now,

477
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:03,440
even heaven can't stand it anymore.

478
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:04,960
It was afraid falling bricks

479
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,930
and the wind coming in

480
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:07,060
would make you sick.

481
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,500
So it just demolished it completely.

482
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,570
All you need to do

483
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,760
is rebuild on this land.

484
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:20,240
How did I not notice

485
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:22,570
you're so good at comforting people?

486
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:25,500
No wonder you can come up with 6 names
for your coffee.

487
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,960
Come on,

488
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,890
I came up with 6 names

489
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:29,490
just so you could choose one.

490
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,180
Is my foot swollen?

491
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:39,390
I'll get some coffee
to reduce the swelling.

492
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:41,200
How does coffee reduce swelling?

493
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,130
For a foot soak?

494
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,000
Right.

495
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,400
It works really well.

496
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,240
Why don't we use
your most expensive coffee?

497
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,330
Sure, that works.

498
00:28:58,930 --> 00:28:59,570
Mr. Xiao,

499
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:00,480
morning.

500
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:01,960
Morning.

501
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,670
Mr. Xiao.

502
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,480
I have good news.

503
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,000
Everyone,

504
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,320
please pause what you're doing.

505
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:17,540
I have an announcement to make.

506
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,920
We just received an email from Lyman.

507
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,520
Our competition qualification

508
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,610
has been restored!

509
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:25,860
Our plan is correct!

510
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:27,240
It isn't in vain!

511
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,570
Right, it isn't in vain!

512
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,720
-Keep going!
-Keep going!

513
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,110
Let's work!

514
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,000
Alright!

515
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:33,720
Let's get to work!

516
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,250
Let's go.

517
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,280
Sun,

518
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,860
why isn't Mr. Jiang here?

519
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,430
He's resigned.

520
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:43,610
That's so sudden.

521
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,090
After the disqualification news came out,

522
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:56,550
he submitted his resignation
within 2 days.

523
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,000
I thought he was just taking a leave.

524
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,370
Not at all.

525
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:01,850
That architecture forum

526
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:03,610
where Mr. Xiao's recording was leaked,

527
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:05,540
haven't you checked it for a while?

528
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:07,850
Some comments made me angry.

529
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,960
I haven't checked it for a long time.

530
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:11,200
These days,

531
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:13,880
there are suddenly many posts
about Jiang Tianyi,

532
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,760
saying that he is

533
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,680
the mole in Dynamism.

534
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,480
Why would he do that?

535
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,890
I don't know.

536
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,850
But that's not important.

537
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:21,780
What matters is,

538
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:23,000
look,

539
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,130
there's this new press release today.

540
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:32,940
I practice architecture
to win awards and gain fame.

541
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:35,010
Winning awards gives me more options

542
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:36,540
to work on better projects.

543
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:40,850
Think about it. This recording

544
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:44,050
could only have been released
by the boss himself, right?

545
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,650
So I'm confused.

546
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,200
If the boss has the complete recording
all along,

547
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,000
why wait until now to release it?

548
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:54,680
Mr. Xiao actually

549
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:57,450
put his best resources
where they matter most.

550
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,830
What do you mean?

551
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,160
[Didn't they say Dynamism is fighting
for Lyman Group's new project?]

552
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:10,480
No wonder.

553
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,760
After this recording came out,

554
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,960
Lyman has restored
our competition qualification.

555
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,850
Isn't this just free publicity?

556
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,240
Not just that.

557
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,280
Every step

558
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:21,580
was calculated.

559
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:22,850
What?

560
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:24,860
Nothing.

561
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,090
I even suspect

562
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:28,330
that those posts by Jiang Tianyi

563
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:29,990
were all arranged by Mr. Xiao.

564
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:32,760
Hu Xiu,

565
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,520
from now on,

566
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,640
don't mess with Mr. Xiao.

567
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,100
Their competition eligibility

568
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:52,010
has actually been restored.

569
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:53,680
Yes.

570
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:56,620
Lyman just made the announcement.

571
00:31:58,290 --> 00:31:59,870
There's one more thing, Mr. Pei.

572
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:02,330
Xiao Zhiyu's reputation has turned around.

573
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:05,070
After the complete recording was released,

574
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,930
everyone online is talking about it,

575
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:08,720
and they're optimistic about
his participation in Lyman's competition.

576
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,910
Sun Daqin

577
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,620
repeatedly promised me

578
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,330
that he wouldn't let him
meet with Xie Lin.

579
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,960
It's only been one weekend.

580
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:20,810
How did he get Xie Lin to agree?

581
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,280
Speak up.

582
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,490
It was my oversight.

583
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:28,090
I heard from Sun Daqin

584
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,200
that Xie Lin would attend a wedding
on the weekend,

585
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,930
but I didn't expect Xiao Zhiyu
would be there too.

586
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,890
He's quite good at turning things around
in desperate situations.

587
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:37,680
However,

588
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:38,810
Dynamism

589
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:40,200
has been less than 5 years
since its founding.

590
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,400
They lack experience

591
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:44,030
and might not be able
to handle such a large project.

592
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:45,310
It's not enough.

593
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:47,680
What I want

594
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:49,850
is Dynamism

595
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:52,830
to have absolutely no chance of winning.

596
00:32:59,200 --> 00:32:59,930
Mr. Xiao.

597
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:06,370
Um,

598
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,300
here are the documents
you asked me to organize.

599
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:10,950
Just put them on the desk.

600
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:18,520
Um, Mr. Xiao.

601
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:22,570
Was it you who called my friend yesterday?

602
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,410
How did you get my friend's number?

603
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,720
You go in and out every day

604
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,220
and haven't noticed the sign at the door?

605
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:32,170
It has contact numbers on it.

606
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:39,370
Did you also buy that medicine?

607
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:44,170
My friend wants to thank you
for the medicine you bought.

608
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:45,130
When she came back,

609
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:47,330
all the pharmacies nearby were closed.

610
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,720
I just hope
your foot injury heals quickly,

611
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,450
so you can get back to work soon.

612
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:57,370
Hello.

613
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,280
We're from Dynamism.

614
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,680
We're here for a meeting.

615
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:00,750
Please come in.

616
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:04,760
Sun,

617
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:07,030
did you bring the documents?

618
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,600
The car key.

619
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,060
I'll go get the documents.

620
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:23,440
Jiang Tianyi.

621
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:25,469
What are you doing here?

622
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,040
None of your business.

623
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,969
Get out of my way.

624
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:29,980
Jiang Tianyi! Jiang Tianyi.

625
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:30,710
Calm down.

626
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:34,080
Whatever it is,
let's sit down and talk it through.

627
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,850
Stop pretending to be nice to me.

628
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:36,810
Look what's happened to me.

629
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:38,170
I won't let them get away with this!

630
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:39,570
Jiang Tianyi, calm down.

631
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,560
Calm down.

632
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,370
Nothing can't be overcome.

633
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:43,030
Move aside.

634
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:43,850
I won't.

635
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:44,780
Get out of my way!

636
00:34:44,889 --> 00:34:45,440
Jiang Tianyi, I...

637
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,040
Move!

638
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:46,810
Jiang Tianyi!

639
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:48,040
Let's talk this through, Jiang Tianyi!

640
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,000
Get out of my way! Get out of my way!

641
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,810
Jiang Tianyi!

642
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:50,560
You!

643
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:11,120
This is a public place,

644
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,590
and you dare hit a woman?

645
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,010
Take him to security.

646
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:15,310
Move.

647
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:19,440
Are you okay?

648
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:20,440
Thank you.

649
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,800
Could you press the first floor for me?
Thanks.

650
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:36,210
It seems the security in this building

651
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:37,370
needs improvement.

652
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,480
Did he scare you?

653
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:39,440
I'm fine.

654
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,910
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

655
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:44,530
It was really our oversight.

656
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:45,660
It's okay.

657
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,460
You can go now.

658
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,800
Do you work for Lyman?

659
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,210
No.

660
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:52,640
I am

661
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,120
an assistant designer

662
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,210
from Dynamism.

663
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:55,710
I'm here for a meeting.

664
00:35:57,810 --> 00:35:58,440
Perfect.

665
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,900
I'm here for a meeting too.

666
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:01,130
Let's go up together.

667
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,160
Thank you.

668
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:19,890
They are currently
the strongest competitors

669
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:21,160
for our project.

670
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:24,210
I've called you all here today

671
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:26,210
mainly to discuss further

672
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:29,250
some requirements
for the later stages of this project.

673
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,960
Feel free to ask any questions.

674
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,560
Mr. Xie.

675
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,040
Mr. Xiao.

676
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,480
Keeping people waiting isn't a good habit.

677
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,600
I'll be more careful next time.

678
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:52,650
Let's go.

679
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:57,410
No rush.

680
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,930
Sorry, I'm late.

681
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,210
Uncle Xie,

682
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:08,080
sorry to keep you waiting.

683
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,810
It's fine. We just got here too.

684
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:11,110
Introduce yourself.

685
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:12,370
I'm Pei Zhen from Zhuling. Hello.

686
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:12,890
Hello.

687
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:13,640
Hello.

688
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:18,740
Why were you with Mr. Pei from Zhuling?

689
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,210
Mr. Pei?

690
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:23,950
The one with glasses?

691
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:26,730
I don't know.

692
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:28,190
I just met him downstairs.

693
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:31,480
I just realized he's from Zhuling.

694
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:32,960
From Zhuling?

695
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:34,830
He's the heir to Zhuling.

696
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:39,480
You guys go ahead first.

697
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,540
I'll be right back.

698
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:43,700
[Lyman Group]

699
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:46,100
Mr. Xiao,
hope we can learn from each other.

700
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,640
Likewise.

701
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:49,810
Mr. Xiao, you're so talented.

702
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:51,040
I'm honored

703
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,290
to meet you again.

704
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,160
Since everyone is here,

705
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,040
let's begin.

706
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,850
Let's start with Zheng,

707
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,850
who will brief you on the situation.

708
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:39,330
As emphasized in the presentation,

709
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,440
our 3 principles for the design plan

710
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:43,730
are human-centered,

711
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:44,640
sustainable,

712
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:45,730
and feasible.

713
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:47,990
What we're looking for

714
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,480
is not just a design plan,

715
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:52,810
but a spatial solution
that can carry the city's memories

716
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:55,480
and meet the needs of future living.

717
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:56,490
Thank you.

718
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,150
Alright, everyone.

719
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,200
That's the basic situation.

720
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,410
I look forward to

721
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,250
all of you designers

722
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,000
using your creativity

723
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:08,740
to inject into this project

724
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,730
a brilliant soul.

725
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:16,770
Today's meeting

726
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:17,690
is over.

727
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:19,190
Thank you all for your hard work.

728
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,320
Meeting adjourned.

729
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,490
Wait, everyone.

730
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:28,190
I need you to fill this out.

731
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:35,480
Ms. Hu,

732
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
see you next time.

733
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:45,410
When I came back,

734
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:46,850
I ran into Jiang Tianyi.

735
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:48,370
He tried to force his way in
and cause trouble.

736
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:49,410
I couldn't stop him.

737
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:51,210
Thankfully, Mr. Pei helped out.

738
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,210
If you want a meeting,

739
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,900
just make an appointment
with my assistant.

740
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,080
It's inappropriate

741
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,480
to show up here suddenly.

742
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:34,730
I don't like those

743
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,560
who think they are smart.

744
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:38,810
Mr. Pei.

745
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:43,600
Mr. Pei.

746
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,700
You didn't reply to my messages.

747
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:46,890
I could only go to Zhuling to find you,

748
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:48,330
but they didn't let me in.

749
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,370
I had no choice.

750
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:53,640
I've done what you asked me to do.

751
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,810
We had a deal.

752
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,330
You promised me
the position of Zhuling's design director.

753
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:58,880
You were not helping me.

754
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:02,250
It's you who don't accept Xiao Zhiyu.

755
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:03,910
You wanted to vent your anger.

756
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,880
I just took the opportunity.

757
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:06,850
I...

758
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:09,330
After the recording was exposed,

759
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:10,730
you resigned very soon.

760
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:12,810
Isn't that right?

761
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:14,640
Yes.

762
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,520
I was a little impatient.

763
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:19,290
Should I wait for them to catch me,
Mr. Pei?

764
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:20,890
I don't ask for anything else.

765
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:21,810
All I ask is to let me

766
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:23,560
be a regular staff member at Zhuling.

767
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,760
This decision is a piece of cake for you.

768
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:28,480
How will others think of me

769
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,600
if I let you join Zhuling?

770
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,600
I don't care!

771
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:31,890
If I have no choice,

772
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,700
I can't control what I'll say!

773
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:47,730
Mr. Pei,

774
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:50,210
I only want one way out.

775
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,640
I beg you.

776
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:55,080
I'm already on the blacklist
of the industry,

777
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:55,890
and my reputation is ruined.

778
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:57,440
I can't find a job at all.

779
00:41:58,810 --> 00:41:59,640
Or...

780
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:01,210
Or should I

781
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:02,850
change my name, Mr. Pei?

782
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,410
Change your name?

783
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:15,250
It's really pathetic.

784
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:18,810
Your brother has changed his name.

785
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:20,120
He took after the auntie's surname,

786
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,180
called Xiao Zhiyu.

787
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,480
From now on,

788
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,540
you can't call him by his original name.
