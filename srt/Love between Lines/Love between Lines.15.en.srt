[Episode 15]

3
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,160
Have you made a decision?

4
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,480
Aren't you coming in?

5
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,280
Honey,

6
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,590
I suddenly have a business dinner tonight.

7
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,590
Go to bed early. Don't wait up for me.

8
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,010
How about Friday night?

9
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,320
I'll take you out for dinner.

10
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,440
Let's not go out.

11
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,190
Just stay at home.

12
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,590
I'll prepare something.

13
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,360
But you have to promise me—

14
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,760
you must come home early.

[Happy 2nd Wedding Anniversary!]

16
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,400
Did I wake you?

17
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:14,680
No.

18
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,800
Drink this.

19
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,040
It'll help you sober up.

20
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,450
Honey...

21
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,930
I'm sorry I came home late again.

22
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:28,680
It's okay.

23
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,450
I know you've been busy.

24
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,320
Sorry it's a day late.

25
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,030
Happy second wedding anniversary.

26
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,630
It's beautiful.

27
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,210
I like it.

28
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,910
I thought you'd forgotten.

29
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,560
How could I?

30
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:31,750
Miss,

31
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,360
we've been going in circles.

32
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,830
Where exactly are you going?

33
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,000
This place is way too hard to find.

34
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,390
Even the GPS can't locate it.

35
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,360
We can't just

36
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,680
keep driving around.

37
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:40,720
Alright,

38
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,000
I'll just get off here.

39
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,860
Thank you, sir.

40
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:43,710
Okay.

41
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,800
Hello, excuse me,

42
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,660
do you know where this factory is?

43
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,250
I really don't know, sorry.

44
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,310
Sorry.

45
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,190
Hello, hello, excuse me.

46
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,520
Do you know where this ceramic factory is?

47
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,430
It's...

48
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,410
Your destination is on your left.

49
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,930
Navigation complete.

50
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:45,830
Hello,

51
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,970
my name is Hu Xiu.

52
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,159
I'm an assistant architect

53
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:50,360
from D Design Studio.

54
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:52,070
Here's the thing:

55
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,270
I recently saw your products

56
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,440
at a ceramics exhibition
featured in a magazine.

57
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,480
They fit perfectly with one of
our architectural project's requirements.

58
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,120
So I wanted to come and learn more

59
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,800
and see if we could establish further...

60
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,830
I'm not the boss.

61
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,290
I'm just a security guard.

62
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,370
Then where's your boss?

63
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:07,600
Over there.

64
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,050
Is the content okay?

65
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,190
Yeah.

66
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,070
We have designated personnel
handling the legal matters.

67
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,480
As long as the content is fine,

68
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,680
you can rest assured.

69
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,430
It's pretty tidy here.

70
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:30,070
Feel free to contact me
if there are any issues in the future.

71
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,130
Looking forward to working with you.

72
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,650
This way, Mr. Ma.

73
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,560
Take care.

74
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,750
You must be tired from the meeting.

75
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,070
I brought you some fruit.

76
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,310
-Thank you, Xiaorou.
-Thank you, Xiaorou.

77
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,530
Perfect timing. I need some sugar.

78
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:47,720
I'm exhausted.

79
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,950
Guangming has been running around
these past few days

80
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:50,950
barely even having time for lunch,

81
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:51,950
just to meet clients.

82
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,390
What do you have to complain about?

83
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,190
Well, it's a sweet complaint.

84
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:56,750
But honestly,

85
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,600
anywhere is better than Longyuan.

86
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,000
Let me tell you,

87
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,600
I just don't have Guangming's courage.

88
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,560
Before he left,

89
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,160
he really let Qu have it.

90
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,470
That was so awesome, right, Guangming?

91
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:06,960
Let's go have fruit.

92
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,060
What does he mean by "let Qu have it"?

93
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,560
You left Longyuan?

94
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,920
G-Go have fruit.

95
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:14,600
Okay.

96
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,480
Honey,

97
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,200
come with me for a moment.

98
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,990
What's going on?

99
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,630
Have a seat, honey.

100
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,800
Mr. Qu found out about Zhan Jie and me

101
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,890
starting our own business.

102
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,240
I'm in the middle of handing things over

103
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,100
and will officially resign soon.

104
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,830
But honey, don't worry.

105
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,750
Tao registered Solara,

106
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,120
and I've checked
Longyuan's internal policies.

107
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,980
Mr. Qu can't hold us accountable.

108
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,800
Guangming,

109
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,040
I've always felt

110
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,950
that you were working too hard before.

111
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:56,630
I've always supported

112
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,120
you leaving Longyuan.

113
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,830
But why is your first reaction always

114
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:02,690
to hide things from me
whenever something happens?

115
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,070
Is there anything

116
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,950
that we, as husband and wife, can't...

117
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,150
can't face together?

118
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,510
It's just that I thought

119
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,000
the procedures weren't complete

120
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,430
and the company wasn't stable yet,

121
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,830
so I didn't dare tell you.

122
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,680
Honey, I know this would make you worry.

123
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,390
I was wrong.

124
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,630
I'm sorry.

125
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,950
I promise you

126
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,680
from now on, I'll tell you about
any decision I make.

127
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,870
No more hiding things,

128
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:27,560
okay?

129
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,920
Don't be mad anymore, okay?

130
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,570
I have good news for you.

131
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,320
Remember I mentioned

132
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:46,720
that a major company

133
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,120
was interested in taking over our project?

134
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,840
Five minutes ago,

135
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,410
we just signed

136
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:53,730
the contract.

137
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,630
Our company will definitely make it.

138
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,320
The big house we want,

139
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,270
a big coffee shop,

140
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:02,870
and a big dog—

141
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,790
we'll have them all.

142
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:08,640
Even if you don't have to
run between two companies,

143
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,900
you'll still be busy like a spinning top.

144
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,740
Busy like what?

145
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,510
A spinning top.

146
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,870
A spinning top.

147
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,570
A big spinning top.

148
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,090
I'm just a medium spinning top.

149
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,510
-They're spinning!
-Yeah!

150
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,030
I won't be a spinning top.

151
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,200
Don't be mad anymore.

152
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,480
What are these two doing?

153
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,630
They're so sweet!

154
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,440
So sweet!

155
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,730
They're watching.

156
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,240
Hu Xiu?

157
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,630
Miss,

158
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:22,800
do you work here?

159
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,560
This place is quite remote.

160
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,120
After my last drop-off,

161
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,030
I thought I'd have to drive back
with no customer,

162
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,230
but I didn't expect to run into you here.

163
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,960
What a coincidence, sir.

164
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,870
If I hadn't run into you driving out here,

165
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,360
I wouldn't have been able to get back.

166
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,420
I've been trying to get a cab for ages.

167
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,550
Hello, Sun.

168
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,360
Hu Xiu,

169
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,240
Lyman's celebration banquet
is about to start.

170
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,200
When will you arrive?

171
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,480
I'm already on my way.

172
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,800
Should be there soon.

173
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,550
Sir,

174
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:55,000
could you please drive a bit faster?
Thanks.

175
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,150
Sure, no problem.

176
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,450
I'll be there soon.

177
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,270
Mr. Xiao.

178
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,120
Congratulations on
winning the competition.

179
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,510
You're truly a young talent

180
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,440
with unlimited potential.

181
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,030
Mr. Xiao.

182
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:32,390
You flatter me.

183
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,320
Our company has a project,

184
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,670
and we'd like to invite you
to be our consultant.

185
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,130
You must accept our offer.

186
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:36,870
Mr. Xiao,

187
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,270
so successful at a young age.

188
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:38,930
I wonder...

189
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,360
are you married?

190
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,600
No.

191
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,400
Starting a family and building a career

192
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,920
go hand in hand,

193
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:45,750
am I right?

194
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:56,350
Thank you.

195
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,450
Mr. Song, come on.

196
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,990
Could you introduce us?

197
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:05,830
No problem.

198
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:06,470
Xiao!

199
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,030
Mr. Xie, Mr. Li.

200
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,600
Mr. Xiao,

201
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:12,980
this is my daughter, An'an.

202
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,290
Nice to meet you.

203
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:18,680
Let's go.

204
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,150
Ms. Hu?

205
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,650
This feels like déjà vu.

206
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,300
What?

207
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,980
Here to play
the beauty rescuing the hero again?

208
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,310
Mr. Pei, you're actually right.

209
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,270
Hu Xiu.

210
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,150
Ms. Zhou.

211
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,030
Where have you been?

212
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:52,840
This is such an important event,

213
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,840
and you're late.

214
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,900
I was busy inspecting...

215
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,720
Here's the dress prepared for you.

216
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,720
Put it on quickly.

217
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,920
Tonight's banquet

218
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,550
has all the big names in the industry.

219
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,150
It's a big day for our studio.

220
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,300
Look your best.

221
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,080
Okay.

222
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,000
So you graduated from
Cornell University, Mr. Xiao.

223
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,900
That's impressive.

224
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,810
I used to visit friends there
all the time.

225
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,910
Maybe we even saw each other back then.

226
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:29,670
Maybe.

227
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,550
What a coincidence, Mr. Xiao.

228
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,150
I also graduated from Cornell.

229
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,720
Could I add you on WeChat?

230
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:35,480
I'm sorry.

231
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,410
My phone is charging in the lounge.

232
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,950
This is a 2013 Dom Pérignon.

233
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:45,870
It's quite good.

234
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:46,920
Try it.

235
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,710
Cheers.

236
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,320
Excuse me,

237
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,050
Mr. Xiao will be giving a speech later.

238
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,650
Let me drink this one for him.

239
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,150
Mr. Xiao,

240
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,840
who is she?

241
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,400
I'm Mr. Xiao's employee,

242
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:50,910
Hu Xiu,

243
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,840
assistant architect at Dynamism.

244
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,720
Mr. Xiao needs to go prepare first.

245
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,460
Please wait a moment.

246
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,450
I believe Mr. Xiao's speech

247
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,740
will definitely not disappoint you all.

248
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:10,900
Excuse us.

249
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,080
Only Hu Xiu could

250
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,340
have gotten you out of there.

251
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,030
Otherwise, who knows

252
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,910
how long you'd still be
stuck talking to them?

253
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:25,790
I have to say,

254
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,210
in that dress, you and Mr. Xiao

255
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,870
look pretty well-matched.

256
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,030
Last time you said

257
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,890
you wanted to find a supplier
of 3D printing materials.

258
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:36,700
I found one.

259
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,480
Do you remember

260
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,550
the ceramic art factory

261
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,360
I mentioned before?

262
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,840
I looked into it.

263
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,480
Their technology is not a problem,

264
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,750
but they do need to overcome
the production capacity issue

265
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,030
we discussed earlier.

266
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:54,170
However, as long as we pay in full upfront

267
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,660
and don't let them bear the cost pressure,

268
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,120
they'll fully cooperate.

269
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,220
So this is
what you've been busy with lately?

270
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:04,480
If we can't pay in full upfront,

271
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,410
I can communicate with them again.

272
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,410
Ladies and gentlemen,

273
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:09,940
good evening.

274
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,510
First, on behalf of Lyman,

275
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,750
I'd like to welcome and thank

276
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:14,620
all of you for being here.

277
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:19,450
[Lyman Group · Future Living ·
Celebration Banquet]

278
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:22,270
The design competition
for our company's resort community

279
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,790
has attracted enormous attention.

280
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:24,550
Mr. Xiao Zhiyu

281
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,480
from Dynamism

282
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:29,000
has won over the judges

283
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,960
with his bold and brilliant proposal

284
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,760
and has become the chief designer
of this project.

285
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,030
I believe

286
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,300
that once this project is completed,

287
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:40,120
it will surely become

288
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:43,210
another shining landmark
in the architectural field!

289
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:46,720
Furthermore,

290
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,200
I'd like to sincerely thank

291
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,630
all other companies
that participated in the competition.

292
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,990
Although we didn't get to
cooperate this time,

293
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:55,170
there will be opportunities in the future.

294
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,530
We sincerely hope

295
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,080
to cooperate and achieve mutual success
with all of you.

296
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,080
Now, let's invite

297
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,680
Mr. Xiao Zhiyu, the chief designer

298
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,510
of the Lyman Resort Community,

299
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:05,480
to the stage.

300
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,880
It is an honor

301
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,550
to stand here

302
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,160
on behalf of Dynamism.

303
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,480
Our studio will do our utmost

304
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,440
to live up to everyone's trust,

305
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,920
making this project a classic masterpiece.

306
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,480
Taking advantage of
this important occasion,

307
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,880
I'd also like to announce

308
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,220
a major decision on behalf of our studio.

309
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,550
Dynamism

310
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,350
has already signed

311
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,590
a project cooperation letter of intent
with Zhuling Group.

312
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,510
We'll officially begin cooperation
after the New Year

313
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:45,570
to jointly complete the construction
of this project.

314
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,180
That factory director's former chauffeur

315
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,030
became a building materials supplier.

316
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,440
The powerful backer he latched onto

317
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,960
is Zhuling Group.

318
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:15,020
Hu Xiu?

319
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:17,960
Ms. Zhou.

320
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,070
So you just came from

321
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,000
the supplier.

322
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,130
You've worked hard.

323
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,340
Not hard at all,

324
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,340
just doing my job.

325
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,960
I just didn't expect

326
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,740
that Mr. Xiao had already made
the decision.

327
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,340
The cooperation with Zhuling

328
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,990
was only finalized
right before today's banquet.

329
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,470
I was also surprised

330
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,580
when Mr. Xiao told me about it.

331
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,160
I figured as much—

332
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,680
if we're working with Zhuling,

333
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,350
they would definitely use
their supplier resources

334
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,550
as a bargaining chip.

335
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,250
But what I didn't expect was

336
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,480
that Mr. Pei would make
such excessive demands.

337
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,680
He's after the entire Lyman's project.

338
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,600
What I least expected was

339
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,000
that Mr. Xiao would actually accept it.

340
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,790
However,

341
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:57,170
looking at it from another angle,

342
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,720
the two companies
working together peacefully

343
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,050
might not be a bad thing.

344
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,070
Besides,

345
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,830
Mr. Xie and Mr. Pei
have a good relationship,

346
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:07,760
which will help the project
progress more smoothly.

347
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,680
I understand.

348
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,520
Go grab something to eat.

349
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,320
See you later.

350
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,020
Thank you.

351
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:36,770
You're here to see Mr. Xiao
about something urgent?

352
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,680
Just some minor matters at the studio.

353
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,850
It was about the supplier, wasn't it?

354
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,720
I know

355
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,120
you've been looking for new suppliers.

356
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,200
But clearly,

357
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,790
no matter how hard you look,

358
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,160
you won't find anyone more suitable
than Zhuling.

359
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,920
You're quite confident, Mr. Pei.

360
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,880
Do you really think

361
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,010
you can control
the entire supply chain in the industry?

362
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,110
You're wrong.

363
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:01,150
We don't need to.

364
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,070
We can't monopolize
the entire industry's supply.

365
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,030
What we can do

366
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,530
is keep the best part

367
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:07,770
for ourselves,

368
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,090
and that's enough.

369
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,440
And your boss, Mr. Xiao,

370
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,810
he's indeed a clear-headed,
decisive businessman.

371
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,490
Especially in this matter,

372
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,130
he knows when to bend and when to stand.

373
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,740
Your company is the one

374
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,010
seeking this work.

375
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,120
If we're talking about
who truly knows how to "bend,"

376
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,850
I'd say you're the master at it.

377
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,070
It was your boss who willingly chose to
work with me.

378
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:29,930
The word "bend"

379
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,670
doesn't even apply here.

380
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,750
Using supplier resources

381
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:36,070
in exchange for project cooperation—

382
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:39,200
the cooperation opportunity
you schemed so hard to get—

383
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,570
and you still say it wasn't "bending"?

384
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,440
Alright, Ms. Hu,

385
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,140
let's not debate anymore.

386
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,740
May I have the honor of this dance?

387
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,480
We're about to become partners.

388
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:01,610
You wouldn't deny me this courtesy,
would you?

389
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,880
In that case,

390
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,960
I shall respectfully comply.

391
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,210
I'm fine.

392
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,480
Is this your first time dancing, Ms. Hu?

393
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:54,520
Of course not.

394
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,070
You don't seem very practiced.

395
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:59,000
I can only work with what I'm given.

396
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,540
Well then, I'd better perform well

397
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,060
so as not to hold you back.

398
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:19,880
Excuse me, everyone. Sorry to interrupt.

399
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,640
In terms of construction,

400
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,830
Zhuling has always been
an industry leader.

401
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,110
Our studio is also very honored

402
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,570
to collaborate with them.

403
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,440
Taking advantage of this occasion today,

404
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,840
I'd like to invite Mr. Pei

405
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:34,690
to give a speech on behalf of Zhuling.

406
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,640
Why do you still look so glum?

407
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,680
I'm not.

408
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,320
Oh, right,

409
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,030
Ms. Zhou,

410
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,400
thank you for preparing this dress for me.

411
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,200
Otherwise, I would've
embarrassed myself badly again today.

412
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,510
I didn't prepare it.

413
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,650
Mr. Xiao asked me to bring it to you.

414
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,010
Why are you out here alone?

415
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,000
There are too many people inside.

416
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,930
It's too stuffy.

417
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,480
When did you make the decision?

418
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,240
Mr. Xie,

419
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,410
do you have time to meet today?

420
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,620
I'd like to introduce someone to you.

421
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,270
Sure.

422
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,210
Come to my office tonight.

423
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,400
Okay.

424
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,960
I never expected

425
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:23,510
that you two

426
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,400
had such a connection.

427
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,160
Zhiyu has been independent since childhood

428
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,720
and never wanted support from the family,

429
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,720
so we didn't

430
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,960
make it public.

431
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,510
You could have relied on

432
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:36,480
a major corporation like Zhuling,

433
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,340
yet you insisted on
striking out on your own.

434
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,200
Mr. Xiao,

435
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,680
you never cease to amaze me.

436
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:43,640
Mr. Xie,

437
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,640
my studio and Zhuling

438
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,970
have no financial or equity connections.

439
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
My relationship with the Pei family

440
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,080
won't affect
the project's progress either.

441
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,880
You can hire a supervision agency

442
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,240
to oversee the construction process

443
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,030
and ensure our cooperation is
fair and transparent.

444
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:57,880
Uncle Xie,

445
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,350
Zhuling

446
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,310
attaches great importance to
Lyman's project this time.

447
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,210
Please rest assured—

448
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,800
we will commit our best resources

449
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,260
to complete this project.

450
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:09,580
In the company, only you know about

451
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,830
my relationship with the Pei family.

452
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:12,590
You've been

453
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:15,350
working so hard to find suppliers
these past few days

454
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,230
because you didn't want to see me
bow to Zhuling,

455
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:17,800
right?

456
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,000
I'm sorry

457
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,060
I didn't tell you about
my decision earlier.

458
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,510
No need to apologize.

459
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:33,960
I just didn't expect

460
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,370
that you would actually
cooperate with Zhuling.

461
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:41,520
What did Pei Zhen say to you?

462
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:43,960
He said

463
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,550
you know when to bend and when to stand.

464
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:51,850
Then...

465
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,880
what do you think?

466
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,720
I think...

467
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:11,440
I think since you've made this choice,

468
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,780
it must be absolutely necessary,

469
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,500

to cooperate with Zhuling.

504
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,960
Uncle Pei was just saying

505
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:00,750

work together toward the same goal.

509
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,160
Everyone, come get your gift boxes
before leaving work!

510
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,620
There's one for everyone!

511
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,830
We get two gift boxes this year?

512
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:20,560
What is this?

513
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,240
We just landed a big project,

514
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,510
so Ms. Zhou and Mr. Xiao
must be feeling generous.

515
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,370
-Right.
-Yeah.

516
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,750
Let me open it and take a look.

517
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:27,550
All done.

518
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,220
Time for vacation!

519
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:31,610
I'm almost done too.

520
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:33,880
Once I finish organizing the materials
for our post–New Year work

521
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,790
with Zhuling, I'll email them to you.

522
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:36,270
Okay.

523
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,350
Let me try to snag a train ticket first.

524
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,480
I'll check it later.

525
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,310
Mr. Xiao,

526
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,930
how are you planning to
spend the New Year?

527
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,240
Just like any other day.

528
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,300
What about you?

529
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,680
My parents used to come to the lane
to celebrate the New Year with me.

530
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,610
It's kind of our family tradition.

531
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,880
We feel the old house
has a more festive atmosphere.

532
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,310
It's close to downtown after all,

533
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,790
so it's very convenient
to see the lanterns.

534
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:08,390
Just a ten-minute walk or so.

535
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,070
Perfect.

536
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,880
I won't be staying in the lane
during the New Year.

537
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,540
Feel free to use it as you like.

538
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:19,150
I was going to ask
if you'd like to join us.

539
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,170
Happy New Year.

540
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,210
Happy New Year. Happy New Year.

541
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,310
Li, happy New Year!

542
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,310
Happy New Year. Happy New Year.

543
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,400
Here, eight-treasure rice pudding.

544
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,030
Great.

545
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:34,070
I get to taste
your eight-treasure rice pudding again!

546
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:34,830
Thank you, thank you.

547
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:35,830
You're welcome.

548
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:36,200
Alright, alright.

549
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,060
Happy New Year.

550
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,400
Happy New Year. Happy New Year.

551
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,400
Thank you.

552
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,350
Hu!

553
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,350
Happy New Year. Happy New Year!

554
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:44,080
Happy New Year. Happy New Year.

555
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,640
Be careful!

556
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,030
Granny, happy New Year.

557
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,880
You're in such good health.

558
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:53,590
You came back to spend
the New Year with Xiu?

559
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,350
Yes, yes.

560
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,320
Oh, right,

561
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,240
this is eight-treasure rice pudding
we made ourselves.

562
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,170
Please try some.

563
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,310
Okay, okay.

564
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,370
I'll be right back.

565
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,680
Her favorite.

566
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,580
Happy New Year.

567
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,510
The lanterns look really nice.

568
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:09,030
Yeah.

569
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,720
They're more festive.

570
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,440
Mr. Hu?

571
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:12,480
Happy New Year!

572
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,480
Happy New Year.

573
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:14,830
Dad,

574
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,590
it's been a while since you greeted anyone
like that, right?

575
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:17,030
Yes.

576
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:19,920
After walking around, I can see
things really have changed a lot.

577
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,640
Help me check

578
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,510
if these are straight on both sides.

579
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:23,570
The one on the right

580
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:24,310
needs to move a bit to the left...

581
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:24,920
Xiu!

582
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,440
Xiaorou is video calling you

583
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,270
to wish our family a happy New Year.

584
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,600
Okay, I'm going inside.

585
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:30,920
Egg dumplings!

586
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,010
-Granny made them.
-They are my favorite!

587
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,240
Zhao!

588
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,070
Happy New Year!

589
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:40,440
-Happy New Year.
-Happy New Year.

590
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,270
That new cardigan
looks really nice on you.

591
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:44,270
We bought it together last time
we went shopping, right?

592
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,110
That's the one.

593
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:45,440
It looks really nice.

594
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,240
Isn't it good?

595
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:48,680
Uncle Hu, Auntie Bai,

596
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,750
happy New Year.

597
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,590
Wishing you good health.

598
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:53,830
Thank you, Xiaorou.
Happy New Year to you too!

599
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,590
We're preparing the New Year's Eve dinner.

600
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:58,160
Are you at your own place
or at your parents'?

601
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,110
Guangming and I are at my parents' place.

602
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:00,830
I wish you

603
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:01,750
success in your career

604
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:04,070
and that you and Zhao achieve
financial freedom soon,

605
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,920
so I can share in your good fortune.

606
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,000
Thanks for the good wishes.

607
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,640
Xiaorou,

608
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,590
well,

609
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:10,400
I wish you young lovebirds

610
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,350
a smooth new year

611
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,690
and hope you have a child soon.

612
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,400
Thank you, Uncle.

613
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,510
Thank you, Uncle.

614
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,680
Um, Xiaorou,

615
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:20,290
let me wish your parents
a happy New Year too.

616
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,160
Sure, I'll go get them.

617
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,290
You elders can chat.

618
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,160
I'll go make some tangyuan.

619
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,920
Xiu, make one with sugar filling.

620
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,160
Alright.

621
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:28,880
For good fortune.

622
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,720
Sure thing.

623
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:34,160
Hello, hello.

624
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:49,890
Did you ask Zhiyu to come for dinner?

625
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,880
This year, our whole family is in China.

626
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:55,400
We should have
a family reunion dinner together.

627
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,270
I asked him.

628
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,980
I've been busy cooking

629
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,260
and haven't had time to check WeChat yet.

630
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,440
That must be Zhiyu.

631
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,270
Zhiyu?

632
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:13,680
Uncle Xu,

633
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:14,890
happy New Year.

634
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,400
You're Ms. Xiao Wanyue, right?

635
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,480
This is for you.

636
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,200
Mom,

637
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:26,880
I sent you some gifts,

638
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,720
and I won't be joining you for dinner.

639
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,310
Wishing you a happy Spring Festival

640
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,240
and good health.

641
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,480
Look at you,

642
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,160
you really didn't need to buy all these.

643
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,560
I still haven't finished

644
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,070
the liquor you gave me

645
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,510
last New Year.

646
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:45,720
I didn't expect

647
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,200
you'd come.

648
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:50,160
I heard earlier that your mother was
coming back to Shanghai this year,

649
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,620
and I thought you would...

650
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:53,610
By the way,

651
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:55,000
you landed a big project,

652
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,400
and I haven't
properly congratulated you yet.

653
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,110
Wait a moment.

654
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,240
I'll prepare some food,

655
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,030
and we can have a drink.

656
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:00,640
Uncle Xu.

657
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,880
I'm just stopping by.

658
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,720
Please don't trouble yourself.

659
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,590
I saw you on the TV news.

660
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:09,480
The way you looked

661
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,940
on that competition stage

662
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:13,240
really resembled your father.

663
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,570
If he were still here,

664
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,640
he would be so proud of you.

665
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,680
So many years have passed.

666
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,960
You're no longer
that little boy from back then.

667
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:30,550
Uncle Xu,

668
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:34,410
I've always remembered
what you said back then.

669
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,750
Listen to your uncle.

670
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,350
Don't rush.

671
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,350
You're still young.

672
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,160
You and your mother

673
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,550
have finally adapted to life in America.

674
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:46,610
At a time like this,

675
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:48,230
you can't act on impulse.

676
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:50,370
Your father wouldn't want you
to be reckless either,

677
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:50,960
right?

678
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,920
So there's nothing I can do?

679
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:55,920
There's one thing you can do.

680
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:57,750
Grow up well.

681
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,200
When you're an adult

682
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,680
and have the ability and resources,

683
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,790
only then will you have the chance
to unravel everything

684
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,120
and discover the truth.

685
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:09,360
Uncle Xu,

686
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,400
I'll grow up quickly.

687
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,080
Sooner or later, I'll prove

688
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,130
my father's innocence.

689
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,150
Good boy.

690
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:22,360
Zhiyu,

691
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,550
you've grown

692
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:24,949
so much over these years.

693
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,550
But sometimes I wonder

694
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,000
if what I said back then

695
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:32,750
planted a seed of revenge in you

696
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,030
that has affected

697
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,760
your life all these years.

698
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:41,760
Uncle Xu.

699
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:45,940
I'm one step closer to what I want to do.

700
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,440
I won't give up.

701
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:48,920
I know.

702
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,620
You've always wanted to clear

703
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,980
your father's name.

704
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,630
But I can't bear to see you

705
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,580
carrying such a heavy burden.

706
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:01,440
I can't bear to see you risk everything.

707
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,960
You're not young anymore.

708
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,230
As your elder,

709
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,590
I'd rather see you living happily

710
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:11,730

00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,980
Could you give it to me?

749
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,510
Mr. Xiao!

750
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,090
Happy New Year.

751
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,800
Happy New Year, Uncle.

752
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,760
Happy New Year.

753
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,440
Let me see.

754
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,550
A child passing by gave it to me.

755
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,230
Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

756
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,840
Why don't you come in for a while?

757
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,500
No, thanks.

758
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:21,800
You can't leave! You can't leave.

759
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,510
It's New Year's.

760
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:23,110
Since you're already here,

761
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,030
how can you leave?

762
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,550
Besides, you're Xiu's boss.

763
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:26,030
Come on, come in.

764
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:26,880
Come in. Come on.

765
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,440
Come in, come in.

766
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,070
Come in.

767
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:29,530
Come on.

768
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:29,960
Mom,

769
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,890
Mr. Xiao is here!

770
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:32,510
Hello, Auntie.

771
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:33,000
Come on, have a seat.

772
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,670
Hello.

773
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:34,360
Happy New Year.

774
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,480
Please have a seat.

775
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,620
Young boss,

776
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:39,480
it's New Year's.

777
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,150
Why are you all alone?

778
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:42,660
Where are your parents?

779
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:44,280
Dad,

780
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,110
Mr. Xiao's family isn't in Shanghai.

781
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,280
He's here by himself.

782
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,960
How can someone spend the New Year alone?

783
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,400
Stay and have dinner with us.

784
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,030
Besides,

785
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,590
you're renting our house,

786
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:54,230
so we should at least
show you some hospitality,

787
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:54,920
okay?

788
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:55,710
Yes, yes.

789
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:56,840
Stay and have dinner with us.

790
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,920
You chat with my dad here.

791
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,980
I'll go help my mom.

792
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,330
Have some dried fruits.

793
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,360
Dad's attitude toward him
has changed so drastically.

794
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:04,920
Later,

795
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,410
have a drink with me.

796
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,860
I've got some good baijiu.

797
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:16,290
It's hot.

798
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:19,570
Is it good?

799
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,510
Pour for the young boss first.

800
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:40,230
Don't rush.

801
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:42,490
Drinking on an empty stomach isn't good.

802
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,770
Let Mr. Xiao eat something first.

803
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:45,330
Auntie,

804
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,630
you can just call me Yu.

805
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,920
Alright, Yu.

806
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:49,630
That's enough. That's enough.

807
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:50,030
Let me fill your glass.

808
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:50,480
Here,

809
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,400
have some "Fish for Prosperity."

810
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,400
This is your Uncle Hu's specialty.

811
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,150
Try it and see if you like it.

812
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:59,120
It's delicious.

813
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,510
Actually, this dish

814
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:03,640
is really suitable for the young boss—

815
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,950
"Rising Higher and Higher."

816
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:05,620
Next year,

817
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,900
I wish you'd take on more big projects.

818
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:08,900
Thank you, Uncle.

819
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:09,750
Here.

820
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,230
In previous years,

821
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:14,710
it was always just the three of us
celebrating the New Year.

822
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:15,070
Yes, yes.

823
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:16,710
This year we have one more person.

824
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:18,110
It really feels different.

825
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:19,030
Yes, yes.

826
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,590
We should've had a son-in-law
joining us by now anyway,

827
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:21,150
right?

828
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:25,830
I'll go check if the tangyuan are ready.

829
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,550
Why do you always have to
bring up sore subjects?

830
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:29,670
Didn't you bring it up first?

831
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,000
Is that what I meant?

832
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,230
Here come the tangyuan.

833
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:35,670
Great!

834
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:36,430
Help yourselves.

835
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:37,230
Okay, okay.

836
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:38,150
Mr. Xiao.

837
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:41,510
This is our family's special tradition.

838
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:43,600
We hide one black sugar filling

839
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,190
among the five-nut tangyuan.

840
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,110
Whoever gets it

841
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:48,040
will have good luck in the new year.

842
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:48,670
Yes.

843
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,920
Xiu will definitely get it first,

844
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,450
right?

845
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,280
Be sweet and happy,
and then find a good boyfriend.

846
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,760
Young boss,

847
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,530
you're so lucky!

848
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,000
If you ask me,

849
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:09,550
our old family house

850
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:10,920
has great feng shui—

851
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:12,990
it's bringing you good fortune.

852
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,800
It seems

853
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,420
good things will happen to you
this year, Yu.

854
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,810
Maybe next New Year
you won't be alone anymore.

855
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:20,140
Then I'll gladly accept your good wishes.

856
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:36,810
Come on, come on!

857
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:38,340
Come on, let's make a toast.

858
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:39,400
Alright.

859
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,400
Alright, come on.

860
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,810
Come on, come on.

861
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,320
Cheers!

862
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,230
Wishing everyone good health

863
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:47,320
and everything going smoothly
in the new year.

864
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,030
Xiu,

865
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,550
let's leave last year where it belongs—

866
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:50,360
in the past.

867
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,070
It's all in the past.

868
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:52,710
It's all in the past.

869
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:53,970
It's all behind us now.

870
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:54,960
Young boss,

871
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:56,440
I want to thank you too.

872
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:57,360
You see, Xiu

873
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,800
now has a stable job,

874
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,390
and her life is back on track.

875
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:01,300
It's all thanks to you.

876
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,280
Here, I toast to you.

877
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:02,880
Thank you.

878
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:03,970
Uncle, you're too kind.

879
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:04,490
Cheers.

880
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,760
Hu Xiu has actually helped me a lot.

881
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:10,110
Okay.

882
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:11,360
Xiu,

883
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:13,630
well, these past few years,

884
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:14,280
you've

885
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,880
been through a lot.

886
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:18,670
From now on,
your days will surely be peaceful,

887
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,190
smooth, and happy.

888
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:20,980
Okay.

889
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:26,120
Mr. Xiao.

890
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:31,030
Uncle is right.

891
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:33,960
Hu Xiu,

892
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,980
I wish you a New Year...

893
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:41,410
free from all troubles.
