00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,510

00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,900
yet I blamed him.

89
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,950
I shouldn't have said

90
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,750
those words to him.

91
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:45,990
Ms. Xiao,

92
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,820
what did you say to him?

93
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,240
He left without a word back then

94
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,340

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,340

96
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,510

101
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,360
You dare not use your own name.

102
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:20,800
You changed your name,

103
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,160

104

00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,750
Don't worry.

190
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:16,090
No matter what happens in the future,

191
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:17,820
I won't hide anything from you.

192
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,840
I want you to protect yourself.

193
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,800
In the future,

194
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,540
don't leave me not knowing where you are.

195
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:29,960
Okay.

196
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:31,170
I promise you.

197
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,320
Hu Xiu,

198
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,120
I'm almost 30.

199
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,870
You're 30 years old,

200
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,050
and you're still
playing elementary school tricks.

201
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:15,010
You really won't come for a bite?

202
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:17,080
I made it for you in the first place.

203
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,270
When I get to my parents' place,

204
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,510
I'll eat with them.

205
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,770
There's something

206
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,630
I haven't had a chance to tell you.

207
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:33,360
Your mom came looking for you yesterday.

208
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,300
She's very worried about you.

209
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,720
She also regrets

210
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,060
saying those harsh words to you.

211
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,550
I understand.

212
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:54,200
You don't want the people
you care about getting involved,

213
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,200
so you haven't told her many things,

214
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:58,990
just like you hid things from me before.

215
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,550
But sometimes,

216
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:02,840
keeping secrets

217
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,960
is crueler than knowing the truth.

218
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,040
I see.

219
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,910
What's wrong?

220
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,480
Whose message?

221
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,150
Zhou Yan.

222
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,840
Did something happen at the company?

223
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,090
You know the Lanjing Park project, right?

224
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,830
They heard about the studio

225
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,020
being investigated

226
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:35,280
and proposed to terminate the contract.

227
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,200
And Lyman

228
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,070
raised work concerns.

229
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,450
They want me to withdraw
from the construction phase?

230
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,650
It's just temporary.

231
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:48,820
The information leak matter
is still under investigation,

232
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,320
and I'm the one
responsible for project liaison.

233
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,840
Their request

234
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,210
is understandable.

235
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:54,790
Hu Xiu.

236
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,000
The innocent need no defense.

237
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,060
I believe the investigation
will clarify things soon.

238
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:01,080
With no work these few days anyway,

239
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:04,000
I'll just spend more time with my parents.

240
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,870
Let me drive you home.

241
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,790
You focus
on handling your company matters.

242
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:08,990
Don't worry about me.

243
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,730
I'm leaving.

244
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,720
Call me if anything comes up.

245
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,520
Bye bye.

246
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,370
Remember this:

247
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,510
the last item on each shelf—

248
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:49,270
its label
is deliberately placed vertically.

249
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,830
That's a restocking mark.

250
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:51,790
In the future, if you see

251
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,440
a product with this mark
placed toward the front,

252
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,700
restock it right away.

253
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,320
45.4 yuan.

254
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,450
Just give me 45 yuan.

255
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:03,910
I've transferred the money.

256
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,369
Okay, thank you. Goodbye.

257
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,069
Zhiyu,

258
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:15,280
I'm sorry.

259
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,210
It was my fault yesterday.

260
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,069
Are the company matters

261
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:20,480
very troublesome?

262
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,240
I'm fine, Mom.

263
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:27,589
Later,

264
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,200
let's talk.

265
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:37,570
Uncle Xu,

266
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,440
what's wrong?

267
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,480
Zhiyu,

268
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,200
Huang Yide suddenly wants
to leave in a hurry.

269
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,330
I'll be right there.

270
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:46,480
Huang Yide is still worried
about his wife and child.

271
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,200
As soon as he heard the loan sharks

272
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,070
had found them,

273
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,000
he panicked.

274
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,210
How did he know?

275
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,990
[Uncle Xu]

276
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,950
His wife called this morning,

277
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,360
saying their door was blocked.

278
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,510
They gave an address

279
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,200
and said Huang Yide

280
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,830
must show up today

281
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,540
and pay back the money.

282
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:02,920
Uncle Xu,

283
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,700
help me calm him down first.

284
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,480
Tell him

285
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:08,210
I'll handle it for him.

286
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,590
You're going alone?

287
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,640
Is it dangerous?

288
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,030
Don't worry.

289
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,160
Okay.

290
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,610
Be sure to stay safe.

291
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:16,350
Okay.

292
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:21,350
Hu Xiu.

293
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,310
Now I need to deal

294
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,490
with Huang Yide's debt matter.

295
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:25,820
I'll contact you later.

296
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,740
[Sir, he still hasn't come yet.]

297
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:50,590
Chairman Pei,

298
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,000
Mr. Xiao from D Studio is here.

299
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,070
I told him you're very busy now,

300
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:53,880
but he...

301
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:06,920
Stop waiting.

302
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,960
Huang Yide won't show up.

303
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,840
And you don't need to act mysterious here.

304
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:18,200
I privately paid off some of his debts.

305
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,000
The only person who's still after him

306
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,880
is you.

307
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,070
Zhiyu,

308
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,070
the person you mentioned—

309
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,070
who is he?

310
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,430
I don't quite understand.

311
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:34,880
Did you come at this moment

312
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,030
to visit me

313
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,910
or to talk about business with me?

314
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,980
Speaking of business,

315
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,070
I did make a pretty good deal recently.

316
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,120
I traded a sum of money

317
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,720
for something very important.

318
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,640
If you really have that thing,

319
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,700
you wouldn't have stepped in for him.

320
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,160
But recently,

321
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,490
I really have been troubled by something.

322
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,790
A supplier

323
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,500
ran into money problems.

324
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,160
I wanted to help him,

325
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,400
but suddenly,

326
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,420
I couldn't reach him anymore.

327
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:26,490
You must know where he is.

328
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,440
The person you are talking about—

329
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,310
I don't quite understand either.

330
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,830
And I'm not interested in understanding.

331
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:39,270
Fine.

332
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,480
All right.

333
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,750
Then the whereabouts

334
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,750
of your Ms. Hu—

335
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,050
are you interested in that?

336
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,420
Where is she?

337
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:26,980
Some time ago,

338
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,260
there was news
about a timber warehouse fire.

339
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,220
Did you see it?

340
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,360
The cause of the fire...

341
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,480
was

342
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,630
a joss stick
that wasn't extinguished in time

343
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,310
ignited the wood dust in the warehouse.

344
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,550
A joss stick

345
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,040
burns for about 20 minutes.

346
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,590
By now,

347
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:08,000
it should be almost burned out.

348
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:13,830
Xiao Zhiyu,

349
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,830
your time is running out.

350
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,390
Is anyone here?

351
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,110
Hello?

352
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,110
Fire!

353
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,110
Help!

354
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:50,920
Help!

355
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,340
Is anyone here?

356
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,480
Help!

357
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:55,640
Help!

358
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,070
Mr. Pei.

359
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,750
Huang Yide!

360
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,810
You fool.

361
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,350

Hu Xiu.

385
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:52,350
Wake up.

386
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,700
Don't fall asleep.

387
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,880
The ambulance will be here soon.

388
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,750
Hang in there.

389
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:56,680
Hu Xiu.

390
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:57,530
Hu Xiu!

391
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,680
It's okay now.

392
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,200
Xiao... Xiao Zhiyu.

393
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,310
I... I'm here.

394
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,160
I'm here.

395
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,030
I'm here.

396
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,070
I'm fine. I...

397
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:10,960
I'm okay.

398
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,200
I'm alright.

399
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,240
It's fine now.

400
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,510
I'm okay.

401
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,480
Don't you think

402
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:28,790
we're just like in a murder mystery game?

403
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,580
You know...

404
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,430
like that haunted house one.

405
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,200
At a time like this,

406
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,530
you're still laughing?

407
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,000
So,

408
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:44,540
did you get the mayor's command token?

409
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,160
Qin Xiaoyi.

410
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:57,070
The last item on each shelf—

411
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:59,240
its label
is deliberately placed vertically.

412
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,700
That's a restocking mark.

413
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:04,320
I suddenly remembered something.

414
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,310
In the room where Mr. Huang
stores the concrete test blocks,

415
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:25,710
one test block
has a very special marking code.

416
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:27,550
The others all have professional QR codes,

417
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:29,410
but only that one is handwritten.

418
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,110
Uncle Xu,

419
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,450
go to Huang Yide's factory now

420
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,440
and look for a concrete test block.

421
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:53,860
Get more people

422
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,310
to keep pushing the story about Xiao Zhiyu

423
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,640
leaking trade secrets.

424
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,400
Also,

425
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,400
bring up the construction accident

426
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,090
related to his father from back then

427
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:03,050
as well.

428
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,550
Okay.

429
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,730
As for Forma's suppliers,

430
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,960
let them continue

431
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:12,350
to fully safeguard their own rights.

432
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:13,590
Understand?

433
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:15,510
Yes, Mr. Pei.

434
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,160
You're faltering.

435
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,620
Is there something wrong?

436
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:19,880
Mr. Pei,

437
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,370
there is something.

438
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:22,240
Go ahead.

439
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,200
It's about Ms. Hu.

440
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:25,110
I think...

441
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:26,570
I should tell you.

442
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:29,720
What about her?

443
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,200
I think today, Chairman Pei sent people

444
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,240
to take Ms. Hu

445
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,920
to a warehouse.

446
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,440
I heard...

447
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:53,390
a fire broke out in that warehouse later.

448
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:54,350
But don't worry.

449
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:55,480
She's fine now.

450
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,750
Chairman Pei doing that—

451
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,970
could it be targeting... Xiao Zhiyu?

452
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:04,960
The weather is dry.

453
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:07,160
A small fire is normal.

454
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,750
Remember to handle
the surveillance footage.

455
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:10,610
What matters is

456
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:11,700
the thing I want!

457
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:12,870
Did you find it?

458
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:16,400
The concrete test block
where Huang Yide hid it

459
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,530
seems to be missing.

460
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,680
Then force him to find it!

461
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,680
What are you standing there for?

462
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,100
Do you have something to say?

463
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:39,200
Dad.

464
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:42,880
Why did you...

465
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,830
You could have come at me alone.

466
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,960
Causing her father's car accident,

467
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,920
getting her suspected
of leaking information—

468
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,450
is that how you protect her?

469
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:57,130
How could I have forgotten before

470
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,200
that the blood flowing in your veins

471
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,240
is the same as his?

472
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:07,600
What exactly do you want to ask?

473
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:16,230
Nothing.

474
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:20,060
Once I'm done
with Forma's business in a few days,

475
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,190
you're coming back to the U.S. with me.

476
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:25,760
I won't go back with you.

477
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,310
I'll get the door.

478
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:58,140
Why are you here?

479
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,680
I'm here to talk about the accident

480
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,990
at the Xincheng Stadium 20 years ago.

481
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,630
20 years ago.

482
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,570
That's all bygones.

483
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,230
Bygones?

484
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,590
But for my father,

485
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,889
it's an injustice
he's suffered for 20 years.

486
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:38,070
Do you need me to refresh your memory?

487
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,840
On January 8, 2004,

488
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:44,280
the Xincheng Stadium's roof collapsed,

489
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,080
causing 3 deaths and 6 injuries.

490
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,320
That accident

491
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,400
was concluded long ago
by the expert panel.

492
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,320
It was your father's decision error

493
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,030
coupled with sudden strong winds.

494
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,400
Decision error?

495
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,440
My dad used Q345B steel—

496
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,410
the design strength of the steel
fully met the standards.

497
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:06,110
The problem was
someone used inferior materials.

498
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:06,710
Pei Zhen,

499
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
you work in engineering.

500
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,760
You should know

501
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,710
the difference

502
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,510
between Q235B and Q345B, right?

503
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:18,720
The strength differs by a whole grade,

504
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:21,030
but they look almost identical.

505
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,400
Exactly.

506
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:24,940
During procurement back then,

507
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:27,030
your father used 30% Q235B steel

508
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,880
to pass it off as Q345B steel,

509
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,940
and pocketed 2 million yuan in kickbacks.

510
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:31,800
That's absurd.

511
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,280
Based on just a few photos
of unclear origin—

512
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,280
is that credible?

513
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,460
You want the memory card, huh?

514
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:42,660
By the way,

515
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,800
your people aren't still with Huang Yide

516
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,460
looking for that concrete test block,
are they?

517
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,480
It was such a big project.

518
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,960
Only that tiny bit of cheap steel
was used.

519
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,880
What's the big deal?

520
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,840
In this line of work,

521
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,360
who doesn't...

522
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,220
Who doesn't take a little? Right?

523
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,920
But only you

524
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,340
forged a document after the incident

525
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,340
and shifted all the blame onto my dad.

526
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,370
Look carefully.

527
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:27,880
It's in black and white.

528
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,610
Your father signed it himself.

529
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:31,730
Why did you say I forged it?

530
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,400
Do you want a handwriting appraisal?

531
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,260
Or I can call Huang Yide right now.

532
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:37,880
Let's see if he'll testify against you

533
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,480
in order to protect himself.

534
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,780
Even if he didn't sign this document,

535
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,140
could he really escape responsibility?

536
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:48,790
Otherwise, why would he choose
to end his life?

537
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,970
Is it really true...

538
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,820
that my father took his own life?

539
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:03,840
He jumped from the building himself!

540
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,900
Everyone knew that back then!

541
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,160
Then where were you at the time?

542
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,360
I already explained.

543
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:10,350
I wasn't at the stadium that day.

544
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,570
That night,

545
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:23,370
as soon as the accident occurred,

546
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:26,000
I rushed to the scene with Mr. Chen.

547
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,640
On the way, we picked up one person—

548
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,900
Pei Kanghua.

549
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,440
Then what about

550
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:41,970
the last text message

551
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,080
Yuze sent?

552
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,400
That text message said...

553
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:54,360
"I'm sorry.

554
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:58,280
It's all my fault.

555
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:02,030
Take good care of Xiaoyi

556
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,730
and make sure he grows up well."

557
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:13,840
Yes.

558
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:16,700
Xiaoyi is indeed my name.

559
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:19,670
But what you might not know is

560
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,150
my dad only called me by my pet name, Yi.

561
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,530
With such a major accident,

562
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:54,360
his whole life would surely be ruined!

563
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,540
If he had listened to me

564
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,590
and taken the blame
for everything back then,

565
00:38:58,590 --> 00:38:59,110
then...

566
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,840
sooner or later
I would have helped him make a comeback.

567
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,590
But he insisted on exposing me.

568
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,800
I didn't mean to harm him.

569
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,630
God helped me,

570
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:15,170
letting me achieve fame and success

571
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,000
and earn money
to support you and your mother!

572
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,920
Without me,

573
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,430
just those debts alone

574
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:22,030
would have crushed you both!

575
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,110
You should be grateful.

576
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:25,690
In this world,

577
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,590
who doesn't look out for themselves
in crisis?

578
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:29,480
Only you killed so many people!

579
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,480
You made my father
bear the blame for so many years!

580
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:49,920
But now...

581
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,470
it's your turn.
