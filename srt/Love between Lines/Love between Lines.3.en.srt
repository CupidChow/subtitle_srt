[Episode 3]

00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,340
Welcome to our park's gathering.

4
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,000
We've had
several new stores open recently.

5
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,510
It's a good chance for you all
to get to know each other.

6
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,870
What took you so long?

7
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,360
Hello everyone.

8
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,960
I'm Xiaorou's husband.

9
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,150
Just call me Guangming.

10
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:16,750
Mr. Ming.

11
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,560
No, no, no.

12
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,590
I work in software development.

13
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,680
Come, have a seat.

14
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,120
Have a seat.

15
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,120
Scoot in a little.

16
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,980
Did you order enough food?

17
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,360
Is everyone here?

18
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,430
Well,

19
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,630
the owner of ME Club, Mr. Gong, is busy.

20
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,380
He said some staff would come instead.

21
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,690
Your wife's shop
is just across the street.

22
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,590
You should know that.

23
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,190
Right?

24
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,590
Those NPCs at their shop

25
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,079
are quite famous online.

26
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,360
NPCs?

27
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,400
Will Qin Xiaoyi come?

28
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,079
Qin Xiaoyi?

29
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,030
Oh, right.

30
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,079
Is he the one who plays General Qin?

31
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,000
He should be coming.

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,600
He's really popular lately.

33
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,520
Is that so?

34
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,840
Then let's organize a game next time.

35
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,680
Sounds good.

36
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,360
I'm going outside to make a call.

37
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,590
Come on, Mr. Ming.

38
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,150
Let's have a drink.

41
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,900
Writing a resume
is about organizing yourself.

42
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,400
This chicken soup for the soul
is really good.

43
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,150
I get you.

44
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,280
I feel like my previous experience
isn't relevant,

45
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,740
but if I don't include it,
it would be a waste.

46
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,870
This person really understands me.

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,079
Why not join the group chat party

48
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,750
and ask everyone for some advice?

49
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,280
That's an idea.

50
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,840
When you're stuck, take a break

51
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,300
and have something sweet.

52
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,620
This one makes the most sense.

53
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,360
Zhao,

54
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,000
I was just about to call you.

55
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:57,440
Are you at the café?

56
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,400
Star Club 888.

57
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,800
What?

58
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,750
I'm at Room 888 in Star Club.

59
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,470
Qin Xiaoyi will be here soon.

60
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,670
You should come over.

61
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,630
Haven't you been checking his sessions

62
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,750
at the murder mystery game place every day

63
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,190
just for him?

64
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,030
Come over and ask him yourself.

65
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:12,870
Set up another game

66
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:13,930
directly with him.

67
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:15,870
Wait for me.

00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,120
Let me introduce you.

00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,630

00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,430
a junior in the Drama Academy's
Acting Department.

75
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,870
And this is my bestie, Hu Xiu.

76
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:44,720
Hello.

77
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,240
Your name's pretty interesting.

78
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,190
I heard you also like coming to

79
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,650

80
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,159

81
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:50,560
Have a seat.

82
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,490
Yes, have a seat.

83
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,270
Then you'll be our VIP from now on.

84
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,630

00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,530
Can I add you on WeChat?

88
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:16,720
Li Yue,

89
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,040
let's exchange WeChat too.

90
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,270
Sure.

91
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,680
I heard your murder mystery games
are really fun.

92
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,310
If Li Yue is here,

93
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,800
then...

94
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,830
Today's latest murder mystery game

95
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,040
should be Group A with Qin Xiaoyi.

98
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,000
I have something to do.

99
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'll be going now.

100
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,630
Zhao,

101
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,920
I think you

102
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,510
have a serious case of face-blindness.

103
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,390
Bye.

104
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,020
I can still make it, right?

105
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,310
Alright.

106
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:02,430
Excuse me.

107
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,430
You're late.

108
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,020
There are no choices left.

109
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,510
The character doesn't matter.
The outcome does.

110
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,030
Okay.

111
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,240
This way, please.

112
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:10,960
You are Wu Jin,
the investigation expert sent by Side S.

113
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,280
[Wu Jin, Investigation Expert]

114
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,660
Your mission is to find the old mayor,

115
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,360
get the command token,

116
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,560
and help the new mayor you support
take office.

117
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,430
Remember,

118
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,190
your choices determine your fate.

119
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,000
Find the old mayor?

120
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,870
In previous games,

121
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,200
the old mayor was always assassinated.

122
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,630
How come this time...

123
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,390
If finding the command token
and the old mayor is the only way

124
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:45,450
to make the new city lord take office,

125
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,560
Qin Xiaoyi

126
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,000
must also be investigating
with all his efforts.

127
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,159
There must be clues

128
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,600
in his office.

129
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,600
The police are also

130
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,000
investigating
the old mayor's disappearance.

131
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,800
There's been no progress so far.

132
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,660
Keep watching.

133
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,190
Any leads on that key?

134
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,590
He's really in this game?

135
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,160
We caught a suspicious person at the café.

136
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:15,240
She said the key
was deposited at the Central Hotel.

137
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,920
Bai Luoyu?

138
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,120
She usually only trades information
for money

139
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,310
and doesn't get involved
in anything in Rongcheng.

140
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,640
No wonder we missed her.

141
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,070
Do we need to...

142
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,410
Who's there?

143
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,430
How can I help...

144
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,380
Give me the key
to the old mayor's residence.

145
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,950
I never saw this house before

146
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,360
in this game.

147
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,070
Never mind.

148
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,200
I'll go in and take a look.

149
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:41,270
Ten years ago,

150
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,789
the whole family committed suicide here.

151
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,600
This place is eerily strange.

152
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:49,480
I think this is a haunted house.

153
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,270
No way.

154
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,010
The old mayor's command token?

155
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,720
Hurry, hurry.

156
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,550
Don't mess with me.

157
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,710
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

158
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,010
I'll just take the token and leave.

159
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,470
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

160
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,200
Don't come over.

161
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,320
Are you okay?

162
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,600
Get up.

163
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,290
My legs are shaking.

164
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,440
Sorry about that.

165
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,870
It's a new haunted house setting.

166
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:13,870
Did it scare you?

167
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:15,270
There...

168
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,790
There's a...

fall from the sky like this?

180
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,150
The game is designed this way.

181
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,680
It has nothing to do with me.

182
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,000
I can walk by myself.

183
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,440
I was just sitting too long

184
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,640
and my legs went numb.

185
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:04,910
I'll take it slow.

186
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:05,790
If you're in a hurry,

187
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,030
you can go ahead.

188
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,270
To get out,
you must go through the garden.

189
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,390
Those things will definitely appear again.

190
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,910
You know how it feels

191
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,090
to encounter them.

192
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:16,750
Are you sure

193
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,060
you can do it alone?

194
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,550
Of course.

195
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,740
Who said she could do it alone?

196
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,390
You're just too slow.

197
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,480
Look, I've already passed you.

198
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,200
Ms. Wu,

199
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,110
you're doing this on purpose, aren't you?

200
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,350
They're all here.

201
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,080
Pretend you don't see them
and go straight through.

202
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,080
Where's your gun?

203
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,480
Why?

204
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,270
I want to see the petals falling again.

205
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:10,750
Who just criticized this design?

206
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,360
Th-th-this one.

207
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,720
Fireflies!

208
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,510
Th-that one is big.

209
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,370
Shoot that one.

210
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,030
There's another one.

211
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,440
That one. That one.

212
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,000
Why did you stop?

213
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:11,870
I'm tired.

214
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:15,270
I thought

215
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,120
General Qin was supposed to be amazing

216
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,200
with weapons.

217
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,350
But your stamina is quite limited.

218
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,270
And these effects—

219
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,070
they have no originality at all.

220
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,240
Ms. Wu,

221
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,830
reverse psychology doesn't work on me.

222
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,600
I'll play by myself.

223
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,200
Ms. Wu, don't you have your own weapon?

224
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,550
Why take someone else's?

225
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,240
I...

226
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,840
Why are you being so stingy?

227
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,030
Just let me play with it for a while.

228
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,670
No.

229
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:45,690
We're already out.

230
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,070
Yes.

231
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,750
I kicked the door open.

232
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,600
That passage is unusable now.

233
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,330
Close it off.

234
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,600
Don't let anyone go through there anymore.

235
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,080
Well...

236
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,720
What happened?

237
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:00,840
Nothing.

238
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,150
General Qin, you reminded me.

239
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,840
I'm also armed.

240
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,270
Now,

241
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:15,020
answer my questions honestly.

242
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,460
Why did you suddenly appear
at the old mayor's residence?

243
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,870
Didn't you just hear?

244
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,030
The control center alerted me

245
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,640
that a player was in trouble
at the haunted house,

246
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,690
so I went to check.

247
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,150
If you want to leave now,

248
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,280
you can get a refund.

249
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,620
The Military Affairs Office...

250
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,420
is quite far from here, isn't it?

251
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,360
Why were you the farthest away,

252
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,820
yet arrived the quickest?

253
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,750
Because when I received the message,

254
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,150
I was already here.

255
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,360
I heard from Bai Luoyu

256
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,220
that a female player took the key.

257
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,470
Although I didn't know who took it,

258
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,740
the only thing I was certain of

259
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,060
was that person

260
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:53,700
would definitely go there.

261
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,840
What exactly is it

262
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,670
that's worth such a risk, Ms. Wu?

263
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,270
Haven't you already figured it out?

264
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,550
Without this command token,

265
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,910
you absolutely cannot become the mayor.

266
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,880
Since you saved me just now,

267
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,060
I'll use this token

268
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,600
to make a deal with you.

269
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,250
I'm listening.

270
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,200
I want to know

271
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,270
who Jiang Yi is.

272
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,630
So Jiang Yi works for Feng Youjin?

273
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,200
Ning Zechen found out

274
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:32,030
that Jiang Yi
was once the Feng family's butler.

275
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,360
It's almost dawn.

276
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,260
We're running out of time.

277
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,660
Let's go check upstairs.

278
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:38,970
Ms. Sun,

279
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,130
it's been a pleasure working with you.

280
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,620
Be careful.

281
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:47,590
What's that sound?

282
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:52,750
This way,

283
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:53,670
please.

284
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,350
It's been a pleasure.

285
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,840
They're gone.

286
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,349
Since the mayor has been hidden away,

287
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:05,960
it must be somewhere secret.

288
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,640
Look.

289
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:16,270
These four rooms are all the same size,

290
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:16,740
but when we checked earlier,

291
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,640
[Partial View of the Rongcheng
Finance Department]

292
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,160
these two
were clearly smaller than the others.

293
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,690
There's a hidden room here.

294
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,230
Let's go check again.

295
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:29,480
35.

296
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:30,830
What?

297
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,890
The previous room had 56 floor tiles,

298
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,690
but this room only has 35.

299
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,130
If there's a secret room,

300
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,660
there must be a secret door.

301
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,440
Why aren't you helping?

302
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,740
I don't know these things.

303
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,680
Otherwise, I would have noticed

304
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,340
the difference in room sizes.

305
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,960
Yeah, all you do is talk.

306
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:04,790
Lightweight materials?

307
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,030
A movable wall?

308
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,820
This designer was really thorough.

309
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,250
Old mayor?

310
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,400
Go untie him.

311
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,000
It's in the back.

312
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,850
Thank goodness we found you before dawn.

313
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:47,200
Almost done.

314
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,230
Done.

315
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,020
Ms. Wu,

316
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:57,090
thank you for saving me.

317
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,690
Qin Xiaoyi, you bastard!

318
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,830
Y-you're so devious!

319
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:18,850
Let me go!

320
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,220
You flatter me.

321
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,240
Saving me in that haunted house

322
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,300
was also part of your plan, wasn't it?

323
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,790
I already told you

324
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,650
to quit the game
and that we'd give you a refund,

325
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:32,650
but you refused.

326
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,100
I'd rather lose than run away.

327
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,210
Don't worry.

328
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,880
You can't run away.

329
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,360
Because...

330
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,510
a fox can't be the winner here.

331
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,090
Goodbye, Ms. Wu.

332
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,830
Qin Xiaoyi...

333
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:56,810
Qin Xiaoyi!

334
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,320
Qin Xiaoyi, let's talk this...

335
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,640
Qin Xiaoyi!

336
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:15,870
Congratulations.

337
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:21,680
He really lives up to his name.

338
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,050
Great. That's awesome.

339
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,400
Impressive.

340
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:36,590
The new version's virtual atmosphere
is amazing.

341
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:37,790
I like the thrill.

342
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,590
Otherwise, it would get boring.

343
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,140
I was wrong, sir.

344
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,700
It would never get boring.

345
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,420
What's up? Something's wrong?

346
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,210
I think

347
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,960
the randomly triggered horror missions

348
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,300
aren't very appropriate.

349
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,820
We should assign them to players
with higher tolerance first.

350
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:56,410
Well...

351
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,190
thanks for your help
with that last session.

352
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,560
That girl has played several times.

353
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,240
I thought she was a veteran player.

354
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:01,680
Here's the thing.

355
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,110
This is the first run of the new version.

356
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,070
Did you inform

357
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,440
all players about the horror segments

358
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,830
before they entered?

359
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,110
She came late

360
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,480
and was in a hurry,

361
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,590
so I just...

362
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,450
Alright.

363
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,750
Well...

364
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,550
I'll adjust the trigger mode

365
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,910
for the horror missions.

366
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,500
Let's pause them for now.

367
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,140
I'll go back
and give the team more training.

368
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,080
I'm leaving.

369
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:06,720
Use mine.

370
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,120
My ride will be here soon.

371
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,470
Thanks.

372
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,350
So annoying.

373
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,440
School starts tomorrow.

374
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,440
I haven't even finished my lab report yet.

375
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,510
What have you been doing
this entire vacation?

376
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,740
Playing murder mystery games.

377
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,840
It's really addictive.

378
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,750
If someone could write my report for me,

379
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,010
I'll immediately support them as mayor.

380
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,880
Life isn't a murder mystery game.

381
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,480
Don't get too caught up in it.

382
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,280
The ride is here.

383
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,030
Let's go.

384
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,590
Yeah,

385
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,240
we always have to return to reality.

386
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,100
Are you home now?

387
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,750
Just letting you know,

388
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,160
the club has sent an apology message

389
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,310
to that female player who got scared

390
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,400
and gave her some free game vouchers.

391
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,200
Got it.

392
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:32,990
By the way,

393
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,070
I heard from the receptionist

394
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,220
that she had specifically
asked about your sessions before.

395
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,750
What a coincidence, right?

396
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,190
Anything else?

397
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:44,400
Nope.

398
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:45,810
Get some rest then.

399
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:01,650
Take care.

400
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,740
Thank you.

401
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,970
Your stomach hurts?

402
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,310
Did you forget to eat again?

403
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,700
Seems like I got too busy last night
and forgot.

404
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,840
You need a healthy stomach to work well,
Ms. Hu.

405
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,800
Things aren't going smoothly?

406
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:46,450
I've asked a friend in headhunting
to keep an eye out.

407
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:48,080
He told me to tweak my resume a bit,

408
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,560
lean more toward architectural design.

409
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:53,530
The most impressive part
of my resume right now

410
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,750
is just my relevant college major.

411
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:58,790
And I didn't pursue further education.

412
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,550
Since graduating,

413
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,180
I've been running this café.

414
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:05,920
I've never worked elsewhere.

415
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,780
I can't give you any great advice.

416
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:10,610
But...

417
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,240
I think your resume...

418
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,960
might be a bit too plain.

419
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,110
In the architecture industry,

420
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,780
everything is already quite dull.

421
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:20,460
There's no need for fancy stuff.

422
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,240
But doesn't your industry

423
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,920
have plenty of fancy things?

424
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,400
That D something—

425
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,400
isn't it quite fancy?

426
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,310
Dynamism?

427
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,510
They're really excellent.

428
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,920
That popular café on Jianguo West Road

429
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,870
and that super photogenic
Galaxy Bookstore?

430
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:35,080
Both of them were designed by them.

431
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,940
How do you know so much about them?

432
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,400
After all,
it's the top architectural studio

433
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,940
in the industry these past two years.

434
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:41,840
They have so many awards.

435
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,640
It's hard not to know about them.

436
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:47,350
I should get back to job hunting.

437
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:48,790
Forget about dreams.

438
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,400
My wallet is empty.

439
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,110
Xiu.

440
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,220
Maybe you should consider
other income sources.

441
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,940
Isn't that attic at your place empty?

442
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,110
Rent it out.

443
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:10,910
Cai.

444
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:12,110
Hu?

445
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,000
You stayed up late again last night,
didn't you?

446
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,870
Look at those dark circles
under your eyes.

447
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,500
Job hunting is exhausting.

448
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:19,380
What?

449
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:20,950
I said

450
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:21,920
working is exhausting.

451
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,520
Your job is much better, Cai.

452
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,150
Nonsense.

453
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:31,260
Wait.

454
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:32,680
You...

455
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:33,900
I got it fir-

456
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,440
Pretending not to know me again?

457
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,550
Thanks.

458
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,640
Why are you following me?

459
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,570
What do you want?

460
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,140
Who's following you?

461
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,270
Ms. Hu, you're back?

462
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:49,040
Excuse me, let me through.

463
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:52,930
It's over here.

464
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,440
Still pretending not to know me?

465
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,780
Who's taking this too seriously?

466
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,050
Signing the contract?

467
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:08,660
Mom,

468
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,350
why are you trying to
rent out the house again?

469
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,580
This house can't be rented.

470
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,450
I don't agree.

471
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:15,600
Please help me ask around again.

472
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,350
Please do me a favor.

473
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:16,950
Thank you.

474
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,370
There aren't many houses for rent here,

475
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:22,400
but I asked my colleagues
to keep an eye out.

476
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,180
Once there's news,

477
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,910
I'll let you know immediately.

478
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:33,650
Nonsense!

479
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,640
How dare you trick my mom
into renting out the house?

480
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,600
How dare you offend me, Chen Dabao?

481
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,080
Let's see who still dares to rent to him.

482
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,930
Borrowing my pot again?

483
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,510
Dazhong, lend me two cucumbers.

484
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,680
As you know,

485
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,160
most of the residents here are elderly,

486
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:13,440
and they've lived here

487
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,030
for most of their lives.

488
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:17,650
They don't like moving around.

489
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,640
Money isn't an issue.

490
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,680
I understand.

491
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,680
I've tried offering higher rent.

492
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,500
It's just that

493
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,010
the news about you renting
Granny Chen's house has spread.

494
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:28,070
That Chen Dabao
has been going around saying

495
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,600
that anyone who rents to you

496
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,660
will be in trouble with him.

497
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,170
Nobody wants to mess with him.

498
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,510
Why don't you try another place?

499
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,070
No.

500
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,640
I'm staying in the lane.

501
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:43,520
Have you asked about that attic?

502
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,780
You mean Ms. Hu's?

503
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:48,680
Her rental listing says

504
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,500
"no agents,"

505
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,550
so I can't really ask.

506
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:53,580
Of course,

507
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:56,240
you could talk to her yourself.

508
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,170
Got it.

509
00:29:58,450 --> 00:29:59,100
Thanks.

510
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:07,780
It's all set.

511
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,310
Mr. Zhao

512
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,160
has invested in quite a few

513
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,730
large-scale VR experience centers.

514
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:13,400
He introduced me to a German company,

515
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,470
saying that a technician named Felix

516
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,330
is really skilled.

517
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:19,170
If we give him the new scenario,
it'll be no problem at all.

518
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:19,900
That's good.

519
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:20,710
By the way,

520
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:22,570
I also told Mr. Zhao

521
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,350
that in the future,

522
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:25,880
we could invest in
some VR projects together.

523
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:26,900
Xiao,

524
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,760
thanks for bringing me here.

525
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,270
Otherwise, I wouldn't even
have a connection with him.

526
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,550
A huge favor like this
can't be thanked enough.

527
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,440
I'll repay you someday.

528
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,360
Don't wait for someday.

529
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:43,190
Repay it now.

530
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,590
Almost there.

531
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:48,840
Okay.

532
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:49,920
Done.

533
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,100
Thank you.

534
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:54,680
Why did you buy such a big cabinet?

535
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,140
To rent this place out quickly.

536
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:57,890
Ms. Wu,

537
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,310
are you interested
in the executive GM assistant position?

538
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,000
You should post your rental listing online

539
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,160
more often.

540
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,350
I did.

541
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,890
I post it every day.

542
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:08,060
Plenty of people contacted me,

543
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:08,790
but...

544
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:09,850
half are agents,

545
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,920
and the other half
just asked for basic information

546
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,030
with no follow-up.

547
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,440
So I thought
I'd try to spruce this place up

548
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,880
as soon as possible.

549
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:18,900
Where should this box be placed?

550
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,700
It's full of your college stuff.

551
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,830
Put it in the living room.

552
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:25,370
Okay, I'll carry it down for you.

553
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:26,880
Zhao.

554
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,270
Do you think
I should replace this bed too?

555
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:31,400
I broke it before and my dad fixed it.

556
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,160
It looks fine to me.

557
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,350
Don't replace it.

558
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,590
What if you keep replacing things

559
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,940
but don't rent it out eventually?

560
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:39,980
Bah!

561
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,120
I definitely can rent it out.

562
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:41,940
It'll be rented by tomorrow.

563
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,740
Fine, it'll definitely be rented out
by tomorrow.

564
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:50,880
Zhao.

565
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,180
[Hello, I'd like to come see the house.]

566
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:13,640
Hello.

567
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,640
Hi. I'm here to see the house.

568
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,960
Do you mind having a male tenant?

569
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,890
I don't smoke, drink, or keep pets.

570
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:27,010
And I won't bring random people home.

571
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:28,820
I don't mind.

572
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,660
This is a two-floor apartment.

573
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:35,640
This area has a bedroom,
a living room, a kitchen, and a bathroom.

574
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,990
This is the common area.

575
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,600
I can hear you.

576
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:45,430
The TV, fridge, and microwave

577
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,460
were all bought less than a year ago.

578
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:49,530
The curtains were replaced
earlier this year.

579
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:50,860
They do look quite new.

580
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,810
This is the master bedroom.

581
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:57,370
It's where I'm living now.

582
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:59,050
The attic is a separate space.

583
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,510
It's here.

584
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,880
Doesn't the attic
get quite cold in winter?

585
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,140
I...

586
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:12,430
get allergies easily.

587
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:14,600
I need to get some sunlight regularly.

588
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:15,510
This...

589
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,030
There's a small balcony over there.

590
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:20,760
In winter, sitting in the sun for a bit
feels nice.

591
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:25,800
The walls look a little yellowed.

592
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:28,130
Well, this house is quite old,

593
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,310
so it's normal.

594
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,680
If it bothers you,

595
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,320
I can hire someone to repaint it.

596
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:32,840
Okay.

597
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,260
This is the bathroom.

598
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,160
All the drainage and waterproofing systems

599
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,160
are excellent.

600
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,170
In this area,

601
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:42,480
it's rare to find an attic
with its own private bathroom.

602
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,270
True.

603
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:44,970
It's just that...

604
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,680
it's a bit small.

605
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:49,860
Small?

606
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,030
And this window

607
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:57,750
directly faces the lane intersection,

608
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:00,760
which isn't great.

609
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,890
From a fengshui point of view, it's...

610
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,440
not considered very lucky.

611
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,770
I'm already feeling a bit uncomfortable.

612
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:10,000
I didn't know you knew these things.

613
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,800
Just a little.

614
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,440
I'll get you some water.

615
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,400
Take your time looking.

616
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,199
Okay, thanks.

617
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:23,920
She went downstairs.

618
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,520
What else do you want to see?
I'll send it to you.

619
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:28,230
It looks fine.

620
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Stop nitpicking.

621
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:30,920
Let's just rent it

622
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,920
like we agreed on.

623
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,620
I was nitpicking for a reason.

624
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,710
I just wanted to let her know
the attic isn't easy to rent out

625
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:36,880
so we'd have more leverage
when negotiating.

626
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,880
What do you know?

627
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:38,969
Did you see that?

628
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:39,850
Just now,

629
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:41,770
when she said she was going downstairs
to get water,

630
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:45,230
that was obviously an excuse.
She couldn't handle it anymore.

631
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,610
It really was an excuse.

632
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:53,380
She's on the second-floor balcony,
making a phone call.

633
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,550
You heard it?

634
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,960
I did.

635
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:57,420
He seems unreliable.

636
00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:00,510
Talking about bad fengshui and all that.
It's too much.

637
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,360
He's so picky.

638
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,280
If he moves in,
he'll definitely be trouble.

639
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,740
Should I wait a bit longer?

640
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:06,840
If I get a female tenant,
I'll feel more at ease.

641
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,970
Exactly. Keep waiting.

642
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:09,630
Consider today as a practice.

643
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:11,950
I just heard her mention a female tenant.

644
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,300
Could there be someone else
coming to see the place?

645
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:16,400
She went inside.

646
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,320
The water.

647
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,070
Thanks.

648
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,590
I'm sorry.

649
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:28,150
I thought about it,

650
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,120
and I feel a man and a woman...

651
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,120
Should have some basic boundaries.

652
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:31,950
Ms. Wu,

653
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,780
I thought about it too.

654
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,880
We're not related or friends.

655
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,880
Even if we live on different floors,

656
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,400
that would still be inconvenient

657
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,110
in many ways.

658
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:40,960
Right.

659
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,400
So I want to rent the whole place.

660
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,480
Just for 3 months.

661
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:47,580
What?

662
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,150
Here's the situation.

663
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:51,660
I was sent to Shanghai
on a business trip by my company.

664
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,630
I'll be returning to Guangdong
in 3 months.

665
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:54,360
My mother...

666
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:55,450
is from Shanghai.

667
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,280
I grew up with my grandfather

668
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,000
in a lane just like this one.

669
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,100
When I was a kid,

670
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:02,150
he used to take me
to the lane entrance to eat those

671
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:04,880
big pancakes
wrapped around fried dough sticks.

672
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:07,920
But later...

673
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,360
Later, my grandfather passed away.

674
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:13,650
So we just...

675
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,290
moved away.

676
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,320
I've seen Ms. Hu at the club.

677
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,790
She's quite clever.

678
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:22,000
The more you talk,
the more likely you'll slip up.

679
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,840
So,

680
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:25,190
since I have this opportunity
to come back,

681
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:25,920
I just

682
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,230
really want to live in a lane for a while

683
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:31,600
to reminisce about my childhood.

684
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,730
Mr. Gong, stop the drama.

685
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:34,780
Get to the point.

686
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:35,470
Shut up.

687
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:38,570
I didn't say anything.

688
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,010
Well, I totally understand

689
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,920
why you want to live here.

690
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,110
It's just that I have too much stuff.

691
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:50,230
Moving would be very troublesome.

692
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:51,960
Ms. Wu,

693
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,630
you didn't get what I meant.

694
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,920
I'll still live on this floor,

695
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,220
and you can lock your bedroom.

696
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,680
I won't touch your things.

697
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:01,640
But the walls...

698
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:02,870
I'm not a clean freak.

699
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,920
This bathroom is too small.

700
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,550
You can use...

701
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,280
I'll just use this one.

702
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,590
As long as there's hot water.

703
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,710
This window faces...

704
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:09,800
It's bad fengshui,

705
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:10,790
but I'm tough.

706
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:12,930
Well, in winter...

707
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:13,600
Ms. Wu,

708
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,380
let me be straightforward.

709
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,230
All those issues I just pointed out...

710
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:19,230
were just to make sure
you don't refuse to rent it to me.

711
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,420
If you let me rent the whole place,

712
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,450
I'll pay 18,000 for rent.

713
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:22,930
Three months. All at once.

714
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:24,470
18,000?

715
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:26,540
I know it's a bit of trouble for you.

716
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,540
How about rounding it up to 20,000?

717
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,470
20,000?

718
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,920
Didn't you say
you wouldn't rent it to him?

719
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,080
How did you end up

720
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,760
getting kicked out of your own place?

721
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,170
I've sent out so many resumes,

722
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:41,040
but everyone who contacted me asked

723
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,320
Since that doesn't work

724
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,450
and I can't get a job,

725
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,970
this is the best option right now.

726
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:45,610
Besides,

727
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:46,730
it's 60,000.

728
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:48,690
The money was deposited

729
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:50,210
right after I signed the contract.

730
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:52,340
It was like money falling from the sky.

731
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,470
You won't be staying here
during this time?

732
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:58,840
Why should I stay here?

733
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:01,750
Right.

734
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,030
You have someone at home now.

735
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,230
Things have changed.

736
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,360
Of course.

737
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,160
What about your place?

738
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,400
My place?

739
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,740
It's just for 3 months anyway.

740
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:14,710
Xiu.

741
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:16,730
If you need money, you can tell me.

742
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:17,790
I can lend you some.

743
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:22,070
Zhao, I'm not that broke yet.

744
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:25,550
I'm just planning to start over.

745
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,510
As a new designer,

746
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:29,240
I don't make much money a month.

747
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:31,550
So I need to save whatever I can.

748
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,630
I'm already very satisfied

749
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:36,360
to have such a generous tenant.

750
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:38,240
As long as you're happy.

751
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,100
I like this place.

752
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,440
The rent was a bit high,

753
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,740
but you can say
I've successfully completed my mission.

754
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:50,880
I got the place sorted

755
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,400
and didn't let you
run into that female player.

756
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,760
Call me
if you need anything in the future.
