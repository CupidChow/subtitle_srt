[Episode 9]

3
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,430
I might not know how his career is going,

4
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,480
but his character

5
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,790
leaves much to be desired.

6
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:04,200
He doesn't even know basic courtesy.

7
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,740
He won't follow Rongcheng's rules.

8
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,680
I'd better not run into him again,

9
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,870
or I won't be able to stop myself
from lashing out,

10
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,800
and everyone will be embarrassed.

11
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,750
Alright.

12
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,070
What?

13
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,130
I won't let you run into him.

14
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,940
Try this candied fruit.

15
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:26,890
It's delicious.

16
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,900
I picked it up along the way.

17
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:48,670
I can no longer accept your gifts,

18
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,320
even if you mean well.

19
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,150
I'm not being kind.

20
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,200
I'm seducing you.

21
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,200
I give expecting something in return,

22
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,530
and I make sure to get it.

23
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,260
I won't marry you just because of a hat.

24
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,380
Don't get ahead of yourself.

25
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,470
I will not marry.

26
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,460
Then I won't kiss you either.

27
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,640
I almost forgot about
the real matters at hand.

28
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,610
No, I don't want to kiss you,

29
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,530
even though you may need it.

30
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:21,800
That is the problem.

31
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,180
You need someone

32
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:24,410
who knows how to kiss.

33
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,050
Then, do you think you're that person?

34
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,590
She's not at

35
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,120
the casino or hotel.

36
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,960
Where else can she be?

37
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,740
Are you an NPC or a player?

38
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,610
Watch where you're going!

39
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,400
Keep staring

40
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,770
and I'll file a complaint against you!

41
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,550
What's wrong?

42
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,050
Is there something on my face?

43
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,040
Wipe your mouth.

44
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,550
There's a quality control issue with
the hawthorn balls

45
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,790
from your store!

46
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:19,760
It's the first time I've had customers
come for a murder mystery game,

47
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,959
but complain about the hawthorn balls.

48
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,760
Don't panic.

49
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:37,120
Let's go.

50
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,960
Chief Ning has lost important evidence.

51
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,760
Everyone must be searched.

52
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,760
Why are you hiding from Ning Zechen?

53
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,120
Follow me.

54
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,690
Hand it over.

55
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,170
There's another exit here?

56
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:06,960
This way.

57
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,790
Where does this path lead?

58
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,610
To the main hall.

59
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,250
It's one of the fire exits.

60
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:15,470
Let's go.

61
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,520
General Qin.

62
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,080
I'm going to find my friend now.

63
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,680
I'll need to prepare for
the mayor's election too.

64
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,000
Well then, General Qin,

65
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,909
farewell.

66
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:37,730
Alright.

67
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,290
General!

68
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,200
It's no good.

69

70

is missing.

71
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,050
I took it with me.

72
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,790
The watch is with you?

73
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,350
Then I can rest easy.

74
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,640
However,

75
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,120
it shouldn't be with me anymore.

76
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,790

00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,450
where have you been?

128
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,400
I've been looking all over for you.

129

Don't even mention it.

Mr. Guangming,

131
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,559
before I came here, I heard that

132
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,470
the NPCs here are all very good-looking.

133
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,400
Lots of women spend money on them.

134
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,679
But I never expected

135
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,400
Ms. Hu is also such a person.

136
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,670
Could there be some misunderstanding?

137
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,790
There's no misunderstanding.

138
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,390
She went shopping with me today.

139
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,890
At first, she even complimented
how handsome I looked in my suit.

140
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,990
Then suddenly, she was flirting
with someone else.

141
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:55,750
She's just a woman

142
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,150
who only cares about looks, not character.

143
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,680
I really misjudged her.

144
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,040
So shouldn't someone with neither looks

145
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,320
nor character

146
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,630
watch what they say,

147
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,440

00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,040
What do you mean by that?

149
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,800
It's your friend who has
questionable character.

150
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,960
I saw it with my own eyes.

151
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,560
She was flirting and even getting physical

152
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,230

153
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:14,590

00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,040
Don't tell me you already knew

157

other male actors.

If you don't want to play this game,

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,040
It's fine, really.

189
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,360

00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:29,050

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,650
Are your bones alright?

196
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,550

You're messing up my gaming experience!

203
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:45,960
I'm sorry.

204
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,350
I can't continue anymore.

205
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,880
Give us an explanation now!

206
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,400
Don't touch me!

207
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,320
What should we do?

208
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:52,710
Let's call the police.

209
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,560
All's good now.

210
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,800
Why call the police?

211
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:55,990
If this gets out,

212
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,080
it won't look good for our club.

213
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,080
Arrange full refunds for this session.

214
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,280
Take down everyone's information.

215
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,480
Everyone gets 30% off their next visit.

216
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,870
Do you... have the authority
to make that decision?

217
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,160
In my opinion,

218
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,350
we should contact our boss first.

219
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,280
Yes, yes.

220
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:10,800
Let's contact our boss.

221
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,800
I am the boss.

222
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,830
How is your face?

223
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:23,890
Does it still hurt?

224
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,160
It's fine.

225
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,440
You'd definitely slapped him back harder

226
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,770
than what I had endured.

227
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,750
It's his mouth.

228
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,400
He can say

229
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,280
whatever he wants.

230
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,630
But I couldn't stand it.

231
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,560
He was being so rude.

232
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,630
Is that Qin Xiaoyi

233
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,260
really the boss of this shop?

234
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,160
If...

235
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,320
he says so himself,

236
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,800
then he must be.

237
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,560
He keeps a much lower profile than
Gong Huaicong.

238
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,800
You should go check on him quickly.

239
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,060
I think he's in much worse shape
than I am.

240
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:51,870
But...

241
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:53,630
No buts.

242
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,050
Wang is here with me.

243
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:56,330
He will take care of me.

244
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,320
Use this to ice it first.

245
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,230
We'll use an ice pack when we get home.

246
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:00,750
I'm sorry

247
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,200
for causing you trouble today.

248
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,200
I'm fine.

249
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,400
I'll go check on Xiao—

250
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,210
Qin Xiaoyi.

251
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,640
All the players for this session
have been refunded.

252
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,410
Wait.

253
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,700
I can't believe I wasn't there

254
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,230
for such a dramatic moment.

255
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,080
I have to go now. Bye.

256
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,400
You were waiting for me?

257
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,200
I'll go to the hospital with you.

258
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,830
You must get checked out.

259
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,360
What if something's wrong?

260
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,920
I didn't say I wasn't going.

261
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,760
Architects don't mess around with
their own hands.

262
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,220
Good that you understand.

263
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,680
Let's go.

264
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:46,430
[Emergency]

265
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:50,560
We're here.

266
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,610
Let's go.

267
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,710
Alright.

268
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:02,850
I hurt my arm,

269
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,710
not my leg.

270
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,280
I can still walk.

271
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,890
Let's register first.

272
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:08,830
Hello.

273
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,280
My friend hurt his arm.

274
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,230
How do we get to the clinic?

275
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,160
Register first.

276
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:15,920
Doctor.

277
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,110
My friend injured his hand.

278
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,730
I need to register.

279
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,190
10 yuan for registration.

280
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,440
Here's your card.

281
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,330
Let's go.

282
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,080
Can you bend it here?

283
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,560
Gently, please!

284
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,340
Your girlfriend seems quite concerned
about you.

285
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,140
She's crying out in pain for you.

286
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,400
Doctor, you misunderstood.

287
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:40,800
I...

288
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,990
We're not together.

289
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,670
Doctor, is it serious?

290
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:45,720
I'm not sure.

291
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,180
Let's take an X-ray first.

292
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:48,710
Oh, X-ray.

293
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,080
Take him there first.

294
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,060
It's on the second floor, right?

295
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:51,650
Let's go.

296
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,270
Thank you.

297
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:00,630
Doctor, what's the diagnosis?

298
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:04,750
I-Is it serious?

299
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:07,840
The bone is fine.

300
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:10,230
There's soft tissue contusion
with bruising.

301
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:10,990
That's why

302
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:11,920
this area

303
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,990
is swollen.

304
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,240
So what should we do?

305
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,320
It's not serious.

306
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,050
I'll prescribe some medicine.

307
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,000
Remember,

308
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,680
absolutely no spicy food or seafood.

309
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,560
And this hand,

310
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,850
don't strain it and keep movement minimal.

311
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:24,790
Thank you, doctor.

312
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,720
You're welcome.

313
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:45,800
Let me see.

314
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,800
It's much better.

315
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,800
Did that project fall through?

316
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,110
Don't mention the project.

317
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,590
Who would work with someone like that?

318
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,120
He'll fail sooner or later.

319
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,100
That's true.

320
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,920
Consider it dodging a bullet.

321
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,080
Let's eat.

322
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,080
Let's go.

323
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,110
How is it?

324
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,770
These are all your favorites.

325
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:16,590
It's good.

326
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,590
It's good?

327
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:30,840
What's wrong?

328
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,890
Mr. Qu wants me to attend
a technical conference.

329
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,510
Is it far?

330
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:38,710
Jinshan.

331
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:41,170
That's not too bad.

332
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,990
At least it's still in Shanghai.

333
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,110
Let's eat.

334
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:55,800
By the way,

335
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:56,920
tomorrow,

336
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,390
remember to transfer

337
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,200
the medical expenses to Hu Xiu.

338
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:01,750
I'll ask her tomorrow.

339
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,210
She must be quite busy now.

340
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,320
The dosage and instructions are
clearly stated on the labels.

341
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,440
Make sure to take them on time.

342
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,040
Call me if you need anything.

343
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,990
Get down first.

344
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,440
I'll go park the car.

345
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:16,920
You've been busy all night.

346
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,980
Aren't you hungry?

347
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,200
I... I'm fine.

348
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:27,800
I'm hungry.

349
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,360
Let's go upstairs.

350
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,060
Mr. Xiao,

351
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,230
my cooking skills aren't that great.

352
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,560
You're still better than me with one hand.

353
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:50,710
Well then,

354
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,170
what would you like to eat?

355
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,520
Check the fridge

356
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,750
and see what's there.

357
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,359
What's this?

358
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,569
I don't like taking advantage of others.

359
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,510
So over here, you're figuring out

360
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,160
how to keep live crabs fresh?

361
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:13,680
At least for now,

362
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,020
they seem to be holding up pretty well.

363
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,020
Are they alive?

364
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,160
It might still be alive,

365
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,089
but you nearly smashed it to death.

366
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,230
By the way, Mr. Xiao,

367
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,510
you already got evidence of
Ning Zechen's smuggling.

368
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:39,360
So why didn't you

369
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,160
go straight to the mayor for
a command token

370
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,660
and then enter the election?

371
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,590
Why come to the dance hall instead?

372
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,900
I was planning to give you this watch.

373
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,400
You trusted me

374
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,330
and gave me the smuggling evidence.

375
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:57,510
So of course, I should give you
something in return

376
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,840
to put your mind at ease.

377
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:01,550
That's what mutual trust is about,
isn't it?

378
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,550
You're so smooth-talking now.

00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,010
Where was all this before?

380
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,870
On that day of the site visit,

381
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,550
it wasn't that I didn't trust you.

382
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,880
I didn't trust Zhuling.

00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,710

you were concerned?

389
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,160
Concern for an employee?

390
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,560
You could put it that way.

391
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:43,850

00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,510
can you just wait a little longer?

488
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,950
I'm almost done drawing.

489
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,680
Dad, look at the building I designed.

490
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,280
It's even taller than yours.

491
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,200
Xiaoyi,

492
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,910
your drawing is wonderful.

493
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,440

a real building someday.

494
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:11,960
You will.

495
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,990
So Qin Xiaoyi

496
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,920

497
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,680
Mr. Xiao,

498
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:55,790
I brought you breakfast.

499
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,150
Thank you.

500
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,160
How's your hand?

501
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,400
It doesn't hurt as much anymore,

502
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,000
but it's still a bit swollen.

503
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,070
What's this?

504
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,600
I saw your fridge was almost empty,

505
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:19,400
so I bought some instant meals.

506
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,550
You just need to heat them up,

507
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:23,480
so you don't have to cook yourself.

508
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,270
Let me do it.

509
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:33,400
I'm not completely incapable of
taking care of myself.

510
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,160
Here.

511
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:37,960
Take it.

512
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,030
Thanks.

513
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,200
Mr. Xiao,

514
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,330
I can drive you to the office today.

515
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:48,120
Isn't Xiao He on a business trip
with Ms. Zhou?

516
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,720
I see your hands aren't
in a condition to drive.

517
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,230
Looking at this background,

518
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,960
it's that murder mystery game shop
in the industrial park?

519
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,120
I heard there was a woman

520
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,700
who cheated with an NPC from the shop,

521
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,200
so the man in the video was very angry

522
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,440
and wanted to catch the adulterer.

523
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,680
I heard it was a love triangle.

524
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,990
One of these women is the current partner,

525
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:28,650
and the other is the mistress.

526
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:30,080
Is that for real?

527
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:30,950
That's scary.

528
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,190
You should have seen

529
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,070
that girl called Hu Xiu.

530
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:36,120
She went straight up
and slapped that jerk.

531
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,710
Although she's scared of ghosts,

532
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,840
she sure isn't afraid to charge at people.

533
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,310
The one who's in trouble should be
Qin Xiaoyi from Group A.

534
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:42,990
I think

535
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:45,510
we should call our Second Boss now.

536
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,320
That statue was really heavy.

537
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:50,870
His hand must be
at least slightly injured.

538
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,100
Qin Xiaoyi is injured?

539
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,230
But it shouldn't be too serious.

540
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:56,790
Boss,

541
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:59,290
have you seen the video in the group chat?

542
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,110
I just saw it.

543
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,440
The group is full of the park's regulars.

544
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,750
If this spreads out,

545
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,280
it would be terrible for us.

546
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,270
How about

547
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:09,160
we share the video of the Second Boss
saving someone

548
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:09,750
instead?

549
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,400
Nonsense.

550
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,700
Remember this, all of you.

551
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,980
Stop calling him "Second Boss"
from now on.

552
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,870
Just treat him as Qin Xiaoyi.

553
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:19,440
We'll be acting together again
in the future.

554
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,370
Just be more natural, understand?

555
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,120
Fei.

556
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,710
Obtain the surveillance footage

557
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:28,750
and show it to me.

558
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:34,110
We are definitely not sharing it publicly.

559
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,510
I'm just curious

560
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,800
how he rescued that person.

561
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:38,680
Okay.

562
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,840
Hu Xiu and this girl

563
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,230
went up and beat this guy together?

564
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,640
They don't look like

565
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,570
the current lover or the mistress.

566
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:52,790
Mr. Gong.

567
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,230
People in the group chat

568
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,700
are just spreading rumors.

569
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,360
This girl is

570
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:56,790
Regard Café's

571
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:57,600
Ms. Zhao.

572
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,030
She's childhood friends with Hu Xiu.

573
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,170
I know both of them.

574
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,200
That Ms. Zhao,

575
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,600
isn't she in the group chat?

576
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,660
Why doesn't she come out and explain?

577
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:05,920
Last night,

578
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,920
many other players

579
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,790
came to me complaining about
this Miyazaki guy,

580
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,190
saying he has no manners.

581
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,310
Why don't we help by

582
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,520
saying something in the group chat?

583
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,070
Wait a minute.

584
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:13,550
Hold on.

585
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,960
Since the people involved
haven't come forward,

586
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,820
it's not appropriate for us to discuss
our client's private matters.

587
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,700
He won't come forward.

588
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,250
Why not?

589
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,750
This guy is called Qian Jinxin.

590
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:27,790
He's the new operations manager
of our industrial park.

591
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:30,310
So many things happen in
Shanghai every day.

592
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:32,690
Everyone's attention will shift quickly.

593
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:34,680
I've got to save my dignity somehow,

594
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,550
so that my little shop

595
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,150
can continue to operate peacefully.

596
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,680
Are we still asking for compensation?

597
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,840
Ms. Zhao left her contact information

598
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,260
and said to contact her when convenient.

599
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:41,870
Forget it.

600
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:43,230
It wasn't her fault anyway.

601
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,070
Besides,

602
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:45,640
she looks like someone

603
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,030
you shouldn't mess with.

604
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,400
Why should I cause trouble for myself

605
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,060
over that little bit of money?

606
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:54,710
It's no trouble.

607
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,950
Mr. Gong, let's settle this
strictly by the book.

608
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:04,460
Mr. Xiao,

609
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,270
here's a document

610
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,800
that needs your signature.

611
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:10,990
Mr. Xiao,

612
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:12,520
what happened to your hand?

613
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:14,840
It's nothing. Just a minor injury.

614
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:18,840
Mr. Xiao,

615
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:19,750
your keys.

616
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,840
Keep it with you for now.

617
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:24,040
Until He returns, you're in charge of
ferrying me around.

618
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:26,850
Anything else?

619
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:28,390
No.

620
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,660
Hu Xiu, you bought a car?

621
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:45,830
No.

622
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,530
I found a part-time job

623
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,130
as a private driver.

624
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:49,920
Well then,

625
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,120
be careful out there.

626
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,400
Zhao,

627
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,440
where are you?

628
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,810
Why did you close the shop so early?

629
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,160
Xiu, I'm at home.

630
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,270
Isn't Guangming on a business trip?

631
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,800
Why did you go home so early?

632
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:08,680
I even

633
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,120
brought you your favorite late-night snack

634
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,520
so we could eat together.

635
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,450
Business was just okay today.

636
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,540
I just wanted to take it easy.

637
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,160
Alright.

638
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,510
Get some rest then.

639
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,600
Zhao, I've got something to do.

640
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,530
I'll hang up now.

641
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,820
Aren't you going to invite me in?

642
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,030
Mr. Qian.

643
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,660
please speak your mind.

644
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,640
With you stomping all over the place,

645
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,310
the floor will get dirty,

646
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,900
and I'll have to mop it again.

647
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,160
Ms. Hu, I heard that you

648
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,290
live just upstairs.

649
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:45,980
Who told you that?

650
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:49,370
I happened to pass by a few days ago

651
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,410
and saw the lights on upstairs.

652
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:52,920
So I

653
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,980
checked the industrial park's
entry and exit records.

654
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:58,470
Yes, I live here.

655
00:28:58,490 --> 00:28:59,900
This is my friend's shop.

656
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,550
She signed a contract with
the industrial park

657
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:03,010
and had already paid rent.

658
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,360
I'm just staying here temporarily.

659
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,470
Is there a problem?

660
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:08,030
Tenants cannot use commercial spaces
as residences.

661
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:09,550
That's the industrial park's policy.

662
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,420
Ms. Hu, up until today,

663
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,470
you've been living here for
almost two months, right?

664
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:16,760
If it were just two or three days,

665
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,310
I could pretend not to know.

666
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,920
But two months...

667
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,610
that's a bit difficult to ignore.

668
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,160
What do you want?

669
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:30,160
I'm responsible for managing
this industrial park.

670
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,110
I can't just know about it and
not report it, right?

671
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:34,030
But if I report this...

672
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,960
your friend's shop

673
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,710
might be shut down for violations.

674
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:39,840
However,

675
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:42,880
rules are rigid, but we can be flexible.

676
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,080
Since you now understand your mistake,

677
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,510
if you just join me for dinner and drinks

678
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:48,640
and apologize,

679
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,350
perhaps I

680
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:52,570
could turn a blind eye to this.

681
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:54,160
No need.

682
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,620
I'll move out as soon as possible.

683
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,150
Please leave immediately.

684
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:03,890
If you don't leave,
I'm calling the police.

685
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:18,630
No problem.

686
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,300
Let's proceed with this plan.

687
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,600
The second draft was well coordinated.

688
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,270
Now, the proposal

689
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:24,610
is in its final stages of revision.

690
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:26,140
We can't let our guard down.

691
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:31,840
Is there anything else?

692
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:33,030
Mr. Xiao,

693
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,470
you just said

694
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,160
this plan is now

695
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,960
in its final stages of revision.

696
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:40,400
Doesn't that mean many things

697
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,160
have already been settled?

698
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,470
So we might not need some...

699
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,780
external inspiration to fuel it.

700
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,280
Just say what's on your mind.

701
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,160
Back then,

702
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,960
didn't you move into the lane in search of

703
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,690
inspiration for this project?

704
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,920
So since this project

705
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,600
is coming to an end now,

706
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,080
isn't it about time you moved out?

707
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,160
It hasn't been three months yet.

708
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:06,980
According to the contract,

709
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,700
I can stay as long as I want.

710
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:13,600
Then can I move in and
share the place with you?

711
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:20,200
I have to drive you
to and from work every day,

712
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,290
which has doubled my commute time.

713
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,510
You know very well

714
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:24,840
how my hand got injured.

715
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:27,550
Of course I know, Mr. Xiao.

716
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:30,930
It's my responsibility to drive you
to and from work.

717
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,130
I'm not running away.

718
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:33,990
I'm just wondering if we could

719
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:35,160
make things

720
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:36,070
a little easier.

721
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:36,750
No.

722
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:42,080
Mr. Xiao,

723
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:42,650
goodbye.

724
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:55,970
What are you doing?

725
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,600
As you all know,

726
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,610
we once developed
a social media application

727
00:31:58,610 --> 00:31:59,470
[Software Innovation and Development
Technical Exchange Conference]

728
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:02,400
which generated quite a bit of discussion.

729
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,270
Well,

730
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:05,840
the chain of trust issue in
anonymous social networking

731
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,640
is sometimes like
the Byzantine Generals Problem.

732
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,640
Users need to hide their identities

733
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,480
while also establishing connections.

734
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,240
Therefore,

735
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:15,310
in this iteration we've introduced

736
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,750
the concept of reinforcement learning
with weak ties.

737
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,880
Let's explore this concept together.

738
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,390
Guangming!

739
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,160
Cheng Han.

740
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,490
What are you doing here?

741
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,550
What have you been up to
these past two years?

742
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,960
We haven't heard anything from you.

743
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,100
I'm just getting by.

744
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,360
You're being modest again.

745
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,200
I heard your

746
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,930
entire presentation just now.

747
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,100
So,

748
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,600
when should we organize a class reunion?

749
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,880
I haven't seen you for just two years,

750
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,760
and it feels like

751
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,220
we've grown a bit distant.

752
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:45,710
Sure.

753
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:46,840
By then, let's...

754
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,600
Cheng Han.

755
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:50,790
Senior.

756
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,250
This is Chi Xin.

757
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:56,040
She was in the same major as us
in college.

758
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,910
I remember she was two years behind us,

759
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:00,880
and now she's working at Zhiteng.

760
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:03,600
Chi Xin?

761
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,650
My fault.

762
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,920
We took some general courses together,

763
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,270
didn't we?

764
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:08,750
Yes.

765
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,790
It's been 7 years

766
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,920
since we last met,
which was at your graduation.

767
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,720
It's normal not to recognize me.

768
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,440
Actually, you've become more beautiful,

769
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,310
so it's no wonder

770
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,030
we didn't recognize you.

771
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,120
Senior, since we're from the same major,

772
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,920
how about exchanging contacts?

773
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,700
It's my wife.

774
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:24,790
My wife's calling.

775
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:26,120
You should take it then.

776
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:28,550
Hi, honey.

777
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,010
So, you are at Zhiteng now?

778
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,030
I've been revising my speech

779
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,550
from last night until this morning.

780
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:34,510
Then, I just had to deal with

781
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,020
a bunch of miscellaneous tasks,

782
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,930
so I didn't have time to check my phone.

783
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:38,530
By the way,

784
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,310
I met two college classmates today.

785
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,750
One you know, Cheng Han,

786
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,210
my college roommate,

787
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,580
and a junior female classmate

788
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,580
who seems to be doing quite well now.

789
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,680
It was quite a coincidence, anyway.

790
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:51,370
Mr. Xiao,

791
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,270
I thought

792
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:54,190
it would be Mr. Gong signing it today.

793
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:55,990
He had something urgent come up.

794
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:58,470
Previously, I mentioned to Mr. Gong that

795
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,360
the industrial park wants to

796
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,080
collaborate with the club
on some marketing events.

797
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,710
So when the proposal is ready,

798
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:03,820
I'll send it to you.

799
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:05,840
Just give it directly to Gong Huaicong.

800
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,230
Okay, that works.

801
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,070
No, let me treat you.

802
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:10,150
It's okay, let me have it.

803
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:10,670
No,

804
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,469
Mr. Xiao,

805
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:12,110
you see,

806
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:14,670
our industrial park values the cooperation
with your club.

807
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,360
Since you're willing to renew
for another two years,

808
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,440
it's only fair

809
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,770
that I should treat you.

810
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,760
If the club has any needs in the future,

811
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,690
just let us know.

812
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:23,770
Alright.

813
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,580
Hello,

814
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,000
two Americanos, please.

815
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,719
Mr. Xiao,

816
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:36,080
the club must have quite a few employees.

817
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,340
They don't live on the premises, do they?

818
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:38,830
No,

819
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:41,110
we've arranged dormitories for them.

820
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,130
That's good.

821
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,010
Is there something wrong?

822
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:44,909
Nothing.

823
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:46,590
It's good that you don't have that issue.

824
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:48,190
How's it going? Is the coffee ready?

825
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:48,790
Yes, it is.

826
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:54,630
Ms. Hu,

827
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:55,760
there are some things

828
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,240
I need to tell you in advance.

829
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,590
There are actually quite a few
residential complexes

830
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,760
near our lane.

831
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,550
But the budget you've given

832
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,960
is truly on the low side.

833
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,760
Moreover,

834
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:06,250
since it's for a one-month
short-term rental,

835
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:06,910
it's even harder

836
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:08,570
to negotiate with this price.

837
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,800
I'm aware of all the issues you mentioned,

838
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,110
but I'd still appreciate

839
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,760
if you could keep an eye out for me.

840
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,840
Sure, sure.

841
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,400
That Mr. Xiao who rented
your previous place,

842
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,800
is he still living there?

843
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,640
It's precisely because
he's still renting it

844
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,500
that I need to find another place.

845
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,030
This Mr. Xiao is also quite strange.

846
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,240
I previously introduced him to

847
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,710
that new complex nearby.

848
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:34,440
It even has free parking spaces

849
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,500
available for him.

850
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,200
But he wasn't interested

851
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,240
and insisted on living in some old lane.

852
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,190
At first, he even said

853
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,550
he must find something

854
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,670
near Lane 7, Number 11.

855
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:45,800
Lane 7, Number 11?

856
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:47,590
Isn't that place vacant?

857
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,470
He's not short of money,

858
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:50,030
so why didn't he just rent
that place directly?

859
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,960
That house isn't available for rent.

860
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,560
The owner bought it for
the sake of collecting.

861
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,240
I've heard of property investment,

862
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:59,760
but for collection?

863
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:02,530
That landlord is really wealthy.

864
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:03,840
He even has

865
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:06,080
his own Baidu encyclopedia entry.

866
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,030
This Xie Lin

867
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,960
used to live on Yanhua Road
when he was a child.

868
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,470
Since childhood,

869
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:17,440
he grew up in this lane

870
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,880
with his grandfather.

871
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:19,760
Unfortunately,

872
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,280
when he was in his teens,

873
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,730
his grandfather passed away.

874
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:25,190
He had to go live with his parents
in Shenzhen,

875
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,790
and later went abroad.

876
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,550
This house

877
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:29,370
changed hands many times.

878
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,150
In the end,

879
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:31,590
it was my mentor who made the connection

880
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,320
and helped buy it back.

881
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,340
That makes sense.

882
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,160
No wonder he insisted on living
in this lane.

883
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,930
It was for Xie Lin all along.

884
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,920
So that means we have to wait until

885
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,320
the design competition is over

886
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,150
before moving out?

887
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:43,610
Well...

888
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,030
I'll just have to share the place
with him then.

889
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:49,740
Share?

890
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:55,340
Ms. Zhou?

891
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:56,600
Hu Xiu,

892
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:57,940
check the message I sent you.

893
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:00,070
Send me a copy of all the materials
mentioned there.

894
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:00,920
I'm sorry, Ms. Zhou.

895
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,550
I wasn't

896
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:03,350
looking at my messages just now.

897
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:05,670
I'll send them to you.

898
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:06,470
Just a moment.

899
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:07,920
It's already late.

900
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,470
I'm sorry for disturbing you.

901
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:10,630
I had no choice either.

902
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:13,080
I just received a notification from Lyman
earlier tonight that

903
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,280
the submission deadline has suddenly been
moved up by two days.

904
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:15,840
So I thought

905
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,420
I should quickly confirm these materials.

906
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:17,990
Tomorrow morning,

907
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:19,030
I will work with the team to...

908
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:20,510
Early submission?

909
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:39,540
Mr. Xiao,

910
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,070
what happened to your hand?

911
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:44,280
You received the email, right?

912
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:46,110
The submission deadline has been moved up.

913
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:48,110
I'm worried about our progress now.

914
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:49,800
Can you still draw with your hand?

915
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,800
It's not serious.

916
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,400
After a few more days of recovery,

917
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,600
I'll speed up and get the drawings done.

918
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,400
You should rest properly first.

919
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,540
Don't force yourself to work.

920
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,400
Your hand's recovery is very important.

921
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,510
I'll see if I can

922
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:01,760
transfer a designer from

923
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,400
another project to assist you.

924
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,070
Got it.

925
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:11,760
Mr. Xiao.

926
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:14,590
Come in.

927
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,150
After hearing the revised proposal,

928
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:23,030
I tried to draw
some revised designs myself.

929
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:25,210
Would you mind taking a look?

930
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,370
Mr. Xiao.

931
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,000
I've been thinking all night

932
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,830
about how I can
better fulfill my responsibilities.

933
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:43,870
Since your hand is injured

934
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:46,410
and these revisions are urgent,

935
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,760
if you have any work

936
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,450
that I can help with,

937
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,340
please don't hesitate to tell me.

938
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,400
How did you know

939
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,440
the revisions are urgent?

940
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:55,960
Well...

941
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:59,240
time was already tight to begin with.

942
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,640
So I think

943
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,280
you should reconsider

944
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,740
my suggestion about sharing the apartment.

945
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:11,370
I can help you with the drawings.

946
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:13,660
Working overtime is no problem at all.

947
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,660
While you're injured,

948
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,920
I'll take care of all the housework.

949
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,670
In short,

950
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:20,320
I can completely become
your new right hand.

951
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:27,710
You really want to be roommates
that badly?

952
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,470
The café cannot possibly be
as comfortable as home.

953
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,190
And your work efficiency

954
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:35,150
won't be as high as when you're at home.

955
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:37,030
Whether from a personal perspective,

956
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,550
or from a work perspective,

957
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:40,550
or from your perspective, Mr. Xiao,

958
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,110
sharing an apartment is a great choice.

959
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:49,920
Fine.

960
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:51,470
Move back as soon as possible.

961
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:52,870
We have a lot of work to do.

962
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:57,880
Just like that?

963
00:39:58,860 --> 00:39:59,740
What else?

964
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:10,960
Coming.

965
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:18,160
Why are you here?

966
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:20,070
I heard you hurt your hand.

967
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,270
I came to check on you.

968
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,150
Are you okay?

969
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,640
It's nothing.

970
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,800
You...

971
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,200
You're so tight-lipped.

972
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:29,390
Not a single word about your injury.

973
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,690
I couldn't hide it from you
even if I tried my best.

974
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,360
Why are you hiding

975
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,890
this heroic rescue from me?

976
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,070
You're sweating so much,

977
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:37,960
yet still talking non-stop.

978
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,360
Drink this to rehydrate.

979
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:40,720
Oh right,

980
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,400
try this

981
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,030
medicinal patch later.

982
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:43,230
I heard it works well.

983
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:46,880
By the way,

984
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,590
if you don't have anything important,

985
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:51,030
stop coming over so often.

986
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:52,560
Just giving you a heads-up.

987
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:53,960
Why?

988
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,330
The landlord moved back in.

989
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,190
So are you moving out?

990
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,240
Your hand is still injured.

991
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,320
How can you move now?

992
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,190
I'm not moving.

993
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,580
We're sharing.

994
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,220
Sharing?

995
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:11,880
I'm really

996
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,440
seeing Hu Xiu in a new light.

997
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:15,990
No wonder

998
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:18,990
someone started buying
grapefruit-flavored water.

999
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,250
It's pretty impressive that she managed
to convince you

1000
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,510
to share an apartment.

1001
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:25,190
Could she be

1002
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:27,280
coming back just to repay you?

1003
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:31,120
She actually put on quite a show in front of me.

1004
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:36,670
Has her friend's café

1005
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:38,070
had any problems lately?

1006
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:41,130
It's operating normally.

1007
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:42,280
However,

1008
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,030
that video of them disciplining someone

1009
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:45,240
during the murder mystery game

1010
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,680
has spread throughout the industrial park.

1011
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,280
It must have had some impact.

1012
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:50,260
Go check for me

1013
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,550
if anything else has happened.
