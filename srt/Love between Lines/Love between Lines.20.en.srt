[Episode 20]

3
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:58,840
Fei,

4
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,240
I need to make a promo.

5
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:03,560
Go through the in-house CCTV
from the past few days

6
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,280
and send it to me.

7
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,880
I'll pick the footage I need.

8
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,240
I didn't know you could edit videos.

9
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,820
Of course I can.

10
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,750
You can never have too many skills.

11
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,870
Let me tell you,

12
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,680
I'm no master at anything big,

13
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,680
but when it comes to small stuff,

14
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,410
I'm pretty good at many things.

15
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,160
What else can you do?

16
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,570
Chasing girls.

17
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,470
Wait. What's that reaction?

18
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,710
You don't believe me?

19
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:35,510
I believe you.

20
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,360
I do.

21
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,190
Of course I do.

22
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,630
Let me tell you something.

23
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,280
You've played
my murder mystery games, right?

24
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,150
All the love and romance storylines
in them

25
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,280
were designed by me.

26
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:45,040
And what are they based on?

27
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,360
My own experience.

28
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,510
Well, I can't compare to you.

29
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,280
You've got plenty of dating experience.

30
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,079
So tell me,

31
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,840
do my Xiu and Xiao Zhiyu

32
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,960
have a chance?

33
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,840
Those two?

34
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,390
They won't work out.

35
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:10,530
Why?

36
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,020
Look.

37
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,520
They

38
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,130
met through a murder mystery game,

39
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,630
live together as roommates,

40
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,630
and on top of that,
one is the other's employer.

41
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,150
Doesn't that sound like fate?

42
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:20,680
Well,

43
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,590
you can rest assured.

44
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,680
This kind of relationship

45
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,150
is the least likely to work.

46
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:24,960
Besides,

47
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,190
if there was really something
between them,

48
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,590
wouldn't I have noticed?

49
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,030
Really?

50
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,310
Of course.

51
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:32,310
Boss.

52
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,510
I want to show you something.

53
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,520
I asked you
to sort through surveillance footage,

54
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,710
what is this you're showing me?

55
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:40,280
Boss,

56
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,910
you missed the point.

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What's the point?

58
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:43,950
Look again.

59
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,570
Look more carefully.

60
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:52,450
-Damn!
-Damn!

61
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,730
The living room's been cleaned?

62
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:05,930
It's quite spacious.

63
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,370
Everything's been moved to the attic.

64
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,630
You moved quite fast.

65
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,450
I wasn't gone for long.

66
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,120
Someone left

67
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,190
so decisively.

68
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,980
If I hadn't turned it into a storage room,

69
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:22,550
I'd see you in it every time.

70
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,310
No need to do that anymore.

71
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,190
I'm going to get changed.

72
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,590
Let's get ready to go out.

73
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,260
There's still time
before the movie starts.

74
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,190
It's broad daylight.

75
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,440
I...

76
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,760
Zhao, stop pacing around.

77
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,300
Just... just sit down.

78
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,180
Let me tell you.

79
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,830
I'm not sitting down.

80
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,250
This is a crime scene.

81
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,480
What are you talking—

82
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,120
Hurry.

83
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,510
It's really a misunderstanding.

84
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,159
Sit down.

85
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,620
Let me tell you.

86
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:57,630
This is just a misunderstanding.

87
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,800
I was combing my hair just now

88
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,680
and it got tangled,

89
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,720
so he was helping me.

90
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,040
Then you walked in.

91
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,000
I panicked,

92
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,560
stood up,

93
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,240
tugged my hair,

94
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,190
and fell over.

95
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,880
Look, I even bent the comb.

96
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,430
Stop changing the subject.

97
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,480
I can't believe it.

98
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,600
You actually gave our club

99
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,360
a juicy scandal

100
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,420
while being so quiet this whole time.

101
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,750
Why are you looking at me?

102
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,990
As the owner,

103
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,480
you abused your position

104
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,160
to flirt with a customer.

105
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,440
The impact is terrible.

106
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,630
Aren't you setting a bad example
by breaking company rules?

107
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,190
That makes it even worse.

108
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,000
Keep your voice down.

109
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,920
The walls are thin here.

110
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,120
I'm saying it anyway.

111
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,850
So you two got together

112
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:37,510
back on that day when we were
playing the murder mystery game?

113
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,600
Then why do you pretend
you don't know each other in front of me?

114
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,310
I thought you two were really at odds.

115
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,840
It makes me look like a fool.

116
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,000
So?

117
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:44,750
So,

118
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,150
perform in 10 more games,

119
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:48,010
and then we can put this behind us.

120
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,850
Tell me quickly,

121
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,970
when did you two get together?

122
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,510
Well...

123
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,600
We made it official today.

124
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,180
Today is the first day.

125
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,120
I knew it.

126
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,750
You two were acting weird
in the shop yesterday.

127
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,610
That's when we just got together.

128
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,090
Alright.

129
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,670
I know you're quite busy.

130
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,400
Just do five more games.

131
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,070
Xiao Zhiyu.

132
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,830
If I hadn't stepped in today

133
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:24,510
and saved the day in time,

134
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,870
who knows
how many people would have seen it?

135
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:26,720
Do you even realize that?

136
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,240
Fine.

137
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,000
Fine?

138
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,510
Are you done?

139
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,360
Not yet.

140
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:36,880
You chased him?

141
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,950
How did you win her over?

142
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,720
Come on.

143
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,040
We've known each other for so long.

144
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,390
So many girls chased you,

145
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,610
but you never showed any interest.

146
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:51,960
So...

147
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,800
What's so special about Hu Xiu?

148
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,600
Who was it that

149
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,510
came to me all pitiful before, saying,

150
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:59,040
"someone wanted to draw a clear line
with me"?

151
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,760
No need to be shy.

152
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,650
I support you.

153
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:02,690
Go get him!

154
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:05,430
Keep your voice down!

155
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,760
The walls are thin here.

156
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,000
Tell me quickly,

157
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,330
how did she win you over?

158
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,850
Who said she chased me?

159
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,570
Well, we just got together.

160
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,840
I haven't even processed it myself yet.

161
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,600
And aren't you busy with the café?

162
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,520
I just thought

163
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:31,200
I'd tell you once things were more stable.

164
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:45,960
Zhao?

165
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,840
Zhao.

166
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:47,910
Zhao!

167
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,720
Zhao!

168
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,650
Zhao, why are you suddenly
packing your things?

169
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,260
Well,

170
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:59,030
I don't want to be a third wheel here.

171
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,390
I'll make space for you lovebirds.

172
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,550
Zhao, I'm not someone
who ditches friends for romance.

173
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,440
Please stay.

174
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,290
I...

175
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,300
I'm just kidding.

176
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,310
Wang Guangming moved out.

177
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,410
I was planning to move back anyway.

178
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,480
Really?

179
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:18,550
Really.

180
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,440
Why would I lie to you?

181
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,360
If I move back home,

182
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,870
I'll be closer to the shop.

183
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,540
That way I can get a little more sleep.

184
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:27,910
Help me open this.

185
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,130
You're not lying to me, are you?

186
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,370
I'm not lying.

187
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,470
Gong Huaicong.

188
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,440
We should go now.

189
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,800
We still have a bunch of stuff to handle
for the co-branded event.

190
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,230
Why the rush?
Let's have dinner before you go.

191
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,140
We're not eating.

192
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,490
Hu Xiu was right.

193
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,600
Let's have dinner together.

194
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,630
My treat.

195
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,390
Let's celebrate, right?

196
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,030
Another day.

197
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:50,750
Not now.

198
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,600
Well...

199
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,480
w-we'll be going now.

200
00:09:59,340 --> 00:09:59,950
Bye.

201
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:03,590
Keep going.

202
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,960
Well, we should keep a low profile

203
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,070
from now on,

204
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:18,320
especially around people at the company.

205
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,120
Otherwise they'll just gossip.

206
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,760
Got it.

207
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,640
What's wrong?

208
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,850
The movie is about to start.

209
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,670
We can just get the next showing.

210
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,640
Let's not go out today.

211
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,390
Why?

212
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,700
We still have something to do.

213
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,310
Wh-What thing?

214
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,550
You tell me.

215
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:21,700
Wait for me.

216
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,860
Didn't I just tell you on the phone

217
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,720
that I have a lot of ideas
I want to discuss with you?

218
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,270
I used to think that the essence

219
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,910
of flowing space lies
in the principle of "less is more"

220
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:46,960
and in having a simple structure.

221
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,530
However,

222
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,360
look at this drawing.

223
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,000
This music hall draft.

224
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,200
It uses a lot of grids as partitions.

225
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,270
Although intricate,

226
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,000
the creation

227
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,520
of flowing space is extremely subtle.

228
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,830
It was seeing this drawing
that reminded me

229
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,200
that many Chinese buildings

230
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,470
use screens

231
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,150
and lattices to divide space.

232
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,000
Actually,

233
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,910
it's another way to create flowing space.

234
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:10,940
Although intricate,

235
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,620
the divisions don't block continuity.

236
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,640
This is the difference
in architectural philosophy

237
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,170
between China and the West.

238
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,470
You like his design?

239
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,720
Of course.

240
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,960
The signature is Q.

241
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,940
I wonder which master it is.

242
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,270
He's a senior figure

243
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,320
who's been out of the industry
for over 20 years.

244
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,580
A design from more than 20 years ago
can be this impressive?

245
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,970
That's remarkable.

246
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,800
This architect's technique

247
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,480
is very mature,

248
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,450
yet it doesn't feel cold at all.

249
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,230
It's actually quite gentle,

250
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:57,670
with the inclusiveness and refinement
of traditional Chinese architecture.

251
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,030
People often say

252
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,610
architecture is a mirror

253
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,430
that reflects the designer's inner world.

254
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:06,760
I think he
must be like that as a person too.

255
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,480
He was.

256
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:21,630
Look.

257
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,450
This space uses a lot of acoustic systems.

258
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,090
The wooden lattices

259
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:29,260
help absorb sound more effectively.

260
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,360
With some sound absorbing materials,

261
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,470
the whole space...

262
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,630
When we have time,

263
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,600
I'll tell you more

264
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,330
about this architect's story.

265
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,610
You fell asleep?

266
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:38,950
Come on.

267
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:42,790
Come on.

268
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,530
Let's go.

269
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:10,119
You can breathe now.

270
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:11,520
Don't hold it in too long.

271
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:44,750
He made a move.

272
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:57,590
Uncle Xu,

273
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,380
what's the situation now?

274
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,550
Exactly as you predicted.

275
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,750
You pressured Forma Group

276
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,520
to provide information
on all their suppliers.

277
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:07,560
A few days later,

278
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,550
Forma terminated its contract
with one factory.

279
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,490
Xinde Building Materials.

280
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,440
That company

281
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,590
wasn't in the supplier information

282
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,250
Forma later provided, right?

283
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,380
No.

284
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,720
Looks like Pei Kanghua

285
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:28,110
really does have something to hide.

286
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,790
Qin Yuze's case is already settled.

287
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,840
Who gave you the nerve

288
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,510
to smear me?

289
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,510
No, I...

290
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:47,750
I...

291
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,320
Don't be nervous.

292
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,270
I know you came to me

293
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:55,810
just to

294
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,240
make a living.

295
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,270
As long as you can keep your mouth shut,

296
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:01,750
I

297
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,250
don't mind having one more person to feed.

298
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,570
Thank you, Mr. Pei.

299
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,440
Rest assured.

300
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:11,050
I promise

301
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,340
everything I just said

302
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,880
will stay with me to the grave.

303
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,710
That's good.

304
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,080
Mom.

305
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,080
Wanyue.

306
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,440
Kanghua.

307
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:43,590
Don't worry about tomorrow's follow-up.

308
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,790
I've arranged the best doctors for you.

309
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,240
If you want to recover,

310
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,070
you have to stay in a good mood.

311
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:51,830
Without you,

312
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,580
I really wouldn't know what to do.

313
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:15,570
Zhiyu,

314
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,460
back then, to protect your mom,

315
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,350
you took everything on by yourself.

316
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,930
It must have been so hard for you.

317
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:24,830
Uncle Xu,

318
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:26,180
let's not mention that.

319
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,510
I know

320
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,530
the show you're putting on

321
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,650
with Forma,

322
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,690
demanding to see
all the supplier information,

323
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,290
is just to force

324
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,410
Pei Kanghua to take action.

325
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,240
Pei Kanghua is wary of me.

326
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,400
He won't let me get near

327
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,930
the insider from back then.

328
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:48,300
Uncle Xu,

329
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:50,170
the owner of Xinde Building Materials

330
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:51,900
could very well be that person.

331
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,570
After all these years,

332
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,860
we finally have some clues.

333
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,650
I know you can't wait,

334
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,340
but we can't alert them just yet.

335
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,440
All of this

336
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,130
is still just your suspicion.

337
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,510
As for whether this current owner

338
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,370
is the same person from back then,

339
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,400
we need to verify it secretly.

340
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,200
You shouldn't

341
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,160
get directly involved

342
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,070
in this.

343
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,790
I'll let you know

344
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:22,010
any new developments immediately.

345
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,480
Thank you for your help, Uncle.

346
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,440
Zhiyu,

347
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,070
this move of yours

348
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,720
was brilliant.

349
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,130
At a time like this,

350
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:34,350
we must act steadily.

351
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,670
Since we've already endured so many years,

352
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:39,270
a few more days won't matter.

353
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:58,240
[I wish Xiaoyi could be happy every day]

354
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,590
This signature is Q.

355
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:02,750
I wonder which master it is.

356
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:39,330
Dad,

357
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,590
this should be over soon, right?

358
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,470
Get in.

359
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:23,880
I'm sorry.

360
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,510
I was so tired yesterday.

361
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:27,310
I didn't even know when you left.

362
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,560
Is that so?

363
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,480
You could wake me up next time.

364
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:36,710
Got it.

365
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,750
You came specifically to pick me up?

366
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,270
From your place,

367
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:45,110
it's a bit out of the way,
isn't it?

368
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:45,910
It's raining.

369
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,480
I was afraid you couldn't get a cab.

370
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,110
Besides,

371
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,860
isn't it perfectly natural for a boyfriend

372
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,660
to drive his girlfriend to work?

373
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,110
Well then,

374
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,110
I won't be polite,

375
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,200
my boyfriend.

376
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:03,000
Stop!

377
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,160
I'll get off here.

378
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,110
It's still 7 or 8 minutes to the office.

379
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,750
It's fine.

380
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,410
It's safer if we enter the office

381
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:13,140
separately.

382
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,160
Forget it.

383
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,350
It's raining heavily.

384
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:18,200
I'll take you to the studio entrance.

385
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,640
I have an umbrella.

386
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,370
And didn't we agree yesterday

387
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,030
that at work

388
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,130
we have to keep a low profile

389
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,390
and not give people gossip to talk about?

390
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,200
Mr. Xiao.

391
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,310
Hu Xiu?

392
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:43,960
How do we explain this?

393
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,550
Mr. Xiao.

394
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,040
Should we say we were running an errand?

395
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,440
Who runs errands
this early in the morning?

396
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:49,550
Hu Xiu.

397
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,200
Good morning.

398
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:54,020
Morning.

399
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,720
Hu Xiu, you're so lucky.

400
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,450
You got a ride in Mr. Xiao's car.

401
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,510
Yeah.

402
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,790
You're just so lucky.

403
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,110
We couldn't get a cab

404
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,030
and had to take the subway.

405
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,160
Look at my pant legs—

406
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,880
completely soaked.

407
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,790
G-Get in the car, both of you.

408
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:14,160
Yes, get in.

409
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,350
I feel so awkward

410
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,510
taking Mr. Xiao's car alone.

411
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:17,840
Let's take it together.

412
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:18,840
Well...

413
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:19,880
thank you, Mr. Xiao.

414
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,570
Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

415
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:21,480
Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

416
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:21,790
Hurry up.

417
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:22,850
Roll up the window.

418
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:38,140
Mr. Xiao,

419
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:40,700
the curved form is quite striking,

420
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,400
but the construction difficulty
is a bit high.

421
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,720
Let's try this approach.

422
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:13,790
Mrs. Xiao,

423
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,880
you're making soup for my dad again?

424
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,070
It's for Zhiyu.

425
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,550
When I saw him on his birthday,

426
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,030
he seemed even thinner.

427
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,270
He's probably busy with work

428
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,670
and not eating properly.

429
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,160
We haven't lived together all these years,

430
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:29,630
and our contact has always been affected
by the time difference.

431
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,430
I haven't shown him enough care.

432
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,400
He'll definitely appreciate

433
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,510
the soup you made.

434
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,070
Yes.

435
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,020
It's almost lunch time.

436
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,680
Perfect timing to deliver it.

437
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,200
Let me take you there.

438
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,920
I've been having meetings
at his company lately anyway.

439
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,740
I'm familiar with it.

440
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,200
Wait for me.

441
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,330
I'll go get changed.

442
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:03,920
Zhen,

443
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:06,160
you know your father's temper.

444
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,000
He's used to being in charge,

445
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,060
and his words can be harsh sometimes.

446
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,730
Don't take it too seriously.

447
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,550
As parents,

448
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:19,040
we can't help

449
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:21,110
but meddle in our children's lives,

450
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:23,350
always trying to

451
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,990
pave a path for them

452
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,530
that we believe is right.

453
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:28,640
Remember,

454
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:31,670
I laid out these stepping stones for you.

455
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,680
If there really comes a day
when the building collapses,

456
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,240
you won't escape either.

457
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:37,830
If

458
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,520
you really like that girl,

459
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,530
don't be discouraged.

460
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,970
I'll talk to Kanghua for you.

461
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,840
External conditions

462
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:46,930
are secondary.

463
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,080
What matters most is your own feelings.

464
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,580
Thank you, Mrs. Xiao.

465
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:58,480
Zhen, you haven't eaten?

466
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,730
I ate before I left home.

467
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,920
Well, what's this for?

468
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,110
It's for a friend.

469
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,650
Here's your order.

470
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,310
Thank you.

471
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,960
All the food we ordered has arrived?

472
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,410
I'll help you carry it over.

473
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:26,920
It's okay.

474
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,790
I can manage.

475
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,960
I could use the exercise anyway.

476
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,030
Hello.

477
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,680
How may I help you?

478
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,200
I'm here to see Zhi—

479
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,560
Mr. Xiao.

480
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,110
Alright. Please wait a moment.

481
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,510
I'll go confirm with him.

482
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:52,840
Mr. Xiao,

483
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,110
there's a lady at the reception

484
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:55,770
who says she's here to see you.

485
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,270
Okay.

486
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:02,880
Please follow me.

487
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,720
I'll take you to Mr. Xiao's office.

488
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,320
Thank you.

489
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:19,400
Mr. Pei.

490
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:21,350
Hu Xiu,

491
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:23,600
could you come out for a moment?

492
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,550
Mr. Xiao's mother

493
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:45,310
brought some nourishing soup for him.

494
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,510
I gave her a ride here.

495
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,000
I see.

496
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,550
I don't have any business matters
to discuss today,

497
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:53,640
so I'm not going in.

498
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,110
It's almost noon.

499
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:56,970
Have you eaten?

500
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,070
Not yet.

501
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,230
Perfect timing then.

502
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,500
This was made by our house helper.

503
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,180
Try some.

504
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,110
Thank you.

505
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,090
Our studio has group lunch orders.

506
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:22,580
I don't mean anything else.

507
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,070
This is to thank you

508
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:26,870
for the bandage the other day.

509
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,960
A one-yuan bandage

510
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,800
for a luxurious lunch from Mr. Pei?

511
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,060
Sounds like I'm getting the better deal.

512
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,020
That bandage meant more

513
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,770
than just one yuan to me.

514
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:51,160
So could you do me

515
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,680
this small favor?

516
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:54,790
A favor?

517
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,350
It took our helper a lot of effort

518
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,550
to make me this lunch.

519
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,210
But I've already eaten.

520
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,160
If you could help me eat some,

521
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,090
it counts as doing me a small favor.

522
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:04,930
Is that okay?

523
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:13,040
Well, thank you very much, Mr. Pei.

524
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:14,760
If there's nothing else,

525
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,560
I'll head back to the office now.

526
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:17,270
Bye.

527
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:50,070
Chopsticks.

528
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:50,590
Give me one pair.

529
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:51,030
Here.

530
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:51,750
Here.

531
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:53,440
Hu Xiu,

532
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,750
who was so thoughtful

533
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,000
as to bring you a lunch with love?

534
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,980
Something's going on.

535
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,160
Don't overthink it.

536
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,160
This isn't just for me.

537
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,350
It's for everyone to share.

538
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,270
Just some homemade...

539
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:14,960
dishes.

540
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:17,440
These aren't just homemade dishes.

541
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,480
They must be from
a luxury private dining chef.

542
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,030
Yes.

543
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:20,640
Hu Xiu,

544
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,480
who exactly is this mysterious person

545
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,400
that brought lunch to you?

546
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:23,880
Who is it?

547
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,160
Who is it?

548
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,680
Tell us.

549
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,750
Eat up.

550
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,200
Everyone, try some.

551
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,670
The plating is so exquisite.

552
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:38,220
I don't even want to ruin it.

553
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:40,590
Mr. Xiao,

554
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,340
I was trying to take a photo.

555
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:46,720
How is it?

556
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,160
Mr. Xiao, is it good?

557
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,360
Not bad.

558
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,100
Let me try it too.

559
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,030
Let's all try some.

560
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,110
Me too.

561
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,420
Aren't you going to try it?

562
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:13,570
I just like our regular boxed meals here.

563
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,550
Great.

564
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:18,850
If you like it,

565
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:20,530
we can order it for dinner too.

566
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,640
Mr. Xiao,

567
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,660
are we ordering dinner tonight?

568
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,160
I was talking to Hu Xiu.

569
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:34,680
After all...

570
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,830
tonight

571
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,360
she has to work overtime again.

572
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,320
Overtime?

573
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:40,660
Overtime?

574
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:42,160
Mr. Xiao,

575
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:43,030
what's the task?

576
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:43,960
Don't work hard by yourselves.

577
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,290
I can work overtime too.

578
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:47,100
It's none of your business.

579
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:53,340
As long as I don't have to work overtime.

580
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,170
It's a special task just for you?

581
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:03,300
Then we probably
don't need to work overtime, right?

582
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:08,969
Time to go home.

583
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:09,630
Bye-bye.

584
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,480
I'm leaving now.

585
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,010
Bye-bye.

586
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,540
You finished your meeting with Mr. Xiao?

587
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:15,560
Want to leave together?

588
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,000
No, wait.

589
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,110
You still have to work overtime, right?

590
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:18,650
I'm just curious

591
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:19,300
why you...

592
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,440
What are you even working overtime on?

593
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,570
Is there really that much work lately?

594
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,030
Or...

595
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,100
did you offend Mr. Xiao again?

596
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:31,320
Kind of.

597
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:36,320
Good luck.

598
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:39,159
Good luck.

599
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:45,310
Hang in there.

600
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,030
I will.

601
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:15,590
If you want to kiss me,
then kiss me already.

602
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:28,390
You're pretending to be asleep?

603
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,670
This is called

604
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,160
"luring you into a trap."

605
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:33,530
I learned it from you.

606
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,070
Last night,

607
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,060
someone wasn't strong enough

608
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,510
and threw me off.

609
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,880
I was afraid if I opened my eyes,

610
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,940
he'd feel awkward.

611
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,550
Not strong enough?

612
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,130
Was that the reason?

613
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,150
Makes sense.

614
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,760
After all, no one lines up
to bring me food,

615
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,420
so it's normal
that my hands aren't very strong.

616
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,000
I hit the mark,

617
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,730
so you're trying to silence me?

618
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,370
When I went to Forma,

619
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:24,710
I just happened

620
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,570
to help Mr. Pei with a small favor.

621
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,590
He wanted to thank me.

622
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:30,320
I couldn't really turn him down,

623
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:30,800
right?

624
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,480
Is that so?

625
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,190
Besides,

626
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,840
who knows my taste better than you?

627
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:43,480
I'm

628
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,150
not a good cook,

629
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,630
but I am a good foodie.

630
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,840
I can still tell the difference

631
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,300
between different foods.

632
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,010
That's more like it.

633
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,480
Pei Zhen came with my mother.

634
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:22,840
I know.

635
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,980
My mom showed up too suddenly.

636
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,040
I wasn't prepared,

637
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,880
so I didn't introduce you to her.

638
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,320
Next time there's a chance,

639
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,980
I'll introduce you properly.

640
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:37,590
You need to prepare

641
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,070
to see your own mom?

642
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,760
We...

643
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,680
haven't lived together for a long time.

644
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,090
So when she came to see you,

645
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:54,950
were you happy?

646
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:04,510
I...

647
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,350
was, I guess.

648
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,070
Then all the more you shouldn't hide

649
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,400
what you really feel.

650
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,110
That way people know

651
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:14,320
what you like,

652
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,230
what you expect,

653
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,230
and what you want.

654
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:21,080
As long as the other person cares too,

655
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,730
a relationship
can be rebuilt very quickly.
