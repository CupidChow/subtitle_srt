[Love Between Lines]

2
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,750
[Episode 23]

3
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,259
That's all I know.

4
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,680
Have you ever met that girl?

5
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,630
Who exactly is she?

6
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,630
She was Xiao's neighbor back then.

7
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,410
How would I have met her?

8
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,010
But you know,

9
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,710
anyone who could be neighbors
with the Pei family

10
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,840
must have come from a well-off family.

11
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,150
I heard from Xiao's mother

12
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,120
that they went to the same school before.

13
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,250
They got along well.

14
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,079
You don't know this,

15
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,000
but when Xiao was in America,

16
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,920
his temper was even worse than it is now.

17
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,650
So that girl must have
a pretty good personality.

18
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,240
But no matter how good her personality is,

19
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,750
she can't be as...

20
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,950
approachable as our Hu Xiu.

21
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,010
Was your Chinese taught by a gym teacher?

22
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,610
My Chinese is indeed not very good.

23
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,900
I haven't even drunk it yet.

24
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,520
No wonder you're single.

25
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,190
You two

26
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,150
are already together now.

27
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,390
It's already set in stone.

28
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,070
No matter how his mom tries to
set them up, it's useless,

29
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,630
right?

30
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,840
I've added an extra espresso shot for you.

31
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,300
Sober up before you speak.

32
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,630
I am perfectly sober.

33
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,440
And I'm not talking nonsense.

34
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,520
When he was in school,

35
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,750
he never listened to his mom.

36
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,220
So there's even less to worry about now,

37
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:14,690
right?

38
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,450
How about this?

39
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,840
If you're really that uneasy,

40
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,100
just call him and ask him
to come over now.

41
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,800
But please don't rat me out.

42
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,210
He sent me a message this morning

43
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,750
saying he had something to do tonight

44
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,280
and needed to meet someone.

45
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,720
What do you think, Xiu?

46
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:55,910
About what?

47
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,240
That girl.

48
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,000
Nothing.

49
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,150
I think

50
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,500
you should just ask Xiao Zhiyu directly.

51
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,630
It's not a big deal.

52
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,070
It's just a family dinner.

53
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,600
Why would I ask him about it?

54
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,080
Fine, fine,

55
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,750
you don't care.

56
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,360
But can you stop causing me trouble?

57
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:17,920
You mixed them up.

58
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,380
This kind goes in this jar.

59
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,200
Finding some peace and quiet here?

60
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,150
Sit.

61
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,480
Since you're already here,

62
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,900
why don't you go up and sit for a while?

63
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,830
My parents are waiting to meet you.

64
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,190
I'm not used to these kinds of gatherings.

65
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,390
Please send my regards to your parents.

66
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,820
I came this time

67
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,130
to say hello to you.

68
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,170
Congratulations on your engagement.

69
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,690
They're beautiful.

70
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,300
Limited edition, right?

71
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:43,920
I prepared the gift

72
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,850
before you even returned to China.

73
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,510
After all, I knew about your engagement

74
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,110
even before your family did.

75
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,680
I was just so excited

76
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,880
that I couldn't help telling you first.

77
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,270
This trip back

78
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,430
is mainly to greet

79
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,159
my relatives and friends here.

80
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,280
By the way,

81
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,410
your mom was quite shocked
when she heard about

82
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,370
my engagement.

83
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,890
During my school years,

84
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,980
I rarely went home.

85
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,510
Thank you for keeping her company
so often.

86
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,510
Don't mention it.

87
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,400
She took good care of me too.

88
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,510
I'm sorry.

89
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,360
Miss, let me handle it.

90
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:25,750
I'm sorry.

91
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,390
Let me. Let me handle it.

92
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,160
Are you alright, miss?

93
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,750
I'm fine.

94
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,190
What's wrong?

95
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,600
Nothing.

96
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,000
What are they talking about?

97
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,530
They're really engrossed.

98
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,730
Hello, miss.

99
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,380
Is there anything I can help you with?

100
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,140
I-I don't need help. Thank you.

101
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,480
Sorry.

102
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,680
I'll be leaving soon.

103
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,390
Mr. Pei.

104
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:56,530
What a coincidence.

105
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:57,460
You're here too.

106
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,190
I...

107
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,270
You're here to see Xiao Zhiyu, aren't you?

108
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,720
It's Saturday.

109
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,060
You're not here

110
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,080
to discuss work with him, are you?

111
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,070
Mr. Pei, I have some matters to attend to.

112
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,130
I should get going.

113
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,120
Ms. Hu!

114
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,320
Tell me,

115
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,360
what exactly is your relationship

116
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,440
with Xiao Zhiyu?

117
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,900
She's my girlfriend.

118
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,730
You two...

119
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,670
Girlfriend?

120
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:17,510
Pei Zhen,

121
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,490
you're late.

122
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:21,430
When you get up here,
you owe us three drinks.

123
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,920
You should go upstairs now.

124
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,480
Your father is waiting for you up there.

125
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,440
Enjoy your dinner.

126
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,520
We'll be going now.

127
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,870
Let's go up.

128
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,720
This isn't the way home.

129
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,240
Let's drive around for a while.

130
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,770
It'll make you feel better.

131
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,290
I want to go home.

132
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,270
Pull over!

133
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,360
Pull over.

134
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,600
Pull over!

135
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,810
Are you cursing me in your mind?

136
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,480
You...

137
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,110
Xiao Zhiyu!

138
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,630
Put me down.

139
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,480
P-Put me down...

140
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,200
Put me down.

141
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:17,230
What...

142
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,090
What are you doing?

143
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,900
Don't move around.

144
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,570
Let's talk.

145
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:23,170
Come on.

146
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,740
That girl...

147
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,330
is the daughter of a former neighbor.

148
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,940
We've known each other for years.

149
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,270
She got engaged before coming back.

150
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,550
I came to see her this time

151
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,550
just to give her an engagement gift.

152
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:49,480
She's...

153
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,200
engaged?

154
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,600
Don't be mad anymore.

155
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,120
Who says I'm mad?

156
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,830
Then...

157
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,980
don't be jealous anymore.

158
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,910
Don't flatter yourself.

159
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,240
Stop being so smug.

160
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,200
Y-You're still smiling?

161
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,400
I'll stop, I'll stop.

162
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:19,810
Oh, right.

163
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,960
A peace offering.

164
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,390
Their tickets were sold out ages ago.

165
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,520
How did you get them?

166
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,800
I have my ways.

167
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:41,380
It's...

168
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,730
It's not that big a deal anyway.

169
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,410
Not mad anymore?

170
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,360
I'm alright.

171
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:51,910

191
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,670
Mr. Pei.

192
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,370
It's your family dinner tonight.

193
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,800
Why did you drink so much?

194
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,080
Why are you here?

195
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,550
To see my dad?

196
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,960
Come on, let me take you home first.

197
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,030
Don't touch me!

198
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,840
I can walk by myself.

199
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,030
Mr. Pei!

200
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,690
I'm not going home.

201
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,650
Where do you want to go?

202
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,550
Hu Xiu.

203
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,240
Are you there?

204
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,510
Hu Xiu.

205
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,570
Hu Xiu, could you please open the door?

206
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:50,840
Hu Xiu!

207
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,890
Who's out there?

208
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:54,730
You woke us up!

209
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,890
Sorry to bother you.

210
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:05,380
I'm just here to borrow a Band-Aid.

211
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:08,030
There's a pharmacy downstairs to the left.

212
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,220
Stop making noise.

213
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:26,730
Why?

214
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,100
Why did it have to be him?

215
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:59,550
[CFO Shen Jie]

216
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,470
The light hits it

217
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,950
and reflects directly off something—

218
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,990
almost like a paper-thin film.

219
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,110
Yes, basically...

220
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:23,440
I never thought a company as big as Forma

221
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,750
would cook the books.

222
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,110
Yeah.

223
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,160
This hasn't been officially announced yet.

224
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,020
Let's wait for the final verdict.

225
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:36,720
Don't stress.

226
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,260
Have something sweet.

227
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:43,210
No wonder the cooperation
has been progressing so slowly.

228
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,740
Even Mr. Xie came in person.

229
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:50,660
This project won't fall through, will it?

230
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,060
Someone reported

231
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,400
our falsified financial reports to Lyman.

232
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,310
According to the procedure,

233
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,160
after verifying

234
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,750
the authenticity of the report,

235
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,200
they'll report it
to regulatory authorities

236
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,330
for investigation.

237
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,430
This is our first violation,

238
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,060
and we've also covered

239
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,280
some of the funding gaps.

240
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,940
Let's wait and see how it goes.

241
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,860
Director Shen.

242
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,760
Not many people know about
the company's financials.

243
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,720
Go find out

244
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,160
who reported us.

245
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:21,350
Okay,

246
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,160
I'm on it.

247
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,510
Mr. Pei.

248
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,110
We just

249
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,050
received a written notice from Lyman.

250
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:33,290
They're terminating
their intended cooperation with us.

251
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:35,220
Would you like to meet with Mr. Xie?

252
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,510
No client

253
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,700
would entrust their projects

254
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,910
to a contractor with financial issues.

255
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,680
What about D Studio?

256
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,720
So far,

257
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,310
we haven't heard

258
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,310
any news about them being affected.

259
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,590
Xiao Zhiyu won't find

260
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,680
a better contractor than us.

261
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,840
How could he agree to cut us out?

262
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,680
Where are you going?

263
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,050
Making a phone call.

264
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:35,450
I don't want us to lose the project
because of Forma's issues.

265
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:36,730
We need a backup plan.

266
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,080
[Ceramic Company: Mr. Shen]

267
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,720
It's been a while, Ms. Hu.

268
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:57,920
Mr. Shen?

269
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,670
W-Why are you here?

270
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,920
Hello, Mr. Shen.

271
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,510
Hello, Ms. Zhou.

272
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,480
Thank you for coming all this way.

273
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,740
It's no trouble at all.

274
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:04,440
The meeting room is this way.

275
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:04,960
Please.

276
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:05,800
Let's go.

277
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,530
Come on. Watch your step.

278
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:17,050
Mr. Xiao.

279
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,160
Mr. Shen, hello.

280
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:19,720
Hello.

281
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,380
This is Mr. Xie from Lyman.

282
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,550
This is Mr. Shen from the ceramics factory

283
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,920
I mentioned before.

284
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,400
Welcome.

285
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,530
Pleased to meet you.

286
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,640
Mr. Shen's factory can supply

287
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,000
the 3D ceramic tiles

288
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:33,970
for the exterior decoration
of the Lyman Hotel.

289
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,550
Yes, Mr. Xie.

290
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,110
As long as this supply chain is secured,

291
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:39,160
we can work with any construction firm.

292
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,790
We absolutely won't delay
Lyman's construction schedule.

293
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:41,990
Please rest assured.

294
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:46,550
This is your first time

295
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,310
at Dynamism.

296
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,310
What do you think?

297
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,350
Mr. Xiao,

298
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,590
you didn't invite me here today

299
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:53,680
just to tour your studio, right?

300
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:56,600
I'd like to talk to you about Forma.

301
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:58,270
I suspect

302
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:01,200
Forma is committing financial fraud.

303
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,050
You have evidence?

304
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:07,250
I've got the full list
of Forma's suppliers.

305
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,460
For the sake of the project,

306
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,640
I've personally investigated
every factory.

307
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,550
I found several companies
whose business operations

308
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,440
don't match their production capabilities.

309
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,750
How could a company like Forma

310
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,000
work long-term with shell companies?

311
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,410
The reasonable explanation is

312
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,750
that Forma is using these companies

313
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,930
to fabricate business transactions

314
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:27,460
to falsify their accounts.

315
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,580
I'll verify what you've said.

316
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,480
But you were the one who proposed

317
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,480
bringing in Forma for this project.

318
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,000
Why this sudden betrayal

319
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,130
of your own partner?

320
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,200
I have no obligation

321
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,750
to bear Forma's risks.

322
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:44,920
Also...

323
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,200
even without Forma,

324
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,210
we can still realize our design.

325
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,310
Let's stay in close communication.

326
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:57,880
Alright.

327
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,880
If you need any materials from us,

328
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:02,320
feel free to let us know.

329
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,160
Everyone,

330
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,000
I assume you've all

331
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,800
heard about Forma's situation.

332
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,680
Please rest assured.

333
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,550
No matter what happens with Forma,

334
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:23,110
we'll still proceed with
Lyman's project as planned.

335
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:23,880
Our studio

336
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,280
won't be affected at all.

337
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,030
That's great.

338
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,550
H-H-Honestly,

339
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,350
I've been on edge all day.

340
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,510
I almost made a mistake
in my drawing just now.

341
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,140
You just can't handle the pressure.

342
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,400
You need to toughen up.

343
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,460
Come on, Hu Xiu.

344
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:41,720
The reason we weren't dragged down
by Forma this time

345
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,980
is all thanks to Hu Xiu.

346
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:44,000
At that time, Forma was

347
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,690
using the supply of special materials
as leverage in negotiations,

348
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,170
but Hu Xiu didn't give up.

349
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,550
She finally found

350
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:49,950
a very reliable factory.

351
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,230
That's why we weren't put in
a passive position

352
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:55,230
and could ensure
the design plan proceeded smoothly.

353
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:01,200
Hu Xiu, you've made a great contribution!

354
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:01,790
Hu Xiu,

355
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,830
if I were you,

356
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,640
I'd definitely take this opportunity

357
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,070
to ask Mr. Xiao and Ms. Zhou for

358
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:08,200
some tangible rewards, don't you think?

359
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,000
That's right.

360
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,590
-More bonus!
-More bonus!

361
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,550
-More bonus!
-More bonus!

362
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,650
-More bonus!
-More bonus!

363
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:15,450
More bonus...

364
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,440
Bonuses are great, of course,  right?

365
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,920
But before we talk about more bonuses,

366
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,200
we still need to work hard!

367
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,750
However, having a dinner gathering first
shouldn't be a problem, right?

368
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:31,920
How about we go for hot pot?

369
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,720
Sounds good?

370
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,070
Having a group dinner first
is fine, right?

371
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,110
Our hero,

372
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:38,000
let's go to the concert tonight.

373
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:41,200
Hot pot? Hot pot sounds good as well.

374
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,920
The hot pot place we went to last time
was really good.

375
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,590
What else do you want?

376
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,880
Just say whatever else you want.

377
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,830
Trip! Let's go on a trip!

378
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:10,290
Come on.

379
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,110
What's wrong?

380
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,910
You've been quiet the whole way.

381
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,510
Tell me.

382
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,310
How did you manage to

383
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:31,480
get in touch with Mr. Shen so quickly?

384
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,650
My girlfriend worked hard
to find that supplier,

385
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:38,450
so of course I took it seriously.

386
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:41,810
I've kept that file you gave me all along.

387
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,970
You'd already reached out to him,
hadn't you?

388
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,100
Back around the Spring Festival.

389
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,200
Spring Festival?

390
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,440
Wasn't that right after you announced

391
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,040
the partnership with Forma?

392
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,250
You already thought
Forma would have problems at that time?

393
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,680
Of course not.

394
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,160
I just don't like

395
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,020
the feeling of having no options.

396
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,480
"Always have a backup plan

397
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,750
and always fix your weaknesses.

398
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,350
That way, you won't be constrained."

399
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:08,830
See?

400
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,530
It came in handy, didn't it?

401
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:12,760
Of course.

402
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:14,310
Thanks to you.

403
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,060
I really can't figure you out.

404
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,820
You planned everything so carefully,

405
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,820
like

406
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:25,980
you never intended to work with Forma
in the first place.

407
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:30,280

411
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,890
can you at least give me a heads-up?

412
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:38,570
You had me on edge.

413
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:41,350
You know, when Mr. Shen came today,

414
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,200

00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,660

Doctor,

554
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,320
will his previous condition worsen
after the surgery?

555
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,710
You'll have to ask the surgeon
about that, okay?

556
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:52,310
Thank you.

00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:54,330

00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,920
Give me Dad's ID.

561
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,450
I'll handle the paperwork.

562
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:14,060
Hospital admission for Hu Ding.

563
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,310
Please show
the patient's health insurance card.

564
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:17,950
Is the digital version okay?
I have it on my phone.

565
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:18,620
Scan here.

566
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:39,770
I'll take care of this.

567
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:41,230
Go accompany your mother.

568
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:47,670
Do you need anything else?

569
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:16,400
How did it go, doctor?

570
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,190
The surgery went well.

571
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,560
All external wounds have been sutured.

572
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,040
Nothing serious.

573
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,360
After the patient wakes up,

574
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,290
we'll conduct a full examination.

575
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:29,030
Doctor...

576
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:29,630
Thank you.

577
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,760
Will my father have trouble walking?

578
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,070
He's previously had a leg injury

579
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:34,930
and has undergone surgery twice.

580
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:37,140
It depends on his recovery.

581
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:38,910
If rehabilitation goes well,

582
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,250
he should be able to walk just fine.

583
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,880
Thank you for your hard work.

584
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,480
Thank you.

585
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,810
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

586
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:46,190
Thank you.

587
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,730
[Name Changed, Legacy Inherited: Architect
Xiao Zhiyu's true identity revealed.]

588
00:38:57,730 --> 00:38:58,750
[His biological father, Qin Yuze,
was behind a major construction accident.]

589
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,400
Dad.

590
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,510
I've received a notice
from the audit committee.

591
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,140
They're launching
an internal investigation first

592
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,470
and will coordinate with the regulators.

593
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,550
Verifying the authenticity of the report

594
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:42,190
will take about a month.

595
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,370
That gives us some breathing room.

596
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:48,710
Who's behind this?

597
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,840
Any leads?

598
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,930
Could it be Shen Jie?

599
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,500
When financial issues arise,

600
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:59,950
he is usually the first
to be investigated.

601
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,810
He wouldn't be that stupid.

602
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,900
Then what did you find out?

603
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:09,030
I did uncover something.

604
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,570
The person who reported us

605
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:13,320
is one of our suppliers.

606
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,650
You can't trust rumors.

607
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:24,150
You need to investigate personally.

608
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,850
I'm afraid it won't be that simple.

609
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:32,510
You've managed Forma for so many years.

610
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,320
I don't know

611
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,790
who your trusted people are

612
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,670
or which partners

613
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:40,480
you've been wary of.

614
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:42,560
I don't know where to start.

615
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,460
I still know

616
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,500
too little about you.

617
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,630
Get some rest.

618
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:54,030
It was you who leaked

619
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:56,300
Xiao Zhiyu's identity, wasn't it?

620
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,730
You couldn't stand him.

621
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:06,850
But you kept this secret for him
all these years.

622
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,150
Why did you act on your own

623
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:10,780
and choose this particular moment

624
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,510
to expose it?

625
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,110
I had to...

626
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,030
keep at least one thing for myself.
