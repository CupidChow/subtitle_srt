I...

00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,330
Dad, Mom, actually,

5
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,190
I forgot my keys today.

6
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,400
Why didn't you say so earlier?

7
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,750
I brought the spare key.

8
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,150
You did?

9
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,150
L-Let me.

10
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:17,680
Let me.

11
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,260
Which key is it? There are so many.

12
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,390
You don't even recognize
the key to your own house?

13
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,870
This short one.

14
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,230
Dad! Mom!

15
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,450
I'm opening the door!

16
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:31,800
What's this about?

17
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,530
We haven't gone deaf, alright?

18
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,040
I-I'm opening it!

19
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:41,750
Well...

20
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,400
What are you doing?

21
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,360
I dropped the key.

22
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,120
I'll get you slippers.

23
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,920
Why's it so hard to open the door?

24
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,160
Dad, your slippers.

26
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,820
Isn't this coat a bit too large for you?

27
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,120
Oversize is in right now.

28
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,820
I know what oversize is,

29
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,160
but this is a bit too oversized, isn't it?

30
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,160
Well, I'll go return it tomorrow.

31
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,080
You bought another coffee machine?

32

Coffee machine?

This coffee machine

34
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,870
was a gift from Zhao.

35
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,150
It's an old one she retired from her shop.

36
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,190
This... This

37
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:20,030
must be quite expensive, isn't it?

38
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,160
It's not expensive.

39
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,490
Just entry-level.

40
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,940
It's really nice.

41
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,470
Mom, why are you going to the balcony?

42
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,400
I want to open the window.
It's too stuffy in here.

Let me do it.

Yeah, everything's ready-made.

Why go out?

My phone's dead.

54
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,140
Can this bowl hold it all?

55
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,080

haven't I heard you

134
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,040
mention this colleague before?

135
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,630
Well, we've just become colleagues.
We're not very close.

136

If you're not close,

137
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:33,900
why would he come to your place?

138
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,720
He's here for a very important document.

139
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,830
What document?

140
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,050
A leasing contract.

141
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,160
I left my leasing contract with Hu Xiu.

142
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,440
Our company mentioned a housing allowance,

143
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,990
so I asked Hu Xiu to help me apply for it.

144
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,850
So you live in a rented place, huh?

145
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,390
I was just curious.

146
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,510
Go ahead, go ahead.

147
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:03,910
I just got something stuck in throat.

148
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,170
Renting is quite nice.

149
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,100
Yes,

150
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,110
I also think renting is pretty good.

151
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,440
If I could have a nice landlord,

152
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,900
that would be even better.

153
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,910
Dad, Mom, I'm full.

154
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:17,870

155
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:18,480
Come on.

156
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,390
I'll see him off,

157
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,080
just in case he doesn't know the way.

158
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,390
But we've only just started eating.

159
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:23,840
You haven't finished yet.

160
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,120
We're done. We're full.

161
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,150
At least finish your meal before leaving.

162
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,120
We ate plenty.

163
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,150
Let's go.

164
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,730
Why such a rush?

165
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,320
Go on, tell me—

166
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,050
how do you plan to resolve this?

167
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,610
They'll definitely leave

168
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,610
within 2 hours.

169
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,030
If you don't want to wait,

170
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,430
I can put you up in a hotel.

171
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,960
Forget the hotel.

172
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,210

The winners of the new
Global Architecture & Design Awards

230
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,260
for Architectural Design Consultants
have been announced.

231
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,670
D Design Studio has once again
made the list.

232
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,660
At the award ceremony,

233
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,960
the designer still did not
make a public appearance.

234
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,080
We boldly speculate

235
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,480
that this refusal of public exposure

236
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,030
reflects the designer's philosophy

237
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:15,090
of letting the work speak for itself.

238
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:45,150
Hello, I'm here for an interview.

239
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,020
What's your name, please?

240
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,840
Hu Xiu.

241
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,730
Please come with me.

242
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,080
I've told you this design won't work.

243
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,320
That's because of your lack of ability.

244
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,200
How many times have I
given you instructions?

245
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,270
What kind of mess is this revision?

246
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,080
I've already revised it 3 times.

247
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,390
What's wrong with my ability?

248
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,030
I won't waste words on you. Come on.

249
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,690
I'll draw it out for you. Look.

250
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:07,890
It's alright, Ms. Hu.

251
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,550
When they're working on creative projects,

252
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,630
they tend to be quite temperamental.

253
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,090
They'll make up in no time.

254
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,630
Please wait here for a moment.

255
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,480
Someone will come out
to guide you inside shortly.

256
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,270
Good luck.

257
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:21,180
Thank you.

258
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,150
Mr. Xiao never used to
attend initial interviews.

259
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,970
Why is he making an exception today?

260
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:43,910
I'm not sure either.

261
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,440
Mr. Xiao only notified me last night

262
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,770
that he would attend the interview today.

263
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,190
Everyone's here.

264
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,280

Hello, everyone.

289
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,080
Please introduce yourself first.

290
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,480
My name is Hu Xiu.

291
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,720
I majored in architecture
as an undergraduate.

292
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,600
After graduating,

293
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,150
I worked as a GM assistant
at Shiyuan Real Estate.

294
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,720
I resigned recently

295
00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:00,110
am now looking for a job
related to architectural design.

296
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:02,550
Ms. Hu,

297
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,320
I see that in your previous job,

298
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,430
you became a GM assistant
in less than 3 years,

299
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,020
which shows you were highly valued.

300
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,950
Your salary and benefits
must have been quite generous.

301
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,920
So why did you choose to resign?

302
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,870
I chose Shiyuan Real Estate before

303
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,230
due to certain practical factors.

304
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:20,870
But now,

305
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,360
I want to make a change

306
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,500
and do what I truly enjoy.

307
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,830
But

308
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,720
architecture is
a highly specialized profession.

309
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,550
How do you plan to make up for
the three-year gap

310
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,840
and lag in your professional skills,

311
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,600
and how can you prove

312
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,750
that you're qualified for this position?

313
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,030
I haven't had any project practice

314
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,270
over the past 3 years,

315
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,720
but I've never stopped learning.

316
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
If that's the case,

317
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,960
do you mind

318
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,420
answering a few questions

319
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,270
related to your profession?

320
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:50,910
Not at all.

321
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:54,600
Regarding the criteria for
selecting building structures,

322
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,510
under what circumstances do you think

323
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,790
frame structures would be preferred?

324
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,870
For commercial buildings that require

325
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,200
a relatively high level of
spatial flexibility—

326
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,690
such as shopping malls, office buildings,

327
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,079
and art centers—

328
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:10,030
frame structures are usually
the preferred choice.

329
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:11,880
This is because within frame structures,

330
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,440
non-load-bearing infill walls
or partitions

331
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,040
can be relatively easily
modified or removed.

332
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,680
In your opinion,

333
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,109
what's the role of sustainability

334
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:25,020
in architectural design?

335
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,720
Actually,

336
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,030
sustainable development
is a core principle

337
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,640
of contemporary architectural design.

338
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:42,000
By integrating those eco-technologies
and green innovations,

339
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,490
like photovoltaic generation systems

340
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,670
or water recycling systems
in our commercial projects.

341
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:51,960
We not only mitigate
the environmental impact,

342
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:56,980
but also significantly save
the general cost for our customers.

343
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,440
Well answered.

344
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:03,770
Tell me about this.

345
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,200
This is a project I worked on

346
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,410
for the UIA-HYP Cup Competition
during college.

347
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:17,850
It's a beautiful design.

348
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,810
It's quite nice indeed.

349
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:22,310
Following the design style of
traditional Jiangnan courtyards,

350
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,720
reading in the corridors

351
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,920
not only creates a unique atmosphere,

352
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,180
but also brings people closer together.

353
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,680
However, in architecture,

354
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,200
beauty and ambience alone aren't enough.

355
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,550
Do you know there's a fatal flaw

356
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,830
in your design?

357
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:49,820
I do.

358
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,160
In a frame structure,

359
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,340
beams and columns

360
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,730
are the most important
load-bearing components.

361
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:06,450
In pursuit of a sense of openness,

362
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,650
I failed to reserve sufficient
load-bearing components

363
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,340
to carry the additional loads.

364
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,490
As a result, once any one of them fails,

365
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,040
the axial compression ratio
of the structural system

366
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,370
would exceed the limit,

367
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,250
leading to a progressive collapse
of the entire structure.

368
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,640
I used to believe

369
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,790
that the most important thing
in architecture

370
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:24,880
was personality

371
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:25,960
and style.

372
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,620
As long as they were strong enough,

373
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:30,080
they'd be able to
catch people's attention.

374
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,520
Now I see that's not the case.

375
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,140
In this industry,

376
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,900
the most important thing is
and will always be

377
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,770
safety.

378
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,270
According to preliminary investigation,

379
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,440
the collapse of
the Xincheng Sports Stadium

380
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,350
was caused by non-compliant
project drawing reviews.

381
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,880
The contractor unauthorizedly
used substandard steel,

382
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,010
resulting in a partial collapse.

383
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:50,820
Besides the load-bearing
beams and columns,

384
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,510
I would also replace the materials
of the building's exterior facade

385
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,550
to add texture,

386
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,830
so that when sunlight filters in,

387
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,490
the spatial layers will be more nuanced.

388
00:19:58,490 --> 00:19:59,480
For areas like the reading zone,

389
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,420
I'd make the space
more open and transparent,

390
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,310
so readers can enjoy better lighting

391
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,980
while reading.

392
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,070
The core of architecture

393
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:08,480
is always people.

394
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,550
Very well, Ms. Hu.

395
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,470
That concludes today's interview.

396
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:20,890
We'll inform you of the interview result
within 3 days.

397
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,310
Please remember to check your email.

398
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:22,960
Thank you.

399
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,030
Thanks.

400
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,370
What's this?

401
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:47,590
It's just a painting.

402
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,950
So he's here for inspiration.

403
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,480
It's painted quite nicely.

404
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,890
You can tell it's a bookstore?

405
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,090
So I'm the real clown here.

406
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,000
Mr. Xiao.

407
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,730
What are you looking at?

408
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,030
Nothing.

409
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,640
The next interview is in 20 minutes.

410
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,680
Got it.

411
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,260
Anything else?

412
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,490
I received your email.

413
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,400
You've signed up for

414
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,530
the Lyman Hotel project competition?

415
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:32,400
Yes.

416
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,100
So this is
what you've been busy with lately.

417
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:39,510
I know what you're worried about.

418
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,650
I've always supported your decisions,

419
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,000
but

420
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,590
Lyman has always worked with

421
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,630
publicly listed companies like Zhuling.

422
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,680
Our studio has only been established
for less than 5 years.

423
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,810
You think my design isn't good enough?

424
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,830
Using lane elements to create

425
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:02,830
a landmark hotel that is both retro
and rich in multicultural character—

426
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,920
the design and concept are both excellent.

427
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,350
I have no doubt about that.

428
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,680
Lyman has abundant funding

429
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,620
and offers great creative freedom.

430
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,230
The project allows architects
to fully express themselves.

431
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,360
That's exactly why

432
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,640
every one of their projects

433
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,240
wins international awards.

434
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,600
Securing an award of that caliber

435
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,960
would be a major boost

436
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,110
for Dynamism.

437
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,530
That's an odd thing to say.

438
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,600
You're not entering the competition
just to win awards, are you?

439
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,840
Why not?

440
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,360
I do architecture to win awards
and make a name for myself.

441
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,880
I have a question:

442
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,310
has

443
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:50,920
Dynamism

444
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,580
Architectural Design Studio

445
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,270
ever changed its founder?

446
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,830
Usually they don't change founders.

447
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,690
Any gossip?

448
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:01,600
No, just letting my imagination run a bit.

449
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:05,140
What kind of question was that?

450
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,350
Zhao,

451
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:11,610
I have a question for you.

452
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,030
Do you think those successful people

453
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,160
have any little quirks

454
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,420
in their private lives

455
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:19,070
that no one knows about?

456
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:22,990
Quirks?

457
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,760
What's wrong?

458
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,510
You've come to the right person.

459
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:29,800
Come here.

460
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,440
I'm asking about legal quirks.

461
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:41,000
Legal ones?

462
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,000
There are plenty of those too.

463
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,890
I heard that chain gym's founder

464
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:45,830
has a quirk—

465
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,230
he likes washing dishes.

466
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:50,350
The dirtier and more disgusting
the dishes are,

467
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:52,130
the more satisfaction
he gets from cleaning them.

468
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,530
The dirtier, the better.

469
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,570
Anything else?

470
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:06,190
There's an internet-famous restaurant
on the street behind us,

471
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,640
and their staff told me

472
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,640
their boss likes to collect hats.

473
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,970
What's so special about collecting hats?

474
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,160
The ones he collects

475
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,830
aren't ordinary hats.

476
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:22,350
Also,

477
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,790
that tea house we often visit,

478
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:27,180
the owner with all those muscles,
remember?

479
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,160
Do you know what
his favorite exercise is?

480
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:29,760
Exercise?

481
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,130
Weightlifting?

482
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,400
Dancing.

483
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,240
There's one that's even more shocking.

484
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,770
That guy who's always on TV,

485
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,110
that super masculine big shot,

486
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,060
what's his name again?

487
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,790
He's one of my husband's clients.

488
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:53,680
-You know, he...
-Alright, alright.

489
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,000
I don't really want to know

490
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,730
the secrets of
those successful people anymore.

491
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,840
You know, those successful people

492
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,720
are in high positions
with lots of pressure,

493
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,590
so having some strange hobbies

494
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,540
is actually understandable.

495
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,460
Why are you suddenly asking me
a question like this?

496
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,770
Did you get to know
some successful person or something?

497
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,000
Who is it?

498
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:21,640
Hello.

499
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,440
When are we going to sign
the new leasing contract?

500
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,240
Just a moment.

501
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,790
That concludes today's interview.

502
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:35,350
We'll inform you of the result
within 3 days.

503
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,200
Thank you.

504
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,180
Okay.

505
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,100
Thank you.

506
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,700
Follow me. I'll show you out.

507
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,870
This last candidate was decent.

508
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:52,730
Good education,
with overseas study experience.

509
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:55,590
It's just his salary expectations
are way too high.

510
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,270
Judging by his attitude,

511
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,800
it'll be hard to negotiate
within our budget.

512
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,340
Then there's that one named Hu Xiu...

513
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,070
I'll bring the contract over tonight.

514
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,640
My questions were a bit tricky,

515
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,830
but she answered them well.

516
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:07,590
It's just a pity that

517
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:09,350
she hasn't accumulated any experience
these years.

518
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,590
Not sure whether she'll be able to adapt

519
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:12,450
after transferring to this role.

520
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,000
So,

521
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:15,880
Mr. Xiao,

522
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:19,560
what's your opinion on
these two candidates?

523
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:31,470
Mr. Xiao.

524
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:31,960
[House Leasing Contract]

525
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,640
I've made some minor revisions

526
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,790
to this contract.

527
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:35,850
Please check if there are any issues.

528
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,090
During the lease term,

529
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:49,790
the landlord promises to
provide the tenant with

530
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,320
the most pleasant service,

531
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,430
meeting all the tenant's needs,

532
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:56,030
respecting all of
the tenant's privacy and...

533
00:26:58,510 --> 00:26:59,200
Quirks?

534
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:06,440
And commit to keeping them confidential
unconditionally and indefinitely,

535
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,220
including after the lease term ends.

536
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,230
I'm fine with that.

537
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,400
However,

538
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,510
I don't want any more

539
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,520
unexpected situations to occur.

540
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,170
I'm sorry.

541
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,810
My parents came unexpectedly last time.

542
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,240
But don't worry.

543
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,160
I'll try my best

544
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,830
to keep them from coming here.

545
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,310
Try your best?

546
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,110
You still haven't told them
that you've rented the place out?

547
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:37,310
When Chen Dabao caused trouble before,

548
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:38,730
so many neighbors saw it.

549
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,830
They could tell your parents anytime.

550
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:41,590
They won't.

551
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,480
My father had an accident years ago

552
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,610
and injured his leg.

553
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:48,880
Since then,

554
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,480
he hasn't really liked interacting with
the people in this lane.

555
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,720
Maybe he doesn't want them to pity him.

556
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,120
But I have no obligation

557
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,270
to hide things from your parents for you.

558
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,400
You dare not confess to them

559
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,960
because in fact, you don't believe

560
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,290
you can succeed in architectural design.

561
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,370
If you're just temporarily unemployed

562
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:11,070
and need to rent out the place
as a stopgap,

563
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:13,270
what's so hard about telling them that?

564
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,950
The night your parents came, you mentioned

565
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:18,410
you were worried that
you might've chosen the wrong path.

566
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:20,140
Well, I need to tell you, Ms. Hu,

567
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,930
it's hard for a job candidate
who's still doubting themselves

568
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:25,190
to convince others to give them a chance.

569
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:31,830
Mr. Xiao.

570
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,590
I only said those things to you that day

571
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:36,520
because I considered you a friend.

572
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,640
I didn't expect it to become my weakness

573
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,530
and your reason to reject me.

574
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,790
But I still want to say

575
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,830
that I've never doubted myself.

576
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,450
From the day I quit
without another job lined up,

577
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:53,450
I've made up my mind

578
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:55,480
that no matter how difficult
the road ahead is,

579
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,790
I would never give up.

580
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:58,630
The reason why

581
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,520
I've kept it from them is that

582
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,000
I've been dealing with

583
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,610
a lot of frustrating things lately,

584
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,830
and I don't want them to worry

585
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,160
about me changing jobs.

586
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,270
That's all.

587
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,750
But anyway,

588
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,920
my request

589
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,270
was indeed abrupt.

590
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:18,960
I'm sorry.

591
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,450
Mr. Xiao.

592
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,200
I won't bother you any further.

593
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:22,750
Goodbye.

594
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,060
Zhao, want to come out for dinner?

595
00:29:58,450 --> 00:29:59,250
Zhao.

596
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:01,820
I messed up another interview.

597
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,180
Where are you?

598
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:14,880
What?

599
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,070
So that difficult tenant
you mentioned last time

600
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,640
is the boss of Dynamism?

601
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,760
They're not the same person.

602
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,020
But in a way, they are.

603
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:26,680
I was planning

604
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,720
to have a good talk with him today.

605
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,350
He's a designer I've always admired,
you know?

606
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,070
If this were in the past,

607
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:32,920
I'd have been so happy

608
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,030
and excited to get to know him.

609
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,090
But now, just thinking that

610
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:38,550
as soon as I got to know him,

611
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,300
he rejected me—

612
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:44,120
I feel like I'd have been better off
not knowing him at all.

613
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:45,720
Thank you.

614
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,160
Xiu.

615
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,720
From my point of view,

616
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,720
you two crossing paths at all

617
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,830
is a kind of fate.

618
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,790
He may have rejected you now,

619
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:58,190
but he might acknowledge you
in the future.

620
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,200
No, no, no.

621
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:01,070
There's no future between us.

622
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:03,440
There are many details you don't know.

623
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,270
Now that I think about it,

624
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,590
every word I said

625
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,830
and every move I made

626
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,480
foreshadowed

627
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:12,280
the outcome of today's interview.

628
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:30,400
Zhao.

629
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:33,280
What I'm drinking is juice, right?

630
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,670
Yes, it is juice. What's wrong?

631
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,440
Then why am I hallucinating?

632
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,200
So, Mr. Xiao,

633
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:02,160
what's your opinion on
these two candidates?

634
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,640
Recruitment is always a two-way choice.

635
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,440
At least I didn't sense

636
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,110
that the person just now

637
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:10,040
had any expectations of Dynamism.

638
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,720
So,

639
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,220
you mean...

640
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,400
Let's pick Hu Xiu.

641
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,680
Although she has a three-year gap,

642
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,280
her fundamentals are solid.

643
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,350
People like her

644
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:23,480
are less likely to be constrained
by routine or inertia.

645
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,510
Do you know what "negative space"
in architecture

646
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,240
is usually meant to emphasize?

647
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,640
It's openness

648
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:31,860
and flow.

649
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,440
And openness and flow

650
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,900
bring limitless possibilities.

651
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,480
Alright, stop checking it.

652
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,720
You're not dreaming.

653
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,700
How will you get back? It's raining.

654
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,400
I brought an umbrella,

655
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,750
and the coffee shop is just nearby.

656
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,080
-I can walk back.
-Okay.

657
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:51,810
What about you?

658
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:53,510
How will you get a taxi in this rain?

659
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:54,200
Me?

660
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,300
My husband is coming to pick me up.

661
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,000
I'll wait with you for a bit.

662
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
No need.

663
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,760
Aren't you starting work next Monday?

664
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,290
Go home early and get ready.

665
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:05,770
Don't show any weakness.

666
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:06,960
Go now.

667
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,040
I'm off then.

668
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,640
Go on.

669
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:10,420
Bye-bye.

670
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:22,530
Why isn't he picking up his phone?

671
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,780
I wonder what he's busy with.

672
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,830
Hello, I'm here to report for work today.

673
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:03,550
I'm Hu Xiu.

674
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:04,720
Hu Xiu, right?

675
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,610
Come with me.

676
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,400
What's wrong?

677
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,440
I-Is there something wrong
with my makeup?

678
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,540
No.

679
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:21,219
I'm just happy for you.

680
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,280
When I saw your resume,

681
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,610
I felt our work experiences were similar.

682
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:28,630
I was also halfway down
a promising career path

683
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,690
when I took a detour here to Shanghai.

684
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,949
So do you regret it now?

685
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:36,270
What do you think?

686
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,130
Let's go. I'll show you around.

687
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:44,250
This is Ms. Zhou's office,

688
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,320
and Mr. Xiao's office is
on the second floor to the left.

689
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,889
This is the conference room.

690
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:50,550
Remember to book in advance
if you need to use it.

691
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,870
This is the materials section.

692
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:54,400
And this is the modeling area.

693
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,780
The main office area is up ahead.

694
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:58,180
Come on, I'll show you
to your workstation.

695
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,420
Everyone, may I
have your attention please?

696
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,560
I'd like to introduce our new colleague.

697
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,560
This is Hu Xiu,

698
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:06,280
our new assistant designer.

699
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,610
She'll be working with us starting today.

700
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,760
Hello everyone, I'm Hu Xiu.

701
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,740
I'm very happy to be working
with all of you.

702
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:15,010
I look forward to your guidance
and support.

703
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:16,260
Welcome, welcome.

704
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:20,330
This is your workstation.

705
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,630
Let me introduce you to everyone.

706
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:22,760
This is Jiang Tianyi,

707
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,230
our lead architectural designer.

708
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,360
This is Sun Yifei,

709
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,230
senior architect.

710
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:28,030
If you have any questions,
you can ask them.

711
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,690
Of course, you can also ask me.

712
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:32,920
Here are some forms you need to fill out
for your onboarding.

713
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,740
Give them back to me once you're done.

714
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,340
Got it. Thanks for your help.

715
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:39,760
Mr. Jiang.

716
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,510
Nice to meet you.

717
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,440
Nice to meet you.

718
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,150
You just graduated
from graduate school, right?

719
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:45,970
Which overseas university did you attend
for your master's degree?

720
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:46,530
I...

721
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,080
I only have a bachelor's degree
from a domestic university.

722
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,810
I graduated several years ago.

723
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,070
Bachelor's degree is good.

724
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,000
In our architecture industry,

725
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,070
what matters is
accumulating work experience.

726
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,000
While others were studying
for their master's,

727
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,210
you were already
getting practical experience.

728
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:03,110
That's much better than
theoretical knowledge.

729
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:04,230
After graduation,

730
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:06,960
I worked as a GM assistant
at a real estate company.

731
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,330
I only recently decided to
return to architectural design.

732
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:11,040
So strictly speaking,

733
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:13,630
I don't have much practical experience.

734
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,920
Hu... Xiu?

735
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:28,480
Hu Xiu?

736
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,440
Don't be nervous.

737
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,750
Our company doesn't have that

738
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:33,590
"everyone stand up when the boss arrives"

739
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:35,150
kind of rule.

740
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:36,220
Relax.

741
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:37,510
Take it easy.

742
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:39,630
Actually,

743
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,400
Mr. Xiao and I

744
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,850
had some minor conflicts before.

745
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:45,250
I'm wondering
if I should apologize to him.

746
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:49,260
Didn't you just start today?

747
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:53,570
So did you somehow upset him
during your interview?

748
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:56,320
Something like that.

749
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,410
I think

750
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,610
you should go apologize to him.

751
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,150
Because

752
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,030
the assistant designer position

753
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,610
was created specifically for Mr. Xiao
this time.

754
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:08,780
Your first project

755
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,610
will definitely be
under Mr. Xiao's supervision.

756
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,320
If there are issues

757
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,790
that aren't clearly addressed,

758
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:16,190
leaving things awkward,

759
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,860
h-how can you work well together, right?

760
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,070
Hu Xiu.

761
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,010
Come up here.

762
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:46,880
Mr. Xiao.

763
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,530
You wanted to see me?

764
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:50,290
Come in and have a seat.

765
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,240
This is the project
we're currently working on.

766
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,920
Take these materials
and review them carefully.

767
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,720
Within a week,

768
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:03,410
compile your thoughts and give them to me.

769
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:04,090
[Lyman Group]

770
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,220
Keep these materials confidential.

771
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:06,950
Understood.

772
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,220
Any other questions?

773
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,030
Mr. Xiao.

774
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,010
Hu Xiu, you're here too.

775
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:20,700
Ms. Zhou.

776
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,250
Perfect timing.

777
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,540
Do you have any plans

778
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:24,740
after work today?

779
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,510
No. Is there some work to do?

780
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:29,690
Not work. It's a dinner gathering.

781
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:31,590
According to Dynamism's tradition,

782
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:32,880
whenever a new employee joins,

783
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,340
we treat everyone to dinner.

784
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,270
Right, Mr. Xiao?

785
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,720
You choose the place.

786
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,110
Thank you, Boss.

787
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,270
Are you done talking?

788
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,710
Yes, I'll head down first.

789
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:08,260
What on earth could he be busy with?

790
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,110
Here we are.

791
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:13,640
Thank you all for your hard work
this year.

792
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,290
I hope that each of us

793
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,670
can successfully complete

794
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:18,230
our ongoing projects

795
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,510
and achieve good results

796
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:21,190
with the projects we're pursuing.

797
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,030
Hear, hear!

798
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:24,080
And now, for today's highlight:

799
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,520
let's welcome our new colleague, Hu Xiu.

800
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,230
I hope everyone can
get along well with her

801
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,480
and make progress together.

802
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,110
Welcome.

803
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,000
Welcome.

804
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:33,840
Here, a toast to you all.

805
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:34,880
Come on.

806
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Cheers!

807
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,480
Cheers!

808
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,480
Newbie, aren't you joining us for a drink?

809
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,200
We're all drinking alcohol.

810
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,800
Yeah, have a drink.

811
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:43,960
Today is the welcome party.

812
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,960
You should at least have a drink too.

813
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,150
Mr. Xiao. Ms. Zhou.

814
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,740
I'd like to toast you both,

815
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:49,210
and everyone else.

816
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:50,760
Okay. Come on.

817
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:51,490
Cheers.

818
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:02,960
It's okay.

819
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,610
I'll drive her home later.

820
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:06,720
By the way, has she filled out
her onboarding form?

821
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,480
Yes, she has.

822
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,060
Is her home address on it?

823
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,880
No. 27, Lane 9, Yanhua Road.

824
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,470
No. 27, Lane 9.

825
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:20,440
Isn't this Mr. Xiao's coat?

826
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:22,260
Aren't these Mr. Xiao's shoes?

827
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:22,720
This...

828
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,530
This is Mr. Xiao's model.

829
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,040
So Hu Xiu and Mr. Xiao...

830
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,610
Live together?

831
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:32,920
I'll give her a ride.

832
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:36,390
It's on my way home.

833
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,490
It does seem to be on the way.

834
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:40,360
Fortunately, she looks like

835
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,320
the type who just falls asleep

836
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:44,480
when drunk, not the troublesome kind.

837
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:46,520
Where do you live?

838
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,650
I'll drive you home.

839
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:48,460
I live...

840
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:49,960
I live...

841
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:52,190
I live on Yanhua Road.

842
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,150
What?

843
00:40:55,360 --> 00:41:00,030
No. 27, Lane 9, Yanhua Road.

844
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:02,560
Let's go.

845
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:18,270
Don't touch me.

846
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:21,760
Don't pull me! I said don't!

847
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,340
Don't move around!

848
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:27,340
I...

849
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,380
Who took my command token?

850
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:35,190
Who took my...

851
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:40,230
Who's so wicked?

852
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:43,370
I just want a command token.

853
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,130
Here you are.

854
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,560
I am the mayor!

855
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:49,280
Yes, you are.

856
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:49,800
You are.

857
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,860
My command token.

858
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,730
My token.

859
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:04,190
Alright.

860
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:05,780
We're here. Get off.

861
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,510
Hu Xiu.

862
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,320
Hu Xiu?

863
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:25,960
Your mayor's command token is gone.

864
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,760
What?
