[Sold]
[See you]

4
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,200
Take care.

5
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:06,350
Bye-bye.

6
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:06,880
Bye-bye.

7
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:07,480
Bye-bye.

8
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:11,950
He's here again?

9
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,130
Seems like he's got other things in mind.

10
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,829
Maybe I'm overthinking it.

11
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,310
Five iced Americanos,
three specialty drinks.

12
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,240
Trying to make me even busier, huh?

13
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,280
It's the weekend. Why did you come here

14
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,810
instead of resting at home?

15
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,800
Because I have an uncanny knack
for foresight.

16
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,040
I knew it would be busy

17
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:48,020
in the café this evening.

18
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,520
I've noticed you're pretty well informed

19
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,280
about Qin Xiaoyi from Group A these days.

20
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,740
He comes back
and you show up here right away.

21
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:57,750
What,

22
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,080
your boss isn't hounding you
to draw plans on weekends anymore?

23
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,150
My project is finished,

24
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,280
so I deserve a break.

25
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,320
Besides, he's doing a side job himself.

26
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,240
That intense?

27
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,890
Even the boss has to take on
a side hustle?

28
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,710
He really should learn a thing or two
from Mr. Pei.

29
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,470
Pei Zhen?

30
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,750
Didn't the Qian Jinxin matter
wrap up already?

31
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,520
What's up with him now?

32
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,710
He went to play over across the street.

33
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,520
Where?

34
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,110
At the murder mystery game place
across the street.

35
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,200
When?

36
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:24,760
About 10 minutes ago.

37
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,310
You and that Mr. Pei, you two...

38
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,490
Where are you going?

39
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:31,950
I'll talk to you later.

40
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,829
Always so jumpy.

41
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,150
No need to run.

42
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,630
Their session has already started.

43
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,280
Qin Xiaoyi is in Group A for this session,
right?

44
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,840
Yes.

45
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,120
He was on leave before.

46
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,630
Today is his first day back performing.

47
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,760
Well, it hasn't been going on for long.

48
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,750
Could you get me a ticket?

49
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,840
Please.

50
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,560
You've played so many times,

51
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,680
so you should know the rules.

52
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,480
We don't admit latecomers here.

53
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,280
I'm practically a regular player now.

54
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,470
Can't you make an exception?

55
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,730
I'll take any role,
as long as I can get in.

56
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,630
There's really nothing I can do.

57
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,360
This session's already full.

58
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,800
Besides, it's against our rules.

59
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,150
Thanks.

60
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,900
Where does this corridor lead?

61
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,290
To the lobby.

62
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,290
It's one of the fire exits.

63
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:44,970
Hello,

64
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
this is ME Murder Mystery Game Club.

65
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,310
Is the signal bad?

66
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:18,390
Hello,

67
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,630
may I ask

68
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,430
if you know the way to the casino?

69
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,270
I think it's up ahead.

70
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:24,800
Yes, right up ahead.

71
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,730
That way, right?

72
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,720
Yes.

73
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,950
Just go straight and turn right.

74
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:29,870
That's right.

75
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:30,910
Thank you.

76
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,700
I didn't know I had to make money here.

77
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,490
You want to make money, right?

78
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,430
Go find that guy—

79
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:37,920
that guy

80
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:38,950
in a suit.

81
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:39,870
He can help you.

82
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,270
He's the son of a gambling tycoon.

83
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,190
At the casino,

84
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,190
he never loses.

85
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,420
You can ask him for help.

86
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,040
Are you a staff member

87
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,570
or playing some character?

88
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,950
I'm a...

89
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,159
Time traveler.

90
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,159
A-A hidden character.

91
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,920
I know there's a map in your bag.

92
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,320
It's something he needs.

93
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,510
Make sure to ask him to help you.

94
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,200
There really is.

95
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,730
Thank you, time traveler.

96
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,360
Sir!

97
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:17,490
Excuse me, sir!

98
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,240
I heard you're the son of
a gambling tycoon,

99
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,720
who makes a lot of money at the casino.

100
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,800
You must've got the wrong person.

101
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,240
Please take me along to make money.

102
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:24,870
No, no.

103
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,390
I... I...

104
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,070
I have to go. I've got things to do
over there.

105
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,360
Please. Let's go.

106
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:27,750
Don't drag me.

107
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,040
Take me along to make money.

108
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,600
Let's go.

109
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,720
Excuse me,

110
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,850
do you have a ticket?

111
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,220
I-I'm here to find someone.

112
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,220
I'll be going then.

113
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:40,870
Hold on!

114
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,070
Control center,

115
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,560
someone without a ticket
has entered the game.

116
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,480
Do you copy, control center?

117
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,940
Someone without a ticket
has entered the game!

118
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,950
[CCTV Room]

119
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:47,560
Fei.

120
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,360
Pull up the CCTV footage for me.

121
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,190
Let's see who's snuck in without a ticket.

122
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,000
How brazen.

123
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,750
Got it, Boss.

124
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,080
Boss, she's here.

125
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,240
Zoom in. Zoom in.

126
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:03,720
It's her.

127
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,630
Boss,

128
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:06,190
I remember she's a regular player.

129
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,190
What is she doing?

130
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,360
Looks like he's searching for Qin Xiaoyi.

131
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:12,920
Boss.

132
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,100
She didn't change into costume.

133
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,430
It won't be good
if other players see her like this.

134
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,040
Zheng Qi. Zheng Qi.

135
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,640
Do you copy? Please respond.

136
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,390
Yes, you've reached Freckled Li.

137
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,830
There's a female player
who didn't change into costume

138
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:22,680
heading your way.

139
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,190
Stop her and bring her out.

140
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,360
Copy that.

141
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,680
I think it should be here.

142
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,600
Excuse me,

143
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,680
you have to leave now.

144
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,510
Freckled Li,

145
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,310
give me some time.

146
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,000
I'll leave as soon as I see Qin Xiaoyi.

147
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,870
No can do.

148
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:36,560
Boss said

149
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,360
you have to leave now.

150
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,360
What you're doing is
against the rules, you know?

151
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,270
As soon as I see Qin Xiaoyi,

152
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,070
I'll say just one thing

153
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,180
and leave right away.

154
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,310
How about this? You can follow me.

155
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,840
I promise I won't cause any trouble, okay?

156
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,640
No.

157
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,750
You're already causing trouble
just by being here.

158
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,750
Leave. Leave now.

159
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,210
Come here, guys!

160
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,390
Freckled Li is handing out a new mission!

161
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,390
H-He's handing out a new mission!

162
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,159
You've got a new mission?

163
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:52,510
Right, talk to him.

164
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,570
What mission is it?

165
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:55,840
There's no mission.

166
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,159
I've got no clues here.

167
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,040
No clues at all.

168
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,850
I've finally found you.

169
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,690
Why are you here?

170
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,540
Commander Qin.

171
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,950
I've got important matters
to discuss with you.

172
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,150
Come with me for a bit.

173
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,410
Excuse me.

174
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,950
So you're here, my contact up the chain,

175
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,370
Qin Xiaoyi.

176
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,640
Why did you barge in here?

177
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,630
I'm sorry.

178
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,150
May I ask

179
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,030
when Qin Xiaoyi will come out?

180
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,150
Mr. Pei.

181
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,960
A murder mystery game here

182
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,220
lasts at least 4 hours,

183
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,970
and Qin Xiaoyi is the one
with the highest win rate.

184
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,780
I don't think you're so idle

185
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:21,070
as to wait until this game's over, right?

186
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,630
Ms. Hu, you know this place so well.

187
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,430
Sounds like you come here often.

188
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:28,030
Since Zhuling lost the Design Competition,

189
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,910
I've indeed got plenty of time to spare.

190
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:30,970
I can afford to wait

191
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,680
this little bit of time.

192
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,810
Alright, let's do that.

193
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,390
Why did you come out here as well?

194
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,720
The game isn't over yet.

195
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,390
I lost.

196
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,840
So fast?

197
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,080
You didn't deliberately lose

198
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,360
to get out early, did you?

199
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,290
My professional integrity
wouldn't allow me to do that.

200
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:59,650
S-So you...

201
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,750
I got distracted.

202
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,630
You, oh you.

203
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,180
Just put your mind at ease.

204
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,710
What could I possibly do to Hu Xiu?

205
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:07,240
I wasn't talking about you.

206
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,050
What business do you have with Qin Xiaoyi?

207
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:14,750
I...

208
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,740
You'd better be honest.

209
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,200
I saw everything just now.

210
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,440
This is my fault.

211
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,480
I think it was probably because of me

212
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,170
that Ms. Hu barged in here.

213
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,080
Because of you?

214
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,300
Was it because of you or Qin Xiaoyi?

215
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,150
Ms. Hu

216
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,550
probably didn't want me to recognize

217
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,790
this NPC here.

218
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,590
I also just found out myself

219
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,830
that he works here.

220
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,750
Let me introduce.

221
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,920
Qin Xiaoyi here...

222
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,060
He's my younger brother.

223
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,080
Younger brother?

224
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,990
Ms. Hu, are you waiting for me?

225
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:35,510
Why did you suddenly come to
this murder mystery game place?

226
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,060
Zhiyu didn't tell us

227
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,430
that he works here.

228
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:41,230
I only found out by chance.

229
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,630
I was curious, so I wanted

230
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,290
to come and confirm it myself.

231
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,960
Don't worry,

232
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,200
I won't make things difficult
for my own brother.

233
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,910
Mr. Pei, when you deliberately
leaked news

234
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,550
of Zhuling's cooperation with Yueheng

235
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,750
on the lane hotel project ahead of time,

236
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,850
you didn't care that Mr. Xiao
was your brother, did you?

237
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:10,520
So this is what you've been upset about
all along.

238
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,920
There are so many lanes
in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang area—

239
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,180
it's nothing unusual.

240
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,450
If the ideas happened to overlap,

241
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,240
we can only say it was a coincidence.

242
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,870
Besides,

243
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,480
it was business competition to begin with—

244
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,010
it's every man for himself.

245
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,080
Do you understand?

246
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,270
A coincidence?

247
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:29,150
Fine, if you say it was a coincidence,
let's say it was.

248
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,790
He won anyway.

249
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,670
So in your opinion, Ms. Hu,

250
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,740
I acted improperly

251
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,250
and lacked ability,

252
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,960
so I deserved to lose?

253
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:47,440
But do you really know Xiao Zhiyu well?

254
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,640
Is he really so upright
and proper himself?

255
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,590
He's just a thief

256
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,270
who, at the age of 12,

257
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,260
dared to sneak into my father's study

258
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,450
and try cracking the safe's code.

259
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:02,820
A thief?

260
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,510
What did he steal?

261
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,380
What do you think was in the safe?

262
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,660
How would I know what he wanted to steal?

263
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,570
As a child, he dared to steal
from our home;

264
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,080
and ever since he grew up,
he's been doing everything possible

265
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,610
to humiliate the Pei family

266
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,790
and Zhuling.

267
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,480
Between him and me,

268
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,870
it's never been
as simple as business competition.

269
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,210
But what disappoints me most

270
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,670
is that such a smart person

271
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,620
as you, Ms. Hu,

272
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,750
actually chose him.

273
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,080
Let's go.

274
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,330
Let's have lunch together tomorrow.

275
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,020
To celebrate you
securing Lyman's new project.

276
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,570
You know perfectly well

277
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,750
whose idea it was.

278
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,840
I was helping

279
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,790
at Regard

280
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:14,870
when I accidentally found out

281
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:17,400
that Pei Zhen joined
the murder mystery game.

282
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:19,890
I remember you said

283
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:22,060
that only in murder mystery games

284
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,990
could you not have to be Xiao Zhiyu.

285
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,120
Although I don't know

286
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,080
why you don't want to be Xiao Zhiyu,

287
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,510
I'll make sure to preserve

288
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,870
this sanctuary for you.

289
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,550
It's just I didn't expect

290
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,520
that he would still find out.

291
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,870
Is he really your elder brother?

292
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:44,510
No.

293
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,870
Not by blood.

294
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,510
I figured.

295
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,110
You have different surnames

296
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,010
and don't look alike at all.

297
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,200
A blended family?

298
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,600
It was a long time ago.

299
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,930
I'm here to collect coffee.

300
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,370
No need to check.

301
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,900
I placed all these orders.

302
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:27,240
I had no idea that you, Mr. Gong,

303
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,120
loves

304
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,650
Regard's coffee this much.

305
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:33,050
I'm just getting it
for a young guy who works at our club.

306
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:34,560
I only drink whiskey.

307
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,000
Is that Pei Zhen

308
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,660
really Xiao Zhiyu's brother?

309
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,960
If it weren't for what happened yesterday,

310
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,910
who would have known

311
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:54,790
that his stepfather is

312
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:57,400
such a renowned figure
in the construction industry?

313
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,260
So why is he still working so hard?

314
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,510
Haven't you known Mr. Xiao
for a long time?

315
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,030
I have,

316
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,790
but you know his temperament.

317
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:07,599
It's not like
he reports everything to me, right?

318
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,790
The two of us met

319
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,750
when we were in college in America.

320
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,069
In the college, apart from

321
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:13,680
second-generation immigrants
and rich kids,

322
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,069
there were only struggling students
supported by their entire families.

323
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:18,000
Since he didn't bring up

324
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,680
his family affairs himself,

325
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,000
I wasn't in the right place to pry.

326
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,589
So,

327
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,160
what was he like back in America?

328
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:29,680
Well, he...

329
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,950
He was indeed quite unusual.

330
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,880
His family

331
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,810
never came to visit him in college,

332
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,830
and he didn't socialize with
any of us classmates, either.

333
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,400
Besides attending classes,

334
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,750
he just worked part-time outside.

335
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,810
He lived completely in his own world.

336
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:50,350
We only met his mother

337
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,000
on graduation day.

338
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,350
But their relationship

339
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,550
seemed...

340
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,590
How did it seem?

341
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,640
Well...

342
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,070
They seemed

343
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,640
very distant

344
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,610
and awkward.

345
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,110
Mom.

346
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,240
Zhiyu, you're here.

347
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:17,540
Come on, have a seat.

348
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,590
Zhiyu.

349
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,550
It's been ages. Why do I feel like

350
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,030
you've lost even more weight?

351
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,160
Come on, have a seat.

352
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,920
You're here, Zhiyu.

353
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:30,350
No drinks for me.

354
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,240
Alright, sir.

355
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,310
Zhiyu.

356
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,310
Good boy.

357
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,830
It's only been a few years,

358
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:38,510
and you've turned an unknown small studio

359
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,960
into what it is today.

360
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,170
Your prospects are limitless.

361
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:45,960
Zhiyu.

362
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,110
Uncle Pei is complimenting you.

363
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,200
You're too kind.

364
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,940
You must all be hungry.

365
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,720
Let's eat.

366
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:55,880
Yeah.

367
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,440
It's rare for our whole family
to be together.

368
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,570
Let's start eating.

369
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,350
Wanyue.

370
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,060
I've ordered

371
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,860
all your favorite dishes.

372
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,550
Zhiyu.

373
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:08,120
I specially ordered this fish for you.

374
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,950
I forgot to ask them
to remove the green onions.

375
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,000
Let me remove them for you.

376
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,640
Mom,

377
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,030
I can

378
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,640
eat green onions now.

379
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,280
But when you were little...

380
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,930
That was all in the past.

381
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,050
Mom.

382
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:43,640
I remember you used to

383
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,050
really love these
sweet and sour lotus root slices.

384
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,050
Please have more.

385
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:47,920
Mrs. Xiao,

386
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,070
your blood sugar has been high
these past few years.

387
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,790
I specifically ordered
many vegetarian dishes for you.

388
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:52,790
Please eat more of those.

389
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,520
Zhen, you still remember that?

390
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,400
Zhiyu.

391
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,780
I packed some food for you.

392
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:15,040
You didn't eat anything just now.

393
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,370
Work is important, but you need to
take care of yourself too.

394
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:23,440
This is the restaurant's signature snack,

395
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,510
called...

396
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,780
Crab shell pastry.

397
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,260
Right, crab shell pastry.

398
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,790
You've been in Shanghai for years.

399
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,790
You must've tried it before, right?

400
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:32,720
Mom.

401
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:36,340
I didn't know your blood sugar
had been high these years.

402
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,410
It's nothing. Just a minor issue.

403
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:40,970
I'm leaving.

404
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,270
I've grown up.

405
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,590
I make my own choice.

406
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,410
As for the money,

407
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,070
I'll figure something out myself.

408
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,480
This isn't about money.

409
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:16,110
Why do you have to study architecture?

410
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,200
And you had to choose a college

411
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,270
so far away from me.

412
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,270
What are you standing there for?

413
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,110
Come and help.

414
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,110
Come on.

415
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:47,520
Here comes help.

416
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:49,830
Thank you.

417
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,550

I'll bring it over for you in a bit.

439
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,790
Thank you then.

440
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:24,920
No need to bring it upstairs.

441
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,320

448
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,270
Crab shell pastry?

449
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,200
You bought this?

450
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,080
Someone gave it to me.

451
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,710
That's a lot.

452
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:15,760
Here.

453
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:22,250
This is to warm your hands.

454
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,000
It's okay.

455
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,060
I'll just apply some hand cream on it.

456
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,480
What are you doing with this?

457
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:57,960
Here.

458
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,540
Put your hand in it.

459
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,550
If you want to protect your hands,

460
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,280
this method is very effective.

461
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:24,480
Mr. Xiao, I didn't know
you had this kind of knowledge.

462
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,550
Back when I worked part-time abroad,

463
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,880
washing dishes in the cold

464
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,010
would make sores break out on my hands.

465
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,450
Later, a coworker taught me this trick.

466
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,640
You...

467
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,480
What?

468
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,720
I just never expected

469
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,980
that someone like you,

470
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,830
a golden boy,

471
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,790
would do such hard labor.

472
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,750
I'm no golden boy.

473
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,310
He's just a thief,

474
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,000
who, at the age of 12,

475
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,890
dared to sneak into my father's study

476
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:59,090
and try cracking the safe's code.

477
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,240
How did it seem?

478
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,000
They seemed

479
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,480
very distant

480
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:05,340
and awkward.

481
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,440
How come?

482
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,310
I only happened to hear about it later

483
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:10,960
that

484
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,200
his biological father passed away early,

485
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,750
and his mother remarried soon after.

486
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,510
He

487
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,180
didn't want to spend
his stepfather's money,

488
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,270
so he became independent at an early age

489
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,330
and left that home.

490
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,400
Did you

491
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:26,350
have a really hard life back then?

492
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,130
I'm going upstairs.

493
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:43,890
Remember to apply it yourself, too.

494
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:09,030
Wang also wanted to come,

495
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:12,000
but he really couldn't make it.

496
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,170
Guangming really pushes himself.

497
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,130
There's no other choice.

498
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:18,830
He's running back and forth
between two sides right now,

499
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,230
and the pressure's huge.

500
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,350
Yeah.

501
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,440
If you need any help,

502
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,510
just let me know.

503
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,440
What's on your mind?

504
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,960
So,

505
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,000
that Qin Xiaoyi from Group A

506
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,110
is your boss?

507
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,030
And that fengshui master

508
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,350
is Gong Huaicong?

509
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,000
I didn't say anything at first

510
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,600
because I was worried
my boss would silence me.

511
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,550
Because in their club,

512
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:45,440
except for Mr. Gong,

513
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,640
no one knows about his second identity.

514
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,680
What about later?

515
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,070
Later, it was out of
my own selfish motive.

516
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:53,920
Well,

517
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,110
I just think

518
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:58,910
he really enjoys
playing the murder mystery game.

519
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,000
You didn't want anyone to spoil his fun.

520
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:05,310
That's why you rushed over
to stop Mr. Pei that day, right?

521
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,240
Xiu.

522
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,960
I think

523
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,420
you've got other feelings

524
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,720
for Xiao Zhiyu.

525
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,030
Look,

526
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:18,000
if you only saw him as your boss,

527
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:20,070
you'd only care about

528
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,480
the rent bills

529
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,550
and the results of the games,
things like that.

530
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:25,590
But now, you care about his feelings

531
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:27,120
and you want him to be happy.

532
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,310
I...

533
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:29,660
Also,

534
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,160
I think his feelings for you

535
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,560
aren't so simple either.

536
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,110
He's living at your place,

537
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,710
supposedly for the project.

538
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,030
But the fact that
he agreed to be your roommate—

539
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,430
roommates of all things—

540
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,580
that's a bit hard to make sense of.

541
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,080
A man and a woman living together,
you know?

542
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,200
Xiu.

543
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,880
I think your spring is
just around the corner.

544
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:08,070
Let's move to another place.

545
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,440
Waiter, check please.

546
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,920
I'll pay.

547
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,560
-I know you spoil me the most, Xiu.
-This is the receipt.

548
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,890
It's 380 yuan in total.

549
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,350
We're celebrating our restaurant's
second anniversary lately.

550
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:20,210
Here's a customized gift for you.

551
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,160
Thank you.

552
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,440
Today, we received

553
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,640
Lyman's authorization letter
for the design intent.

554
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,350
This project

555
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,480
is finally secured.

556
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:38,070
There have been
quite a few issues recently.

557
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,790
This result is thanks to
everyone's hard work.

558
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:42,320
You'll definitely get
your project bonuses.

559
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:43,390
Excellent!

560
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,030
Today,

561
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:49,640
Mr. Wu from Huasheng Materials
is also here with us.

562
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,640
Thank you, Mr. Wu,

563
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,910
for taking time to attend
our celebration banquet.

564
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:53,940
We also hope

565
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,640
you'll continue to support us, Mr. Wu.

566
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,350
Don't mention it.

567
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,000
It's our honor

568
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,660
to collaborate with D Studio.

569
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:00,480
Come on,

570
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,310
let's all raise a toast to Mr. Wu.

571
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:02,590
Come on.

572
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,550
Alright, to Mr. Wu!

573
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:05,070
Here's to the smooth progress
of our project.

574
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:05,510
Cheers.

575
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:06,710
Don't drink too much.

576
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,030
Just a little bit.

577
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,530
Don't be like last time.

578
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,370
Cheers. To you, Mr. Wu.

579
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,590
Hu Xiu,

580
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,700
congratulations on passing probation.

581
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,830
Passing probation?

582
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:28,410
Aren't there still 2 months left?

583
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,880
It's been moved up.

584
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,540
Mr. Xiao already informed me.

585
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,160
As expected from someone
I spotted from the beginning.

586
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:34,720
Dong Qi.

587
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,700
Weren't you looking for the restroom?

588
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,500
I found it.

589
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,140
Come on, I'll show you the way.

590
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,270
Let's go.

591
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,040
-Mr. Wu.
-Ms. Hu.

592
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,500
No more drinks.

593
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:06,670
Mr. Xiao said

594
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,450
you couldn't

595
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,680
hold your liquor, Ms. Hu.

596
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,540
Better listen to Mr. Xiao, right?

597
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:15,480
Ms. Hu.

598
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:18,070
I heard from your colleagues

599
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:21,210
that you used to work
at a real estate company.

600
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:22,240
Yes.

601
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,270
From real estate

602
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,510
to architectural design—

603
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,830
it must've been hard for you, Ms. Hu.

604
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,350
This industry is quite demanding.

605
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,130
If you want to achieve something,

606
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:37,660
you have to sacrifice a lot.

607
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,550
Compared to rough guys like us,

608
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:43,550
it's even harder for you young ladies.

609
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,750
However,

610
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,320
with Mr. Xiao's support,

611
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,440
Ms. Hu,

612
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,690
you're much luckier than most people.

613
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,160
Especially the fact that Mr. Xiao

614
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,760
is such a talented young man.

615
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,110
A man with such potential

616
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,550
is rare to come by.

617
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:02,170
This mushroom

618
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,400
tastes a bit strange.

619
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:04,510
Just like I find

620
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:06,570
what you just said quite strange too.

621
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,240
You misunderstood.

622
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:13,410
I didn't mean anything negative about you.

623
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,440
I just thought

624
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:18,030
if there are suitable projects
in the future,

625
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,560
we could collaborate more.

626
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:20,630
Mr. Wu,

627
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,650
I'm not the one
who can decide on collaborations.

628
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:24,980
I understand.

629
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,170
I spoke out of turn.

630
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,680
Mr. Xiao, you've finished your business?

631
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,350
Ms. Hu and I were having a nice chat.

632
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,510
Hu Xiu.

633
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,550
There's a conference call in 5 minutes.

634
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:42,400
Come with me.

635
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,480
Mr. Xiao.

636
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,940
What conference call?

637
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,740
What did Mr. Wu say to you just now?

638
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,680
Nothing.

639
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,520
Then why are you upset?

640
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:03,830
I'm not.

641
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,960
You weren't even there just now.

642
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,560
How could you know I'm upset?

643
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:15,290
Actions speak louder than words.

644
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:20,880
Do you know

645
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,210
that you've always had a habit?

646
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,400
Whenever you're upset,

647
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,410
you fidget with your fingers.

648
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:34,640
I'm okay.

649
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,930
I just tripped accidentally.

650
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,340
Mr. Xiao, you seem to enjoy
observing your subordinates a lot.

651
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:54,750
Can you tell me now?

652
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,880
What happened just now?

653
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:01,000
He underestimated me.

654
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,160
But it doesn't matter
what he thinks of me.

655
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,830
As long as his
3D spatial construction technology

656
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:08,360
can help our studio,
that's all that matters.

657
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:16,320
Stop.

658
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:17,120
Mr. Xiao,

659
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,690
please stop observing me.

660
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,070
I couldn't care less about you.

661
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:15,880
Mr. Xiao.

662
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,230
Why didn't you wake me up

663
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,920
when we arrived?

664
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,670
I've got nothing urgent to do.

665
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,320
Get off.

666
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:51,320
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

667
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:51,920
Mr. Xiao.

668
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,960
I couldn't get any strength.

669
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,400
I just

670
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:57,270
couldn't open this.

671
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:58,320
Cut it out.

672
00:35:58,510 --> 00:35:59,920
I've used this trick before.

673
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,510
Get off.

674
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:06,880
I'm okay.

675
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:08,980
Well then.

676
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,000
Snow?

677
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:44,850
It's snowing.

678
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:30,150
Mr. Xiao,

679
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,630
it's really snowing.

680
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:32,320
Look.

681
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:33,880
Hu Xiu,

682
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:35,990
are you hallucinating?

683
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:36,960
I

684
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:47,320
think

685
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,940
there are flower petals falling too.
