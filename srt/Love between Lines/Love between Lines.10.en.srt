[Episode 10]

3
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,880
How am I supposed to explain to Zhao

4
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,570
that I'm moving back?

5
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:16,950
Xiu,

6
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,400
help me finish the leftover cake

7
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,560
from my shop.

8
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:24,750
Zhao,

9
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:27,660
I'm moving back to my old place
in the lane.

10
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,380
I've already discussed it with my boss.

11
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,640
We're in the home stretch of the project,

12
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,680
so it's more convenient for work
if we share a place.

13
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,140
That makes sense. I'd be worried

14
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,310
if you lived alone.

15
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:41,630
What did you say?

16
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,910
I said this room is too small.

17
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,820
It's really not convenient for you
to live here.

18
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,280
Moving back is a good idea.

19
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,240
Let me help you pack up.

20
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,310
It really isn't convenient.

21
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,070
I'll take you back to the lane later.

22
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,330
You have so much stuff.

23
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,100
No need.

24
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,950
My boss lent me his car.

25
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,810
You're on such good terms with
your boss now?

26
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:15,950
Not really.

27
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,190
I just earned it

28
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,630
by working overtime.

29
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,100
Alright.

30
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:08,820
Mr. Xiao.

31
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,280
You just parked my car on the street?

32
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,280
I just finished moving everything.

33
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,580
I'll go park it in the lot now.

34
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,230
Mr. Xiao,

35
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,900
I can go by myself.

36
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:26,430
It's just a short walk.
You don't need to come with me.

37
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,290
But it's still a bit of a distance.

38
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,670
Mr. Xiao,

39
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,750
do we really have to wash the car
at this hour?

40
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,220
It's just a bit of mud.

41
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,760
And it's still raining.

42
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,550
I've checked the weather forecast.

43
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,150
The rain will stop
by the time the car is washed.

44
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,380
It's okay.

45
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,280
I can manage with only one hand.

46
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,550
Then... then go ahead and wash it.

47
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,340
I'll go back and unpack.

48
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:04,380
Okay.

49
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:32,950
You left something?

50
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,190
Yes, yes.

51
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,310
I left my conscience behind.

52
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,430
Here, give it to me.

53
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,030

Moving

94
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,190

I remember you love these konjac jellies.

Moving is quite exhausting.

99
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,430
Especially when you have

100
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:51,230
a roommate who doesn't understand
the meaning of "peace and quiet."

101
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,150
Ms. Hu,

102
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,510
why haven't I seen you at the café lately?

103
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,600
I've already moved.

104
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:07,670
Why?

105
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,480
Is it because of that video?

106
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:10,820
Video?

107
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,150
What video?

108
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:27,750
Okay.

109
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,330
I'll communicate with them again.

110
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:31,080
Goodbye.

111
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,270
Mr. Xiao.

112
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,789
I'd like to leave two hours early

113
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:37,700
today.

114
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:38,700
How about

115
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,390
you take a taxi home tonight?

116
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:42,289
What happened?

117
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,500
It's Zhao,

118
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,430
my friend who runs the café.

119
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,070
She got into a fight at the club last time

120
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,520
and got herself into some trouble.

121
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,510
And I moved out
without knowing anything about it.

122
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,510
I want to go back to the café for a bit.

123
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:53,950
Okay.

124
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:55,460
Wait.

125
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,950
You have my keys, right?

126
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,090
Take my car.

127
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,990
Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

128
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,030
Ms. Zhao, sorry to bother you.

129
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,130
What's the matter?

130
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,030
Ms. Zhao,

131
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,680
I'm just here to notify you

132
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,740
that next quarter, your shop's rent

133
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,430
will be raised according to regulations.

134
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,860
No, that's not right.

135
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,800
I've already discussed this
with the industrial park management.

136
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,670
I provide discounted coffee
in exchange for

137
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,550
keeping the rent the same.

138
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,810
Why the sudden change?

139
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,070
Well...

140
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,340
All those previous business arrangements

141
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,980
are no longer valid.

142
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,820
Did something happen?

143
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,430
Ms. Zhao,

144
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:46,390
your shop has been reported
for mixed commercial and residential use.

145
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:46,950
We can't

146
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,680
just ignore this kind of thing.

147
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,100
After the leadership found out,

148
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,390
they stopped
all previous cooperation with you.

149
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:52,990
That's why

150
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,790
they sent me here to verify the situation.

151
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,980
But I specifically consulted with
the property management about this.

152
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,030
My second-floor loft

153
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,460
isn't open to the public.

154
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,190
They said short-term residence
wasn't a problem.

155
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:04,550
Yeah, that's true.

156
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,460
Normally, we wouldn't be
so strict about it.

157
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,260
But you see...

158
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,760
someone filed a report,

159
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,620
so we have to take action, right?

160
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:13,980
Well,

161
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,700
can you tell me who reported it?

162
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,500
I'd like to discuss it with them.

163
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,340
Well...

164
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,030
I'm afraid
I can't disclose that information.

165
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,860
Sorry about that.

166
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,700
I found out.

167
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,630
It was all Qian Jinxin's doing.

168
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,100
Ms. Zhao,

169
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,100
I've sent you the complete video.

170
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:54,950
Maybe it'll help.

171
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:55,910
You didn't know all along

172
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:59,170
that your bestie was
flirting with another actor, did you?

173
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,190
He hit a woman.

174
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:02,980
He hit a woman?

175
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:03,740
Shameless!

176
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,270
I'm the owner

177
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,550
of the Regard Café.

178
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,310
Here's what really happened

179
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:20,340
that day

180
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,470
at the murder mystery game club.

181
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:32,030
The most beautiful café owner in the world—

182
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,150
do you still have coffee?

183
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,670
There's only one cup of cold coffee left,

184
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,330
and the latte art is terrible.

185
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,240
If you don't mind,

186
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,460
it's on the house.

187
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:45,770
♪ Under the streetlight,
I grow increasingly weary ♪

188
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:46,530

00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:30,700
Boss,

241
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,220
I'm innocent.

242
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,700
It was those two girls
who were giving me trouble.

243
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,270
Enough!

244
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,230
There's a complete video online.

245
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,430
Stop making excuses!

246
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:39,620
Because of you alone,

247
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,860
the reputation of the entire
industrial park staff has been tarnished!

248
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,030
The impact is terrible!

249
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,580
Come to my office

250
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,340
first thing tomorrow morning!

251
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,550
Boss, I was wrong.

252
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,100
Boss...

253
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,230
After you started sharing
an apartment with your boss,

254
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,750
you're sharing a car too?

255
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,900
Things between him and me

256
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,860
are rather complicated.

257
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:20,150
Once things get complicated,
they become dangerous.

258
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,790
What does he want?

259
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:27,650
Qian Jinxin, are you crazy?

260
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,860
If you won't let me live in peace,

261
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,280
neither of you will have peace!

262
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,280
Xiu, be careful.

263
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:31,950
It's okay.

264
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,190
Stop right there!

265
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:06,860
Pei Zhen?

266
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:08,990
Xiu,

267
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:10,970
we need to call the police now.

268
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:18,650
[For plot purposes only—do not imitate]

269
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:56,000
How did you even drive like that?

270
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,300
You've got a death wish?

271
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,900
Do you even know how to drive?

272
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:08,670
Wait...

273
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:09,980
W-What do you want?

274
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,590
I've got a death wish.

275
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,270
Go ahead and call the police.

276
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:17,210
You...

277
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,670
Are you nuts?

278
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,580
Mr. Pei.

279
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:28,620
Ms. Hu.

280
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,430
I'm really sorry about tonight.

281
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:31,390
It all happened so suddenly,

282
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:31,950
and I...

283
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,480
didn't see your car coming.

284
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,430
It's okay.

285
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,670
It wasn't your fault that the car got hit.

286
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:39,500
Actually, you didn't need to
chase after him.

287
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,270
I wasn't thinking much at that moment.

288
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,460
I saw him running away,

289
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,730
so I thought I'd take a shortcut
to stop him.

290
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,550
Who knew he would turn around right then?

291
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,950
Now that I think about it,

292
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,220
it was pretty scary.

293
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,790
Last time at the property site,

294
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,850
did I put you in a difficult position?

295
00:16:56,390 --> 00:17:00,340
Mr. Xiao wouldn't make things difficult
for someone over such a small matter.

296
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,860
I just think it's a pity.

297
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,440
If our two companies weren't competitors,

298
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,569
you and I could have been good friends.

299
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,670
It seems we need to win

300
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,530
the Design Competition quickly.

301
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,980
He won't lose either.

302
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:19,480
All done, Xiu.

303
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,150
The police said

304
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,220
that administrative penalties
for him and for us are inevitable.

305
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,260
As for criminal liability,

306
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,650
they'll investigate further.

307
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:26,589
If they need our cooperation,

308
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:27,720
they'll contact us.

309
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,720
You're Mr. Pei, right?

310
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,190
Thank you so much for today.

311
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,500
-Nice to meet you.
-Sorry for the trouble.

312
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,830
I just heard from the officer

313
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,740
that vehicle damage claims are
quite complicated,

314
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,150
and it seems you need some kind of
liability determination report...

315
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:38,980
It's fine.

316
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,050
My assistant is coming.

317
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,390
I'll have him take care of it.

318
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:41,980
Okay.

319
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,060
Then,

320
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,350
let's exchange contact info.

321
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:44,540
Sure.

322
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,110
If you need my help later,

323
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:46,910
just contact me anytime.

324
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:48,040
I'll scan your code.

325
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,440
I was the one driving the car.

326
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,430
But you were helping me with my situation,

327
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:53,830
so of course I should take responsibility.

328
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,350
Mr. Pei, so that's settled then.

329
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:58,150
If anything comes up later,
just contact me directly.

330
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:58,680
Alright.

331
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,040
We'll be going now.

332
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:00,870
Bye-bye, Ms. Hu.

333
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:01,430
Bye-bye.

334
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:15,350
Mr. Pei.

335
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:16,870
Are you alright?

336
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:17,400
I'm fine.

337
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,630
Just finished dealing with the penalty.

338
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:20,500
But I don't understand—

339
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,670
why did you waste your time

340
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,700
helping them?

341
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,110
That's Xiao Zhiyu's car, isn't it?

342
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:28,910
That's right.

343
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:31,190
It's hard not to be curious, isn't it?

344
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,780
You have to play the long game
to catch the big fish.

345
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,460
What about your car?

346
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,740
Should I take it in for repairs first

347
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,110
and then deal with that guy, or...

348
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,440
Just get rid of it for me.

349
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,900
A defective product is
a defective product.

350
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,430
It'll still be defective,
even if it's fixed.

351
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,060
Mr. Xiao,

352
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,700
you're still up?

353
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,670
You startled me.

354
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,390
If I could use this hand properly,

355
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:20,250
I wouldn't be sitting here all night
doing nothing.

356
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,390
I'm sorry.

357
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:24,950
I...

358
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,680
got held up
helping my friend with something.

359
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,430
I can work now.

360
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,260
Something happened?

361
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:46,980
Mr. Xiao.

362
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,150
Actually...

363
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,020
just now...

364
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,950
I almost crashed your car.

365
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:54,840
Are you okay?

366
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,430
But

367
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:59,730
I ran into Mr. Pei.

368
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,730
That's basically what happened.

369
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,300
I don't know
why it was such a coincidence,

370
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,230
but I thought I should let you know.

371
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:12,500
Don't worry.

372
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,560
I didn't talk about work with Mr. Pei.

373
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,060
If there's anything
that needs to be handled later,

374
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,520
I'll have Zhao take care of it
to avoid anything

375
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,220
that could cause misunderstandings.

376
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,020
Next time,

377
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,570
contact the car owner first
if anything happens.

378
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,460
I mean,

379
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,220
contact me first.

380
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,500
Got it.

381
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,670
We're not continuing with the drawings?

382
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:39,780
Get some rest.

383
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:40,680
Hello, Zhao.

384
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:42,500
Hello, Xiu.

385
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,100
Check the industrial park's
announcement now.

386
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:45,870
You know what?

387
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,110
Early this morning,

388
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:50,310
the park's leadership was waiting for me
at the entrance.

389
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,710
Did they give you trouble again?

390
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,110
No.

391
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,540
The leadership
personally apologized to me.

392
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:59,300
They said my cooperation with the park
will continue as usual.

393
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,220
And the rent

394
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,980
won't increase at all.

395
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:03,910
That's great!

396
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:05,220
That's not all.

397
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,480
Let me show you a video.

398
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,980
Stop filming... Stop filming!

399
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:16,830
Someone like you

400
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:17,500
should have been kicked out long ago!

401
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:17,910
Stop filming!

402
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:18,540
That's right!

403
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,300
Stop filming!

404
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,910
I've already apologized!

405
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,540
Shameless!

406
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:22,870
Don't cover your face!

407
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,470
Stop filming! Stop filming!

408
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,630
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

409
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:26,430
Stop filming!

410
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:29,980
I asked around.

411
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,780
Apparently, the owner of ME Club

412
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,150
pressured the park management,

413
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:33,830
firmly refusing to allow

414
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,910
someone like Qian Jinxin
to manage the park.

415
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:37,780
So he was fired immediately.

416
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:40,820
The ME Club owner?

417
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,590
Good morning, Mr. Xiao.

418
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,720
Breakfast is ready.

419
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,260
That's what we didn't finish last night.

420
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,060
Let's continue this afternoon.

421
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:17,950
Also,

422
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:19,630
this bowl of porridge—

423
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:21,360
I bought it as a thank-you gift.

424
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,430
You helped out with

425
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:27,820
the vendors' protest too, didn't you?

426
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,110
I just wanted to get justice

427
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,240
for my injured hand.

428
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:33,470
I understand.

429
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,100
I understand.

430
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:40,840
What are these?

431
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,350
Onion bulbs.

432
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,260
I want to grow green onions.

433
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,630
If we're cooking at home,

434
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:46,980
how can we not have green onions?

435
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:47,540
Real onions.

436
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:47,980
No need.

437
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,240
Your delivery is here!

438
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:50,700
Coming!

439
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:54,220
Hello, your flowers.

440
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,150
Thank you.

441
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:55,910
Have a nice day.

442
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:56,780
You too.

443
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,020
Who sent them?

444
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,980
I bought them myself.

445
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,500
Is it also a thank-you gift for me?

446
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,260
No.

447
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,260
Of course, Mr. Xiao,

448
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,390
if you like them,

449
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,110
I can share half with you.

450
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:13,740
No need.

451
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,870
Another delivery?

452
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:21,910
Xiu?

453
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,510
Xiu, open the door.

454
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:25,500
It's my dad.

455
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:26,460
My dad is here.

456
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,660
Quick, quick, hurry!

457
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:30,650
Xiu?

458
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,220
Bathroom! Bathroom!

459
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:47,500
Dad!

460
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:48,870
What were you doing?

461
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:49,740
I've been knocking forever,
and you didn't answer.

462
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,830
I... I was listening to music.

463
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,630
I was... I was dancing in my room.

464
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:55,230
Dancing.

465
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,350
Why did you come so suddenly

466
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,980
without telling me first?

467
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:02,510
Do I... do I have to report to you
before coming?

468
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,260
I... I guess not.

469
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,780
I made some food for you.

470
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,430
Get a couple of bowls and dish it out.

471
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:09,060
Okay.

472
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,710
Why is there a new table here?

473
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,780
I needed it for work,

474
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,840
so I just bought it.

475
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:21,460
Xiu.

476
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:22,840
Your mother and I

477
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,410
came all this way
to bring you those two bottles of baijiu.

478
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:26,270
You didn't give them to your boss?

479
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:30,630
Dad, it'd be a waste
to give them to my boss.

480
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:31,500
He...

481
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:33,350
He has high blood pressure,
high blood sugar, and high cholesterol—

482
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,670
he can't even have a sip of alcohol.

483
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,150
If I eagerly gave him baijiu,

484
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:38,220
w-wouldn't that show I'm clueless?

485
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,150
T-That many health problems?

486
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,880
You should've told me earlier.

487
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:44,780
Dad, you don't need to bring me food.

488
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,510
I think I

489
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,060
can take care of myself.

490
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,060
Before you

491
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,430
say things like that next time,

492
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:50,590
put away this junk food

493
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,290
first.

494
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:51,860
It's the middle of the day.

495
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,460
Why are you having porridge?

496
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,400
I-It's leftover from breakfast.

497
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,800
Dad, don't worry about this.

498
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:00,260
I still have

499
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,190
a lot of work to do after I eat.

500
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:03,590
If I can't

501
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,950
complete my work on time,

502
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:06,430
no amount of gift-giving will help,

503
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:06,950
right?

504
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,150
Right, right.

505
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,870
Let me walk you out to get a taxi.

506
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:10,690
Let's go. Let's go.

507
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:11,020
Okay, okay.

508
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,260
I'm really busy today, Dad.

509
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:12,980
Okay, okay.

510
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:15,740
Wait, no rush.

511
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,300
What's that sound?

512
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,400
Maybe Dazhong is taking a shower!

513
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:25,190
His bathroom and our living room

514
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:26,920
are only separated by one wall.

515
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,630
No, the sound seems to be coming from
over there...

516
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:29,540
That's empty.

517
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,260
How could anyone be there, Dad?

518
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,740
Let me walk you out. Put your shoes on.

519
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,190
Okay.

520
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:34,060
Let me help you.

521
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:34,780
Okay, okay.

522
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,260
This foot.

523
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:36,910
Alright, that's it.

524
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:37,190
Be careful with your leg.

525
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:37,950
Go on with your work.

526
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,020
I'll walk you downstairs, Dad.

527
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:39,460
No need, no need.

528
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:39,950
Let me walk you...

529
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,300
Just focus on your work.

530
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:41,830
Don't let me hold you up.

531
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:42,300
Okay.

532
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:42,870
Bye.

533
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,390
I'll let you know when I'm free.

534
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:44,920
Alright!

535
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,690
Be careful going downstairs!

536
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:47,170
Okay.

537
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,310
Bye-bye!

538
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,190
Bye-bye!

539
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,050
What are you doing?

540
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,260
Mr. Xiao,

541
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,630
I'm really sorry.

542
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,780
It happened so suddenly.

543
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,110
I had no choice.

544
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,540
But I promise you—

545
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,540
three times max!

546
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,870
Three times max?

547
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:15,720
So that means there's still one more time?

548
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:17,430
Oh, you're right.

549
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,120
You even took a shower in there?

550
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,460
My thermos container...

551
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,220
-Dad!
-Dad.

552
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:34,150
U-Uncle, hello.

553
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:38,690
How did you get in?

554
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,660
Why didn't I hear anything?

555
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:45,670
-You didn't close the door.
-You didn't close the door.

556
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:57,210
Dad,

557
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,670
this is Yu.

558
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,100
You've met him before.

559
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,060
I know.

560
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,460
You're colleagues, right?

561
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:03,910
Yes.

562
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:05,700
You came today

563
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,060
to pick up a contract too?

564
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:09,870
Uncle, I came to get...

565
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:11,930
Go upstairs and change your clothes.

566
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:13,490
Don't catch a cold.

567
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:17,860
Go ahead.

568
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,220
You said you wanted to
focus on your career.

569
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,110
You said there were many things

570
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,110
more important than marriage.

571
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,470
I actually believed you.

572
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:37,400
You've forgotten about
Zhang Qiran already, haven't you?

573
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,930
I'm not against you dating.

574
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:39,460
But

575
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,740
how long has it been since you broke off
your engagement with him?

576
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,300
And now, you're...

577
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,310
well, you're already living together?

578
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,830
This lane isn't very big.

579
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:46,630
People see everything.

580
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:48,160
What will they think of you?

581
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,560
Why should I care what others think of me?

582
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,720
Yu and I are living together.

583
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,970
But we're not in a relationship.

584
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,410
He's my tenant.

585
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,480
To be precise, we're roommates.

586
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:01,350
Room...

587
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:02,590
Roommates?

588
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,540
Do your other colleagues

589
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,670
know that you two are living together?

590
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,730
Will they gossip about you?

591
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:14,960
My other colleagues

592
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:15,870
won't know.

593
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:17,790
That's good.

594
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,090
Because I've already resigned.

595
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,160
That baijiu...

596
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,260
I never gave it to Mr. Xu.

597
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,260
I got rid of him long ago.

598
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,500
He doesn't deserve it.

599
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,190
Also,

600
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:31,390
I didn't rent out the loft

601
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:33,020
because he was struggling financially

602
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,150
or needed help.

603
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:35,670
I did it

604
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:37,800
because I wanted the money myself.

605
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,900
Yu and I are indeed colleagues.

606
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,630
He's my boss,

607
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,950
the founder of D Design Studio.

608
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,630
W-W-What?

609
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:49,910
What? Design what?

610
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:50,430
What?

611
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:51,980
D Design Studio.

612
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:56,150
It's an architectural design company.

613
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,870
Why architectural design again?

614
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,190
No, you...

615
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:03,830
You said you weren't happy at work,
so you quit,

616
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,090
and I understand that.

617
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:06,260
Shanghai is so big.

618
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,630
There are so many companies.

619
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:09,500
You have experience
as a general manager's assistant,

620
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:09,980
right?

621
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,980
You could work at any company you want.

622
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,870
Why do you keep jumping around

623
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:14,700
and ending up back in architecture again?

624
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,460

What a hassle.

699
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,740
Xiu didn't tell you?

700
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,740
The dorm shuts the lights off

701
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,590

702
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,540
you know?

703
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,150
Dad, Mom,

704
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:53,500
I've redesigned our rooms.

705
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,500
Go take a look.

706
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:03,460
Dad? Mom?

707
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,380
Why are you here?

708
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,500
I'm taking your dad for a follow-up
at the hospital.

709
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,330
We were passing by, so we came to see you.

710
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:14,060
You became a regular employee?

711
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:17,949
Actually,

712
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:19,719
Shiyuan Real Estate is quite good.

713
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:22,620
Your cousin wanted to work there before
but couldn't get in.

714
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,750
I know. Let me walk you two to get a taxi.

715
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:13,620
You ordered
all this fried chicken and fries,

716
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,750
and you're just leaving it out here?

717
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,410
At least take it inside to eat.

718
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:18,890
And these flowers.

719
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,060
If you leave them like this,

720
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,120
they'll wilt soon.

721
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:41,270
The onion bulbs fell on the floor,

722
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:43,730
and you didn't even come out
to clean them up.

723
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:24,770
The drainpipe under the upstairs sink
is broken.

724
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:26,690
If you don't want the loft to flood,

725
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:27,890
come up and fix it now.

726
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,100
There are spare pipes
in the living room cabinet.

727
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,460
You can replace it yourself.

728
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,060
No.

729
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:33,820
My hand hurts.

730
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,830
Didn't we just replace the pipe
a few months ago?

731
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:27,090
Why is it broken again?

732
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,500
See for yourself.

733
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:45,560
Are you messing with me?

734
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,580
If I hadn't resorted to
such a dirty trick,

735
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:50,660
you would've stayed in bed
until the Design Competition.

736
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:51,660
I would not.

737
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,620
But you were right about one thing—

738
00:38:58,270 --> 00:38:59,230
not telling my parents

739
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,620
about changing jobs

740
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:03,050
was like setting a time bomb.

741
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:05,590
But you defused it yourself.

742
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:08,610
Aren't you still standing here
perfectly fine?

743
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:11,710
I have a way

744
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:14,230

Wait here.

746

Watch out.

747
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:23,240
You're taller than I am.

748
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:30,450
What's that method you mentioned?

749
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,100
It really is a good method.

750
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:44,140

How is it?

778
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,230
Not bad.

779
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:52,750
How about you?

780
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:55,640
Pretty good.

781
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,430
I've figured it out now.

782
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:03,580
There's only one shortcut

783
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,390
to solving everything—

784
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:06,790
and that is to win.

785
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:09,060
Win?

786
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:12,790
Something that difficult,

787
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:14,250
and you call it a shortcut?

788
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:18,620
Though it's difficult,

789
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:21,520
it can solve a lot of problems
all at once.

790
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:22,460
Look,

791
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:24,580
if we win this competition,

792
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:26,710
I can become a regular employee.

793
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:28,310
Once I become a regular employee,
I can get a raise

794
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:30,390
and work on
the follow-up project implementation.

795
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:31,140
When the project is implemented,

796
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:33,070
I'll have a small accomplishment.

797
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:34,390
Then, at that time,
no matter how my father...

798
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:35,320
Hold on, hold on.

799
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,020
You haven't "figured things out."

800
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,550
You're clearly pushing me.

801
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,550
I wouldn't dare.

802
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:49,620
They should be out at their stalls now.

803
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:50,180
Let's go, Mr. Xiao.

804
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,360
Let's go grab some breakfast.

805
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,290
What's the rush?

806
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,460
I'm in a rush.

807
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:56,140
I have to come back and draw the next one.

808
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,500
Come on, get moving. Let's go.
