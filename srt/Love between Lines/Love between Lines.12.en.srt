3
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,120
So,

4
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,370
he only moved into the lane 2 months ago?

5
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,350
Yes.

6
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,860
So it's really related to
Lyman's Design Competition.

7
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,060
It's related to Lyman?

8
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,560
Two months ago,

9
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,640
right when Lyman released the news

10
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,850
about the Design Competition.

11
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,780
He never does anything without purpose.

12
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,190
Are you saying

13
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,940
they are planning
a lane-style hotel this time?

14
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,820
But the lane theme is nothing new.

15
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,220
Traditional Jiangsu and Zhejiang buildings

16
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,180
are everywhere.

17
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,079
If he's doing this,

18
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,030
there must be something I don't know

19
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,960
that can increase his chances of winning.

20
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,710
It's a pity...

21
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,400
we don't have another Jiang Tianyi.

22
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:51,590
No.

23
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,710
I-I mean,

24
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,230
the Design Competition is coming soon.

25
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,680
Even if we knew

26
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,870
what they are planning,

27
00:02:58,870 --> 00:02:59,670
it would be...

28
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:00,870

The building form
emphasizes vertical lines,

31
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,120
with the top gradually receding inward,

32
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,400
creating a tall and elegant presence.

33
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,320
The design stresses symmetry,

34
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,100
proportion, and scale,

35
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,840
with a focus on luxurious decoration

36
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,200
and a three-part composition

37
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,200
in its architectural composition.

38
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,430
Well,

39
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,320
that concludes my presentation.

40
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:26,950
Mr. Pei.

41
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,190
Mr. Pei,

42
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,190
do you think

43
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,800
there is anything in our current proposal

44
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,130
that needs adjustment?

45
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,410
Let's leave it for now.

46
00:03:59,190 --> 00:03:59,710
Mr. Pei,

47
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,400
you dismissed everyone.

48
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,300
Do you already have a plan?

49
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,250

once we get through tonight

and confirm there
are no issues with the design,

62
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,870
we can submit it.

63
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:46,720
Hang in there.

64
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:47,920

Ms. Zhou,

71
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,630
Mr. Xiao.

72
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,550
That's right.

73
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,590
All the architects at Zhuling

74
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,280
have a say in their work.

75
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,040
In every project,

76
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,360
I want them to be creators,

77
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,070
not just

78
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,750

Speaking of clients,

81
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,270
Zhuling and Yueheng have always maintained

82
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,870
a good working relationship.

83
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,920
I hear there's something new
coming up soon.

84
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,630
Can you give us a hint

85
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,360
in this exclusive interview?

86
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,830
Yueheng Group and Zhuling are old friends.

87
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,560
We've collaborated
on quite a few projects,

88
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,360
mostly in a modern style.

89
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,720
But this time, we are planning a hotel project

90
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,310
featuring Shanghai cultural elements.

91
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,490
Can you be a bit more specific?

92
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,070
That's a business secret.

93
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,070
Just kidding.

94
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,640
What I can say for now

95
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,710
is that we'll use Shanghai's
stone-doorframe houses

96
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,240
as the main design element.

97
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,630
My father and I...

98
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:05,660
Mr. Xiao,

99
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,610
isn't this similar to our idea?

100
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:08,720
Exactly.

101
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,800
Why did Zhuling suddenly come up

102
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,720
with this?

103
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,070
Mr. Xiao.

104
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,270
Let's have a meeting.

105
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,830
Let's hear everyone's thoughts first.

106
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:37,800
Mr. Xiao,

107
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,630
Ms. Zhou,

108
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,920
let me share my opinion first.

109
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,240
I have full confidence

110
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,480
in our design.

111
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,750
Even if we're using the same elements,

112
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,150
our plan will definitely outshine theirs.

113
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,120
As for

114
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,190
changing our plan at the last minute,

115
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,510
quality aside,

116
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,180
whether we can finish it in time is already a question.

117
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:57,890
Yifei,

118
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,520
even the most secret project

119
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,660
can't stay completely under wraps.

120
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,310
When have you ever heard
that Yueheng Group

121
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,270
is developing

122
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,270
a Shanghai-cultural themed hotel?

123
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,050
If we were at the competition—

124
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,590
never mind just Zhuling—

125
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,510
even if all the companies presented proposals

126
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,630
with stone-doorframe house elements,

127
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,430
we wouldn't be afraid
of direct competition.

128
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,750
But the problem now

129
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,600
is that right before the competition,

130
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,920
Zhuling suddenly claimed

131
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,040
to be preparing

132
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,430
this so-called special project,

133
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,270
and they even emphasized

134
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,470
that it would be implemented very soon.

135
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:28,320
That means

136
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,120
no matter how good our proposal is

137
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,120
or how competitive the details are,

138
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,020
Lyman won't buy it.

139
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,040
Because in their eyes,

140
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,870
no matter how we design this lane-style hotel,

141
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,320
we'll just be copying someone else's idea.

142
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,000
So this project mentioned in the interview

143
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,800
won't actually be implemented.

144
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,140
Whether it'll be implemented or not,

145
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,670
the impact has already
fallen squarely on us.

146
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,600
Thank you for your hard work overtime lately.

147
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,000
Go back and get some rest.

148
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,280
Meeting adjourned.

149
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,750
The scallions have grown.

150
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,610
Come back and eat Yanduxian soup.

151
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:38,000
Those flowers seem beyond saving.

152
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,929
Could you buy some plant nutrients?

153
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:40,809
It's urgent.

154
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,080
Mr. Xiao,

155
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,950
now you really have to come back.

156
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,060
Do you remember the old lady
who sells hydrogen balloons

157
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,200
at the lane entrance?

158
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,750
She wasn't paying attention today and all the balloons flew off

159
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,390
and got stuck on our roof.

160
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:04,360
I have to climb up
through the skylight in your room

161
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,760
to help her get them down.

162
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,980
When are you coming back?

163
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,750
She's worried sick.

164
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,240
You lied to me?

165
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,170
If I hadn't pulled this trick,

166
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,550
you could've stayed gone

167
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,270
until the Lyman competition.

168
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,140
If I hadn't pulled this trick,

169
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,950
you'd probably lie in your room until the Design Competition.

170
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,160
Stop.

171
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,310
The plant nutrients part
might be an excuse,

172
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,830
but there really is an old lady who's been waiting for you

173
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:07,590
to come home.

174
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:08,790
Cut it out.

175
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,790
If you don't believe me,
go up and see for yourself.

176
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,720
Go by yourself.

177
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,270
The door upstairs isn't locked anyway.

178
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:16,640
Fine.

179
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,390
I thought you didn't believe me.

180
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,510
I was afraid you'd bring something weird

181
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,390
into my room again.

182
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,450
That doll last time was scary enough.

183
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,630
Be careful.

184
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,320
It's fine. I'm quite experienced.

185
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,320
Come up.

186
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,630
I had no choice.

187
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,890
Seeing how upset the old lady was,

188
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,350
I bought all her balloons.

189
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,940
I didn't lock the door.

190
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,310
I didn't feel right barging in.

191
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,320
Didn't someone lock themselves

192
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,250
in the attic to keep me away before?

193
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,600
See?

194
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,310
I rarely lie.

195
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:27,330
Where are the scallions?

196
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,480
Mr. Xiao,

197
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:34,430
authentic Yanduxian soup doesn't need scallions.

198
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,700
Uncle Wang gave this to me.

199
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,390
I traded scallions for it.

200
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,250
Uncle Wang is that generous?

201
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,650
You got this from him
with just some scallions?

202
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:46,910
You don't understand.

203
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,440
Scallions are cheap at the market,

204
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,120
but once the dish is cooking

205
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,000
and you're just missing that little bit of it,

206
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,200
it's worth a fortune.

207
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,780
Is this how you always find loopholes?

208
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,620
Otherwise,

209
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,420
how could you be drinking this?

210
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:23,070
Your friend moved out,

211
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,110
and your parents moved out.

212
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,740
Why are you still here?

213
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,240
Because...

214
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:33,800
it's different.

215
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:37,960
This place is nothing like
those new buildings

216
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,370
or apartments.

217
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,600
It's old,

218
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,720
but that's exactly

219
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,670
why the lanes

220
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:48,840
have a sense of story

221
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,370
and a legendary quality

222
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,390
that

223
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,190
new buildings don't.

224
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,550
That second floor

225
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,660
used to be Granny Wang's home.

226
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,570
I always think she is the most exquisite

227
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:07,430
and elegant person I've ever met.

228
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,390
I heard she was a noble lady

229
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,250
during the Republic of China era.

230
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,840
I once saw her old photos.

231
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,120
She was stunning when she was young.

232
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,380
If you turn into the lane next to us,

233
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:26,590
at the very end,

234
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,600
you'll see Mr. Wang's secret hideout from when he was a kid.

235
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,630
He told me

236
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,150
his parents worked in a factory

237
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,630
and didn't have time to take care of him.

238
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,890
That place used to be his little canteen.

239
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,080
And Dazhong.

240
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,960
Dazhong was amazing at the violin.

241
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,690
He even won awards in Shanghai.

242
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,950
You wouldn't have guessed, would you?

243
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:57,960
Of course,

244
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,480
living in the lanes
has many inconveniences.

245
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,270
The spaces are cramped,

246
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,630
the soundproofing is poor,

247
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,490
and the facilities are outdated.

248
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,870
You don't even need to mention these—

249
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,400
young people don't like it.

250
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,530
Older people with mobility issues

251
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,960
who rely on elevators

252
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,020
aren't suitable to live here either.

253
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,390
Like my dad.

254
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,660
Indeed.

255
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,200
If only there was a building

256
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,660
that could preserve the history of the lanes

257
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:29,120
while fixing

258
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,310

259
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:31,990

Hello everyone,

476
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,660
I'm Xiao Zhiyu from Dynamism.

477
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:56,720
To put it simply,

478
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,110
the concept of the proposal
I'm about to present

479
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,260
originates from

480
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,080
stone-doorframe house lanes.

481
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,590
However, I'm not using

482
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:17,050
the stone-doorframe house lane aesthetic.

483
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,100
When thinking of lanes,

484
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,130
people often first imagine buildings

485
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:23,270
that blend Eastern and Western elements,

486
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,710
shared living spaces,

487
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,230
and the neighborhood warmth that grows from them.

488
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,400
Many also think

489
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,330
lanes

490
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,440
are too cramped,

491
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,070
too old,

492
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,900
and inconvenient to live in.

493
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,480
I once wondered about this too.

494
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,400
Today's young people

495
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,030
are used to smart,
convenient modern apartments.

496
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,270
So why do some

497
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,960
still choose to live in lanes?

498
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,050
To find out the reasons,

499
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:44,510
I moved into a lane myself.

500
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,880
This experience became

501
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,680
a very important part of my life,

502
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,750
and I treasure it deeply.

503
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,560
Beyond the richness of daily life,

504
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,800
a certain resident in the lane

505
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,130
also gave me a lot of inspiration.

506
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,840
She helped me find the answer.

507
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,160
Lanes carry

508
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,170
the collective memory of old Shanghai residents.

509
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:13,640
They possess
not only architectural beauty,

510
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,440
but also a unique community life

511
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,030
that formed over a century ago.

512
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,430

513
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,010

Regarding your company's earlier presentation,

616
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,690
we are leaning towards...

617
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,850
I overheard a bit

618
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,200
in the restroom just now.

619
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,070
They said the scores are deadlocked.

620
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,240
Then it depends on whether Mr. Xie

621
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,040
is willing to pay for sentiment.

622
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:00,750
Anyway,

00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,880
we've done our best.

624
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,050
So don't be nervous.

625
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:04,830
Right.

626
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,240
Yes.

627
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:09,700
No need to be nervous.
We can't be nervous.

628
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,980
I need to go to the restroom again.

629
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,520
Everyone, please return to the conference hall.

630
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,120

636
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:54,050

644
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,110
I was just saying...

645
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:34,030
Hu Xiu, you guys are so bad at acting!

646
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:34,960
I couldn't help it!

647
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,440
Can't you hold it in a little longer?

648
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:36,720
I...

649
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,110
One vote! We beat Zhuling by one vote!

650
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:41,310
I knew it!

651
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:43,310
You didn't reply to my messages! I was worried sick!

652
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:45,640
I just wanted to give everyone a surprise.

653
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,750
Everyone's been too tense lately.

654
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,750
-Seriously!
-Just kidding. Relax.

655
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,790
You need to improve your acting skills.

656
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:56,960
I don't need much acting skill.

657
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,000
As long as I can fool Commander Qin
in the game,

658
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,860
that's enough.

00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,920

00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:11,040

Everyone has worked hard.

663
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:17,450
Today, go home and get some rest.

664
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,030
Later we'll have a celebration banquet.

665
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:19,830
It'll be on Mr. Xiao.

666
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:20,640
How's that?

667
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,920
Feel free to suggest any food you want.

668
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:43,880
Honey!

669
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:50,680
Why are you waiting outside?

670
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,410
Are you cold?

671
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,640
Look who's talking.

672
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,840
You're late for your own class reunion.

673
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,940
I stopped by our company after work.

674
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,270
There were no parking spaces when I came here,

675
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,670
so I had to park next door.

676
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:00,640
You should just

677
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,750
quit that job soon.

678
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:02,310
I will.

679
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:04,270
Let's wait until the company
is more stable.

680
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:04,870
Over here.

681
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,330
Come on, everyone.

682
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,680
I'd like to make a toast.

683
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,310
This glass,

684
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,200
we have to finish it all.

685
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,550
We're all in Shanghai,

686
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,830
yet we haven't seen each other in so long.

687
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:15,630
Is that right?

688
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:16,790
There, there.

689
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:18,480
Cheers!

690
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,270
Cheers!

691
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:24,830
All gone.

692
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:31,830
Guangming,

693
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,350
I have to say, you're still

694
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,310
the most thoughtful.

695
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:36,160
No wonder you were the campus heartthrob back then.

696
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,220
Oh, give me a break.

697
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,110
Back in the day,

698
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,480
when we were in school,

699
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,960
there were so many girls liked Guangming.

700
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,750
Too bad

701
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,200
you married young.

702
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,820
You broke so many women's hearts.

703
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,730
My fault.

704
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,920
Alright, guy.

705
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,070
We just sat down for a moment.

706
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,200
Please, give me a break.

707
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,240
Stop teasing me.

708
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:54,680
Speaking of which,

709
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,270
I just remembered something.

710
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:56,880
Earlier,

711
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,240
when we went to that conference,

712
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,440
I ran into Chi Xin.

713
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:00,720
Chi Xin?

714
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:01,830
Do you remember her?

715
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:02,960
That junior sister?

716
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,000
I remember back then

717
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,400
we once worked on a project as a team.

718
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,440
She came to us on her own,

719
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,770
asking to join our team.

720
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:08,880
She's

721
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,400
at Zhitung Tech now, I think.

722
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,530
Pretty impressive.

723
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,660
You're well informed.

724
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,790
But you know what?
That day at the conference,

725
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,550
Chi Xin specifically came over

726
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,560
to add Guangming on WeChat.

727
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:21,680
But,

728
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,790
Guangming refused her immediately.

729
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:24,400
Right.

730
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,830
Later she came to me

731
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:27,110
and asked me to give her his WeChat.

732
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:27,750
And then?

733
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,430
The man himself immediately refused.

734
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,200
That's why Guangming

735
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,720
is a model husband.

736
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,030
How does that saying go?

737
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,640
"Out of all the waters,

738
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:37,930
I only take one scoop."

739
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,710
"Passing through a thousand flowers..."

740
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:41,680
"Not a petal touches me."

741
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:46,010
How come I didn't know about this?

742
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,050
No need to report such a trivial matter.

743
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:48,770
Come on.

744
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,000
Let me make another toast.

745
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,160
A toast to our former campus heartthrob.

746
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:52,680
Come on!

747
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,240
Everyone!

748
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:53,830
Come on.

749
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:56,640
And to our youth we can't go back to!

750
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:59,110
And to this model couple.

751
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,200
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

752
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:00,960
Cheers!

753
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:11,860
What's this?

754
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,590
What?

755
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:17,820
When did you buy this?

756
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:27,700
I noticed you're not in high spirits tonight.

757
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:29,940
Is everything okay at the company?

758
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,920
Do you remember that project

759
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,400
I mentioned to you at home?

760
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:40,700
The client's funding has been cut off.

761
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,480
The project might be canceled.

762
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:45,510
That project—

763
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,960
didn't they just transfer
the first payment

764
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,160
to your company?

765
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,510
If it stops now,

766
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:52,290
won't all the work you did before be in vain?

767
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,640
So that's why you came back from Jinshan

768
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,900
last time?

769
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,440
Xiaorou,

770
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:06,640
don't worry.

771
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:09,180
I won't let this project fail.

772
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,830
There's already a big company

773
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:12,790
that's interested.

774
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,190
We're still discussing.

775
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:17,590
I'll definitely secure the deal.

776
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:23,200
The cab is here. It's cold outside.

777
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,360
Go back now.

778
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,240
Tell the designated driver

779
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,270
to drive slowly.

780
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,170
Let me know when you get to the company.

781
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:30,650
Okay.

782
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:31,820
I'm leaving.

783
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:42,990
Bye.

784
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,290
This way, Mr. Xiao.

785
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:19,480
You're in good spirits, Mr. Xiao.

786
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:25,920
Winning the competition

787
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,190
definitely calls for a drink

788
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,110
in a nice place.

789
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:32,230
Yeah.

790
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,440
The drinks here are good.

791
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:37,080
Perfect for drowning one's sorrows.

792
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:42,860
You know,

793
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,000
these years since you came back to China,

794
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,130
you're really different from before.

795
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,909
You're more and more like a true elite.

796
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,850
Remember to keep your tail hidden.

797
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:03,030
Don't let it show.

798
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:04,760
This game

799
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,360
is just getting started.

800
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,960
You'll have to play along
with me until the end.

801
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,560
A game that makes you go to such lengths—

802
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,760
I'll certainly play along until the end.

803
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,000
After all,

804
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,760
seeing you so on edge

805
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,340
is way more entertaining than drinking.

806
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:32,710
Mr. Pei,

807
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,210
let me take you to the VIP room

808
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:36,670
to complete your membership registration.

809
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,710
Forget it.

810
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:40,420
You let just anyone in here, don't you?

811
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:51,160
I heard about the competition.

812
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,680
Congratulations.

813
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,640
Thank you.

814
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:56,780
Here.

815
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,150
These are the personnel files from the steel factory back then.

816
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,400
The director's secretary,

817
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,070
finance staff,

818
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,130
project managers—

819
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,630
anyone with a name

820
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,630
whose information could be found

821
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:07,360
is here.

822
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:13,840
Well?

823
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:16,330
Is the one you're looking for among them?

824
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,590
Besides these,

825
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,080
have you found anyone

826
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:23,040
who was closer to him?

827
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,480
Now that you mention it,

828
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,530
there actually is someone.

829
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,630
This person is quite interesting.

830
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:34,230
He was the director's personal driver
back then.

831
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,710
It's said that after the director died,

832
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:37,670
he managed to climb the social ladder,

833
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,030
became a building materials supplier,

834
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,560
and is now doing quite well.

835
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,800
His driver?

836
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:45,840
Yes.

837
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:05,560
[Supply Records]

838
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:26,000
He was such a nobody that it was hard

839
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,370
to even find his name.

840
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,870
But the connection he made back then

841
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,790
is one you're familiar with.

842
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,070
It's Zhuling Group.

843
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:41,980
Dad,

844
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,840
you're back.

845
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,800
Why didn't you tell me?

846
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,110
I could have come to pick you up.

847
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:08,850
Don't you have anything
you want to tell me?

848
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:15,890
How's your health recently?

849
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:19,320
That determines

850
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,030
how I should talk to you

851
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:23,170
and how much I should tell you.

852
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,000
You lost the competition,

853
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,260
and you still dare to have this attitude?

854
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,190
Look at Xiao Zhiyu.

855
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:30,570
In just a few years,

856
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,250
he's already climbed to a position

857
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:34,330
the entire industry can't ignore.

858
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:38,190
Dad,

859
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,550
only those on the ground

860
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,050
need to climb up.

861
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,990
People like me

862
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,960
just need to sit here

863
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:53,220
and give them the motivation to climb.

864
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:57,710
With you like this,

865
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:00,590
how can I entrust Zhuling to you?

866
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,200
Think about it carefully.

867
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,180
There's another thing

868
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,280
I need you to run an errand for me.

869
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:30,840
Auntie Yue.

870
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:32,840
Zhen.

871
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:33,830
Take this soup

872
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,950
and try it.

873
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:37,800
Is this for my dad?

874
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:39,800
I made a pot of this soup.

875
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,040
There's more upstairs.

876
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,100
I'll go get another bowl for your dad.

877
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:44,880
Thank you.

878
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:11,150
Mr. Pei,

879
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,110
your coffee is ready.

880
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:13,440
There are some new desserts we developed.

881
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,370
Please try them.

882
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:16,880
Thanks.

883
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,430
And?

884
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:24,110
Okay.

885
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,280
Qin Xiaoyi?
