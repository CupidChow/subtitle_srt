No one wants to be the one who loses.

So

to reach our ideal destination.

Auntie, can I borrow your phone?

Sorry I'm late.

40
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,770
It's okay. Young people are always busy.

41

Qiran hasn't arrived yet either.

42
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,600
You've got quite a few relatives.
I don't know any of them.

43
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,600
You'll get to know them soon enough.

44

Your mother and the others are over there.

45
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,250
I'll go over there then.

46
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:26,880

Why are there three tables now?

51
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,070
And this wasn't the hall I booked.

52
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,800
I've calculated with your dad.

53
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,000
Since we were having the event anyway,

54
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,390
and Qiran's mother had also
invited quite a few relatives

55

who've all come from far away,

00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,160
we added one table.

57
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,510
The cost for upgrading the hall

58
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:44,920
is covered by your father.

59
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,450
He likes lively occasions.

60
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,540
He was more than happy to pay for this.

I really don't know what to do
with you guys.

62

How could you bring your laptop here?

63
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,200
You worked overtime
until past 2 AM this morning.

64
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,260
Isn't that enough?

65
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,730
I'm just worried
there might be some emergency.

our family will match it.

Our amount

72
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,250
definitely won't exceed theirs.

73
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,520
When the time comes,

74
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,280
we'll offer slightly less than them,

75
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,610
just about this number.

76
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,280
Anyway, in the end, all this gift money

77
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,110

the engagement banquet costs

with their family all this time?

83
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,160
It wasn't for anything else

84

confidence and footing

377
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,569
I'll go with you.

378
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,710
Why didn't you go with Feng Youjin?

379
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:31,840
Why

380
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,160
should I go with him?

381
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,230
Thank you.

382
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,440
And thank you for the hawthorn.

383

I've been waiting for you
for quite a while.

387
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:54,950
You were too slow.

388
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,990
But catching me won't do you any good,

389
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,230
because I don't

390
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:59,360

391
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:00,800
Is that so?

392
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,050
What about this?

393
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,750

394

402

560

How could this be?

561
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:05,800
Sun Jiaying, an overseas student,

562
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,080
has been eliminated after death.

563
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,000
When my glasses go black,

564
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:10,560
that means I'm dead?

565
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,360
Yes.

566
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,470
Our equipment has a trigger system.

567
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:14,880
Since you triggered the death ending,

568
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,410
the device has
automatically disconnected.

569
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:21,400
I...

570
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,450
I'm not the first one who died, am I?

571
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,230
Who killed me?

572
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,070
Those two killers in black?

573
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:32,320
In Rongcheng, your opponent could be...

574
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:33,840
Anyone.

575
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:36,270
I've already lost,

576
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,130
and you won't even let me know why.

577
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:38,990
Many players

578
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:39,990
play through multiple times.

579
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:41,840
Not only can you experience
flexible storylines,

580
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,230
but our virtual settings
also change frequently,

581
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:46,470
ensuring something fresh every time.

582
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,080
They're all so rich?

583
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,880
After the entire game ends,

584
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,270
all players will gather here

585
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,400
for a review session.

586
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,660
You'll get key information at that time.

That Chen Dabao downstairs
from your place,

00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,830
I think he's just malicious.

610
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:24,030
Didn't the community already
assess the situation?

611
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,560
The leak is his own problem.

612
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,320
By the way, I left in a hurry yesterday,

613
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,800
and I didn't get to hear the game review.

614
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,400
In the end,

615
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,900
did Chief Feng win?

616
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,930
It was that Qin Xiaoyi who won.

617
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:34,370
Qin...

618
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,430
Qin Xiaoyi?

619
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:38,670
Wasn't he just playing

620
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:39,950
an NPC in the storyline?

621
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:41,710
How could he have become the mayor?

622
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:43,560
He wasn't just an ordinary NPC.

623
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,080
They said there were 4 factions in total,

624
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,010
and he was the leader of one of them.

625
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:48,270
What?

626
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,080
But I was

627
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,840
busy winning money at the casino
the whole time,

628
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,230
so I didn't see how they played.

629
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,560
I only heard the review.

630
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,400
They said his storyline
was hidden quite deep.

631
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,280
Not just our faction,

632
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,470
even Ning Zechen's people

633
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:07,200
were taken down by Feng Youjin.

634
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,360
I was quite committed in this game.

635
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,760
Looks like we're definitely going to lose.

636
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,800
Not necessarily.

637
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:16,560
[Post Office]

638
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,880
If Feng Youjin can't get the formula
from her,

639
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,800
he can't win.

640
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,510
That Qin Xiaoyi

641
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,950
saw Feng Youjin's

642
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:25,120
contact note and props before I did.

643
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,990
I believe you.

644
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:35,920
Thank you,

645
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,920
General Qin.

646
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:39,840
Then he concealed his identity,

647
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,640
obtained the formula documents,

648
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,510
and finally led his faction to victory.

649
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,400
The formula?

650
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,080
He took my formula.

651
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,790
He should have given it to Feng Youjin.

652
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:50,940
What formula?

653
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:53,710
He clearly said

654
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,600
he was on the same side as me.

655
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,560
You all probably don't know this.

656
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,120
When Qin Xiaoyi executes an enemy,

657
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,230
he fires two shots

658
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,360
to ensure the target's dead.

659
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:08,920
Two shots?

660
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,840
Who knows how cool that is?

661
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,800
So manly.

662
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,270
Liar.

663
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,470
He was trying to kill me to silence me,

664
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:21,950
and there I was like an idiot,

665
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:22,560
saying

666
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,490
thank you to him.

667
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:27,700
Where are you going?

668
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:31,110
In real life, there are too many people
I can't deal with.

669
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,660
But at least in this game,

670
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,450
I'll make anyone who crosses me
pay the price.

671
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:51,330
Everyone, welcome to Rongcheng.

672
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,470
The blizzard has blocked the roads.

673
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:54,840
I apologize for the inconvenience,

674
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,430
but you'll have to rest
in Rongcheng for now.
