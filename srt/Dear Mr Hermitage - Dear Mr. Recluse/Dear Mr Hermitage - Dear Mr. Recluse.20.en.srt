[Dear Mr. Recluse]

28
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,020
[Episode 20]

29
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,230
This is so frustrating.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,310
How did she become like this?

31
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,680
This place is cursed.

32
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,230
She doesn't even come after me
to persuade me back.

33
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,310
Madam Lin.

34
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,310
Are you alright?

35
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,000
Shu Yue.

36
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,280
I'm planning to go down the mountain,

37
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,240
but I've sprained my ankle.

38
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,590
Why are you leaving so soon?

39
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,000
I want to go back.

40
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,430
I can't stay in this village any longer.

41
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,630
For the sake of a few tea saplings,

42
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,240
she bossed me around.

43
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,400
Madam.

44
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,000
There might be some misunderstandings.

45
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,870
Master often told us
that she respects you the most.

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,560
How could she boss you around?

47
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,000
Don't take it to heart.

48
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,310
You know nothing,

49
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,520
yet you're providing your definition.

50
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,520
You're quite protective of her.

51
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,120
Shu Yue.

52
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,870
Do you like my daughter?

53
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,190
Yeah.

54
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:47,870
Really?

55
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,560
I like her a lot.

56
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,000
Your mom left?

57
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,470
Yeah, she scalded your tea sapling.

58
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,800
Of course, I had to scold her.

59
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,560
Don't bother.

60
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,240
Whenever we spend more
than a day together,

61
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,280
we'll definitely have a fight.

62
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,520
After we fight, she'll leave.

63
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,150
I used to comfort her before,

64
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,590
but this time she really did wrong.

65
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:08,870
Take it slow.

66
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,120
Oh my.

67
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,150
If Shu Yue hadn't helped me back,

68
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:15,960
I bet no one

69
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,240
would have cared enough to look for me.

70
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,360
Madam, what happened to you?

71
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,310
Did you sprain your ankle?

72
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,240
This place is shabby.

73
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,710
If you were to marry and settle here,

74
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,240
both of my ankles surely would be done.

75
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,240
Is it serious?

76
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,960
Now you care about me.

77
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,310
I thought you only
care about your boyfriend and not me.

78
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,560
Madam.

79
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,750
Let me help you inside
to apply some ointment.

80
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,240
No need.

81
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,800
I want Shu Yue to help me in.

82
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,030
Alright, then.

83
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,400
Madam, take it slowly.

84
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,430
Over here.

85
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,030
It's a tough battle.

86
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,400
Let's face it head on then.

87
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,360
Since my mom lives here,

88
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,520
our time together

89
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,800
will be reduced.

90
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,030
Would you mind?

91
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,240
We'll make time.

92
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,800
Is no one coming to give Shu a hand?

93
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,750
I'll get some ice from the village.

94
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,630
I'll go take a look.

95
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,240
Alright.

96
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,400
Madam Lin.

97
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:13,680
This is just a sprain.

98
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,750
I've applied the ointment for you.

99
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,480
For the next two days, you should ice it.

100
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,630
After 48 hours,

101
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:18,630
you can switch to warm compresses.

102
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,720
I'll go get some ice.

103
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,120
No need.

104
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,870
Lin Wei has gone to get some.

105
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,750
Well.

106
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,630
Thank you.

107
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,510
You can go back to the company.

108
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,160
Alright.

109
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,680
Oh, no.

110
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,510
Let Shu Yue stay
and chat with me for a bit.

111
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,120
Mom.

112
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,510
There's still work at the company.

113
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,240
Aren't you the boss?

114
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,750
He's just staying a little while.

115
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:33,480
Master.

116
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:34,750
I'll keep her company for a while then.

117
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,310
Shu Yue.

118
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,560
I heard your family is from Beijing.

119
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,270
Yes, that's right.

120
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,360
My hometown is Beijing,

121
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,560
but I attended university in Yunbei.

122
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,160
I see.

123
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,800
What does your family do?

124
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:48,680
Why are you asking this?

125
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,870
That's personal.

126
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,240
It's fine.

127
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,560
It's not much of a secret.

128
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,070
My family runs an online video platform.

129
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,360
I see.

130
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,600
You two are a perfect match.

131
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,720
One is into video production,

132
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,310
and the other runs
an online video platform.

133
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,310
If the two of you come together,

134
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,360
it'll be a powerful alliance.

135
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,430
I heard you're not just her assistant now,

136
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,310
but you're also a shareholder
in the company.

137
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,190
It's a pity that Beijing is far away.

138
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,160
Have you ever thought
about settling in Yunbei?

139
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,070
What are you thinking?

140
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:18,830
Uh.

141
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,480
I'm thirsty.

142
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,510
Could you pour me a glass of water?

143
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,240
I'll do that.

144
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:22,720
No need.

145
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,070
Let her do it.

146
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:31,870
Shu Yue.

147
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,950
You're good in many ways,

148
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,600
but you listen to her too much.

149
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,510
You need to take the initiative.

150
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:38,800
It's not like that.

151
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,430
I...

152
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,680
I'll help you,

153
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:41,950
and you do me a favor too.

154
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,480
I really have no other choice.

155
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,360
Where are you going?

156
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,270
I'm going to pour you a glass of water.

157
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,120
I've got it.

158
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,630
Yu.

159
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,040
My injury has gotten a bit better
over the last two days.

160
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,270
Would you accompany me
to go down the mountain

161
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,430
and buy some things?

162
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:30,390
Sure.

163
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,120
You should sleep early then.

164
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:32,720
Okay.

165
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,630
I'm getting old.

166
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:35,950
I need to use the restroom
often at night.

167
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:36,830
In a little while,

168
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,510
I'll probably need
to get up to use the restroom.

169
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,360
You should sleep now.

170
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:43,870
Alright.

171
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:02,480
Madam Lin?

172
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,560
You haven't rested yet?

173
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:09,560
Lin Wei.

174
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,830
I'd like to speak to you for a bit.

175
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,000
You're a good man.

176
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:18,950
You're kind-hearted,

177
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,310
morally upright,

178
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,560
and always considerate of others.

179
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,480
But...

180
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,560
Please go ahead.

181
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,360
I'm a selfish mother.

182
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,560
Perhaps someday,

183
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,600
if you become a father,

184
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:42,390
you'll understand that parents
can bear some of the suffering.

185
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,240
But, we can't watch our children
do the same.

186
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,390
You have no idea

187
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,870
how far a mother would go

188
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,120
for her child.

189
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,950
You also don't know

190
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,560
how much a mother loves her child.

191
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,800
I know.

192
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,830
No, you don't.

193
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,720
Whether you believe it or not,

194
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,750
I have to tell you.

195
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,270
I'm not biased against the poor
and fond of the rich.

196
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,630
I know you're the heir of Haowei Coffee.

197
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,270
In the past, you had a glorious life.

198
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,720
And in the future, you might rise again.

199
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,800
But I can tell

200
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,600
there's something on your mind.

201
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,310
When Yu is with you,

202
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,720
she's not enduring financial hardship

203
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,390
or environmental difficulties,

204
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,190
but rather, spiritual hardship.

205
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:35,320
This is even more bitter
than having no money, house, or car.

206
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,510
I can protect her.

207
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,320
I'll endure all the hardships

208
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,630
and let her have the good moments.

209
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,150
You're a good kid.

210
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,240
I'm not unreasonable.

211
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,000
Why would I ask you
to endure all the hardships

212
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,030
and let Yu have the good moments?

213
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,320
You've mistaken me.

214
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,120
I just want her to marry well,

215
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,080
and for the two of them to live happily.

216
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,000
Why must you endure hardships?

217
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,390
Don't you think so?

218
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,030
You and Yu are not good together.

219
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,080
After meeting you,

220
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,720
she changed completely.

221
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,360
I don't like the changes
you brought to her.

222
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,840
I'm even less likely to like you.

223
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,630
I hope you can understand.

224
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,120
I

225
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,360
understand.

226
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,440
Great.

227
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,960
If in the future,

228
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,840
I do something that bothers you,

229
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,960
I hope you'll forgive me.

230
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
About the tea sapling incident,

231
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,240
I didn't mean it.

232
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,000
I don't know

233
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,600
what you're keeping in your heart.

234
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,320
But you must believe there's no obstacle
that can't be overcome.

235
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,630
As soon as you get better,
you're out shopping.

236
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,840
Didn't you enjoy shopping in the past?

237
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,480
Times have changed.

238
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,750
See that?

239
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:00,240
A man's financial situation

240
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,200
determines a woman's desire to shop.

241
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,630
Stop objectifying women.

242
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,720
I have freedom of speech.

243
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,240
What do you think of this?

244
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,750
Isn't this a bit too girly for you to wear?

245
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,120
I'm buying it for you.

246
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:14,840
Come.

247
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,840
Try it on for me.

248
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,360
It looks very good on you.

249
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,270
We're getting it.

250
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,360
Are we done shopping now?

251
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:27,750
Not yet.

252
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,080
You have to accompany me somewhere.

253
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,870
Mom.

254
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,440
Since you're here,

255
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,270
you might as well hurry up.

256
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,510
What are we doing here?

257
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,000
Shu Yue?

258
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,750
Why are you here?

259
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,030
Your mom asked me to come.

260
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,390
Mom?

261
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,320
You two enjoy your meals.

262
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,120
Don't mind me.

263
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,630
What's my mom up to?

264
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,390
Let's sit and talk.

265
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,600
You look very lovely today.

266
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,390
Thank you.

267
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,960
But when I look at you like this,

268
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,480
I find it a bit awkward.

269
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,750
Can you not treat me
as your apprentice tonight?

270
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,240
You're my apprentice.

271
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,600
What else could I see you as?

272
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,750
A man.

273
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,320
Do you remember our first meeting?

274
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,120
I was supposed
to go for an interview at Starshine.

275
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,960
Coincidentally, you were also recruiting.

276
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,550
You took me to Time Flies.

277
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,240
[Shu Yue. Media Director.]

278
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,390
You graduated with a Journalism degree
from Yunbei University.

279
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:00,440
College experience.
Production of "Stories from Yunbei",

280
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,120
a social documentary series on Yunbei TV.

281
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,550
I know that one.

282
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,840
It won the Documentary Prize.

283
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,360
Hey.

284
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,270
Here's your water.

285
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:10,440
Thank you.

286
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,670
I think

287
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,200
the scope of your company

288
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,720
might not align
with my future career plan.

289
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,120
It was nice

290
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,040
meeting you all though.

291
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,120
Young man.

292
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,670
Where do you think you're going?

293
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,750
Leaving in the middle of an interview

294
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,510
is very impolite.

295
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,000
Don't scare him.

296
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,030
Shu.

297
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,600
Don't underestimate our company
just because it's small now.

298
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,150
We are well-rounded in all aspects,

299
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,440
and we have made plans
for the next five years.

300
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,000
You see.

301
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,360
If you join us now,

302
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,360
you might become
a major shareholder in the future.

303
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,790
This kind of opportunity isn't easily

304
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,480
offered to just any young man.

305
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:56,840
Exactly.

306
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,000
Think about it carefully.

307
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,480
Okay.

308
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,240
If you're interested,

309
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,320
how about I explain our plans to you?

310
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,030
To be honest, at first, I thought

311
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,870
Time Flies was a fraudulent company.

312
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,030
I checked its qualifications online
several times.

313
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,600
At that time,

314
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,840
we had been posting job ads for a month.

315
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,150
The other job seekers,

316
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,270
who came and saw our company was small,

317
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,360
had the same reaction as yours.

318
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,200
So when we finally met you,

319
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,480
an outstanding graduate,

320
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:32,630
we became a bit desperate.

321
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,720
Yeah, especially Ruan.

322
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,600
She usually speaks so gently,

323
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:38,030
but on that day, she really scared me.

324
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,270
So, why did you
choose to stay back then?

325
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,150
Because as we
got to know each other better,

326
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,720
I realized that every word you said

327
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,840
on the first day we met

328
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:46,840
was true.

329
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:48,870
You said,

330
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,840
although our company is small,

331
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,960
every one of us

332
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,720
is working toward the same goal.

333
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:56,480
Especially you.

334
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,750
Your energy and enthusiasm

335
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,840
have always been inspiring me.

336
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,720
It made me realize
that following the right person

337
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,600
is much more important than
joining a big company.

338
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,000
Well,

339
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,960
our five-year plan

340
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,270
hasn't been realized yet.

341
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,720
We still need to work hard.

342
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:17,240
Yeah.

343
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,200
Five years. It's a good length of time.

344
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,600
No matter

345
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,680
what happens in the future,

346
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,480
I hope

347
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,870
I can always be by your side.

348
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:41,480
Actually,

349
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,510
today,

350
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,440
your mom asked me to come

351
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,600
for a blind date with you.

352
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,200
She hopes
I can break you up with Lin Wei.

353
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,630
Shu Yue.

354
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,750
To me, you're a very important friend

355
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,960
and partner.

356
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,390
You're not the one I love.

357
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,360
I know.

358
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:05,720
I know.

359
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,440
I don't want to do that either.

360
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:13,750
Su Shiyu.

361
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,080
If I were to become despicable one day,

362
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,960
I would be even more
unworthy of receiving your affection.

363
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:27,870
Alright.

364
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,150
We've said everything
that was bottled up.

365
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,150
Let's enjoy this meal.

366
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,630
We are

367
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,240
going to part ways tomorrow, aren't we?

368
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,360
How could I bear to part ways with you?

369
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,720
I want to see you

370
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,000
every single day.

371
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:53,960
Of course,

372
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,030
I won't use any despicable means

373
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,150
to break you and Lin Wei up.

374
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,030
Rest assured.

375
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,720
While you have a boyfriend,

376
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:01,960
I'm just your partner.

377
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,440
So starting tomorrow,

378
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,000
let's work well together.

379
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:05,880
We're comrades in arms

380
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,680
and partners.

381
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,480
Let's eat.

382
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:15,590
This.

383
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,400
It's delicious.

384
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,070
Really?

385
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:17,680
I'll try some.

386
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,590
How was it?

387
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,070
I failed.

388
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:57,110
But I also seem to feel enlightened.

389
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:09,640
Lin Wei.

390
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,350
You were absent

391
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,240
in many moments of my master's life.

392
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,200
I'm entrusting them to you now.

393
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:38,830
Take good care of her.

394
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,350
You're honest and straighforward.

395
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,440
If you dare to mistreat her,

396
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,750
I won't let you off.

397
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,510
Your master
is officially entrusted to me now.

398
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,200
How was it?

399
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:12,680
How did it go?

400
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:13,960
Is the meal delicious?

401
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,680
Yeah.

402
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,400
So,

403
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,640
Shu is pretty good, right?

404
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,070
Quite good.

405
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,160
I told you.

406
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,830
He is reliable,

407
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,400
and his family background is good too.

408
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,030
You two are quite suitable together.

409
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:25,550
Mom.

410
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,110
Shu Yue told me.

411
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,270
We're just business partners.

412
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,180
If you ask him
to break up Lin Wei and me again,

413
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,200
things will get very awkward.

414
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,440
We're not kids anymore.

415
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,480
I can't believe Shu,

416
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,680
who seems righteous and trustworthy,

417
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:40,790
betrayed me.

418
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,720
Mom, stop meddling in my love life.

419
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,590
Lin Wei and I are doing well now.

420
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,240
Oh, stop using your phone.

421
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,030
Doing well?

422
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,790
Has he ever been considerate of you?

423
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,680
If you had been
part of his future plans,

424
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,350
he wouldn't have asked you
to move to this village

425
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,960
for some unrealistic goals.

426
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:00,000
I came to Village Xiaojin
according to my own plan.

427
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,680
You're in love and confused.

428
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,200
You're blinded by love.

429
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,480
You'll understand in the future.

430
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,270
I'm just concerned about you.

431
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,270
Oh, really?

432
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,880
What's my favorite color?

433
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,480
Green.

434
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,000
Right.

435
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,680
Every time you buy something for me,

436
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,830
it's always green.

437
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,310
That's because
my sister's favorite color is green.

438
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,110
So, in your subconscious,

439
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,880
my favorite color is green too.

440
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,550
But do you know
that I actually love pink the most?

441
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,270
You've been independent since little.

442
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,480
I never have to worry about you.

443
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,510
Back then, I had to run a shop

444
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,240
and support you through your studies.

445
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:31,590
But,

446
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,830
I have never
deprived you of basic necessities.

447
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,640
Now you're blaming me for it.

448
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,030
Right.

449
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:37,550
I'm independent.

450
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,240
Does that mean
you don't have to be caring toward me?

451
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:41,270
Where were you when I needed you?

452
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,240
Where were you when I was sick?

453
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,510
How can I make you grasp
that those absent days

454
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,480
cannot be regained?

455
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,240
Mom, I've grown up now.

456
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,440
I think I don't need you anymore.

457
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,640
Your concern for me now

458
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,030
is a kind of burden.

459
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,510
Madam Lin.

460
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:47,960
Madam Lin.

461
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,240
Where are you going?

462
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,510
I'm going home.

463
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,720
It's going to rain soon.

464
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:52,830
There might be mudslides.

465
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:53,750
It's too dangerous to leave now.

466
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:54,790
It's none of your concern.

467
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:00,550
Madam Lin.

468
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,270
Let's go back.

469
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,590
Go away.

470
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,180
Your relationship

471
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,180
with Yu is just nonsense.

472
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,070
No matter what you do,

473
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,160
it won't change my mind.

474
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,550
You're such a fool.

475
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,720
Come here.

476
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:54,680
Mom?

477
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,830
You've got quite a collection here.

478
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,030
In the tea fields,

479
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,510
I often have to stay up at night.

480
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,160
Yu prepared all these for me.

481
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,590
She's been considerate since little,

482
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,590
knowing to take care of others.

483
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:29,960
But,

484
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,400
now that you two are together,

485
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,240
shouldn't you
be taking care of her instead?

486
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,200
Sit closer.

487
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,510
I'm worried if you get sick,

488
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,030
Yu would be worried.

489
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:54,830
Lin Wei.

490
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,000
Why do you like my daughter?

491
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,680
She's worth everyone's liking.

492
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,510
What is she like to you?

493
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:12,550
She's enthusiastic

494
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,440
and kind-hearted.

495
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:15,640
She likes making friends,

496
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,480
enjoys socializing,

497
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:19,590
has strong self-motivation

498
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:21,160
and even stronger resilience.

499
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,880
She often considers others,

500
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:27,510
yet neglects herself.

501
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,160
She's loyal

502
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,200
and enjoys taking care of others.

503
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,270
She can even share the best things
with others.

504
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:44,200
But who can truly see her as she is
and take care of her?

505
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,590
Who can know whether she is happy

506
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,270
and what she wants?

507
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:00,590
Madam Lin.

508
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,200
Do you know

509
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,440
why she's so sensible?

510
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,880
Her personality is just like this.

511
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,510
It's because she dares not be willful,

512
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,240
afraid that being willful
will cause her to lose even more.

513
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,240
From her studies

514
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:31,440
to her career choices,

515
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,240
Yu has always made her own decisions.

516
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,310
I was busy with my own career,

517
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,240
my second marriage,

518
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,000
and having a second child.

519
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,440
I attribute
all my unfulfilled responsibilities

520
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:55,590
on her independence.

521
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,440
I took her understanding

522
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,680
as a matter of course.

523
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,550
Were you worried just now?

524
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,680
Not at all.

525
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,510
Clearly, she was at fault.

526
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,160
And she left just like that.

527
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:44,070
There was a misunderstanding
between you two.

528
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,400
Your mom

529
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,030
was just concerned about you.

530
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,000
Why are you saying the same thing?

531
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,310
She's never cared about me.

532
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:54,880
Now, she's suddenly trying to advise me.

533
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,590
That's the reason.

534
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,160
She doesn't want

535
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,020
to be absent from your future endeavors.

536
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:07,720
Thank you.

537
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,640
Thank you for taking care of my mom

538
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,680
and for what you said in the tea shed.
