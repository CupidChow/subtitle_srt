[Episode 15]

29
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,640
What actually is the meaning

30
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,560
behind Su's WeChat post?

31
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,280
I don't know.

32
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,040
I don't know.

33
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,400
What does it mean?

34
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,400
Come on, just tell us.

35
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,070
Don't keep us guessing.

36
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,560
Look at this picture.

37
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,510
She took a photo of a flower.

38
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,230
But her focus is actually on a person.

39
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,200
As for this person,

40
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,230
well, I won't say it.

41
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,590
Everyone knows.

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,790
So,

43
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,190
I've come to a big conclusion.

44
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,750
- Su and Lin Wei are dating!
- Su and Lin Wei are dating!

45
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,750
How did you guys find out?

46
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,150
The two of us have been scheming

47
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,470
behind the scenes.

48
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,360
We're practically their matchmakers.

49
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,080
Seriously, what's up
with her WeChat post?

50
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,560
She must have encountered a bottleneck,

51
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,680
so she can only vent on WeChat.

52
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,870
Hey, isn't that Lin Wei?

53
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:29,400
Lin Wei.

54
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,630
He doesn't even have WeChat.

55
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,560
So he can't see my complaints at all.

56
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,630
Who on earth can advise him?

57
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,560
Since I'm the matchmaker,

58
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,680
I am responsible

59
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,310
for criticizing and educating you.

60
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,430
Lin Wei.

61
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,120
You're in the wrong here.

62
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,400
As far as I know,

63
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,710
Su is very innocent

64
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,030
and has never dated before.

65
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:22,910
Therefore,

66
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,000
she has high hopes

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,470
for this relationship with you.

68
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,750
How do you know so much?

69
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,870
From Wechat, of course.

70
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,750
I've been scrolling through Su's WeChat

71
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,400
for three hours

72
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,400
all the way back to 2013.

73
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,120
So,

74
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,280

75
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,430
You're quite impressive.

76
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,840
Be careful with your eyesight.

77
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,680
Aren't you afraid
of worsening your presbyopia?

78
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:40,360
Don't get off-topic.

79
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,400
Leave out the presbyopia talk.

80

86

Communicate a bit.

87
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,870
Ask him why he made Su angry.

88
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,240

I just don't get it.

95
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,430

Isn't it a bit strange?

00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,270
for compulsory enforcement in the court.

516
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:03,960
Next,

517
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,030
the court will freeze your assets
according to the law.

518
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:19,720
Lin Wei.

519
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,200
You got a call from the lawyer, right?

520
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,110
My decision won't change.

521
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,640
I've made it clear to you.

522
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,550
This is the third time.

523
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,440
I'm not inviting you anymore.

524
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,640
This is your final warning.

525
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,680
We had a signed agreement before.

526
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,070
If you're not in charge
of Yuanqi Capital anymore,

527
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,400
I have the right to buy back the fund

528
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,350
and recover all the fund profits
I'm entitled to,

529
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,270
totaling 700 million yuan.

530
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,590
I will freeze all your assets,

531
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,110
auction your property
through legal procedures

532
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,790
and restrict your personal expenses.

533
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,270
You can't take high-speed railways

534
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,350
or airplanes,

535
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,440
and you can't have luxury expenses.

536
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,070
Your threats won't affect me.

537
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:02,030
I heard your girlfriend
is starting a business, right?

538
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,310
She must need funding and clients.

539
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,510
You know, I have my ways.

540
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,680
I can make sure her business

541
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,110
never takes off.

542
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,510
What's the connection

543
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,440
between Lin Wei and the elders here?

544
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,240
The residents here

545
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,790
are elderly folks who stayed in town.

546
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,920
Aunt Jin Yue originally founded

547
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,350
this nursing center.

548
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,720
It's been about ten years.

549
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,880
So, was this place
started by Lin Wei's mother?

550
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:40,750
Yes.

551
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,070
Are they spinning this thread

552
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,750
to sell?

553
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,510
The elders don't like
getting free food and shelter.

554
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,640
During their free time,

555
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,240
they will engage in crafting activities,

556
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,070
to earn some money,

557
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:52,880
which goes to the nursing center

558
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,000
to support their living expenses.

559
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,790
Madam, can I try this?

560
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:00,640
Sure.

561
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,240
Thanks.

562
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,270
Should I lift this up a bit?

563
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:08,680
But it...

564
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,920
But it keeps rubbing against my hand.

565
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,070
You can use your foot to tread on that.

566
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:11,480
Right here?

567
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,200
Yes, exactly.

568
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,310
You're improving so quickly.

569
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,510
Thanks. I'll surely master it next time.

570
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,750
Madam Biyu, we will leave now.

571
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:45,000
See you next time.

572
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,510
Alright.

573
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,310
Take care.

574
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:46,880
Bye-bye.

575
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,830
So are you coming back next time?

576
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,350
It's not that hard to learn.

577
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,720
I'll be more helpful next time I visit.

578
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:57,270
Ms. Li.

579
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,790
We should head back now.

580
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,110
We'll visit everyone again next time.

581
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,160
Sure.

582
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,720
Why are you injured?

583
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,310
It's a small scratch
from the thread spinning.

584
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,350
Wait here for me, okay?

585
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:13,680
Alright, you two,

586
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,030
stop showing off your affection here.

587
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:15,960
You didn't bully her, did you?

588
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:16,920
Of course not.

589
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:19,790
Feifei.

590
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:20,480
Here.

591
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,350
Take these back to eat.

592
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,030
These are homemade rice cakes by ourselves.

593
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,000
Thanks, Ms. Li.

594
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,750
Let me treat your hands for you.

595
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:26,750
It's okay,

596
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:27,350
Ms. Li.

597
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,240
I'll handle it myself when I return.

598
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,030
This is homemade remedy from Ms. Li.

599
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:31,920
It's great for reducing inflammation.

600
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:32,830
Go ahead.

601
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,240
Come with me.

602
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,350
Thank you.

603
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:46,960
Come.

604
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:51,400
Su.

605
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:55,240
Lin Wei has gone through a lot.

606
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,590
His life was tough.

607
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,880
We sincerely hope

608
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,400
that he'll have sweeter days ahead.

609
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,440
Don't worry.

610
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,720
I'll ensure his life is filled
with sweetness from now on.

611
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,000
Sirs and madams,
you should head back in.

612
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,480
I'll come visit you next time.

613
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,640
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

614
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,200
Thank you for visiting us.

615
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,680
Welcome to come again.

616
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,960
Those two girls are so lovely.

617
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,750
Yeah, they are really beautiful.

618
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,310
Seriously.

619
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,680
I've had enough
of you two being lovey-dovey.

620
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:36,590
Alright.

621
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,350
I'll get going.

622
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,350
Being a third wheel all day is tiring.

623
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,070
Bye-bye.

624
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:40,960
Bye-bye.

625
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:41,680
Bye.

626
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,000
I had a great time today.

627
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:47,720
Thanks to you.

628
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:50,680
Su Shiyu.

629
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:51,720
What's wrong?

630
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,030
I feel like my confession the other day

631
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,510
was a bit rushed.

632
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,400
I didn't think it was rushed at all.

633
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,550
It was quite nice, actually.

634
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,680
What's up?

635
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,000
Are you about to confess to me again?

636
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,030
What I mean is

637
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,440
that we should take some time apart.

638
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,750
There are things I need to deal with.

639
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,400
What do you mean?

640
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,880
Life has many uncertainties.

641
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,110
Each one could

642
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:31,200
cause problems
for me and those around me.

643
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,350
I shouldn't involve you in trouble too.
