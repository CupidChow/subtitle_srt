That's why I condemned you.

112

You're right.

113
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,310

(He's a monk.)

173
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,680
Mr. Lin.

174
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,160
Good to see you.

175
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,510
This is the incense money

176
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,720
given by the woman who was here earlier.

177
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,430
So this is where you're staying?

178
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,190
Yeah.

179
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,360
Yu.

180
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,360
Your life should be sophisticated,

181
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,150
not perfunctory.

182
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,080
The most important thing for a woman

183
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,080
is sophistication.

184
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,320
You've forgotten everything I taught you.

185
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,320
Life

186
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,600
is about living for yourself.

187
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,790
It's good as long as you're comfortable.

188
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,030
Besides, I came to start a business.

189
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,150
I'm not on vacation.

190
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:51,630
I disagree.

191
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,510
In my opinion,

192
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,870
women should find a good man to marry.

193
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,440
Look at you.

194
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,000
You bear everything on your own.

195
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,080
It's tough.

196
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,360
Mom.

197
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,200
It's because of this mindset,

198
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,550
that you don't even know
how to fix a pair of shoes.

199
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,550
Men can't be by our sides all the time.

200
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,870
This is a special case.

201
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,240
Most of the time,
men will be there for us.

202
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:17,790
Yu.

203
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,510
I have two questions for you.

204
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,000
You have to answer honestly.

205
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:22,910
The first question is,

206
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,510
did you block me on WeChat?

207
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,390
No.

208
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,630
Then you must have
put me in a restricted group.

209
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,200
I never put anyone in groups.

210
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,960
I don't like grouping people.

211
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,080
Look.

212
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:32,910
Here.

213
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,440
[Su Shiyu: Spending every day with you!]
Your cousin sent me this screenshot.

214
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,240
Your cousin sent me this screenshot.

215
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,080
Mom.

216
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,030
Please let me explain.

217
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,000
This WeChat post...

218
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,030
No need to explain.

219
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,080
You put your own mother
in a restricted group.

220
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,510
Is your boyfriend that unreliable?

221
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,480
I want to meet him right now.

222
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:48,390
There he is.

223
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,510
He's back.

224
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,270
Madam.

225
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,720
So this is your boyfriend?

226
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,080
I quite like this young man.

227
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,360
You know him well.

228
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,440
That makes me feel relieved.

229
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,630
He's a bit young though.

230
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,270
How long have you been with my daughter?

231
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:04,750
Mom, you've got it wrong.

232
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,910
This is my boyfriend.

233
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,600
How is that possible?

234
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:10,080
I just saw this Bhante
in the temple earlier.

235
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,600
Are you...

236
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:19,630
Nice to meet you, madam.

237
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,390
What about you?

238
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:24,630
Oh.

239
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,510
I'm here to deliver materials, madam.

240
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,960
Turns out I got it wrong.

241
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,240
He's not a Bhante from the temple.

242
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,480
He's just a faithful believer

243
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,910
who debates with the abbot.

244
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,080
Why would he wear ragged clothes

245
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,270
and shave his head like a monk?

246
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,360
It's no wonder
that I didn't recognize him.

247
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:48,320
Madam.

248
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,270
It's my fault.

249
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,550
Sorry for making you misunderstand me.

250
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,510
But the incense money you provided

251
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,030
has been passed to the abbot.

252
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:54,480
Thank you.

253
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,720
Let me ask you.

254
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,240
What kind of job do you have?

255
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:00,870
Why do you live on the mountain?

256
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,150
He's into farming.

257
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,480
Farming?

258
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:04,510
A contractor?

259
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,550
A supplier.

260
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,600
A supplier...

261
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,440
A supplier?

262
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,750
Doesn't that mean
he has to work on site all day?

263
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,550
Madam.

264
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,000
To be honest, I don't have a job now.

265
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,080
I came up the mountain

266
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,000
just to grow tea.

267
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,790
You don't even have a job?

268
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,550
Doesn't that make you a jobless man?

269
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,550
You can't even support yourself.

270
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,480
How can that work?

271
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,550
This place

272
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,550
is not your only home, right?

273
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:32,480
No.

274
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:33,510
Oh.

275
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,030
This place is rented.

276
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,510
Yu.

277
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,000
Hmm?

278
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,320
Come with me.

279
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:53,630
Hurry up.

280
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,120
Yu.

281
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,030
I don't mind that you're seeing a man
without a house.

282
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,720
But he rented a cabin.

283
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,150
Why would you lower your own status?

284
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:04,200
What do you mean by that?

285
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,720
I'm renting a place too, aren't I?

286
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,150
He's righteous,

287
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,030
has a good character,

288
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:08,600
and treats me well.

289
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:09,870
What else should I ask for?

290
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,360
Anyway, this is unacceptable.

291
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,200
Let me ask you.

292
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,150
Are you planning to live here forever?

293
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,240
I don't know.

294
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,510
I'm just happy with my life now.

295
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:36,360
Madam.

296
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,320
I just finished work.

297
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:37,960
Did you call for me?

298
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:38,960
Shu Yue.

299
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,270
Come here.

300
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:39,670
Sit.

301
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:40,200
Sure.

302
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,390
Shu Yue.

303
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:42,750
Yeah?

304
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,750
There's something

305
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:46,550
I'd like to ask you.

306
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,550
Please go on.

307
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,790
How did my daughter and Lin

308
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,480
get together?

309
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:53,720
Madam.

310
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,790
I think

311
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,000
you'd better ask Su directly.

312
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,080
It would be better that way.

313
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,240
You know her character.

314
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,080
If she were willing to tell me,

315
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,200
I wouldn't have only found out today

316
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,630
that she's in a relationship.

317
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:06,000
Look.

318
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,120
You've been with her for a long time,

319
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,240
so you definitely know something.

320
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:09,670
Tell me.

321
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,440
At first,

322
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,720
it was Su who took the initiative.

323
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,510
Then,

324
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,390
they

325
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,240
got together.

326
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,480
She initiated it?

327
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,030
How long have they been together?

328
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,910
Did they hold hands?

329
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:28,720
Did...

330
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,150
Did they kiss?

331
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,200
Did they go further...

332
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:32,910
Madam.

333
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:34,720
Well.

334
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,790
They've been together
for less than a month.

335
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,910
But beyond that, I really don't know.

336
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:40,480
I...

337
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:41,270
I think

338
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,360
I'm not feeling so well.

339
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,080
Um.

340
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:44,870
Sorry, Madam.

341
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:45,440
I'll...

342
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,000
I'll have to leave first.

343
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:47,790
Madam.

344
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,000
Less than a month?

345
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,550
That means

346
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,790
this is just their beginning.

347
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,000
Didn't you start your backup plan?

348
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,120
Since it's a long-term plan,

349
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,550
why care about a short-term loss?

350
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:12,550
Well.

351
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,390
That doesn't mean I can
endure her mother's aggressive attacks.

352
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,870
You came up with a long-term plan

353
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,150
but you can't withstand a test?

354
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,270
I advise you to give up soon.

355
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,150
Why are you dampening my enthusiasm?

356
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,480
I'm just advising you to be rational.

357
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,750
Listen.

358
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,630
It's obvious that Su Shiyu's mother

359
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,080
doesn't approve of her relationship
with Lin Wei.

360
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,750
I know.

361
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,240
But Master is a stubborn person

362
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,440
who would take risks

363
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,360
despite being aware of the dangers.

364
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,000
Actually,

365
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,440
I think there's nothing difficult
in this world

366
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,630
as long as you're willing to give up.

367
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,670
Why do I feel like

368
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,510
you don't want me to succeed at all?

369
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,390
Are you helping me

370
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,510
or sabotaging me?

371
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:58,550
Why is your face so red?

372
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,150
Are you having a fever?

373
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,150
Nonsense.

374
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,910
My mom said she's going to stay here

375
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,000
but didn't mention for how long.

376
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,270
She hasn't seen you for some time now,

377
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,670
so you should spend more time with her.

378
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:23,750
Later,

379
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,870
I'll buy some essentials for her.

380
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:26,030
Hey.

381
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,270
If my mom says something to you,

382
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,750
don't take it to heart.

383
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,870
I'm afraid she'll pick on you.

384
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,630
But that's her way of caring for you.

385
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:34,790
I was fine when she didn't care,

386
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,870
but now,
she's making things difficult for me.

387
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,390
I lived well by myself all these years.

388
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,510
Now that she suddenly
started caring for me,

389
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,600
I can't get used to it.

390
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,790
Lin Wei was afraid
you'd get cold at night,

391
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,360
so he bought a blanket from town.

392
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,870
Is this blanket comfortable to sleep in?

393
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,600
This is the best one in town.

394
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:11,320
Alright, then.

395
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,720
I'll make do
and sleep with it for one night.

396
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,960
I'll take you back tomorrow, okay?

397
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,270
I can make do
and sleep for a few more nights.

398
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:22,550
Yu.

399
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,080
Yeah?

400
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,440
You two have been together
for a month, right?

401
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:28,960
How did you know?

402
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:30,960
I guessed it.

403
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,270
Have you two

404
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,320
held hands?

405
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:36,720
Yeah, we have.

406
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:38,790
Have you two hugged?

407
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,550
Are you about to ask me

408
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:42,960
if we've kissed?

409
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:44,870
Yu.

410
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,240
It's only been a month,

411
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,550
and you haven't known him well yet.

412
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,630
Think twice
before doing anything, alright?

413
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:50,750
Now,

414
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,390
tell me,

415
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,270
have you and Lin Wei

416
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:55,510
done that?

417
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,750
What are you talking about, Mom?

418
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm going to sleep.

419
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,870
Come on, Yu.

420
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,200
From what I see,

421
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,630
he doesn't seem like a frivolous person.

422
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,750
Ugh.

423
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:04,310
Yu.

424
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,270
Answer me.

425
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:05,750
Did you...

426
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:06,310
No.

427
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,110
Go to sleep.

428
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,880
There are so many mosquitoes
in the mountains.

429
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,440
Madam.

430
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,110
How about I fetch some mugwort for you?

431
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:34,550
No, thanks.

432
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,350
I can't stand the smell.

433
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,920
Try the dishes.

434
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:40,590
Here in the mountains,

435
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,590
we obtain simple ingredients.

436
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,270
That's why

437
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,750
we prepared
only a few simple vegetarian dishes.

438
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,880
But they're all grown by villagers

439
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,310
which makes it natural and organic.

440
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,920
No wonder.

441
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,200
That's why you look so thin now.

442
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,350
Madam.

443
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,350
How about trying this?

444
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,000
It's a specialty of Village Xiaojin,

445
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,880
a vegetarian rice dumpling
made of glutinous rice.

446
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,240
Let's eat.

447
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,440
Who made this?

448
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,070
Lin Wei specially made it for you.

449
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,400
It's too sticky.

450
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,160
Try the stuffed lotus root, then.

451
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:23,790
This stuffed lotus root

452
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,590
doesn't even have any meat inside.

453
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,270
How good can it be?

454
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,160
Besides,

455
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,510
why is it

456
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,110
that your kitchen
doesn't even have a window?

457
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,590
Insects fly around.

458
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:33,400
That's so unhygienic.

459
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,790
That's just how it is in the mountains.

460
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,590
If you can't stand it,

461
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,400
you can just leave.

462
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,400
What's wrong?

463
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,750
I'm just reminding you
to pay attention to food hygiene.

464
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,590
Am I wrong?

465
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:42,920
I'm not eating anymore.

466
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,920
I'm sorry.

467
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,510
My mom is used to living in the city,

468
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,160
so she's quite picky.

469
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,200
Please

470
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,640
don't be angry, will you?

471
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,350
She's your mother.

472
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:02,880
If I go against her,

473
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,680
wouldn't it
make things difficult for you?

474
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,510
She won't be staying long.

475
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,790
Just endure a few more days.

476
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,720
It's not hard for me.

477
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,750
I should love your family
like I love you.

478
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,030
Besides, I can tell

479
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:12,790
that she

480
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,200
has a sharp tongue but a kind heart.

481
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,160
You're the sweetest.

482
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,160
Yu.

483
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,590
Why haven't you gone to work yet?

484
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,750
I'm leaving now.

485
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:22,880
Hurry up, then.

486
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,750
I'm going to spend some time with Lin.

487
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,110
Sure, madam.

488
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,160
Please take care of my mom.

489
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:28,790
Okay.

490
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:29,640
Drive safely.

491
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:30,240
Don't worry.

492
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:35,440
Go on.

493
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,550
Up here,

494
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,640
is where we dry our beans.

495
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,310
Lin Wei.

496
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,440
Have you eaten?

497
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,350
Yes, I have.

498
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,110
Oh?

499
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,240
Who's this?

500
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,440
She is

501
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,400
Yu's mother,

502
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:54,750
Madam Lin Lan.

503
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,350
Oh.

504
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:55,720
Hello.

505
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,400
Nice to meet you.

506
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,680
I'm Mrs. Sha.

507
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,640
Everyone calls me that.

508
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,350
I'm in a hurry to find my dog, Liuliu.

509
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,720
Perhaps later,

510
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,440
Lin Wei can take you to my place
for coffee.

511
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,000
Sure.

512
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,270
Liuliu.

513
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:07,920
Liuliu.

514
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:09,720
Hey, Lin Wei.

515
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:10,790
You should head back now.

516
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:11,550
Oh, alright then.

517
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,680
I was just about to look for you.

518
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,640
My wife

519
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,880
made a lot of your favorite dishes.

520
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,880
We prepared some for Su as well.

521
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,160
Thank you, Chief.

522
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:17,720
Don't mention it.

523
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,400
Drop by later, alright?

524
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:18,880
Sure.

525
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:22,720
Second Granny.

526
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,350
Let me do it.

527
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:29,880
You're young.

528
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,480
That's why you're energetic.

529
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:32,680
Thanks.

530
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,400
Let me do it.

531
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:36,750
Okay.

532
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,440
Go ahead and do your work.

533
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:38,270
Take care of your back.

534
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:38,590
Sure.

535
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,720
Thank you.

536
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,480
Lin Wei, you're here.

537
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,110
Yeah.

538
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,550
Have you guys eaten?

539
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,350
Yes, we have.

540
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,030
Hey.

541
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:47,590
Lin Wei.

542
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,000
Yes?

543
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,400
Are you heading out?

544
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,110
No.

545
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:49,790
I'm taking Madam Lin for a stroll.

546
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,160
Oh.

547
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,160
You have a guest?

548
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:51,550
Yes.

549
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,480
Take care on your way.

550
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,030
Madam.

551
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,200
Let's head upstairs.

552
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:12,880
Madam.

553
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,030
Let me carry your bag for you.

554
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,110
No, thanks.

555
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,480
Attention, everyone.

556
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,200
We're holding
an emergency meeting now.

557
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,030
Your participation
is greatly appreciated.

558
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,790
I announce once again

559
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,720
that we're holding
an emergency meeting now.

560
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,070
Your participation
is greatly appreciated.

561
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,110
Chief.

562
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,880
Why did you gather us?

563
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,070
What's going on?

564
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,400
37 Foundation

565
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,750
was founded by my elder sister,

566
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,720
Ms. Jin Yue.

567
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,640
Isn't 37 Foundation

568
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,310
the fund institution

569
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,400
that funds our village?

570
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,640
The donor had always remained anonymous.

571
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:01,960
Turns out it was Jin Yue.

572
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,960
There's something I regretfully have

573
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,200
- to announce to everyone.
- That's right.

574
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,160
Over these years,

575
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,310
everyone has witnessed it firsthand.

576
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,920
The foundational development
of our village,

577
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:14,400
the road constructions,

578
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,920
and the educational resources
are all well-established.

579
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:23,000
Here are all the details
of their donations.

580
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,510
Does that mean

581
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,440
that during our difficult times,

582
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,070
she was supporting us financially?

583
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,350
I knew it.

584
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,000
Each year,

585
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,110
as the year draws to a close,

586
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,880
our village would
receive a significant amount of subsidy.

587
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:37,510
Yes.

588
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,000
Over all these years,

589
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,310
Jin Yue made some misjudgments.

590
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,110
Because of that, our village

591
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,000
has also paid a painful price.

592
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,640
Overnight,

593
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,350
everyone turned a cold shoulder to her

594
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,680
and started condemning her.

595
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,000
She became

596
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,440
the archenemy of our village.

597
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:56,110
But it was her,

598
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,590
who, despite our abandonment,

599
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:02,030
continued to silently contribute for us.

600
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,680
She treated us as family.

601
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:07,720
But what about us?

602
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,640
We even considered expelling her
from our family lineage.

603
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,750
Was this really

604
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:18,160
fair to her?

605
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,550
It's all because of certain individuals

606
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,070
who always hold onto others' weaknesses.

607
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,750
Even though she wanted
to make it up to us,

608
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,920
she had to do it secretly.

609
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,400
Each one of us here

610
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,030
and Jin Yue are from the same lineage.

611
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,880
Now that she's gone,

612
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,480
the Orange Jasmine

613
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,440
becomes the biggest regret of her life.

614
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,590
But isn't this also

615
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,070
the regret that each of us carry?

616
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:42,550
Yes.

617
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:43,720
Indeed.

618
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,640
Now that her son, Lin Wei,

619
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,590
has returned to fulfil his mother's wish

620
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:50,400
to grow tea,

621
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,270
we shouldn't hinder him.

622
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,790
Instead, we should help him.

623
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:01,440
Am I right?

624
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:05,590
He...

625
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,550
He can do whatever he wants

626
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,400
as long as he's capable of doing so.

627
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,440
Are we done with the tour yet?

628
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,030
Can we go back now?

629
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,590
We're almost done.

630
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,160
I just wanted to show you

631
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,880
Time Flies' office up there.

632
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:29,790
It's just ahead.

633
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,480
You're really enthusiastic, huh?

634
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,440
Yeah.

635
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,440
What was with his attitude?

636
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,000
Oh, Lin Wei.

637
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,240
Madam Lin.

638
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:36,070
Hey.

639
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,070
Did you tour around the village?

640
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:37,550
Yes, we did.

641
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:38,480
How is it?

642
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,000
Is it beautiful?

643
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:39,680
It is.

644
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,480
This is Su's mother.

645
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,110
Madam Lin.

646
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:42,310
Hello.

647
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,030
Hello, everyone.

648
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:43,920
Lin Wei.

649
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,310
We're here to share some good news.

650
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,110
Regarding 37 Foundation,

651
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,200
everyone already knows about it.

652
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:49,960
The village's one and only
stubborn old man

653
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,350
has agreed for you to grow tea.

654
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,510
Are you talking about Mr. Hua?

655
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:54,000
Yeah.

656
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,000
Isn't he causing trouble

657
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,920
at your tea shed all the time?

658
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:56,960
The chief has spoken,

659
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:57,880
so let's see if he still dares.

660
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,640
We should really thank the chief for that.

661
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,310
If it weren't for his attentiveness,

662
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:03,000
we wouldn't know until now

663
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,880
that your mother
had been helping our village.

664
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,310
Don't thank me.

665
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,750
To be honest, Mr. Hua

666
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,030
doesn't have any malicious intentions.

667
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,030
For so many years,

668
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,000
your mother supported our village.

669
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,270
He knows that very well.

670
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,590
By the way, Lin Wei,

671
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,000
I heard

672
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,920
that your father
pledged all his assets under his name

673
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,350
for you to take over the foundation.

674
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,680
Is that true?

675
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,400
Yes.

676
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,000
Doesn't that mean

677
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,110
you're having a hard time
running the foundation now?

678
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,640
If you need any help from us,

679
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:29,750
please let us know.

680
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,310
Yeah.

681
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,750
It's not a big deal,

682
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,200
so don't worry, everyone.

683
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,070
I'll take Yu's mom around first.

684
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:36,440
Okay.

685
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,070
Let's go.

686
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,030
I'm exhausted.

687
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,270
Goodbye.

688
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,310
I'm afraid it's a serious matter
for Lin Wei this time.

689
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:49,270

799
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,480

I'm your mother, alright?

801
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,550
What's with your attitude?

802
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,550
I know

803
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:29,680
that you don't approve of us together,

804
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,640
but Mom,

805
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,590
you went too far this time.

806
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:32,400
Do you know that?

807
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,750
Are you implying
that I did this intentionally?

808
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,160
Everything I'm doing

809
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,590
is for your own good, isn't it?

810
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,510
You were fine living in the city,

811
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,790
but you insist on coming
to the countryside to suffer.

Tell me.

Which mother wouldn't worry about that?

814
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,440
Lin Wei's not what you think.

815
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,880
He's not poor or incapable.

816

He used to have a successful career,

817
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,240
but everyone

818
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,350
has a different definition of success.

819
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,070
Do you know?

820
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,440
Success isn't just about having money.

821
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,480
Are you saying

822
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,680
that I'm money-minded now?

823
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,400
That I'm just chasing wealth?

824
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,590
Are you not?

825
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,000
Fine.
