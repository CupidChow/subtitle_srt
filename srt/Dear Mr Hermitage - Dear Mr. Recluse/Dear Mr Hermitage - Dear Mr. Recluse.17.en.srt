29
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,350
Ugh.

30
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,120
Have we arrived or what?

31
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,710
You didn't even wake me up.

32
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,120
What does this mean?

33
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,030
Why are we still in the village?

34
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,000
Shu Yue, what do you mean?

35
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,000
Didn't I tell you?

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,710
I'm not coming back to the village.

37
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,080
Why did you bring me back here again?

38
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,360
What are you doing?

39
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,150
Why is it you again?

40
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:27,710
You little assistant.

41
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,360
What are you up to?

42
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,030

00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,680
Can I have a word with you?

46
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,080
You have done talking, right?

47
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:36,590
Alright.

48
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,150
Good.

49
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,190
I might think about it.

50
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm heading back to the city now.

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,360
Goodbye.

52
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:40,560
Let's go.

53
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,190
Shu Yue, let's go home.

54
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,150
Oh dear.

55
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,750
What a day.

56
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:46,520
What is it?

57
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,120
What are you doing?

58
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,910
Do you want to force me?

59
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,150
It's at least a six-hour walk

60
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,470
back to the city from here.

61
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,560
Oh my.

62
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,190
Stop it.

63
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,150
Can you please stop messing around?

64
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:15,910
What are you doing?

65
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:16,630
I want to go home.

66
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,280
Why won't you let me go home?

67
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,430
Gosh, seriously?

68
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,910
Why is going home such a hassle?

69
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:23,840
Are you truly willing

70
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,360
to give Time Flies another chance?

71
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,430
What can I possibly do?

72
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,190
It's not up to me to call the shots.

73
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,470
Let's start the live stream.

74
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:36,360
I'll help you.

75
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,400
I'll help too.

76
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,190
What's this all about?

77
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,000
As you all know,

78
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,280
roses have always been a symbol of love.

79
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,190
But do you know

80
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,560
that besides being able
to convey affection,

81
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,520
roses can also be used in cooking?

82
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,520
Today, what I want to bring you

83
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,630
is a rose feast.

84
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,590
We're making dishes like rose pastries,

85
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,520
rose-filled dumplings,

86
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,430
rose porridge,

87
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,870
rose-infused pineapple,

88
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,030
rose-infused lamb,

89
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,960
and Su's special rose dirty coffee.

90
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,190
I hope you all can look forward to it.

91
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:09,680
Now let's get started.

92
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,080
Let's pluck the rose petals.

93
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,310
Can Su manage
to keep up with everything?

94
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,560
Mr. Zhang.

95
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,310
Where are you going?

96
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,160
Oh.

97
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,950
I'm going to the restroom.

98
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:24,630
I'll go with you.

99
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:27,800
It's okay.

100
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,720
I can hold it a bit longer.

101
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:35,480
Here,

102
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,160
have some sunflower seeds.

103
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,630
When making rose sauce,
you must be patient.

104
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,160
First, you have to pluck the rose petals

105
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,480
one by one.

106
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,680
Then wash them and let them dry.

107
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,040
Next, you start sauteing them in a pot.

108
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,390
When adding sugar...

109
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,360
When adding sugar,

110
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,870
you must be patient.

111
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,750
You have to add it slowly.

112
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,390
If not, it might burn.

113
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,680
So,

114
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,720
rose petals...

115
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,070
Sorry, my apologies.

116
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,120
If...

117
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,510
There are many ways to pair rose sauce

118
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,310
with dishes.

119
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,070
Hey, be careful.

120
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,360
Don't you dare run again.

121
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:49,680
Keep streaming.

122
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,270
The livestream was so amazing.

123
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,920
Congratulations.

124
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,360
Everyone, could you all

125
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,390
please let me go now?

126
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,480
Honestly,

127
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm tired.

128
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,040
I want to go home.

129
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:42,630
Uncle.

130
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,270
Uncle.

131
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,360
About...

132
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,430
About today's matter,

133
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,120
everyone wants me to apologize to you.

134
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:49,630
It's true

135
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,950
that I was the one who was at fault.

136
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,560
So, if you're angry, let it out on me.

137
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,390
You've been bothering me all day.

138
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,310
And

139
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,430
you are only apologizing to me now.

140
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,070
Aren't you just being
a Monday morning quarterback?

141
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:00,800
I'm sorry.

142
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,190
Uncle.

143
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:02,920
But,

144
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,720
about the investment in Time Flies,

145
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,430
could you...

146
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,160
Let me think about it.

147
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:13,680
Oh, wait.

148
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,390
About

149
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,190
that Lin,

150
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,160
he looks quite familiar to me.

151
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,390
Has he been in the newspaper or on TV?

152
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:23,720
Yeah.

153
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,680
He's been on TV.

154
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,680
You see, I'm right.

155
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,270
He must have done something wrong

156
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,270
to be on a legal program.

157
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,000
Oh, yeah.

158
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,830
What's his full name?

159
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,720
Lin Wei.

160
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,830
Lin Wei?

161
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:55,360
Master.

162
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,630
You don't have to worry.

163
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,000
I'll talk things over

164
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,630
with my uncle again.

165
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:00,560
That's all.

166
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,510
Thanks for your efforts today.

167
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,240
Get some early rest.

168
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,870
Can I come back to work tomorrow?

169
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,270
Be there by 8:00 AM.

170
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,200
Latecomer will sweep the floor.

171
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,600
Do you think

172
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,240
Mr. Zhang will invest in Times Flies?

173
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,750
Man proposes, God disposes.

174
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,670
We've done all we can to fight for it.

175
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:56,960
Don't overthink it.

176
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,550
Is there anything on my face?

177
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,150
Thank you.

178
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,360
Why thank me?

179
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,960
Thank you for being willing to change,

180
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:17,030
putting on a suit again to act with me,

181
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,270
and stepping in.

182
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,120
I know this isn't an easy thing for you.

183
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,200
If I weren't working right now,

184
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,480
I'd definitely give you some rewards.

185
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,000
It's not raining today.

186
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,360
Let's save it for later.

187
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,150
You're here.

188
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,440
You too.

189
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,270
Master has accepted me back.

190
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:58,670
I know.

191
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,870
I'm returning
the assistant position to you.

192
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,480
But some positions can't be reclaimed

193
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,840
after they've been given away.

194
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,030
If it truly belongs to you,

195
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,390
it can't be given away either.

196
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,600
Didn't you claim
that you wanted to focus on tea farming?

197
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,320
I actually believed

198
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,360
that you were all
about simplicity and detachment,

199
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,360
with no improper thoughts
toward my master.

200
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,550
I don't really need
to explain to you, do I?

201
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,870
Are you not willing to explain?

202
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:21,840
Or are you just too afraid to explain?

203
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,390
You won't leave the mountain for her,

204
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,840
so you make her stay here with you.

205
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,000
You want her to make sacrifices for you.

206
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,870
What about you?

207
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,550
Leaving without a word
and then suddenly returning.

208
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,440
Is your return this time

209
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,480
for the long term?

210
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,670
Or is it simply another cycle of pain?

211
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,120
Your mindset seems quite limited to me.

212
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:42,870
I won't leave this time

213
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,000
unless my master leaves first.

[Yunbei Time Flies Media]

215
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,480
Miss Su.

216
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,910
Did you gather us here

217
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,000
to announce some good news?

218
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,600
Yeah, it's about something.

219
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,030
Wasn't there a livestream yesterday?

220
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,360
Didn't everyone appear on it?

221
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:56,960
Yeah, right.

222
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:01,390
I think everyone should
be mentally prepared.

223
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:02,480
What's going on?

224
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,510
The livestream data
was pretty good yesterday.

225
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,390
Even Jin Na watched it too.

226
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,270
It was quite good.

227
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:08,600
Well...

228
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,270
If you have something to say,
just say it.

229
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,150
Don't beat around the bush.

230
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,440
It's not your style.

231
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,080
Well, promise me

232
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,910
that if you watch it,
you won't get angry.

233
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,240
No, we will not.

234
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:17,910
We definitely won't get angry.

235
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:18,440
That's right.

236
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,080
Alas.

237
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,120
Your hesitation is like
a double-edged sword.

238
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,960
Just spill the beans already.

239
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,000
Oh.

240
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,200
You stay out of this.

241
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,670
Take a look here.

242
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:29,270
My expression is too ugly here.

243
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,270
Oh my.

244
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,360
I fell so ungracefully.

245
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,440
And it was all captured on camera.

246
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,200
Hey.

247
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,440
I still looked good on camera here.

248
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,360
Who made these?

249
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,600
It's so infuriating.

250
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,670
These young people nowadays

251
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,360
should have their phones confiscated.

252
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:42,000
Didn't we agree not to get angry?

253
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,750
These netizens
have no respect for others.

254
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,080
I fired back at them this morning.

255
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:45,630
That's right.

256
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,200
What's this all about?

257
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,270
I think you're all quite cute.

258
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,670
That's because you're not in them.

259
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,270
Right.

260
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,790
I think so, you're cute.

261
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,360
The main issue is they're in the wrong.

262

She's right.

263

Look at how ugly my expression was.

264
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,440
And I didn't even get angry.

265

Yes.

He's probably busy.

286
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,600
I was thinking
that since he came all the way here,

287
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,150
I should make a good impression.

288

But I turned into a laughing stock.

289
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,120
It's fine to treat it as a joke.

290
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,750
But it ended up all over the internet.

Here's what I'll do.

00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,030
I'll go and find the source
of these images

295

and see how to deal with them.

296
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,840
Shu Yue.

297
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,550
You truly are my Doraemon.

He's just her apprentice.

How do they show it in TV dramas?

302
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:26,550
So many romantic relationships
start as close friends,

303

besties,

304
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,240
buddies,

305
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,150
apprentice, and so on.

306
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,270
These titles are what lead to
future developments.

307
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
When two people are together,

308
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,120
mutual trust is the foundation.

309
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,440
It's good to be broadminded,

310
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,550
but it's a different matter
if it backfires.

311
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,360
This is the one.

312

Hurry up, let's go.

313
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,910
I'm going to the city with Shu Yue.

314
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,480
This jerk.

315
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,550
Hey, wait for me.

316
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,120
What on earth is this?

317
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,750
Getting touchy-feely in broad daylight.

318
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,440
Not even afraid
of setting a bad example.

319
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,440
Why are you so mad?

320
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,750
I'm not mad at all.

321
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,840
I notice you're not angry.

322
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,030
I'm standing up for you.

323
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:02,600
Is there a problem?

324
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,150
For these trivial matters in the future,

325
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,150
you don't need to consult me.

326
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,480
You all can decide on your own.

327
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,840
As for the guide to opening the store,

328
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,960
I want to see a detailed proposal
from you by Monday.

329
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:18,550
That's it.

330
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:19,600
Mr. Jin.

331
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,840
I think we should
postpone the expansion plan

332
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:23,910
for the third-tier market for now.

333
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,840
Before the new product line is launched,

334
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,200
we need to be cautious

335
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,000
and consider Haowei Coffee's

336
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,480
past experiences and failures
with market expansion.

337
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,270
Cheers.

338
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,080
Why is it?

339
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,840
Why are you chugging down wine

340
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:41,960
so quick in broad daylight?

341
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,270
What's the hurry?

342
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,720
Who's in a hurry?

343
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,270
Oh.

344
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,150
What's wrong?

345
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,080
Are you upset?

346
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,240
Jin Xingchen.

347
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,030
I've told you before.

348
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,150
I don't like being a double spy.

349
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,000
And also,

350
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,270
from now on,

351
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,360
I won't report to you

352
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,390
about their movements anymore.

353
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,840
If you called me here

354
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,670
just to work overtime

355
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:01,910
at the restaurant on weekends with you,

356
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,030
I'm sorry.

357
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,150
I have something else to do.

358
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:04,790
I'm leaving now.

359
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,240
Sit down.

360
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,550
Since I asked you to meet up,

361
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:13,960
it must be for something.

362
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,440
A while back, I had too much to drink.

363
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,720
You were the one
who took me home, right?

364
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:21,670
I...

365
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,440
I don't remember that.

366
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,200
You don't remember?

367
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,320
But I do.

368
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,550
I've been quite busy with work lately,

369
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,750
so I haven't brought up this matter.

370
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,120
However,

371
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,240
I think we should
have a proper talk about it.

372
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:34,910
Now,

373
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,030
I'm pretty much prepared.

374
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,960
I've also acquired the equity shares.

375
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,550
When the time is right,

376
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,790
I'll team up with Mr. Cai
and take Haowei Coffee...

377
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:42,440
Mr. Jin.

378
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,270
Why are you telling me all this?

379
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,550
Our interaction is simply

380
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,320
a regular boss-employee relationship.

381
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:49,550
Besides,

382
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:50,750
aren't you worried

383
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,390
that I might tell Lin Wei about these?

384
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,550
Not worried at all.

385
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,270
You're my girlfriend.

386
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:56,960
What do I have to worry about?

387
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,390
What did you say?

388
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,510
I said I want you to be my girlfriend.

389
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,310
Do you understand?

390
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,200
Don't...

391
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,680
Don't joke with me like this.

392
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:07,590
I'm not joking.

393
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:08,680
I've thought about it seriously.

394
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,270
And I've made up my mind.

395
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,550
Look.

396
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,110
You and I.

397
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:14,920
We've already reached

398
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,000
a suitable age for marriage.

399
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:16,550
Am I right?

400
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,790
You've been my assistant

401
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,030
for quite a while now.

402
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,310
You know me very well.

403
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,750
And I've got used
to having you by my side.

404
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,200
Well.

405
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:24,720
There's an old saying.

406
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,720
"It's better to be well-cooked than raw."

407
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,350
You want me to be your girlfriend

408
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,640
just because we're familiar
with each other?

409
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,310
Is that so?

410
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:37,590
What's wrong with that?

411
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,270
Jin Xingchen.

412
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,640
Your steak is quite well-cooked too.

413
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,240
Go live your life with it.

414
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:49,680
Hey.

00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,110
What...

416
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,480
What was that about?

417
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
[Mr. Cai]

418
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,510

419
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:01,440
Is our plan still going smoothly?

420
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:02,830
Of course.

421
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,200
I really have to thank you for this.

422
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,960
Lin Wei did mortgage all his shares to me.

423
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,510
I must say, your nephew
is quite a stubborn one.

424
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,590
Even though he is deep in debt,

425
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,400
he's still enjoying life up
in the mountains

426
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,880
and living so comfortably.

427
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,750
Under the guise of redemption,

428
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:21,880
he's suddenly dating someone now.

429
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:22,790
Mr. Jin.

430
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,830
This is something you might not know.

431
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,920
It's called building a public image.

432
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,270
However,

433
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,920
putting him in debt

434
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:33,160
doesn't seem to have had a good effect.

435
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,590
What he cares about the most
is the 37 Foundation.

436
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,590
And you happen to be
the operator of the foundation.

437
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:44,790
So, I will leave the rest in your hands.

438
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,030
Mr. Cai, here's the thing.

439
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,550
That foundation is

440
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,000
my sister's lifelong dedication.

441
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,310
So, I don't intend to...

442
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,110
What's the big deal?

443
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,920
Your sister isn't here anymore,

444
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:58,510
right?

445
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,830
Shu Yue and I went to find

446
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,960
the original creator
of this set of memes.

447
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,310
It's Chen Xiangxiang again.

448
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,070
Isn't this a deliberate smear campaign
by competitors?

449
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,160
Do you know that early in the morning,

450
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,270
I've already received this meme

451
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,920
from eighteen people?

452
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,160
Netizens are referring to me
as "Miss Duck Droppings".

453
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,750
I really can't continue
as a food blogger anymore.

454
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,440
I'm in a situation
just as complicated as yours.

455
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:44,550
What happened to you?

456
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,160
Just a while ago,
my boss confessed to me.

457
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,070
Jin Xingchen?

458
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,440
Yeah.

459
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,070
Oh.

460
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,200
I knew it.

461
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,960
You made up that TV drama.

462
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
So, what did you do?

463
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,830
Of course, I rejected him.

464
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,400
How could I agree
to be with a villian like him?

465
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,160
And besides,

466
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,310
Jin Xingchen was the one

467
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,880
who sabotaged your proposal back then.

468
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,400
It's quite strange

469
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,270
that he, a CEO, would take the time

470
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,920
to mess with you.

471
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,030
I feel like I can't continue
with this job anymore.

472
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,480
I need to return to Time Flies
as soon as possible.

473
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,000
You really need to stay away

474
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,400

00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:21,920
