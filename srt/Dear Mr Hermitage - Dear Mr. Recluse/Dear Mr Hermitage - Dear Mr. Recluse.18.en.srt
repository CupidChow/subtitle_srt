30
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,280
There's a new bamboo restaurant in Yunbei

31
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,280
and it's very popular.

32

Do you want to go eat there together?

33
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,560
I finally have a day off tomorrow.

34
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,630
I want to spend some time with Lin Wei.

35

Oh.

36
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,430
What about the day after tomorrow?

37
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,590
Feifei might be free.

38
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,910
Maybe you can try asking her.

39
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,560
Aren't you supposed to go

40
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,120

Shu Yue.

44
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,680
I sent you a message about a restaurant.

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,800
It's a very popular
bamboo restaurant in Yunbei recently.

Do you have feelings...

Yes.

51
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,120
When did it started?

52
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,400
It just happened
without me realizing it.

You're truly my nemesis.

Regarding Shu Yue,

59
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,960
his feelings toward me
are truly unexpected.

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,630
I only sensed them recently.

61
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,430
Are you troubled as well?

62
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,430
After all, he's an apprentice under me.

63
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,030
I'm just afraid

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,750
that we can't even be friends anymore.

65
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,680
Should we work together?

What?

67
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,000
Forget it.

I've worked with many people,

69

but I don't see any benefits.

70

if you have any expectations
for your girlfriend.

80
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:22,870
For example,

81
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,600
not allowing her

82
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,800
to get intimate with other guys,

83
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,310
or not allowing her

84

and you also need your space,

too much pressure.

We've also received
some business inquiries.

124
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,120
Thus, I've decided

125
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,120
to reward everyone

126
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,430

The second thing is,

130
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,000
I've had business cards
made for everyone.

the centre of attention.

It was very wrong of me.

169
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,870
So, I must strictly adhere
to meeting disciplines

174
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,360
We'll resolutely obey you.

175
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,360
We'll do whatever you ask us to do.

176
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,560
No matter what it is,

177
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,870
we'll give our utmost cooperation.

178
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:52,800
Utmost cooperation.

179
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,800
And the third thing

180
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,750
is the most exciting event

181
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,360
of this quarter.

182
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,310
Our company
has been invited to participate in

183
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,480
["Hao Yu"]
the Shining Network Celebrity Ceremony

184
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,510
next Friday.

185
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,270
Well,

186
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,870
I have a few acres of grass at home

187
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,480
that still need to be weeded.

188
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,190
I don't have time.

189
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,360
You can represent us.

190
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,160
Actually,

191
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,870
my tomato trellis
needs to be set up too.

192
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,720
My chicken is about to hatch some eggs.

193
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,750
I'm leaving.

194
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,560
This Friday is
the anniversary of my husband's death.

195
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,720
It's not appropriate for me to go.

196
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,680
Didn't you say you would obey me fully

197
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,830
and do whatever I ask you to do?

198
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,070
I can go.

199
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,240
You can go?

200
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,200
Didn't you say
you don't like social events?

201
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:34,910
It's different if I go with you.

202
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,390
Feifei.

203
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:46,480
So,

204
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,320
I've calculated
the project's earnings for you.

205
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,510
You can use this calculation

206
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,910
to pay the team.

207
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,550
I think you can create
a model in the future

208
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:54,910
based on the project type,

209
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,910
revenue structure,

210
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,480
profit distribution ratio...

211
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,270
Wait a minute.

212
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,440
Isn't it a bit early
to start modeling now?

213
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,120
No, it's not too early.

214
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,910
Strategy.

215
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,480
Planning comes first,

216
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,000
and tactics comes second.

217
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,240
I'm planning for your long-term success.

218
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,080
Thank you.

219
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,440
Oh, by the way.

220
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,960
I've prepared
a sample of your business card.

221
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:09,910
From now on,

222
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,270
you'll be our Finance Director

223
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,510
[Luo Feifei, Finance Director]
at Time Flies.

224
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,150
It sounds like a rather idle position.

225
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,440
Right.

226
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,440
Why didn't Shu Yue come today?

227
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,550
He left after delivering
the invitation card.

228
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,670
Invitation card?

229
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:25,240
Yes.

230
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,440
Do you want to attend

231
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,200
the Shining Network Celebrity Ceremony?

232
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:27,630
I...

233
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:28,720
Never mind.

234
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:30,870
I think you don't really like

235
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,440
these kinds of events.

236
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,080
I'll just go meet with Shu Yue.

237
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,390
I'll go.

238
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,720
Why would I not go?

239
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:50,600
Mr. Jin.

240
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,080
I've brought the clothes you wanted.

241
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:53,840
Bring them in.

242
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,630
He didn't even think of
helping me to carry them.

243
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,440
Mr. Jin.

244
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,320
Why are you still calling me "Mr. Jin"?

245
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,550
I'll place your clothes here.

246
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,390
Oh, by the way,

247
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,720
among those two sets of clothes,

248
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,790
one of them was bought for you.

249
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,120
Take a look and see if it fits.

250
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,840
Bought for me?

251
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,630
How did you know my size?

252
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,720
I know the sizes of all the employees.

253
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,030
What are you thinking?

254
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:35,790
Oh.

255
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:39,840
This outfit

256
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,480
doesn't seem to match my style.

257
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,480
Besides, I don't have a chance to wear it.

258
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,320
Thanks anyway.

259
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,080
Wait a moment.

260
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:45,870
Actually,

261
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,200
there's an upcoming chance
for you to wear it.

262
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,320
There's a network celebrity event.

263
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,120
I want you to go with me.

264
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,440
You want me to go with you?

265
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,200
Yes.

266
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,150
I'm giving you two options now.

267
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,390
Either go with me as a colleague,

268
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,750
or go with me as a girlfriend.

269
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,360
Please.

270
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,000
Just go with me, okay?

271
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,720
When you're with me,

272
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:16,870
I feel more at ease.

273
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,150
Is this event that important to you?

274
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,320
This is not something you usually do.

275
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:39,750
Tomorrow, I'll wear black.

276
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,000
You should wear black too.

277
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,600
Why?

278
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,960
Are you trying to make an announcement
of our relationship?

279
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,200
It's better for us

280
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,270
to keep low on our relationship.

281
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,240
Why?

282
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,150
Do you think
I'm not good enough for you?

283
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,960
I'm a famous influencer
with 600,000 followers.

284
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,150
How am I not good enough for you?

285
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,000
Well, I'm the one
who's not good enough for you.

286
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,320
You're catching onto the joke, huh?

287
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,440
You haven't answered my question.

288
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,550
Not all questions have answers.

289
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,510
Your gown is so grand.

290
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,390
This is what I wore

291
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,150
when I used to attend banquets
with Lin Wei.

292
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,390
I couldn't find
other gowns in such a short time,

293
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,080
so I just decided to wear it.

294
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,200
It's something that I always do.

295
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,240
Bai.

296
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:35,720
Su.

297
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,910
Let me introduce you.

298
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,720
My best friend, Bai Ruan.

299
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,630
And this is the financial director
in my company.

300
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,120
Nice to meet you.

301
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:41,750
I'm Luo Feifei.

302
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:42,440
Nice to meet you.

303
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:42,870
I'm Bai Ruan.

304
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,320
Don't you dislike

305
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,550
attending events like this?

306
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,790
There's nothing I can do.

307
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,910
Right now,

308
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,120
I'm just a tool controlled by my boss.

309
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,550
Do you want to consider

310
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,550
going back to Time Flies?

311
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,910
We can talk about that in the future.

312
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,000
Look who's here.

313
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,080
You're so beautiful.

314
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,080
Don't dress like this anynmore.

315
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,030
I don't think
you came here to accompany me.

316
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,240
You're here to keep an eye on me, right?

317
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,600
Since Shu Yue is here,
I have to do this.

318
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,270
You're so straightforward
with your jealousy now.

319
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,390
Facing my desires and obsessions openly

320
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,080
is also a form of self-cultivation.

321
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,320
Are you guys trying
to make people jealous?

322
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,550
You'll break up soon
if you're always showing off.

323
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,030
Touch wood. Don't curse us.

324
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,080
Sooner or later,

325
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,600
you'll fall in love too.

326
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,840
Let's go inside.

327
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,390
You guys go ahead.

328
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,510
I need to wait for my boss.

329
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,440
Mr. Lin.

330
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,030
Long time no see.

331
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:00,960
What have you been up to lately?

332
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,150
There are many old friends over there
waiting for you.

333
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,120
Let's go and chat with them.

334
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,630
Go ahead.

335
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,080
Let's go.

336
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,030
Su.

337
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,150
Lin Wei is really willing to do

338
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,910
anything for you.

339
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,080
Normally,

340
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,480
he wouldn't attend events like this.

341
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,120
He's really good to you.

342
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,480
This one looks good.

343
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:19,910
Hey.

344
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,320
Miss Su, you're here too.

345
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,080
You're such an honored guest.

346
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,120
Are you here to receive an award today?

347
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,630
Thanks for your Jade Ruyi.

348
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,320
But I've noticed

349
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,440
you haven't been doing well lately.

350
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,000
You post about your rural life every day.

351
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,390
There's only one thing good about you.

352
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,600
You're selfless.

353
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,600
You're willing to share your own pain

354
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,000
to make everyone else happy.

355
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,150
Do you have any friends at all?

356
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,840
Why are you always

357
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,750
checking my Wechat posts?

358
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,870
You do have many friends.

359
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,670
They all come from the mountains.

360
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,670
Daughters of the mountains, huh?

361
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:50,480
You...

362
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,550
Sorry about that.

363
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,200
Sorry.

364
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,390
I didn't mean to.

365
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,670
- Let me wipe that for you.
- Are you blind?

366
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,480
Can I make it up to you?

367
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,480
This bag is expensive.

368
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,630
Can you afford it?

369
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,550
How do you know she can't afford it?

370
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,510
It's just a bag.

371
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,910
You can just
send it for maintenance, right?

372
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,270
It's not about the bag.

373
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,600
It's that people with different statuses

374
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,270
shouldn't be in the same place.

375
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,870
Aren't you all just staying together

376
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,550
because you have a low number of fans?

377
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,030
I have 30 million fans,
and it's still not enough?

378
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,840
How many fans
do you have to be so great?

379
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,030
You probably have

380
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:23,840
over a billion of fans.

381
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,440
Excuse me.

382
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,320
May I know...

383
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,600
I'm Chun Huahua.

384
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,870
This is my husband.

385
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:38,630
Niu Fangfang.

386
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,960
I've seen reports about you.

387
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,270
I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you.

388
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,240
We usually don't dress up
when shooting videos.

389
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,790
Today, we dressed up for this event,

390
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,510
and yet we were looked down upon.

391
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,480
If I had known earlier,

392
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:50,870
I wouldn't have worn this suit.

393
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,440
No.

394
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,200
I think it looks good.

395
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,390
Don't care about what others say.

396
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:54,720
I'm honored to know you.

397
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,360
I've been watching your videos too,

398
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,240
and I really like them.

399
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:58,630
By the way,

400
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,960
I wonder if we can

401
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,270
exchange WeChat contacts later.

402
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:05,360
Sure.

403
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,000
Cheers.

404
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,320
Master.

405
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,600
Feifei.

406
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:14,550
Excuse me for a while.

407
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,000
Shu Yue.

408
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,840
With your attire today,

409
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,840
I couldn't recognize you.

410
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,120
You look great today too.

411
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:23,790
Oh, right.

412
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,030
Let me introduce you to my friend.

413
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,000
Feifei.

414
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,960
I'll take her over for a while.

415
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:43,750
You look so beautiful.

416
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,630
Did you just realize it today?

417
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:48,390
Nope.

418
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,000
Zhang.

419
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,200
Mr. Zhang, the CEO of Zhang Media Group.

420
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:58,630
This is my master

421
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,150
I told you about.

422
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,240
Su Shiyu from Time Flies.

423
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,150
Her account is called "Hao Yu".

424
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:03,750
Okay.

425
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:10,200
Bai Ruan.

426
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:11,480
Go there and wait for me.

427
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:12,550
Okay.

428
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,160
Well, let's chat next time.

429
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,270
Sure, take care.

430
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:18,590
Lin Wei.

431
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,200
Aren't you someone

432
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,590
who usually dislikes events like this?

433
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,160
Why did you come today?

434
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,790
People always change, you know.

435
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,880
Are you attached to the mortal world

436
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:33,640
and not practicing meditation anymore?

437
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:35,550
I thought

438
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,160
you'd be away for a while.

439
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,270
It seems like during my absence,

440
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,750
you've been having a great time.

441
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,070
Do you wish I didn't come back?

442
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,880
Whether you're here or not

443
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,830
doesn't affect my mood.

444
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,830
I'm quite curious then.

445
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,480
What kind of mood

446
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,200
did you come with today?

447
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:57,830
Satisfaction?

448
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,240
Joy?

449
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:00,640
Or something else?

450
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,590
I don't want to argue with you now.

451
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,880
It's been a long time since all of that.

452
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,750
Can we move on

453
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,830
and stop dwelling on that?

454
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,200
Do you think

455
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,160
that by going up the mountain

456
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,720
and planting tea,

457
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,030
you can claim the moral high ground

458
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:22,960
and look down on me?

459
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,070
I admit

460
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,590
that you used to be
a genius in our family,

461
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,480
but now, our family is gone.

462
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,920
I don't care about anything anymore.

463
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,270
I just hope

464
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,200
that you won't live a good life.

465
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,640
If you insist on acting like this,

466
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,830
then I have nothing to say.

467
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,510
But no matter what happens,

468
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:46,680
how we argue,

469
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,030
blood is thicker than water.

470
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:52,880
Uncle.

471
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,400
I'll always wish you well.

472
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:57,270
Do you wish me well?

473
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,240
Don't you think
you're being hypocritical?

474
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,000
Hello, everyone.

475
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,640
Welcome to

476
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,920
our ceremony.

477
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,160
I announce

478
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,480
that the third
Shining Network Celebrity Ceremony

479
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,480
officially begins.

480
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,110
Now, let's announce
the winner of this year's

481
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:27,310
Most Popular Award.

482
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,440
The nominees for this award are

483
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,830
Chun Huahua and Niu Fangfang,

484
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,550
Xiangxiang's Food Testing,

485
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,200
Zhang Loves Life,

486
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:37,160
Everything on One Street,

487
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,110
and lastly, Ma and Tiao's Happy Life.

488
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:44,590
This time

489
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:47,550
the winner of the Most Popular Award is

490
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,400
Chun Huahua and Niu Fangfang.

491
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,110
Please come forward to the stage.

492
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,920
May I ask, with this award,

493
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:13,000
is there anything
you'd like to share with everyone?

494
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,440
I heard

495
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:20,200
that this award
comes with a 200 thousand cash prize.

496
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,240
Is that true?

497
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:28,070
You're really focused
on the main point, aren't you?

498
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:28,960
Yes, it's true.

499
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,880
I want to donate

500
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,720
this 200 thousand to the 37 Foundation.

501
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,550
This is because I've received help

502
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,960
from this foundation before.

503
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:44,160
Now that I can earn money,

504
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,070
I won't forget those who helped me.

505
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,510
I'll ensure

506
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,510
the continuity of this foundation.

507
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,960
- Great!
- Great!

508
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,440
Wait a minute.

509
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,510
Why is this person going on the stage?

510
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,590
What is he doing?

511
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,550
Who is this?

512
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,440
Hello, everyone.

513
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,000
I am the manager of the 37 Foundation.

514
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,720
My name is Jin Xingchen.

515
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,920
First of all,
I want to thank these two bloggers

516
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,510
for their donations to the foundation.

517
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,160
Thank you.

518
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,110
The 37 Foundation

519
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,480
was founded by my late sister,

520
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,310
Ms. Jin Yue.

521
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,070
The original purpose
of establishing this foundation

522
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,830
was to help Village Xiaojin.

523
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,510
But today,

524
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,030
I regret to inform everyone

525
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,680
that Ms. Jin Yue,

526
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,160
the founder of the 37 Foundation,

527
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:46,830
my sister,

528
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:48,830
has passed away.

529
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,310
After her passing,

530
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,270
the foundation
has not been managed well.

531
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,640
As a result,

532
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,030
I have made the decision

533
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,030
that once the foundation

534
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:02,110
completes its final donation today,

535
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:05,310
it will be dissolved.

536
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,750
Is this a decision
of the board of directors?

537
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,270
Mr. Jin.

538
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,640
May I ask about
the challenges encountered

539
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,400
during the foundation's operations

540
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,590
and the reasons
behind its management failure?

541
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:16,680
Is Ms. Li's nursing home

542
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,350
supported by this foundation as well?

543
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,350
Yes.

544
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,030
For example,
the funds weren't used properly,

545
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,720
there were
internal personnel transfers...

546
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,880
Mr. Jin, may I ask

547
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,270
what difficulties exactly
did the foundation encounter

548
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,720
in its operation?

549
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,510
This should be considered

550
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,960
an internal matter of our company.

551
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,640
You have no right to interfere.

552
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,510
But isn't this
more than just a company matter?

553
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,790
This also involves many

554
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,110
residents who need

555
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,310
the foundation's support.

556
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,640
The 37 Foundation

557
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:52,070
was established by my mother,
Ms. Jin Yue, when she was alive.

558
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,830
I will keep it running.

559
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,750
In the future,
all expenses incurred by the foundation

560
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,680
will be borne by me.

561
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,030
All poverty alleviation projects
will also continue to operate.

562
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,720
As long as I'm here,

563
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,480
it will not be dissolved.

564
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,830
Mr. Lin Wei.

565
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,640
If I recall correctly,

566
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:09,590
you've already gone bankrupt.

567
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,270
I wonder

568
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,000
how can you manage the foundation.

569
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,920
Since it's a charity project,

570
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,000
it doesn't have to

571
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,830
be restricted to its forms, right?

572
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,070
The relevant procedures
for the 37 Foundation

573
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,880
have been finalized last month,

574
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,270
and the application
can be launched immediately.

575
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,480
The 37 Foundation

576
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,440
will be open to the public.

577
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,350
We'll receive from the people

578
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,880
and give back to the people.

579
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:38,110
It will become a charitable platform.

580
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,680
Great!

581
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,160
Mr. Lin.

582
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,550
May I ask
when did you first conceive the idea

583
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,590
of turning the 37 Foundation

584
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,960
into an application?

585
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:57,880
After I got together with my girlfriend.

586
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,270
Do you mean the one beside you?

587
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:01,110
Isn't she the famous blogger "Hao Yu"?

588
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:01,790
Mr. Lin.

589
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:02,960
I heard
you've been restricted from spending.

590
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,830
Is that true?

591
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,000
It's true.

592
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,640
Can you share some details about
the later operation of the application?

593
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,310
Those details will be announced later.

594
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,000
Jin Xingchen.

595
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,110
Why did you dissolve the foundation?

596
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,510
It's such a good cause

597
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,920
that can help so many people.

598
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,240
Why would you dissolve it?

599
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,680
I don't want to.

600
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,640
37 Foundation.

601
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,270
Do you know what "37" represents?

602
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,240
March 7th.

603
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:49,510
That's my sister's birthday.

604
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,400
I know.

605
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,550
In the hearts of all of you,

606
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:56,880
I'm a selfish,

607
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:58,680
cold,

608
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,030
shameless person

609
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,160
who can do anything

610
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,750
to achieve all his goals.

611
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,920
But was I like that before?

612
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:12,790
Lin Wei.

613
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,480
He was loved by the whole family.

614
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:19,400
Since he was little,

615
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,790
my sister loved him,

616
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:23,550
protected him,

617
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,200
nurtured him,

618
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,550
and sent him abroad for education,

619
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,070
hoping he would

620
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,830
support the family after he succeeded.

621
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,960
But what did he do?

622
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,240
My sister went through
so much trouble back then,

623
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,590
and he could have easily helped.

624
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,350
You say I'm selfish,

625
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,110
cold-hearted,

626
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:45,960
but in my heart,

627
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,550
he is the most selfish

628
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,590
and cold-hearted person.

629
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,110
When my sister was dying,

630
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,590
she was still thinking of him.

631
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,960
Maybe in my sister's heart,

632
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,920
she had already forgiven him.

633
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,960
But in mine,

634
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,830
I will never forgive him.

635
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,350
Su.

636
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,310
I really feel sorry for you.

637
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,310
You thought you found a rich boyfriend,

638
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:36,160
but it turns out he's broke.

639
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:38,880
I can understand it, though.

640
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,590
Every pheasant

641
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,960
wants to become a phoenix.

642
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,510
However,

643
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,750
not all pheasants succeeds,

644
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,000
and they end up in the pheasant coop.

645
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,750
Actually,
whether you can become a phoenix

646
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,270
depends on your own hard work.

647
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:52,000
Then, you better work hard

648
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,400
to catch up with me.

649
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,070
Why should I catch up with you?

650
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,400
I'm not interested in that.

651
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,240
But I do need to work hard

652
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,720
to surpass you.

653
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,960
[Best Fashion Award]
Get this first before saying that,

654
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,640
or you should go home and sleep earlier.

655
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,200
In your dreams...

656
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,480
Hold your trophy tight.

657
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,680
Don't drop it on the floor.

658
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:13,790
Over there.

659
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:14,400
Let's go.

660
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:16,920
We want to interview you.

661
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,480
Mr. Lin.

662
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,440
Mr. Lin.

663
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:23,790
Run.

664
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,440
Wait.

665
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,920
Is our relationship
officially announced now?

666
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:26,720
Of course.

667
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,790
Weren't you going to make your move?

668
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,070
Why are you helping Lin Wei

669
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,310
to retreat with Su Shiyu?

670
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:43,880
What about you?

671
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,350
Didn't you also help just now?

672
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,110
I quit a long time ago.

673
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:58,750
I can't do this anymore.

674
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,160
My feet hurt too much.

675
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:02,400
Take off your shoes.

676
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,070
I'll carry you.

677
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:21,270
Although I know you're tired now,

678
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,720
I still hope this path

679
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,830
can be a bit longer.

680
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,270
Life

681
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,750
is a long and dark road itself.

682
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,440
As long as I'm with you,

683
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,510
