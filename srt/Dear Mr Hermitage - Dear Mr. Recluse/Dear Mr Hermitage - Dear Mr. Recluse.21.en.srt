[Dear Mr. Recluse]

28
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,020
[Episode 21]

29
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,070
When there is enough fertilizer,

30
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,590
new shoots grow quickly,

31
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,920
tea leaves sprout more,

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
internode length increases,

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,840
and the number of leaves increases

34
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,870
along with their size.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,350
Their youthful phase will be prolonged,

36
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,040
and

37
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,510
the reproductive growth
can also be suppressed,

38
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,430
thus increase
the quantity and quality of the leaves.

39
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,040
Am I right?

40
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,000
Can I be considered half an expert?

41
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,560
Your theory is right,

42
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,280
but you still need
to improve on practical application.

43
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,400
During the germination period
of tea seedlings,

44
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,030
directly applying fertilizer
to the roots

45
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,000
can easily lead to fewer roots.

46
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,310
Like this.

47
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,710
Just spray a small amount

48
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,400
on the leaf surface.

49
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:22,240
Here.

50
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,520
These tea seedlings are growing well.

51
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,520
Have you thought about
opening up a sales channel?

52
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,190
Hmm.

53
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,710
Orange Jasmine is a rare variety

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,840
which has a low production.

55
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,560
Apart from the small number
of tea enthusiasts in the country,

56
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,590
not many people know about it.

57
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,080
Furthermore,

58
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,840
the growth cycle of tea seedlings

59
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,910
is about two to three years,

60
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,430
so it would be
difficult to promote them.

61
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,190
Well,

62
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,630
we can do it through live streaming.

63
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,560
I can help you with it.

64
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,430
We can use
a tea seedling adoption model.

65
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,710
This way,

66
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,000
customers will be allowed

67
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,080
to enjoy

68
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,560
an individualization service.

69
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,190
Once we open up a sales channel,

70
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,560
not only can we
develop the land behind the mountain,

71
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,030
but we can also involve the villagers.

72
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,750
But the land behind the mountain

73
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,190
is already being prepared

74
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,800
by Haowei Coffee
to grow new coffee varieties.

75
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,400
If we change to growing tea

76
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,360
at this crucial moment,

77
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,750
it would be too risky.

78
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,800
I don't want
the villagers to bear this for me.

79
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:20,840
You really don't need to worry about

80
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,430
this matter.

81
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:24,560
Sorry.

82
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,590
I overheard everything just now.

83
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,630
But I think what Su said

84
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,750
is very feasible.

85
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:30,870
Chief.

86
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,430
I know that you all
support my mother's dream,

87
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,280
but

88
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,870
if we change to growing tea now,

89
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:36,840
it will be too risky.

90
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,630
Chief.

91
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,910
Lin Wei's result
of Orange Jasmine planting

92
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,310
can be seen by all.

93
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,030
Now that the tea seedlings
have also been planted,

94
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,560
the risk will clearly
be decreased significantly.

95
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,240
So, as long as we give Lin Wei a chance,

96
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,910
the villagers can wait
for our pre-sale to succeed

97
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:50,470
before joining us.

98
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,960
They'll have the option
to join or exit.

99
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,430
Su is right.

100
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,310
Lin Wei.

101
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,400
Give it a try.

102
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,750
I'll take care of

103
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,030
the piece of land
behind the mountain for you.

104
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:58,710
Alright?

105
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,040
How's your consideration?

106
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,870
If we use the land behind the mountain,

107
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,800
we'll be against my uncle.

108
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,720
Don't get caught up in that.

109
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,750
Actually, I think the villagers

110
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,870
are all on your side.

111
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,600
People who believe in you

112
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,390
will definitely support you

113
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,360
without regretting it.

114
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,600
You should know

115
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,070
that they don't just believe in you,

116
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,870
they believe in
their own choices as well.

117
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:52,600
So, you should

118
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,800
give yourself a chance.

119
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:57,510
Lin Wei.

120
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,000
Su.

121
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,720
We're here!

122
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,600
All of us support you.

123
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,040
What are you still worried about?

124
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,510
When is the pre-sale happening?

125
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,000
I want to make a solo appearance!

126
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:06,680
Oh, right.

127
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,510
You can't stream at night.

128
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,680
Night time is face mask time.

129
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,430
And I need to go to bed early.

130
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,630
I don't understand

131
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,390
the marketing plan.

132
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,800
Just tell me,

133
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,190
if it succeeds,

134
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,040
how much money can I get?

135
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,160
Why are you so greedy for money?

136
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,120
I don't know how to do live,

137
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,800
but I can help with farming.

138
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,360
In any case,

139
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,830
I'll support you.

140
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,240
Yes.

141
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,000
I agree!

142
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,950
I simply told them about the plan,

143
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:31,920
but I never thought

144
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,040
that so many people would support you.

145
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:33,630
Right?

146
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,830
Of course.

147
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:35,510
Absolutely.

148
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,430
My ancestors all grew tea.

149
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,240
We've just started
understanding how to grow coffee,

150
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,830
let alone how to develop new varieties.

151
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,070
I just want to know

152
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,120
if we can make money
from growing tea now?

153
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,800
Of course, we can.

154
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,070
Otherwise, how will
the company make profits?

155
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,430
Okay.

156
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,240
It's settled.

157
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,750
Can you just consider me

158
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,680
tagging along?

159
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,800
I also want to try
live streaming commerce anyways.

160
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:03,830
Besides,

161
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,680
this is all because

162
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,240
I'm lucky to have

163
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,360
an excellent boyfriend.

164
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,240
Just think of it as helping me out

165
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,630
to grow the company, alright?

166
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:25,360
Alright.

167
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,630
We're taking

168
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,240
the land behind the mountains.

169
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,510
Very well.

170
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,070
I promise to help Village Xiaojin

171
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,160
create a brand-new
ecological industry chain.

172
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,920
In less than five years,

173
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,190
the village will change dramatically.

174
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,240
Okay!

175
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,920
That's great!

176
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,240
We support you!

177
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:50,950
Let's do this!

178
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,270
Thank you.

179
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:59,430
This is amazing.

180
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,830
So, Chief,

181
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,870
what do we need to do now?

182
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,750
Rainy season

183
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,510
is coming.

184
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,240
As the village chief,

185
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,070
I must set an example and take the lead

186
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,600
to think of unexpected situations
that the villagers might not anticipate.

187
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,600
I must look ahead

188
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,480
and consider potential risks.

189
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:21,630
Now,

190
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,560
I'm going to help a special farmer

191
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:24,560
to reinforce the tea shed.

192
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,430
Our chief

193
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,800
is truly very warm-hearted.

194
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,600
Alright.

195
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,510
We're almost there.

196
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,190
Perhaps this villager

197
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:30,830
has been waiting for a while...

198
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:31,720
Chief.

199
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,070
Why did you just arrive?

200
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,510
We have finished
reinforcing the tea shed.

201
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,120
Ah.

202
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,830
You're live streaming.

203
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,160
Hello, everyone.

204
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,270
Hello everyone, I'm Mrs. Sha.

205
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,560
I'm Second Granny.

206
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,560
Let's go.

207
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,560
Let's go.

208
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,360
Let's go.

209
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,750
You guys carry on.

210
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,680
Alright.

211
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:50,430
Alright.

212
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,560
Goodbye.

213
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,120
Bye.

214
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,680
As you can see,

215
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:56,680
they

216
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:57,680
looked ahead

217
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,160
and acted ahead.

218
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,190
This is closely tied

219
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,360
to my usual teachings.

220
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:03,950
Alright.

221
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:04,720
Now,

222
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:05,870
I'll take everyone

223
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,720
to see this special tea farmer

224
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,190
and the special tea seedling
he's growing.

225
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,160
In front,

226
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:12,830
right here...

227
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,120
Why did he take away my phone?

228
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,430
Look what the heat did to you.

229
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,240
Quick, wipe yourself.

230
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,510
This is nothing.

231
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,720
These are just cold sweat.

232
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,240
You didn't even wipe this part.

233
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,190
It's...

234
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,080
It's fine.

235
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,360
I can wipe myself.

236
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,510
I'll go check on Chief.

237
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,670
I'll go buy water.

238
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:48,270
Come.

239
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,480
Everyone, take a look.

240
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,600
This is the specialty of Village Xiaojin,

241
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,790
Orange Jasmine.

242
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,030
Although our village...

243
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:54,510
Master.

244
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,030
- I'll hold it.
- is a coffee plantation site,

245
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:56,840
but,

246
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,790
our village

247
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,320
- was once very famous
- Why are you so late?

248
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,080
in Yunbei.

249
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,270
- as a tea plantation site.
- It was the chief.

250
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,840
He insisted
on showcasing his brewing skills

251
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,200
and while doing that,

252
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,480
he talked about the past

253
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,870
and future development
of Village Xiaojin.

254
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,840
But it made
a lot of followers leave the live.

255
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,870
Let me check the current data.

256
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,270
Look.

257
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,510
[Shouldn't this be a food blog?]
Many viewers quit.

258
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:18,750
[Who is this? Where is Miss Su?]
The number is still not rising.

259
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,750
[This man is ugly. Get another host.]

260
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,120
Out with the old,

261
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,910
in with the new.

262
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,000
Hey.

263
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,670
What do you think of this sales method?

264
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,120
I've thought about it carefully too.

265
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,000
If we combine live streaming
with the adoption model,

266
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,120
it will demand
some patience from our fans.

267
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:37,910
But on the other hand,

268
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,080
it will increase fan engagement

269
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,670
over time.

270
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,240
They'll grow together
with the tea seedlings,

271
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,030
and naturally,

272
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,670
they'll spread
the word about our tea.

273
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:47,390
So, I'll explain
the adoption process later

274
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,670
to everyone.

275
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,550
I'll handle it.

276
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:49,870
Okay.

277
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,510
Shu Yue.

278
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:56,550
This matter

279
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,390
might be something

280
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,150
that won't
yield profits in the long run.

281
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,240
If...

282
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,000
There's no "if".

283
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,030
I don't know
if there will be any profits,

284
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,320
but I do know
that this is meaningful

285
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:08,840
and I won't regret it.

286
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,670
If anyone is interested,

287
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,360
you can contact our management team

288
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,550
to adopt tea seedlings.

289
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,320
Oh.

290
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:20,790
Huh?

291
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,440
Why is no one commenting anymore?

292
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,200
Did the internet go down?

293
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:25,960
Hey.

294
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:26,550
Lin Wei.

295
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,510
Come over here.

296
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,120
It seems like my internet is down.

297
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,270
Check it out.

298
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,270
[So handome.]
[Introduce yourself, handsome.]

299
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,270
[I think he's more handsome
than the assistant.]

300
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:38,910
Everyone, look.

301
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,630
This young man

302
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,600
right beside me

303
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,150
is the owner of our tea garden.

304
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:42,630
Master.

305
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,030
Don't let his youth fool you.

306
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,720
Since he came to Village Xiaojin,

307
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,360
[Am I seeing this right? So handsome!]
he has bonded with our villagers

308
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,960
and developed this tea farm.

309
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,630
This young man's

310
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,670
hardworking spirit

311
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,390
is something
young people should learn from.

312
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:53,360
Lin Wei.

313
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,550
Come say hi to everyone.

314
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:56,790
Ah.

315
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,200
Lin Wei, don't go.

316
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,630
See how welcoming everyone is.

317
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,630
A lot of people are commenting
since you appeared.

318
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,390
You should promote our tea.

319
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,320
If we can sell them,

320
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,480
it will also help Village Xiaojin.

321
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,200
Alright?

322
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,150
(My business is your business.)

323
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,790
(Besides, your appearance in public
will also benefit Village Xiaojin.)

324
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:21,150
Come on.

325
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:21,630
Lin Wei.

326
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,200
Say hi to everyone.

327
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,030
Hello, everyone.

328
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,510
Welcome to Village Xiaojin.

329
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,630
Orange Jasmine.

330
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,510
Orange Jasmine

331
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:35,000
is a very delicate variety.

332
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,000
During cultivation,

333
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,080
it's easily affected by

334
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,510
various external factors,

335
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,750
leading to the death of the tea seedlings.

336
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,510
In my eyes,

337
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,600
I think

338
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,670
that they all have personalities

339
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:47,630
and destinies from young,

340
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,360
so I believe

341
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,840
they should also have

342
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,030
their own destined owners.

343
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,480
I hope everyone
can claim them rationally

344
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,390
based on your needs

345
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,550
and witness

346
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,670
their growth.

347
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,510
Hence, harvest your first

348
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,630
Orange Jasmine in your life.

349
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,790
Your coffee.

350
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,550
How much salt did you put this time?

351
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,630
Guess.

352
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:26,870
Hey.

353
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,200
I think

354
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,910
you shouldn't treat Lin Wei like this.

355
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,480
I know

356
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,390
I shouldn't meddle in
your personal affairs.

357
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,960
But I feel that there might be

358
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,600
some misunderstanding between you both.

359
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,390
You can meddle in my personal affairs.

360
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,150
Didn't you say

361
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,120
that we should keep
our private and public matters separated?

362
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,390
Actually,

363
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:52,080
it's okay
to mix them up a bit sometimes.

364
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,000
It's not a big deal.

365
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,550
But now, I feel

366
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,960
that separating
private and public matters

367
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,390
is not bad too.

368
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,240
Is that so?

369
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,150
Alright then.

370
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:01,440
Yes.

371
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,200
Let's keep it that way.

372
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:03,870
I'll follow your will.

373
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,960
You are doing this on purpose.

374
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,080
Oh, you do laugh.

375
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,960
What do you mean?

376
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,320
I'm not poker-faced, you know.

377
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,270
Alright.

378
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,790
I know you've been working hard lately.

379
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,030
So, take a break.

380
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,480
Spend a couple of days
having fun with your best friend.

381
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,910
She's been really busy lately.

382
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,440
She doesn't even have time for me.

383
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:33,240
Hey.

384
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,550
Is she developing

385
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,030
that land behind the mountains?

386
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,720
How do you know that?

387
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,200
She told me it's a secret.

388
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,360
Secret?

389
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,720
She's live-streaming it.

390
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,240
The pre-sale of the Orange Jasmine

391
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,550
is going really well.

392
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,390
Oh.

393
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,320
This tastes good.

394
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:58,790
I'll add more salt next time.

395
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:07,670
Bro.

396
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,510
This isn't even

397
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,000
fishing.

398
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,790
You're just

399
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,910
mocking the fish's intelligence.

400
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,840
These are all villagers' fish.

401
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:17,510
I don't want to fish them.

402
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,120
That's why I said

403
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,670
you're really boring.

404
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,320
If I caught some,

405
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,240
I'd pay the villagers
double the price to make them happy.

406
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,080
And when they're happy,

407
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,910
I'd be happy too.

408
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,270
What are you trying to tell me?

409
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:36,440
Fine.

410
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,360
I won't beat around the bush with you.

411
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,320
It's about the live broadcast.

412
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,120
Mr. Recluse selling tea

413
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,600
is a fantastic idea.

414
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,360
After all,

415
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,080
looks are everything.

416
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,960
I think you're not bad too.

417
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,320
But I don't live on the mountain.

418
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,390
Besides, Master

419
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,440
definitely doesn't want
to make things difficult for you.

420
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,120
The problem is,

421
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,630
this is not just about her.

422
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,670
This is about
the entire future development

423
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:12,390
of Village Xiaojin.

424
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,870
At this point,

425
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,750
if you still want to remain indifferent

426
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,120
and only grow tea,

427
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,360
it's not a problem.

428
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,840
But don't you think

429
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,840
you might be
drawing the line a bit too clearly?

430
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,150
I don't want to be indifferent either.

431
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,480
That's right.

432
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,000
This method

433
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,270
can help Orange Jasmine

434
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,670
become more visible to the public

435
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,630
and even create more opportunities

436
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,440
for the future development
of Village Xiaojin.

437
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,240
Right?

438
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,390
Mr. Jin.

439
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,360
Congratulations.

440
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:53,720
You've achieved your goal.

441
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,670
Lin Xiaojian has been

442
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,120
completely destroyed by you this time.

443
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,750
I have to pay homage to you,

444
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:01,870
the biggest shareholder

445
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,120
of Haowei Coffee.

446
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,910
I have to thank you

447
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,870
for using the foundation

448
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,440
to force Lin Xiaojian
to help his own son.

449
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,480
We have to target his vulnerable point
to get what we want.

450
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,240
But don't you think Lin Wei

451
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:24,960
isn't easy to deal with?

452
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,840
Sometimes,

453
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:33,240
I do see my sister's shadow in him.

454
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:33,840
Oh.

455
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,600
Tell me more.

456
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,440
He won't stop until he hits a wall.

457
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,440
He's now targeting the back mountain.

458
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,270
I don't know

459
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,240
from where did he get his confidence.

460
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,150
This kid is quite troublesome.

461
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:55,320
It's okay.

462
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,360
I have a plan.

463
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,510
Don't pursue a defeated enemy.

464
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,150
Let him do whatever he wants.

465
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:03,870
Ah.

466
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,790
You're feeling sorry for your nephew.

467
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,750
It's always a new beginning

468
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:11,480
after a challenging period.

469
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,200
Those who should be eliminated

470
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:16,310
should be thoroughly eliminated.

471
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,110
Let's drink.

472
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:37,750
Hello everyone.

473
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,160
This is Village Xiaojin's live.

474
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,510
The air is so good here
in the mountains.

475
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,590
Indeed, it is.

476
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,240
The cost and desires here are low,

477
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,400
and there
isn't any competition here too.

478
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,440
In the past, everyone

479
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,070
was eager to go to big cities.

480
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,350
But who knows

481
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,310
if it will be the same in the future.

482
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:53,070
Maybe people
will return here to grow tea.

483
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:54,920
Right?

484
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,960
So, what are you doing now?

485
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,680
Five-Year Strategy Plan?

486
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,510
Shu Yue?

487
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,920
Why five years?

488
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,480
Given the failure
of my ten-year plan for Lin Wei,

489
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,160
I've

490
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,590
learned my lesson from it.

491
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,160
Reliable plans are usually
planned for five years ahead only.

492
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,640
There are 364 more.

493
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,000
Everyone needs to be quick.

494
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:16,590
300.

495
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,510
300.

496
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:18,270
Only 300 left.

497
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,200
280.

498
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,400
Everyone, be quick.

499
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,440
Everyone knows

500
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,310
that during June and July...

501
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:22,920
Has Lin Wei

502
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,200
officially signed agreements
with Time Flies

503
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:24,960
to be a streamer?

504
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,110
Don't you think

505
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,030
Mr. Recluse selling tea

506
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:27,960
is more interesting than me selling tea?

507
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:28,590
But I feel like

508
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,000
Shu Yue is not bad either.

509
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,960
His sales
aren't as good as Lin Wei's, though.

510
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:32,960
You never know.

511
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:33,880
Different strokes

512
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,550
for different folks.

513
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,720
You two.

514
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:39,640
This is what they call
"beauty is in the eye of the beholder".

515
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,720
First of all,

516
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,110
[I love these two handsome.]
the most important step

517
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:44,920
[When will the next sales start?]

[Isn't this the investment star...]
is to wash the tea leaves.

519
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,070
Isn't this the investment star
of the past year?

520
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,070
First, use water
at 95 degrees Celsius...

He caused his own mother's death

522
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,070
and now he's even gone up the mountain
to establish his character persona.

523
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,030
Ah.

524
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,440
Perhaps a lot of coffee lovers...

It's a new account.

527

Does it cost nothing
to spread rumors now?

528

Mom.

Have you not forgiven me yet?

534
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:38,790
We have to fix

00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,240
our broadcast time.

536
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,200
Shu Yue and I
plan to divide you into groups.

537
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,310
One group will be taking videos,

538
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,750
and the other will be
in charge of live streaming.

539
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,240
We need to prepare a week before.

540
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,000
Lin Wei is here.

541
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:47,830
Oh, right.

542
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,750
Why weren't you called
for the meeting today?

543
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,400
Shu Yue, continue.

544
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,480
Oh dear.

545
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:58,350
No, it's not that.

546
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,790
I thought about it for a moment.

547
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:01,790
I think we should
divide the tasks properly.

548
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:02,350
You will

549

of the planting and expansion.

to me and the others.

Why?

553
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,960
Because I'm going
for a specialty account,

554
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,310
not just a looks-based account.

555
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:12,720
Oh.

556
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,510
I thought that this way,

557
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,920
it might increase
the number of pre-sales.

558
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,030
It's okay.

559
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:17,830
We've just started after all.

560
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,510
Many things require adjustment.

561
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:20,110
But still...

562
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,110
It's alright.

563

Everyone

00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,440
has their own expertise.

565
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,310

Go on.

Hey.

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,030
Where did this come from?

570
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,590
I snatched it from Bao.

571
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,110
How old are you?

572
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,550
Why do you still snatch food from kids?

573
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,510
No matter how old I am,
I'll always be younger than you.

574
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,350
Master.

575
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,790
Cheer up a bit.

Why aren't you allowing Lin Wei
to appear before camera?

I don't want
the netizens to criticize him.

578
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:05,880
Why would they do that?

579
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:07,720
I don't know.

580
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,000
But I have a bad feeling about it.

581
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,400
I just don't want there

582
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,720
to be any negative comments

583
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,030
that could hurt him.

584
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,790
Love is said to blind people,

585
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,160
but I think
it actually makes them more sensible.

586
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,200
It's a pity.

587
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,400
I don't have such things.

I don't think you don't have it.

589
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,590
You're just not looking carefully.

Hey.

591
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,510
What are you looking at?

592
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,400
Nothing.

593
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,550
What are you here for?

594
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:38,160
I'm also a Time Flies' employee now.

595
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,590
Can't I be here to clock in?

596
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:41,750
Sure.

597
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,400
Why does she seem so odd?

598
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,030
Don't be afraid.

599
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,310

00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,070
Look at your phone.

they'll be the ones targeted

No.

But that incident just now

636
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,200
seems really strange.

There weren't even a hundred comments,
yet it made into the top ten trending.

I think someone paid for it.

639
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,920
Right now, I'm only
worried about Lin Wei.

640
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:13,680
I know.

641
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,880
Don't worry too much, though.

642
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:15,920
Because not many people

are paying attention
to this topic for now.

644
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,270
It should be off the trending list soon.

645
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,880
I'll try to figure out a solution

646
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,070
and see if I can intercept the news.

647
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,030
The reason I called everyone here today

648
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,790
is to share a good news with everyone.

649

The group of experts
we previously invited

650
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,640
conducted a test

651
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,680
on the soil here.

652
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,720
The soil is very suitable

653
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,960
to grow new coffee variety.

654
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:40,510
So,

655
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:42,440
Chief.

656
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,680
We should sign the contract today.

657
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,270
Isn't the plan scheduled to be next year?

658
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:47,880
Ah, right.

659
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,240
The company was quite busy before,

660
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,350
and I forgot
to inform everyone about this.

661
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,640
The company internally decided

662
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,790
to bring forward the plan.

663
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,830
Coffee again?

664
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,030
We have already been through too much.

665
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,750
We don't dare to attempt it again.

666
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,440
Right.

667
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:01,790
Yes.

668
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:02,400
Exactly.

669
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,310
Chief.

670
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,160
Are you afraid to plant coffee,

671
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,880
or do you just want to plant tea?

672
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:15,310
How do you know?

673
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,400
I can know anything

674
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,480
that I wish to know.

675
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,110
Hey.

676
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:24,310
Is she developing

677
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,790
that land behind the mountains?

678
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,240
How do you know that?

679
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:30,640
She told me it's a secret.

680
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,000
But what I want to know now is,

681
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,030
whether you are helping me,

682
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,750
or are you helping Lin Wei?

683
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,480
It's not up to me alone

684
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,160
to decide what to plant.

685
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,270
We need a meeting to make a decision.

686
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:48,680
Exactly.

687
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,590
We'll decide in a meeting.

688
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,550
Right.

689
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,400
You guys are determined

690
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,590
to help Lin Wei, right?

691
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,030
Hey.

692
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,750
Don't you all know

693
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,240
that Lin Wei killed his own mother?

694
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:11,070
He returned and claimed to want
to plant Orange Jasmine this time,

695
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:12,110
but in reality,

696
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:14,070
he's planning to return
and establish a tea brand

697
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,350
to take back his authority.

698
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,920
He's not truly helping us.

699
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,030
It's true.

700
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:19,750
You have to believe me.

701
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,200
Actually,

702
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,680
you can plant

703
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,030
whatever you want.

704
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,240
I won't object.

705
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,790
But I hope you all think carefully.

706
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:32,440
If you're determined to help Lin Wei,

707
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,270
from now on,

708
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:37,270
I won't accept

709
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,440
any of the coffee bean you plant.

710
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:50,790
Just think about it.

711
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,310
We will have no income by then.

712
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,160
No, Mrs. Sha.

713
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,960
Think about it yourself.

714
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,920
What will we do without any income?

715
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:10,720
Where are you going?

716
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:12,590
Stop!

717
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,400
Where are you going?

718
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:22,590
What's the matter?

719
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:30,880
You tricked me.

720
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,000
You know that Lin Wei
wants to plant tea.

721
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:35,510
That's why you bring forward

722
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:37,240
the plan.

723
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,310
Don't you know me well?

724
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:39,830
Don't you know

725
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,750
that I won't let Lin Wei
succeed in anything?

726
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,510
Besides, planting
a new variety of coffee

727
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:45,960
is a very wise choice.

728
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,920
It's beneficial for the entire village.

729
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,110
Am I wrong?

730
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:53,000
Fine.

731
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:56,240
If you feel uncomfortable deep down

732
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,440
and think that I'm using you,

733
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,030
I apologize to you.

734
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,480
Okay?

735
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,590
Do it sincerely
if you're actually apologizing.

736
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,640
If you feel forced,

737
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,510
then don't bother doing so.

738
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,160
I am sincerely apologizing to you,

739
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,590
I'm truly apologizing to you.

740
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,310
Mr. Jin.

741
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,030
Am I just a pawn

742
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,640
in your eyes?

743
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:22,880
Same goes to Lin Wei

744
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,720
and Su Shiyu as well?

745
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,750
As long as it can help you
achieve your goals,

746
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,440
you won't care
about anyone's feelings, right?

747
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,000
Is that right?

748
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,160
Bai Ruan.

749
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,960
What do you mean by saying all these?

750
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,510
What's your point?

751
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,110
Are you trying to tell me

752
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,680
that even you want
to be on their side

753
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,070
to be against me and betray me?

754
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:38,750
Is that what you mean?

755
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,110
Betray?

756
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,070
Do you think the whole world

757
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,000
has betrayed you?

758
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,160
You think you are the only kind-hearted,

759
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:47,830
self-sacrificial person

760
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,110
who can save the world.

761
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:49,680
Is that so?

762
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,640
Put away your hypocrisy.

763
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,200
Don't act weak

764
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,270
in front of me

765
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,480
to make me pity you

766
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,270
or even

767
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,720
fall in love with you.

768
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,750
I've had enough.

769
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,640
[Jin Yue's grave]
It seems like Lin Wei was not here.

770
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,200
I hope he's not in trouble.

771
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,400
Mr. Lin, don't worry.

772
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,070
Lin Wei left early this morning.

773
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,480
He might already

774
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,240
be on his way back.

775
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,510
Why don't we go back and check?

776
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:32,440
Don't worry too much.

777
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,480
Okay.

778
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,550
You can rest assured.

779
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,510
I'll definitely help you

780
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:38,440
find your son.

781
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:39,830
We're leaving.

782
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:41,070
Let's go.

783
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,400
Is it here?

784
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:47,480
It looks like it.

785
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:49,720
Seems like no one's inside.

786
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:51,830
Let's wait here for him to come back.

787
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,000
It's here.

788
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:54,960
What's going on here?

789
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,310
I'll go in and check first.

790
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:56,880
Alright.

791
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,110
What are you guys doing?

792
00:29:59,200 --> 00:29:59,510
Oh.

793
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,350
Isn't this Hao Yu's blogger?

794
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,030
Hello.

795
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,880
Are you Hao Yu's blogger?

796
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,480
We're journalists.

797
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,750
We're here to interview Lin Wei.

798
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:06,480
This is my home,

799
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,350
not Lin Wei's.

800
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,920
We found him in your video.

801
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:12,830
Please leave this place,

802
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,350
or I'll report you for trespassing.

803
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,110
Hey, isn't that Mr. Lin?

804
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:16,920
Mr. Lin!

805
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,440
Mr. Lin!

806
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,750
Mr. Lin, don't leave!
