00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:54,320
Mrs. Sha.

173
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,360
We really did break up.

174
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,720
That's how it is with my Jin Na.

175
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,510
She'll come back when they fight,

176
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,910
but the next day they're back together.

177
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,910
You young people

178
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,120
don't have any integrity in this thing.

179
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,320
I've long been worn out by it.

180
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,550
Mrs. Sha.

181
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,600
He really broke up with me.

182
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:11,910
That's impossible.

183
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,790
Unless something major happened to him.

184
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:16,790
Oh.

185
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,240
Why didn't I think of that?

186
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,120
Given his personality,

187
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,600
he must have encountered something

188
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,960
that he can't solve.

189
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,000
So he had no choice but to break up.

190
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,480
I have to go now.

191
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,440
Thank you, Mrs. Sha.

192
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,960
What did I say?

193
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,550
Thank me?

194
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,790
They're growing well.

195
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,240
When the new roots grow in,

196
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,270
I'll have the professor recommend
some new leaf fertilizer.

197
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,120
Thank you.

198
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,360
Thank you for your hard work.

199
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,910
The weather will get hot soon.

200
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,270
Remember to water them.

201
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,600
Okay.

202
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,150
Why are you suddenly restricted
from spending?

203
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,670
With my current spending habit,

204
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,320
it doesn't matter
whether it's restricted or not.

205
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,480
So you knew in advance

206
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,630
that your spending would be restricted.

207
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,480
You're afraid of affecting Su Shiyu,

208
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,030
so you broke up with her?

209
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,000
You really went too far.

210
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,840
She's starting her business
and needs funding.

211
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,200
Am I supposed to ask her
to join me in repaying the debt?

212
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,510
And also,

213
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,750
were you just scolding me?

214
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,840
When did you
become good friends with her?

215
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,080
I understand where you're coming from,

216
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,440
but what you did was still too much.

There's no need to investigate.

221
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,870
I'll tell you.

222
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,480
So this is

223
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,910
the reason he broke up with me?

224
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,790
I feel you have the right to know.

225
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,910
Relationships shouldn't be like

226
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,440
"I chose not to be with you
for your own good".

227
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,630
But you should think carefully.

228
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,790
His debt is significant.

229
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,120
If you're not prepared to endure

230
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,600
the challenges alongside him,

231
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,270
and if you choose
to give up on this relationship,

232
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,550
no one will blame you.

Thank you.

Thank me for what?

236
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,720
Thank you for treating me

237
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,750
like a mature and independent person,

238
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,320
and for telling me the truth.

239
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,720
I'll think it through.

Board member of Haowei Coffee]

If you're planning to break up with me,

242
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,120
don't you think you should at least

243
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,790
get my consent?

244
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,600
You're so disrespectful
to your girlfriend.

245
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,150
Yu...

246
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,910
You don't have to say anything.

247
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,750
I know what you're going to say.

248
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,550
I don't agree.

249
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,030
Do you think of me
as someone who has a bad character?

250
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,550
You've had your spending restricted,

251
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,790
so I'll break up with you?

252
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,360
You found out?

253
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,630
But that's not what I meant.

254
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,670
Then what do you mean?

255
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:30,670
You want to be a saint all by yourself,

256
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,790
not wanting to involve me, right?

257
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,600
If these things are only directed at me,

258
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,240
then I have no reason to be afraid.

259
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,390
But if you get dragged into this,

260
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,120
I might not be able to protect you.

261
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,360
Are you afraid that I'll be targeted?

262
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,200
But I...

263
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,720
Look at my situation now.

264
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,870
Aren't I the same as you?

265
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,480
I have nothing at all.

266
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,120
Those who have nothing to lose
do not fear those in power.

267

Since we've decided to be together,

268
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,200
we should trust each other.

269

From now on,

272

I'll be responsible for making money
and supporting the family,

273
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,870
and you'll be responsible
for growing tea at home.

274
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,440
I don't think
what you earn will be enough.

00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,840
They went to the village entrance.

290

Don't call me "Master".

I'm sorry.

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,120
It was wrong of me
to leave without telling you.

310
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,080
Can you give me another chance

311
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,030
to go back to Time Flies?

312
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:50,840
Well.

313
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,270
I was too idealistic before.

314
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,030
I'm fine on my own now.

315
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,840
I'm unburdened and I feel relaxed now.

316

Master.

317
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,270
Do you have
to make such a grand entrance?

318
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:10,200
That was unexpected, right?

319
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,150
What do you infer from it?

320
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:17,870
Over the top.

321
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,000
Is it still over the top now?

322
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,080
You're not only over the top
but also try to bribe me now.

323

Hey.

324
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,030
Can't you comfort me a bit?

325
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,630
At the very least, we're allies.

326

Come here.

327

Push me.

Let me analyze it for you.

Hurry up.

330
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:43,630
When you

331
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,750
abandoned me in the battlefield,

332
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,360
our alliance had already disbanded.

333
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,960
And now I've already figured things out.

334
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,480
I don't want
to taste the bitterness of love for now.

335
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,320
But as friends,

336
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,790
I must advise you.

337
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,790
You should look further ahead.

338
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,440
Look to a more distant place.

339
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,960
A more distant place?

340
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,030
Yes.

341

A more distant...

Are you alright?

346

What are you doing?

347
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,910
I'm sorry.

348
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:16,600
I didn't mean it.

350
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,080
No need.

Oh.

352
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:19,630
Sorry.

353

Isn't her reaction
a bit too exaggerated?

For that project you introduced me,

358

I really don't have any loyal followers.

I've talked to you
about this several times.

Just based on your personality,

I've decided
to give you another big project today.

How should I
describe this all-in-one service?

373
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,380

No.

You're talking
about the middle part of the business.

382
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,820
I'm talking about the last part.

383
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:48,940

Can't you give me some projects
from the mortal world?

Hey.

387
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,580
Projects in the mortal world

388
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,500
lack the sincerity
that projects in the underworld have.

389
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,060
If you're truly sincere,

390

Why the hurry?

If we can't collaborate on this area,

393
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,540
we can collaborate in other areas.

394

Consider merging my business

with your internet celebrity company.

If that's not possible,
I'll invest in you.

Let me tell you.

405

Why are you putting so much effort
into helping her?

432
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,300
She's someone I like.

433

But on another note,

436
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,020

437
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,300

some time to digest this.

00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,620
Didn't she surrender the tenancy
for the office in the city?

Can you help me
send these to her to take a look?

474
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,500
He's afraid you'll get angry,

475
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,740
so he didn't dare to message you.

476

Say thank you to him,

480

Also,

when you receive such messages,

483
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,460
you can just block him.

484
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,300
Or you can simply ignore him.

485
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,060
He's your apprentice after all.

486

He returned back then

487
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,700
because of his mother's insistence.

488
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,340
Can't you put yourself in his shoes

489

and consider the situation?

490
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,140
Why are you so concerned
about his matters?

491
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,100
You're acting very unusually.

492

I'm not.

493

Su.

512
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,460
Look what these are.

513
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,540
A couplet?

514
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,220
Who sent them?

515
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,300
A master from the mountains.

516
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,740
These are beautifully written.

517
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,300
What do they say?

518
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,300
Make money today.

519
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:29,900
Make money tomorrow.

520
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,340
Make big money every day.

521
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:32,700
Views soar high.

522
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,460
Artists soar high.

523
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,380
The company shall surely touch the sky.

524
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:35,780
The horizontal scroll says

525
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,660
Time Flies shall prosper.

526
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,860
Aren't these my WeChat posts?

527
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,340
You're quite thoughtful,
my dear assistant.

528
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,780
You wrote them really well.

529
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,260
I practiced a bit when I was in school.

530
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:46,980
Su.

531
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,300
Eh?

532
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,300
Why are you here?

533
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,100
Time Flies is reopening.

534
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,100
Of course I have to be here.

535
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,940
Isn't this Mr. Lin Wei,
the son of the president of my company?

536
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,900
Just call me Lin.
I am just an assistant.

537
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:00,380
Assistant Lin.

538
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,460
Come help me for a moment.

539
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:02,940
You guys chat.

540
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,180
Assistant Lin?

541
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,260
What's this about?

542
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,940
He'll be here to help when he's free.

543
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,860
Be my assistant for a while.

544
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:12,740
Here.

545
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,260
Take a look.

546
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,780
Jade Ruyi?

547
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,140
Wow, Chen Xiangxiang

548
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,660
really lives up to her words.

549
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:21,740
She said

550
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,740
since you moved the company
to the countryside,

551
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,580
it seems you need this Jade Ruyi more
to ward off evil.

552
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,700
I don't care what she says.

553
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,180
Anyhow,

554
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,420
I'll accept this Jade Ruyi.

555
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:30,940
And what's that?

556
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:31,820
Garlic?

557
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:32,300
Gar...

558
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,100
What garlic?

559
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,380
This

560
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,540
is striped barbados lily.

561
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,420
It blooms without watering.

562
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,900
It symbolizes that even if
one is not favored by anyone,

563
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,140
they will still become popular.

564
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:43,900
Thank you for your auspicious words.

565
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:44,340
Hurry.

566
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,340
Let's go upstairs for a visit.

567
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:45,980
Okay.

568
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:52,940
Remember,

569
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,180
never water it.

570
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,660
If you water it, it'll lose its power.

571
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,260
Are you starting to believe

572
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,260
in the power of metaphysics?

573
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,460
Honestly speaking,

574
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,820
why have you been acting strangely?

575
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,860
You don't reply to my messages.

576
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,380
Are you dating someone?

577
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:08,340
I...

578
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,500
How is that possible?

579
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,660
You're overthinking it.

580
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:11,820
Then why is your WeChat

581
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,540
full of melancholic posts every day?

582
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,140
It's...

583
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,060
It's because I'm watching a drama.

584
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,900
The female lead in that drama
has a troubled fate.

585
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:20,860
Tell me more.

586
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,900
There's a major antagonist in it.

587
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,380
This antagonist

588
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,940
has two different personas.

589
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,740
When at work,

590
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,140
he's fierce and ruthless,

591
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,620
showing no mercy to the female lead.

592
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,340
But after work,

593
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,580
he becomes gentle

594
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,980
and cares for the female lead.

595
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,580
It's truly confusing.

596
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,220
The female lead's mood

597
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,420
is like riding a roller coaster every day.

598
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,860
I have a question.

599
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,900
Does the female lead like him?

600
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,380
How is that possible?

601
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,340
What's the title of this drama?

602
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,140
I'll check it out.

603
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,220
It's called...

604
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,460
The chief is here.

605
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:56,620
I'll go talk to him first.

606
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:57,660
Go ahead.

607
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,460
After the opening ceremony is over,

608
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,260
I'll be heading back.

609
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:02,900
You're quick to tidy up.

610
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,180
Yeah.

611
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:03,980
Chief.

612
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,220
I've moved my company to the village.

613
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,100
Shouldn't I pay rent?

614
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,500
Just pay

615
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:10,980
200 per month.

616
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,460
Let's not talk about this.

617
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,340
We'll go downstairs later

618
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,580
to see the gift
our villagers pooled together for you.

619
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,540
Wishing you
prosperous and thriving business.

620
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:19,460
Come.

621
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:19,820
Let's go.

622
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:20,580
Let's go downstairs and have a look.

623
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,060
Let's go.

624
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,180
Let's all go downstairs and have a look.

625
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,060
Let's go.

626
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:32,260
Time Flies will prosper.

627
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:35,220
Time Flies will thrive.

628
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,980
Time Flies will prosper.

629
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:38,940
Time Flies...

630
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,780
Alright.

631
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,060
Everyone, please quiet down.

632
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,020
Today

633
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,620
is the opening ceremony
of Time Flies Culture Spreading Co., Ltd

634
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,540
in our Village Xiaojin.

635
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,940
A special thanks to everyone

636
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,140
who came to support.

637
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,220
Now,

638
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,700
we have a very important
ribbon-cutting ceremony.

639
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:53,860
Next,

640
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:54,500
let's welcome

641
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,660
Miss Su to the stage

642
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,140
with warm applause
for the ribbon-cutting ceremony.

643
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,140
Chief.

644
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,820
Isn't this a bit too grand?

645
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,060
It's nothing.

646
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:03,660
Not grand at all.

647
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,380
Alright.

648
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,100
The ribbon-cutting ceremony is over.

649
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,300
Let's all take a photo together, okay?

650
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,420
Sure.

651
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:35,940
Come, move forward.

652
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,060
Come on.

653
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:37,980
Alright.

654
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,980
Capture this background
and take a good photo for us.

655
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:44,500
Why do I feel like this is a wedding?

656
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,500
It's even the 80s' style.

657
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,300
Very retro.

658
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,580
Happy wedding, then.

659
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,140
Alright.

660
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:50,660
Come on.

661
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:55,420
Three, two, one, cheese!

662
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,020
Shu.

663
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:11,780
Haven't we arrived yet?

664
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,300
We're almost there.

665
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:13,700
Uncle.

666
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,660
Now I understand
why it's called Time Flies.

667
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,660
An hour flew by

668
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,980
just to get there.

669
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,620
[Welcome Mr. Zhang
from Beiqiang Investment]

670
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:30,660
My right eyelid keeps twitching.

671
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,100
Why am I feeling so uneasy?

672
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,580
Maybe I should go back
and tell them to disperse.

673
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:34,300
Don't worry.

674
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,380
I'm here.

675
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,180
The car's here.

676
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:46,340
Mr. Zhang.

677
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:46,780
Hello.

678
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,420
I'm Su Shiyu from Time Flies.

679
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,500
We've been talking on the phone.

680
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,540
I didn't expect you
to be so good-looking.

681
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,300
Why do I feel like
I've seen you somewhere?

682
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,380
Have we met before?

683
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,100
I'm sorry.

684
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,980
I've been working too hard
in the funeral industry.

685
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,180
Now I'm starting to have trouble
recognizing living people.

686
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,140
You are...

687
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:06,540
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

688
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,180
I'm Miss Su's assistant.

689
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:08,980
Oh.

690
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,140
Assistant.

691
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,820
Hold on. Shu.

692
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:13,620
Come here.

693
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,180
Let me introduce you properly.

694
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,180
This is my eldest nephew.

695
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,540
He has been
recommending your company to me.

696
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,900
He says you're really outstanding.

697
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:20,900
So, I came today

698
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,180
mainly get a better understanding

699
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,580
how your company is doing.

700
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,820
Shall we go to the office first?

701
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:25,620
Sure.

702
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,020
Let's go.

703
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,140
Oh my.

704
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,580
Not bad at all.

705
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:30,700
A banner for me.

706
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,860
Time Flies shall prosper.

707
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,540
These words are written so dynamically.

708
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,300
Who wrote them?

709
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,900
It was Lin.

710
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,020
Oh.

711
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:45,900
It's true

712
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,420
that great talents
always hide in plain sight.

713
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,980
Your company has a hidden talent.

714
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,060
Mr. Zhang.

715
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,300
How about we go upstairs
and take a look?

716
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:53,980
Sure.

717
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:54,940
Is it on the second floor?

718
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:55,540
Yeah.

719
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,300
Oh dear.

720
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,380
These are woods.

721
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,260
You all really put in effort.

722
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,340
This is Mr. Zhang.

723
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:09,300
Oh my.

724
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,060
So you're Mr. Zhang.

725
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,860
You're truly handsome and charismatic.

726
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,420
Your visit to Time Flies

727
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,460
has truly added glitter to the place.

728
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,580
Welcome.

729
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,980
Are you in the middle of a meeting?

730
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:25,460
Yes.

731
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,740
At Time Flies,

732
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,580
we have a very mature team.

733
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,620
Oh.

734
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:30,540
I see.

735
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,260
Indeed, very mature.

736
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,820
We have meetings
at least three times a week.

737
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,980
But we're almost done for today.

738
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,460
Right?

739
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,860
No problem.

740
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,260
You can continue your meeting.

741
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,500
I'm here for an inspection anyway.

742
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,420
You go on.

743
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,660
Let's continue, then?

744
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,820
They said my visit
added glitter to the place.

745
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,060
Look.

746
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,780
Even without me,
glittery dirt is everywhere.

747
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:02,980
Have some water.

748
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:03,380
Uncle.

749
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,780
Regarding video creative ideas,

750
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,220
we still need some brainstorming

751
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,580
to gather ideas.

752
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,420
What does brainstorming mean?

753
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,300
[Video Idea Meeting]
It means we'll all think together

754
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,180
[Video Idea Meeting]
about what to shoot.

755
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:18,740
I propose

756
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,380
[Video Idea Meeting]
we shoot the Torch Festival.

757
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,900
The scene is spectacular.

758
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,820
The Torch Festival is in three months.

759
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:24,740
How are we going to shoot it?

760
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:25,820
Shoot the Peacock Feast.

761
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,140
When Jin Na got married,

762
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,140
the Peacock Feast was a big hit.

763
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,940
But we'll need two people
to get married.

764
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,980
How about
shooting the Chinese-style buffet?

765
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,220
So, you're saying

766
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,060
someone has to die first.

767
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,060
What's going on?

768
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,180
Isn't this an internet celebrity company?

769
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,980
How did they end up
discussing my business?

770
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,020
They knew you were coming,

771
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,060
so they brought this up.

772
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:51,620
Let's continue watching.

773
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,100
Let's continue.

774
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,060
Um...

775
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:58,700
We should

776
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,980
let Miss Su decide.

777
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,460
What do you think, Miss Su?

778
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,420
I think...

779
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:03,940
Mom.

780
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:04,540
I need to use the bathroom.

781
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:05,300
Okay.

782
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,620
I'll take you, baby.

783
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:08,340
Su.

784
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,020
I'm taking a day off.

785
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:09,340
Let's go.

786
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:09,900
Hurry.

787
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,060
Is that...

788
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,740
This meeting is so amateurish.

789
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:25,700
Uncle.

790
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:26,660
Wait for me.

791
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:27,180
Actually,

792
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:29,180
what you just saw was just the surface.

793
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,060
You haven't seen

794
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,700
the expertise of my master

795
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,780
and her ability to assess the market.

796
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,580
Give her a bit more time.

797
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:38,860
My dear nephew.

798
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,460
Yes, Uncle.

799
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,980
It's not that I'm not giving her time.

800
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,180
I've really given her time.

801
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,740
I spent hours coming here,

802
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,340
but what happened?

803
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,860
I gave her time, right?

804
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,620
It's not about time anymore.

805
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,700
It's been half a day now.

806
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,380
Let me tell you.

807
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:52,620
I really have a big project

808
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,780
at the cemetery.

809
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,180
I have several people lying there
waiting for me.

810
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,900
Let's go back to the city.

811
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:00,180
Wait.

812
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:00,460
No.

813
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:00,860
Wait.

814
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,220
Uncle.

815
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,580
Let me explain to you again.

816
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,340
Su.

817
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,980
Did we mess up?

818
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,660
No.

819
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,620
It's my fault.

820
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,940
I insisted on this formalism.

821
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,300
It's fine. Thank you all.
You can go back and rest.

822
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,700
I need to go home
and cook for my husband.

823
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,460
I'll leave first.

824
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,420
I need to feed Liuliu too.

825
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,500
Go ahead.

826
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,220
Su.

827
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:30,900
If there's anything, you...

828
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:32,780
Forget it.

829
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,900
When I get back, I'll reflect on myself.

830
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,660
I said the wrong thing.

831
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:37,980
I'm sorry.

832
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,700
You should head back to the tea farm.

833
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,500
Are you really okay?

834
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,220
I'm really fine.

835
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:55,860
Go on.

836
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:23,860
Uncle.

837
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,100
Let me know
when you're available next time.

838
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,500
If you want to come over again,

839
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,380
I'll take you anytime.

840
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:30,420
Shu.

841
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,100
You want me to come back again?

842
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,980
Didn't I explain it to you clearly?

843
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,540
This company is unreliable.

844
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,460
Don't bring me here anymore.

845
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,180
I'm begging you.

846
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,660
You be my uncle, okay?

847
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,380
My god.

848
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,340
Every day,

849
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,060
you tell me to do these useless things.

850
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:45,980
Don't talk about it anymore.

851
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,260
I'll take another nap.

852
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:57,820
Hello?

853
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:58,540
Shu Yue.

854
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,300
I'm Lin Wei.

855
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:03,860
What's up?

856
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:22,520
♪In the garden of growth,
