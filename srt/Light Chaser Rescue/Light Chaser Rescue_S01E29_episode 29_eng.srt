1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,050

2
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,760
♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,140
♫  I put out mountain fires  ♫

4
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:22,060
♫  and catch the sunset  ♫

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,560
♫  I leave the rhythms of life in my wake  ♫

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:35,620
♫  Happiness whispers in my ears  ♫

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,380
♫  Chasing the passion for the future  ♫

8
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:43,540
♫  Like a dream maker  ♫

9
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:48,180
♫  Reading the universe and stars  ♫

10
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,540
♫  My existence in the river of time  ♫

11
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,680
♫  With the body temperature of a moment  ♫

12
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:02,200
♫  I'm trying to be the extension of light  ♫

13
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:08,900
♫  If the world grants me a frustrating opening  ♫

14
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:15,420
♫  I'll chase back time like a dark horse  ♫

15
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:22,260
♫  Even though I know the truth, I won't be afraid  ♫

16
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:28,320
♫  I won't miss the moon because of mediocrity  ♫

17
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,700
♫  I won't lose the light  ♫

18
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,940

19
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,400

20
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,479
Zhuangzhuang. Was school let out?

21
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:45,920
You haven't been home for three years.

22
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,380
Come home with me.

23
00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:52,380
Okay, I will. Come home.

24
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,820
Mom.

25
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,540
I'm Zhuangzhuang.

26
00:02:01,779 --> 00:02:03,419
I'm your son.

27
00:02:03,419 --> 00:02:06,680
Lanzhi, he is I'm Zhuangzhuang.

28
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,839
He's Zhuangzhuang.

29
00:02:07,839 --> 00:02:10,060
Zhuangzhuang.

30
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,460
No.

31
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,779
He's not.

32
00:02:12,779 --> 00:02:15,439
Lanzhi, have you forgotten?

33
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:17,140
He is Zhuangzhuang.

34
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,159
On the hospital wall, you saw his photo, didn't you?

35
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:24,299
- His photo? 
 - Yeah, Mom.

36
00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:25,839
Look.

37
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,340
I am Zhuangzhuang.

38
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,100
It's me.

39
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,640

40
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,980
I'm your son, Mom.

41
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:45,660
You can't even recognize me.

42
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,239
I'm so useless.

43
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,780
I always forget that you have grown up.

44
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,200
I'm sorry, Mom.

45
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,660
- Zhuang'er. 
 - You become like this.

46
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,519
Mom, you're in the hospital now.

47
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,119
Rest assured.

48
00:03:03,119 --> 00:03:05,200
Doctors will cure you.

49
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,739
You'll be fine, Mom.

50
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:10,820
I believe you, Zhuang'er.

51
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,139
Luo Ben.

52
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,940
For this, thank you.

53
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,260
Take good care of your mother.

54
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,419
I've decided to quit my job at the hospital to take care of my mother.

55
00:03:41,399 --> 00:03:43,660
This opportunity to go to Fengxi,

56
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,339
both Zhanyan and I cherish it very much.

57
00:03:46,339 --> 00:03:48,379
She can be chosen.

58
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:49,920
I congratulate her.

59
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,019
She's going to Fengxi?

60
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,979
Have some vegetables.

61
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:11,040
Dr. Cai said that he would resign and go back to take care of his parents.

62
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:18,580
Actually, he has been working hard for so long, it's a pity to give up like this.

63
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,380
If you were him, how would you choose?

64
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:32,299
In fact, you have already made a choice.

65
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,819
You know it.

66
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:43,960
If Cai Yuxiao didn't tell me, were you going to tell me after arriving in Fengqi?

67
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,719
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

68
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:51,019
It's just that it wasn't sure at that time.

69
00:04:51,019 --> 00:04:52,740
When it's not sure, it's called negotiation.

70
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,699
If it's determined, that's called notification.

71
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,100
This opportunity is really precious to me.

72
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:04,799
So you thought that, if you tell me about it, I would block your opportunity?

73
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,159
That's not what I meant. I...

74
00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:13,200
I just couldn't figure out how to tell you about it.

75
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,519
Zhan Yan.

76
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,579
I do want to live with you.

77
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:29,560
When I miss you, I can see you anytime.

78
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:34,380
But at the same time, I will also support your career pursuit.

79
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:40,500
Living in and traveling between two cities would not be a problem for me at all.

80
00:05:42,059 --> 00:05:44,220
This is my fault.

81
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:55,200
Why won't you talk to me before making your own decision?

82
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,000
Did you really think I wouldn't agree with you?

83
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:06,779
It turns out that considering my feelings will increase your burden.

84
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:13,700
It seems like I'm quite the failure as a boyfriend.

85
00:06:17,719 --> 00:06:19,880
Forget it, let's eat.

86
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,220
I'll take you home after dinner.

87
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,320
I told you. You should have discussed it with him earlier.

88
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,379
Look at you now. How passive you are!

89
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,719
No wonder he's angry with you.

90
00:06:38,719 --> 00:06:41,479
Do you know the most unacceptable thing for men?

91
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:45,759
The most unacceptable thing is that women disregard them.

92
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:48,640
This is my fault.

93
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,119
But he didn't need to be so angry.

94
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,159
You are single-minded.

95
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:55,560
How could you have considered others' feelings?

96
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,960
- Do I have to? 
 - Be more confident.

97
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,259
Remove the question mark.

98
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:02,159
Your EQ is really worrisome.

99
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,780
What's your suggestion?

100
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,740
Do I really need to give up?

101
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,340
That's what I mean.

102
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:12,059
Is it necessary? He's angry just because I didn't tell him.

103
00:07:12,059 --> 00:07:13,900
He also said he would support me.

104
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,819
You believe that?

105
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:18,880
The essence of a man is duplicity.

106
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,340
Just rush over and coax him.

107
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,860

108
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,880
Yuxiao is gone.

109
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,599
And you.

110
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,279
You are going to Fengxi with Professor Coben.

111
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:35,540
Losing two key members at the same time.

112
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,119
It makes me very passive.

113
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:41,939
From the perspective of work, I really want you to stay.

114
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:47,720
However, Professor Coben's project is more precious.

115
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,799
I hope you can cherish the opportunity and learn well.

116
00:07:51,799 --> 00:07:53,259
I will.

117
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:57,719
Has everything in the department been handed over?

118
00:07:57,719 --> 00:07:59,139
It has been handed over.

119
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:00,900
Personally,

120
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:06,200
do you have any other problems about going to Fengxi to work?

121
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,559
You can tell me.

122
00:08:07,559 --> 00:08:11,120
The hospital may help you.

123
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,179
No problem.

124
00:08:21,499 --> 00:08:22,619
Hello, your express.

125
00:08:22,619 --> 00:08:24,340
Okay, thank you.

126
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,650
Hello, your express.

127
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:43,410
Okay, thank you.

128
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,839
Is it over?

129
00:08:56,839 --> 00:08:58,480
Have you received them?

130
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,060
It's you who bought all these.

131
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:16,240
What are you doing?

132
00:09:16,939 --> 00:09:18,320
I'm about to leave.

133
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,260
So I prepared some seasonal clothes for you.

134
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,739
Are you going to leave for years?

135
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:28,700
I just passed and I don't know the situation there.

136
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,780
Okay, I see.

137
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,780
Thank you.

138
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,599
Anything else?

139
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:42,900
Can you stop being like that? I will come back when I'm free.

140
00:09:44,699 --> 00:09:47,639
How happy I am. My girlfriend is leaving.

141
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:49,859
And she has prepared clothes for me for the whole year.

142
00:09:49,859 --> 00:09:52,259
Can you speak normally?

143
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,040
You're leaving.

144
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,859
What else can I say?

145
00:10:15,859 --> 00:10:17,499
You're back.

146
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,439
 Brother, why did you buy so many clothes?

147
00:10:38,439 --> 00:10:41,820
I didn't buy them. Zhan Yan did.

148
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:50,959
Did you two have a fight?

149
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,820
 Zhan Yan, tomorrow I will take wedding photos.

150
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,019
 Can you come and help me?

151
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,000

152
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,800
Yuan, I might be a little late.

153
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,000
You can start first.

154
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,200
 Let's go and take pictures there.

155
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,200
 Look here.

156
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,400
 Very nice.

157
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,400
 Bride, relax.

158
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,200
Groom, come closer.

159
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,100
Come on, closer.

160
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,400
Bend down, right.

161
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,400
Together. Okay, one shot.

162
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,600
Lower, right. Good.

163
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,700
Bride, show your diamond ring. Diamond ring!

164
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,000
Beautiful.

165
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,600
Okay, right.

166
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,300
Yuan Yuan.

167
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,600
Why are you here?

168
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,800
Luo Yuan asked me to come.

169
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,200
Yuan said, you must come when we take wedding photographs.

170
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,500
Let's take a photo together later.

171
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,100
The bride and groom. Get ready to take the second picture.

172
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,200
Go ahead.

173
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,900
I didn't expect you to have so much time.

174
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,600
I thought you had a lot of things to pack.

175
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,500
I started packing things early.

176
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,000
After all, it will take three years. There are many kinds of things.

177
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,600
Is that so?

178
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,800
Well, I will give you a good farewell then.

179
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,400
Save it if you don't have time.

180
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,600
There are a lot of people in the hospital who want to see me off.

181
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,300
Then, why don't you tell Luo Yuan that you're going to Fengxi?

182
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,900
She thinks of you as a good friend.

183
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,500
You should ask her to see you off.

184
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,200
Luo Yuan is your sister.

185
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,700
Why don't you tell her? As long as I go to Fengxi,

186
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,100
you'll look like you want to break up with me.

187
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,400
Don't keep it from her.

188
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,900
Come on. Get closer. Right.

189
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,100
Head. Slightly move your head...

190
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,000
Right.

191
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,900
Good.

192
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,800
Come on. Let's make another pose.

193
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,100
Makeup. Makeup for the bride.

194
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,800
Wipe the sweat.

195
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,500
All right.

196
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,100
Luo Yuan smiles so happily.

197
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,100
Yeah.

198
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,200
She wants to bless us.

199
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,400
But she would never imagine...

200
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,100
that we're saying goodbye soon.

201
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,400
Not if you don't want to.

202
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,400
So that's my problem?

203
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,800
I didn't discuss it with you in advance. It's my fault.

204
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,100
But did you have no problem at all?

205
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:10,380
Obviously, your fault came first. And you blame me now?

206
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,000
Are we talking about the order on this?

207
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,400
Don't shirk your responsibilities.

208
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,000
Don't change the subject.

209
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,600
I'm talking about going to Fengxi.

210
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,100
- I'm talking about attitude. 
 - What's my attitude?

211
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,600
- Do you think it's good? 
 - Is my attitude bad?

212
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,700
Go and get some rest.

213
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,700
Yuan, you are so beautiful.

214
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,900
Guys, please help me by getting into position.

215
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,700
It can save a lot of time.

216
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,100
He asked you to get into position.

217
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,600
- You go. 
 - Go.

218
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,300
Get closer.

219
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,900
Right, closer.

220
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,300
Yeah, good.

221
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,000
Look at me. Look at the camera.

222
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,600
Keep smiling.

223
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,200
Good.

224
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,200
Nice. Come on.

225
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,700
Let's change our pose.

226
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,900
Well, you two, back to back.

227
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,200
Back to back.

228
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,000
Lean on each other.

229
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,200
Good. keep.

230
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,400
Smile.

231
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,800
Have you decided on the departure date?

232
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,100
After the wedding on the seventh.

233
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Great. Come on, let's do another pose.

234
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,400
Well, you two, face to face.

235
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,400
Sir, move closer. Move over, Sir.

236
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,200
Facing each other. Put your arm around her waist.

237
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,860
Put your arms around the girl's waist.

238
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,600
Get closer.

239
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,100
Right, closer.

240
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,000
All right, this move is great. Keep it up.

241
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,100
Pay attention to your eyes. Soften your eyes.

242
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,000
Smile softly.

243
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,400
Yes, sweet.

244
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,200
You two, go to the front.

245
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,800
Right.

246
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,400
Look at me.

247
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,400
Smile.

248
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,800
Wait a moment, please.

249
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,900
I want to invite them to take photos together, okay?

250
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:14,100
Sure. Come on. Let's take it together.

251
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,300
Closer.

252
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,700
Good.

253
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,000
Great.

254
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,100
Change the pose.

255
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,000
Come on.

256
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,600
Had a quarrel with Zhan Yan?

257
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,000
This time it's her fault.

258
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,700
Gentlemen should be generous.

259
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,400
It sounds as if you are very experienced.

260
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,800
Well, I...

261
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,500
My experience is all on Luo Yuan.

262
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,600
That's right.

263
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,600
I only asked for half a day off. I'll go back soon.

264
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,000
I'll take a taxi myself.

265
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,900
 His EQ is low. Don't care about him.

266
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,100
Mine is not high either.

267
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,200
I went to find Ding Dingding.

268
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,200
Mom?

269
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,200
You are so busy, and you worked so hard.

270
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,900
Why did you go to her?

271
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:12,100
If I didn't go, would you two secretly get married?

272
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,000
How could that be?

273
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,700
Then I would definitely come to ask for your permission.

274
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,500
Are you thinking about it?

275
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,900
I tell you. I disagree.

276
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,400
Why, Mom?

277
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,600
Do you have misunderstandings about Ding Dingding?

278
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,200
Misunderstanding? I said one word, and she replied two.

279
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,200
Such an indecent, uneducated girl.

280
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,200
Except for you, who can she fool?

281
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,400
Are you lured by her appearance?

282
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,110
She does look pretty good.

283
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,600
No.

284
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,700
She always talks upside down and full of nonsense.

285
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,400
But there's nothing evil in it, Mom.

286
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,400
Don't defend her.

287
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,200
Let me tell you, Ming.  This girl is not worthy of you.

288
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,500
How many times have I told you?

289
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,200
To find a partner, what matters is inner beauty.

290
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,800
A girl's inner excellence is inseparable from her growing environment and family background.

291
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,600
It can't be changed overnight.

292
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,200
Mom.

293
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,620
Her parents are university professors.

294
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,800
University professors?

295
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,200
And they educated a daughter like this?

296
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,500
Stop pinching.

297
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,300
 Dingding.

298
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,600
Why are you here?

299
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,100
Why don't you answer your phone?

300
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,100
I'm drawing. The phone is muted.

301
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,100
Are you all right?

302
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,400
How could I not be all right?

303
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,800
I just know that my mother came to you.

304
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,600
Why didn't you tell me?

305
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,200
Your mother's little trick didn't scare me at all.

306
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,400
I grew up in battles with my elders.

307
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,900
She doesn't like me now doesn't mean she won't like me in the future. Right?

308
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,100
I'm sorry. I'll apologize for my mother.

309
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,200
Don't apologize to me. I have just completed psychological construction.

310
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,200
I'm softened when you apologize.

311
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,200
I don't want to be a weak person.

312
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,400
That's my girl.

313
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,000
Right.

314
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,800
If your mother bullies me again, I'll bully you. You hear me?

315
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,700
Sure.

316
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,600
You promise? Keep your word?

317
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,400
- Keep my word. 
 - What if you regret your promise?

318
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,000
If I regret it, you just bully me.

319
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,600
- Are you going to be so serious? 
 - Yeah. Come on.

320
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,700
It hurts!

321
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,100
Not arrived yet.

322
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,600
Is it today? What time is it?

323
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,100
What's the hurry?

324
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,600
Maybe there's a traffic jam.

325
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,800
Did my sister forget the way?

326
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,000
Let me pick her up.

327
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,600
Yeah, let's go together.

328
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,300
Let's go.

329
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,200
Dad.

330
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,900
Mom.

331
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,500
You're back.

332
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,720
Your brother was worried that you couldn't find your way home.

333
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,200
How can I not find my home?

334
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,600
Everything's all right?

335
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,900
Good.

336
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,200
It's great that you came back.

337
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,500
Your mother and I still have two dishes to make. Don't stay out all the time.

338
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,400
Xiong Fei, take your sister inside.

339
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,600
Let's go.

340
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,500
Go inside.

341
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,220
Sister.

342
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,159
Welcome home.

343
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,600
Why are you still so thin?

344
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:01,940
Take this.

345
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,139
What are you doing, Sister?

346
00:23:05,139 --> 00:23:06,999
I don't want it.

347
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,359
I have been abroad for so many years.

348
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:13,059
I didn't take good care of you, Mom, and Dad.

349
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:14,559
Now you're getting married.

350
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,079
This is a little token of my regard as your sister.

351
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:20,540
Sister, I can support the family by selling Wonton.

352
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,720
I appreciate your kindness.

353
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,000
- Keep the money for yourself. 
 - Here comes the steamed fish.

354
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,220
Come on, Mom.

355
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,080
Be careful.

356
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,520
Careful.

357
00:23:32,539 --> 00:23:34,399
- Here. 
 - Thank you, Mom.

358
00:23:34,399 --> 00:23:35,720
Xiong Fei is getting married.

359
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,200
Xiong Dan comes back home.

360
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,900
For our family, it's good things in pairs.

361
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,060
Double the joy.

362
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,139
- Yes. 
 - Today,

363
00:23:42,139 --> 00:23:43,739
we must have a good drink.

364
00:23:43,739 --> 00:23:45,540
Come on, I'll pour it for you.

365
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,200
Here, it's okay.

366
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,219
Dad, you still keep this.

367
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:49,980
When did you buy it?

368
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,100
When you and your brother were born,

369
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,700
your father bought one bottle each. Is it?

370
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,100
He waited for you to get married and started drinking.

371
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:57,639
Have some.

372
00:23:57,639 --> 00:23:59,320
A little.

373
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,960
Come on.

374
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,999
I wish Xiong Fei a happy marriage.

375
00:24:02,999 --> 00:24:05,310
Wish Dan a bright future.

376
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,210
- Great. 
 - Thanks, Dad.

377
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:07,040
Thank you, Dad. Thank you, Mom.

378
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,560
I also wish you good health.

379
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,459
Cheers.

380
00:24:09,459 --> 00:24:10,879
Cheers!

381
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:15,560
 Great.

382
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,080
 Come on.

383
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,060
 You drink with your father.

384
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,780
 We can't.

385
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:20,739
 Your mother's drinking...

386
00:24:20,739 --> 00:24:21,539
 Pour some for your sister.

387
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:24,140
 A little.

388
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,940
 We're going to shoot six sets.

389
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,819
 These six styles.

390
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,300
 So, you need to keep smiling.

391
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:32,800
 Right.

392
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,720
 Listen to me and I'll teach you how to move.

393
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,000
 Just follow my instructions.

394
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,180
Mr. Photographer.

395
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:38,760
Hello.

396
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,160
May I ask you?

397
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,260
The photos we took that day.

398
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,499
Is there an archive?

399
00:24:42,499 --> 00:24:44,060
Those photos...

400
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,139
Sorry.

401
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,900
Your photos were mainly used as a reference for positioning.

402
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,940
So they were all deleted.

403
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,080
Sorry for bothering you.

404
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:53,979
Wait a minute.

405
00:24:53,979 --> 00:24:54,920
I remember now.

406
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,300
That man who came with you that day copied all of them.

407
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,559
You can go and find him.

408
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:01,559
Is it the groom?

409
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:02,180
No.

410
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,639
It's the bride's brother.

411
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:22,280
Is there any problem with the contract?

412
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,680
No problem.

413
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,380
I'll print it out.

414
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,920
Is there anything?

415
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,439
Can't I chat with you if I have nothing to do?

416
00:25:58,439 --> 00:25:59,419
Chat with others.

417
00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:01,120
I'm busy.

418
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,759
So unfriendly!

419
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:05,439
You didn't even say anything about when you're getting married.

420
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:07,299
Who's getting married?

421
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,620
How do you explain it?

422
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:16,120
There's nothing to explain.

423
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:21,059
Mr. Luo refused to defend himself.

424
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:23,940
It seems that this matter is settled.

425
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:28,560
Fortunately, I kept one move.

426
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:30,620
Don't joke around.

427
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,120
Give it to me.

428
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:34,580
Why are you so serious?

429
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,520
That's a good thing.

430
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,900
I also want to have fun.

431
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,300
I know you want to give me a red envelope.

432
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,019
Just wait.

433
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:47,480
Take the opportunity.

434
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,560
Then Ariel will give up on you.

435
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,739
What are you talking about?

436
00:26:50,739 --> 00:26:52,700
Get busy with your business.

437
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:15,539
What are you thinking?

438
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:20,019
I wonder what my mother will do to me next.

439
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:23,520
I've always been curious.

440
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,540
Your mother is like that.

441
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:28,620
What kind of life would your father have?

442
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:32,000
Maybe, for so many years, my father became used to it.

443
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:38,120
How did your father fall in love with your mother?

444
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,820
Actually, my mom pursued my dad.

445
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,639
At that time, her mother and the family were against it.

446
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,500
Because my dad was just a little reporter.

447
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,880
Little reporter.

448
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,000
Did your father capture some secret dealings

449
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,899
and help the police solve a case?

450
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,700
Then, your mother fell in love with your father instantly.

451
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,979
Then she married him.

452
00:27:57,979 --> 00:28:00,259
What strange things are you thinking?

453
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:05,100
That's because your mother gave me the impression of hating the poor and loving the rich.

454
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,100
After my parents got married, they started a business.

455
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,979
My dad was running around all day trying to write reports.

456
00:28:11,979 --> 00:28:13,780
He didn't come home for months.

457
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:16,720
My mother carried all the burdens of the company alone.

458
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,140
Later, the company got better.

459
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,559
It had the current scale then.

460
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:24,019
Actually, my mother paid a lot of effort.

461
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:26,000
Now I get it.

462
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,700
Is it that your mother, because of her life experience,

463
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,520
thinks her success can be replicated.

464
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,539
Take a look.

465
00:28:34,539 --> 00:28:38,959
She has an idle son like you at home.

466
00:28:38,959 --> 00:28:40,699
She needs to match him

467
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:45,300
with a wife as good as her to be worthy of you.

468
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,400
So you can achieve a career.

469
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,100
It seems that I don't deserve you.

470
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,500
You can relax.

471
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,839
I'm different from my father.

472
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:55,100
I'll shoulder the responsibility.

473
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,900
I will protect you.

474
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:02,800
I didn't hear you.  Speak louder.

475
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,079
I said... I will protect you.

476
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:06,999
Louder, I can't hear you.

477
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:08,920
Come on.

478
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,319
There are so many people. Stop it.

479
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:12,080
It's all right.

480
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,900
I said...

481
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,839
I will protect you.

482
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,239
Okay.

483
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:20,220
Concentrate on drawing.

484
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,399
What are you drawing?

485
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:24,639
My boyfriend.

486
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:25,559
Do I look like this?

487
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:26,040
Yeah.

488
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,300
Very handsome.

489
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,439
Redraw it.

490
00:29:28,439 --> 00:29:29,979
No, do you understand my art?

491
00:29:29,979 --> 00:29:30,720
This is called Abstractionism.

492
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,860
Redraw it. Come on.

493
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,060
I won't. Listen.

494
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,480
Go back and hang it up.

495
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,499
Get it framed.

496
00:29:35,499 --> 00:29:36,559
Photo frame, do you hear me?

497
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:37,900
 - Redraw it or not? 
 - No.

498
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,780
 - Redraw it or not? 
 - No.

499
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,440
 Come on.

500
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,460
 No, don't pinch me!

501
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,819
 Come on, redraw it. Hurry.

502
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:51,700
Look.

503
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,399
Is it right?

504
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,000
Just right.

505
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,019
Almost done.

506
00:29:58,019 --> 00:29:59,780
Thank you, Sister.

507
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,559
Why are you thanking me?

508
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,600
After getting married, be nice to your wife.

509
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,480
Don't you trust me?

510
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,180
Find a brother-in-law for me soon.

511
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:14,199
 I will follow my fate.

512
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,380
Yuan Yuan,

513
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:33,500
I won't see you again in the morning.

514
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,680
 Here he is.

515
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,480
 Look.

516
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,200
 Congratulations!

517
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,639
 So handsome.

518
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:17,060
Wish you a lasting marriage.

519
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,499
Go!

520
00:31:18,499 --> 00:31:20,800
- Happy wedding! 
 - Right.

521
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,919
Brother.

522
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:27,260
Come here, Guo.

523
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:27,899
Look.

524
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:28,979
Is Uncle handsome?

525
00:31:28,979 --> 00:31:29,660
Yes.

526
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,399
Handsome, right?

527
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:31,820
Uncle is the most handsome one, isn't he?

528
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:32,520
Yes.

529
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,639
Is your father handsome?

530
00:31:33,639 --> 00:31:34,680
He's the second handsome.

531
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,139
Dad is the second handsome?

532
00:31:36,139 --> 00:31:39,019
You little traitor!

533
00:31:39,019 --> 00:31:40,200
Guo is the most beautiful one, right?

534
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,440
No, the bride is the most beautiful.

535
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,000
I'm the second.

536
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,820
Brother Xiong, are you ready?

537
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,620
The bride is coming.

538
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,059
Okay.

539
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,500
- Go, man. 
  - Come on!

540
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,239
 Go!

541
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,039
Xiong Fei!

542
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:00,700
 Come on!

543
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:08,220
So beautiful.

544
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,739
All relatives and friends.

545
00:32:33,739 --> 00:32:35,120
All teammates.

546
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,820
It's a great honor today to get together here

547
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:41,700
to witness the new couple getting married

548
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,199
and entering the palace of marriage.

549
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,100
Now I declare, the wedding starts.

550
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,180
 Good!

551
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:54,000
Let's welcome our most handsome groom, Xiong Fei.

552
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,219
 Great!

553
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:04,120
Groom.

554
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:08,100
Now, please go to meet your most beautiful bride.

555
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:23,940
♫  I want to be a shining star  ♫

556
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:26,470
♫  I will give out my light  ♫

557
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:28,059
Xiong Fei...

558
00:33:29,779 --> 00:33:34,739
I'll entrust Luo Yuan to you.

559
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:40,590
♫  Dreams eventually become lighter  ♫

560
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,040
Xiong Fei,

561
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,840
take good care of her.

562
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:48,099
Brother,

563
00:33:48,099 --> 00:33:49,539
rest assured.

564
00:33:49,539 --> 00:33:52,000
I will take good care of her.

565
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,790
♫  Although everything can't go as planned  ♫

566
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,819
Go, Yuan Yuan.

567
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:08,140
♫  I am alone in this lively world  ♫

568
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:14,520
♫  Still, I light up the way for others  ♫

569
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:19,400
♫  I think I'm a star  ♫

570
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:25,740
♫  I only have eyes for you  ♫

571
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:30,780
♫  The world is getting brighter  ♫

572
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:37,040
♫  Within glistening teardrops there is my love for you  ♫

573
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,960
♫  Two free forms  ♫

574
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:48,319
♫  Embrace the world  ♫

575
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:50,540
Yuan Yuan looks good in her wedding dress.

576
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,440
What? Do you want to wear it?

577
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,939
Are you so anxious to marry me?

578
00:34:53,939 --> 00:34:56,060
Stop dreaming.

579
00:34:56,060 --> 00:35:00,199
Today is an exciting day.

580
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:04,859
Let's give the warmest applause to congratulate the new couple.

581
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:06,880
 Good.

582
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,280
Friends on the left gave the warmest applause.

583
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,260
I wish you a bright future.

584
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,560
 Great!

585
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,620
Friends on the right gave the most passionate applause.

586
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:18,499
I wish you a brighter future!

587
00:35:18,499 --> 00:35:20,420
 Good.

588
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,119
What time will you leave tomorrow?

589
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:24,980
I'll see you off.

590
00:35:26,799 --> 00:35:29,519
I'll say goodbye to you anyway.

591
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:31,479
12:00 at noon.

592
00:35:31,479 --> 00:35:33,099
Okay.

593
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:41,260

594
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,279
What's the matter, Brother?

595
00:35:51,279 --> 00:35:52,860
It's none of your business.

596
00:35:53,799 --> 00:35:56,099
Now please welcome our groom

597
00:35:56,099 --> 00:36:01,360
to tell us how he chased beautiful Miss Luo.

598
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:05,019
Captain, I know the sinkhole in Fengtou Village. No one has reached the bottom.

599
00:36:05,019 --> 00:36:09,560
Except for you, only Xiong Fei has such rescue experience.

600
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:15,099
But today is Xiong Fei's wedding day. I'll lead the team.

601
00:36:15,099 --> 00:36:17,020
After we arrive there,

602
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:21,440
- we'll make the exact rescue plan. 
 - Okay.

603
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,379
Groom.

604
00:36:23,379 --> 00:36:25,399
Do you still need to think about it?

605
00:36:25,399 --> 00:36:29,399
It seems that your experience was rough.

606
00:36:29,399 --> 00:36:33,300
Dingding. Mingming. You stay with the bride and groom.

607
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,040
Captain.

608
00:36:37,819 --> 00:36:39,119
I'm in.

609
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,759
What are you doing? Your mission today is to be a good groom.

610
00:36:42,759 --> 00:36:44,360
A 300-meter sinkhole rescue.

611
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,819
Only I have such experience. I have to go.

612
00:36:47,819 --> 00:36:49,860
Yuan Yuan supports me.

613
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,279
Captain.

614
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,819
Let him go.

615
00:36:59,499 --> 00:37:01,139
Okay.

616
00:37:19,099 --> 00:37:20,259
Peng.

617
00:37:20,259 --> 00:37:21,880
Dad, you can do it!

618
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,100
You're leaving tomorrow at noon.

619
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:27,279
I might not able to come back to see you off.

620
00:37:27,279 --> 00:37:29,059
Have a safe trip.

621
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,359
It's okay.

622
00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:34,000
Then I'm leaving.

623
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,579
Be careful.

624
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:37,019
Okay.

625
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,440
Yuan Yuan.

626
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,040
 Go.

627
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,880
 I'll be waiting for you.

628
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:50,100
Dear relatives and friends, I'm really sorry.

629
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,960
We were temporarily notified that we need to go out on a mission.

630
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,840
The wedding can't go on.

631
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,840
Please forgive me.

632
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:04,980
 Life matters.

633
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,099
 He should go.

634
00:38:07,099 --> 00:38:08,720
Wait for me.

635
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:43,070

636
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:52,480

637
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,800
 All right. Please stand back.

638
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,720
 Come on, stand back. Stand back.

639
00:39:16,139 --> 00:39:17,860
 It should be here.

640
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,500
 Get ready.

641
00:39:34,859 --> 00:39:36,880
This is Yuncheng Highway.

642
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,399
There is Miaoshanqian Village.

643
00:39:39,399 --> 00:39:42,040
This is the sinkhole of Fengtou Village.

644
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,880
The parents of the victim asked for help.

645
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,379
The name of the victim is Hong Wei. 27 years old.

646
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,960
Yesterday, he climbed the mountain with his friends.

647
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,699
It rained all night, the sky was dark, and the road was slippery.

648
00:39:51,699 --> 00:39:54,140
Hong Wei stumbled and fell into the sinkhole.

649
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,440
Do you have any information about the sinkhole?

650
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,940
This sinkhole is the largest and the most dangerous sinkhole in this area.

651
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,880
The depth exceeds 300 meters.

652
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,739
You're experts in Sinkhole Rescue. So this time you take the lead.

653
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:10,960
We'll fully support you.

654
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,210
Okay.

655
00:40:13,219 --> 00:40:17,450
Everyone knows.

656
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:19,920
This task is very difficult.

657
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,800
Director Liu is here. He's in command.

658
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,840
We will work in two groups.

659
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,199
Xiong Fei and I together.

660
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:29,119
The other team is Luo Ben and Peng.

661
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,599
 Yes.

662
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:32,359
The sinkhole is very deep.

663
00:40:32,359 --> 00:40:34,979
The conditions below are unknown. It's impossible to directly hit the bottom.

664
00:40:34,979 --> 00:40:36,779
We descend in sections.

665
00:40:36,779 --> 00:40:39,620
Make a protection station along the way. Set fixed points.

666
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:43,860
Xiong Fei, take special ropes and enough other equipment.

667
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:46,119
I'll go first. You cooperate with me.

668
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:48,719
Captain, I'm stronger. Let me go first.

669
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:52,219
Captain, I want to apply to go with Xiong Fei as Team One and enter the sinkhole at the same time.

670
00:40:52,219 --> 00:40:53,580
Captain, I...

671
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:56,119
Don't argue about it. Follow my order.

672
00:40:56,119 --> 00:40:58,719
All right. Everybody, get ready.

673
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:00,320
 Yes, Sir.

674
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,890
- Wei, my son! 
 - Please save my son.

675
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:17,020
- You have to save my son. 
 - We will do our best.

676
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,279
He must still be alive.

677
00:41:18,279 --> 00:41:21,160
All right. We will do our best.

678
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,679
We will do our best.

679
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:26,179
Xiong Fei, I'll go first.

680
00:41:26,179 --> 00:41:27,360
Son.

681
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,200
Wei.

682
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:55,260
Report from No. 1.

683
00:41:55,260 --> 00:42:00,319
I am now 20 meters deep.

684
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,659
It's safe.

685
00:42:01,659 --> 00:42:03,820
No. 2 can enter the hole.

686
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:06,880
No. 2, roger that.

687
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,780
Xiong Fei, be careful.

688
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,119
Luo Yuan is waiting for you.

689
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:11,720
Don't worry.

690
00:42:36,219 --> 00:42:38,100
No. 1, report.

691
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:42,100
We are now 50 meters deep.

692
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,740
No victim has been found.

693
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,520
Request to continue to go down.

694
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,840
 Agreed.

695
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,219
Let's go.

696
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:12,040

697
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:22,360
♫  At first, there was no sadness in the world  ♫

698
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:29,780
♫  Until luck came and crossed the stage  ♫

699
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:37,560
♫  At first, souls were confused and wandered  ♫

700
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:45,140
♫  Until people hugged each other  ♫

701
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:52,500
♫  I've been on the road  ♫

702
00:43:54,480 --> 00:44:00,860
♫  Trying to connect laughter and tears  ♫

703
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:07,800
♫  I suddenly have faith  ♫

704
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:15,600
♫  I can walk by millions of shining household lights  ♫

705
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:23,340
♫  I hope I can admire flowers in the afterglow  ♫

706
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:30,600
♫  Shed tears and hope that you are well  ♫

707
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:39,380
♫  The good times I'm pursuing belong to the light  ♫

708
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:46,880
♫  It can light up the wounds that follow  ♫

709
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,720
♫  Catching the floating stars  ♫

710
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,540
♫  Watching as the memories flash by  ♫

711
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:58,200
♫  Traveling through market scenes  ♫

712
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:01,860
♫  With a fiery gaze  ♫

713
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:05,700
♫  I can't fly  ♫

714
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:09,260
♫  But I can look up  ♫

715
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:16,800
♫  I'm always on the road chasing the light  ♫
