OK.

18
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,970
We can stick for a little longer.

19
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,840
But the publicity and release
will start soon.

20
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,690
We really don't have

21
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,770
a penny for that.

22
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,970
Hello, who's that?

23
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,330
Hello, is that Zhou Mingming?

24
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,600
I'm Li Jian's dad.

25
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:16,410
Hello.

26
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,840
When is it convenient for you?

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,130
I want to see you.

28
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,440
Li Jian didn't make

29
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:22,970
any mistakes recently, did he?

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,930
I'm not going to talk about him.

31
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,880
I want to talk about our cooperation.

32
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,600
Li Jian's dad and Mingming

33
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,650
talked all afternoon yesterday.

34
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:42,930
He offered to

35
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:43,880
invest in our

36
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,970
film project

37
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,440
and solve our financial problems.

38
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,530
Really?

39
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,040
That's great.

40
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,370
He solved my pressing problems.

41
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,760
I talked to him before.

42
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,040
He seemed to be not interested

43
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,440
in our company.

44
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,320
Thanks to Mingming.

45
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:07,440
Earlier,

46
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,280
Yang Zhao and Li Jian

47
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,810
got lost during camping.

48
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,250
Mingming rescued them.

49
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:12,600
Now both of them

50
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,690
are doing rescue work with Mingming.

51
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,970
Li Jian's dad was very happy

52
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,250
after learning about it.

53
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,840
I never thought that Mingming
could bring in investment

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,720
by doing rescue work.

55
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:23,810
Exactly.

56
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,210
Aiqi,

57
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,930
thanks for your hard work these days.

58
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,130
I did what I should do.

59
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:32,840
You know,

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,690
I've always liked you.

61
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:36,930
In my mind,

62
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,160
I've always hoped that

63
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,530
you and Mingming

64
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,880
will be closer.

65
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,760
I know, ma'am.

66
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,040
Mingming and I

67
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,880
grew up together.

68
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,720
We know each other well.

69
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,530
Don't worry.

70
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,210
I'll try my best to help him.

71
00:03:59,280 --> 00:03:59,630
I...

72
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,490
By the way, ma'am,

73
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,320
did you see the news?

74
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,530
It has made our film

75
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:04,650
a big hit.

76
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,530
What news?

77
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,560
Haven't you seen it?

78
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,250
Look.

79
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,690
In a neighborhood
in the south of the city,

80
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,250
two residents suffered

81
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,600
cardiac arrest in succession

82
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,690
(Citizen donated first aid equipment to
neighborhoods) due to a heart attack.

83
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,760
Fortunately, the neighborhood
is equipped with a defibrillator.

84
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,000
The community service workers

85
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,610
have also received systematic

86
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,050
cardiopulmonary resuscitation training.

87
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,640
With their timely help,

88
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,730
the two victims got out of danger.

89
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,730
We've contacted

90
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,290
the donor of the defibrillator,

91
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,760
Ding Dingding, a young cartoonist.

92
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:36,610
Hello.

93
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,370
I'm a TV journalist.

94
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,960
I'd like to interview you.

95
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,370
How did you come up with the idea

96
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,810
of donating the defibrillators?

97
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,080
First...

98
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,330
Please look at the camera.

99
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,560
Look there?

100
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:48,080
Yes.

101
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,170
Hello, everyone. I'm Ding Dingding.

102
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,490
First, I'd like to explain,

103
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,640
or clarify something.

104
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,050
The defibrillators

105
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,400
weren't donated by me.

106
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,000
They were donated by the chairwoman
of Mingmei Media,

107
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,250
Ms. Ma Ruifen.

108
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,320
If you want to thank someone,

109
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,000
thank her.

110
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,250
And here's what happened,

111
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,880
Ms. Ma gave me half a million,

112
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,880
and asked me to do something

113
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,320
for the public good on behalf of her.

114
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:09,960
I heard that some neighborhoods

115
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,610
lacked first-aid equipment...

116
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,250
(I created a good life)

117
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,610
(for Mingming)

118
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:14,960
(so that he would be able to reject)

119
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,880
(the unsuitable things.)

120
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:21,170
(You are the unsuitable thing now.)

121
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,170
I see.

122
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,320
If Aiqi didn't tell me,

123
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,730
I wouldn't know that

124
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,930
you mortgaged our house.

125
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:01,810
Mom,

126
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:03,850
I didn't tell you because

127
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,370
I didn't want you to be worried.

128
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,440
I don't blame you.

129
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,850
On the contrary, I'm very pleased.

130
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:13,930
You did the right thing.

131
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,930
If it weren't for you,

132
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,320
our company would hardly

133
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,810
go through the difficult period.

134
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:27,880
Son,

135
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,640
you've grown up.

136
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,930
Mom can finally let go.

137
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,250
Mom,

138
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,000
then can I make my own decision

139
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,290
for me and Dingding?

140
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:42,760
Let's go inside.

141
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:04,200
Hello.

142
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:04,560
Hello.

143
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,080
I want to see Mingming's mom.

144
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:07,400
Come in, please.

145
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:07,880
OK.

146
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,290
This way.

147
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,560
Hello, Aunt.

148
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:15,050
Why are you here?

149
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,370
Mingming isn't home.

150
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:18,760
I know.

151
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,880
I come to see you.

152
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,000
What can we talk about?

153
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,320
Don't think I don't know

154
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,200
your little tricks.

155
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,440
What tricks can I have?

156
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,810
I want to show you something good.

157
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,000
Look.

158
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,690
I don't like comics.

159
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,320
I didn't ask if you liked it.

160
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,520
Didn't you see it?

161
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,880
No, I didn't.

162
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,760
This is you 30 years ago.

163
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,050
Take a closer look.

164
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,490
This is where you worked.

165
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,810
Does it look familiar?

166
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,640
When you started your business,

167
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,610
you rented a warehouse as an office,

168
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,290
right?

169
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,760
I carried the walkie-lookie by myself.

170
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:13,520
This is

171
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:14,610
when you went to the TV station

172
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,370
to deliver tapes.

173
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,400
Back then, you all used

174
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,560
video tapes, right?

175
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:18,760
Yeah.

176
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,520
What do you mean?

177
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,170
I mean nothing.

178
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:28,930
Mingming told me

179
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,050
your story of

180
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,130
starting a business from scratch.

181
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,560
I was very moved after I heard that.

182
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,250
I think such a good story

183
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,930
should be known to more people.

184
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,880
So I drew a comic

185
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,210
based on your story.

186
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,330
You're really trying hard

187
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,520
to please me.

188
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:46,610
Nice try.

189
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:48,850
Aunt,

190
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,250
don't you think my comic...

191
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,680
Enough. Don't talk again.

192
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:52,760
You should leave.

193
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:53,920
I want to take a nap.

194
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,160
I'll put the comic here.

195
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,850
You can read it if you want to.

196
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:01,920
I'm leaving.

197
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,620
(No, this is my dream. No matter
how hard it is, I can't collapse.)

198
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:13,210
Wait.

199
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,920
Come back after my noon break.

200
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,680
Yes.

201
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,000
Bye, Aunt.

202
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:57,330
Yuan,

203
00:09:58,370 --> 00:09:59,280
you're back.

204
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:02,880
Brother, why did Zhan Yan leave?

205
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,370
Did you know?

206
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:09,330
(Luo Yuan,)

207
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,520
(I'm sorry I can't)

208
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,730
(say goodbye to you face to face.)

209
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,520
(I'm going to support
the mountainous areas.)

210
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,090
(It'll take a year)

211
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,640
(or longer.)

212
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,250
(Zhan Yan)
(I know you have many questions.)

213
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,210
(I can't explain to you one by one.)

214
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,640
(I just want to say,)

215
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,610
(no matter what happens
between your brother and me,)

216
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,330
(you're always my sister.)

217
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,370
What happened between

218
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,040
you and Zhan Yan?

219
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,130
As Zhan Yan said,

220
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:34,520
there are many things

221
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,680
that can't be explained.

222
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:38,250
We have different

223
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:39,920
positions and opinions.

224
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:42,000
Yuan,

225
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,850
anyway,

226
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,370
don't ask about it again.

227
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,640
Fellows,

228
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:25,680
I'm sorry to trouble you.

229
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,920
There's something

230
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,730
I've always wanted to tell you

231
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,760
but failed.

232
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:38,640
Today, I choose to

233
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,400
tell you in a way like this,

234
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:43,640
so I can muster my courage.

235
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:47,800
Light Chaser Rescue

236
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,640
has been formed for many years.

237
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,330
With love

238
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:52,970
for public charity,

239
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,400
you joined the team

240
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:57,520
and witnessed its development

241
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,760
and growth.

242
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,450
But you don't know

243
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:04,130
the reason why I built this

244
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,160
non-profit rescue team

245
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,570
was because

246
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,920
my family suffered

247
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,520
a devastating earthquake

248
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,400
25 years ago.

249
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,970
In the earthquake,

250
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,370
my daughter and I

251
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,330
survived by luck.

252
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,040
But my wife

253
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,570
was buried under the ruins.

254
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,210
Trapped with her

255
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:34,250
was another couple.

256
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,640
They asked me for help,

257
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,610
but I thought only of my...

258
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,000
my daughter's mom.

259
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,160
So I went to save my wife first.

260
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,570
Due to lacking rescue skills,

261
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:57,370
I caused the second collapse

262
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,880
of the building.

263
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,880
My wife and that couple

264
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,160
died from that.

265
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,130
They were supposed to

266
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:11,920
have a chance to be rescued.

267
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,760
But I killed them.

268
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:27,250
Over the years,

269
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,370
with the hero's halo above my head,

270
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:30,570
I've never had the courage

271
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,920
to clarify the truth.

272
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:38,880
With a feeling of atonement,

273
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,760
I set up this team.

274
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,330
I hope I can use professional

275
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,450
rescue knowledge and skills

276
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:47,850
to help and rescue

277
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,330
more people in danger.

278
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:55,520
I know what I've done

279
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,760
is far from enough to make up

280
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,880
for the mistakes I made.

281
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,450
But better to do it than not.

282
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:10,400
This is my only consolation.

283
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,680
Light Chaser Rescue
still has a long way ahead.

284
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:16,970
It needs a

285
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,880
better leader.

286
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,400
So today,

287
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,920
I hereby announce

288
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,610
I resign as the captain of

289
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,040
Light Chaser Rescue.

290
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,680
Luo Ben will be my successor.

291
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,610
It's been so many years.

292
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,920
I finally got this thing

293
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,250
off my chest.

294
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:43,520
If you can accept me,

295
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,800
I'll always be a member

296
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,570
of Light Chaser Rescue,

297
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,490

298
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:51,640

Mr. Lordan,

326
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:09,850
your blood sugar level
and blood pressure

327
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,920
are a little high.

328
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,960
You should keep taking medicine.

329
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:14,440
I'll prescribe the medicine for you.

330
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,880
Every medicine has its side effects.

331
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,130
I can't take it every day.

332
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,640
Long term hypertension

333
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:26,370
will cause damage

334
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,610
to your heart and kidneys.

335
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,130
So you must

336
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:31,720
take the medicine.

337
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,370
Do you like this?

338
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,050
Take it.

339
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:01,610
Little Tashi,

340
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,610
you must stay in school

341
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,770
and study hard.

342
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,240
Thanks, doctor.

343
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,160
What a child!

344
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:11,050
It doesn't matter.

345
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:12,480
It's a small gift

346
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:14,010
for kids.

347
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,960
Remember to take the medicine on time.

348
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,330
Thank you, Dr. Zhan.

349
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:24,440
Let's go.

350
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,050
What's this, An?

351
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,050
The facial masks I asked
my family to courier to me.

352
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,640
I can't find any here.

353
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,370
The environment here

354
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,640
isn't so good as Linjiang.

355
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:47,810
You signed up with me

356
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,330
to help the village.

357
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,530
Do you regret it?

358
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:51,920
How could I?

359
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:52,710
I come here

360
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:53,770
to learn from you and practice.

361
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:54,680
Everyone in our department

362
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:55,960
envies me.

363
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:57,090
Xu Zirui said

364
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,810
he would sign up next time.

365
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,240
He just got married.

366
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:02,770
Is he willing to come?

367
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,370
Xiaolu supports him.

368
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,480
The disciples you've trained

369
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:06,920
are all good.

370
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:08,200
By the way,

371
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:09,720
didn't they say a new colleague

372
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:11,130
would come to help us?

373
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,880
Maybe in a couple of days.

374
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,940
(Medical Service Center
of Qianliang Village)

375
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,130
Bye.

376
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,010
Let me see.

377
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:48,880
It hurts.

378
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,480
Let me see.

379
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,330
It hurts.

380
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:53,920
Just hold it.

381
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,200
It hurts.

382
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,530
All right.

383
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:03,920
What are you doing?

384
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:04,880
His arm is dislocated.

385
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,880
I was helping him.

386
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,610
I saw my son crying.

387
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:09,960
Don't leave until

388
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,290
you make it clear.

389
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:13,290
I was really

390
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,370
treating him.

391
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,440
But I saw...

392
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,400
But I saw my son crying just now.

393
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,570
Which of your arms is hurt?

394
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:20,130
This one.

395
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:20,850
You should ask him.

396
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,130
I'm a doctor here.

397
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:22,770
Can it move?

398
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:24,130
Look at my gown.

399
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,090
I didn't hurt Xiaozhuo.

400
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,010
Does it still hurt?

401
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:27,160
No.

402
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:29,240
Dad, it doesn't hurt now.

403
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:31,290
Doesn't it?

404
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:32,530
Yes.

405
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:34,370
This doctor didn't lie to you.

406
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:35,530
She did give your son

407
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,880
a joint reduction.

408
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,090
I see.

409
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:39,610
Cai Yuxiao.

410
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:41,610
Long time no see.

411
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,770
I'm so sorry.

412
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:46,810
I misunderstood you.

413
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,090
I'm sorry.

414
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:52,810
This is my number.

415
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,370
If your son feels unwell later,

416
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,370
call me anytime.

417
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,610
Thank you.

418
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,610
Thank you.

419
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,480
Come, son.

420
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:00,130
Get up.

421
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,570
Thank you.

422
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,400
Dr. Zhan,

423
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:09,090
I come to report for duty.

424
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:10,850
Will you feel disappointed?

425
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,130
How could I?

426
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,680
I just never thought

427
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:15,090
the new colleague would be you.

428
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:16,720
I'll show you the dormitory.

429
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:17,720
OK.

430
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,370
You must be tired after the journey.

431
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:31,960
I fetched some hot water for you.

432
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,290
Thanks.

433
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,330
You've changed so much.

434
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:38,680
I can hardly recognize you.

435
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:40,480
Really?

436
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:43,480
Sometimes when I look in the mirror,

437
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:46,090
I do find I've changed a lot.

438
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:48,480
Have some water.

439
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:49,770
OK.

440
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,680
Thanks.

441
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,440
Did you get hurt?

442
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:59,330
When I worked for

443
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:01,090
Doctors without Borders
in the war zone,

444
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,570
I got hurt.

445
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,530
What task were you assigned?

446
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:08,480
Why did you get such a serious injury?

447
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:12,720
There was a war on.

448
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,400
A shell suddenly

449
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:16,160
exploded near us.

450
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:19,610
I never thought you would

451
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,130
go to such a dangerous place.

452
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,960
Tell me about you.

453
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:27,370
Why did you come here?

454
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,880
You know,

455
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,010
I've always hoped

456
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:33,240
to help the border areas.

457
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,610
But the conditions here

458
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:37,880
are not as good as those in Linjiang.

459
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:38,920
If you need anything,

460
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:40,200
tell me.

461
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,400
I'll bring it to you if I have it.

462
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,090
Don't bother.

463
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,880
It's good enough.

464
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,200
Alright. Tidy up first.

465
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:50,570
Then have a good rest.

466
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:52,440
I'll tell you the specific

467
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:53,960
job content tomorrow.

468
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:55,130
OK.

469
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,160
Dad.

470
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:26,160
How could you take it so fast?

471
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:28,920
I was waiting because I thought

472
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,530
you would call at this time.

473
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,330
Seriously?

474
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,720
What will you do if I

475
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:34,850
work overtime next time?

476
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:36,160
I handed over

477
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:38,050
the work in the team to Luo Ben.

478
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,240
I'm not busy now.

479
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:40,290
I have time to wait.

480
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:42,050
I just miss you.

481
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:44,370
You're alone out there.

482
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:45,920
Take care of yourself.

483
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:48,960
Don't worry. I'm doing very well.

484
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:51,770
I work at sunrise and rest at sunset.

485
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,290
My life is regular.

486
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,570
I eat healthy food.

487
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,610
I'm here to keep in good health.

488
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:58,570
Instead, I worry about you.

489
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,400
Do you take medicine on time?

490
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,480
Have you changed the habit

491
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,570
of drinking tea at night?

492
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,370
Don't drink tea at night.

493
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,160
It'll overwhelm

494
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:10,010
your heart and kidneys,

495
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,770
and it's bad for your stomach.

496
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:13,960
Do you hear me?

497
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:16,370
And especially don't drink alcohol.

498
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,130
I didn't.

499
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,770
I drank this tea during the day.

500
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:23,050
I stopped drinking early. Don't worry.

501
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:25,200
Good to hear that.

502
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,770
Guess

503
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,010
who I saw today?

504
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,920
Is it someone I know?

505
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:33,130
Cai Yuxiao.

506
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:36,370
Cai?

507
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,130
He went there to help too?

508
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:40,850
Yeah.

509
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:42,400
I didn't expect

510
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:43,770
I would meet him here.

511
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,330
But he's changed a lot.

512
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,200
I can hardly recognize him.

513
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,720
Give my regards to him.

514
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,400
Yan,

515
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:53,240
Luo Ben asked about you today.

516
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:55,810
I know the communication there
is inconvenient.

517
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:57,290
Would you spare some time

518
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,770
to talk with him?

519
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,850
He cares about you.

520
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:02,960
Dad,

521
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,920
Cai Yuxiao just arrived today.

522
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:05,810
I'm going to

523
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,290
give him a tour later.

524
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:09,240
Gotta hang up now.

525
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:14,050
Lately,

526
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:15,880
Light Chaser Rescue

527
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:17,010
has developed rapidly.

528
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,640
We participated in

529
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:20,610
various rescue operations,

530
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,370
and successfully fulfilled the tasks

531
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,370
assigned to us

532
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:25,920
by the leadership and the people.

533
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,240
I counted up the tasks

534
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:32,050
Light Chaser Rescue has fulfilled
over the country this year.

535
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,770
As of today,

536
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,240
we've participated in

537
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,480
more than 6,000 rescues.

538
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,200
This is Mr. Robert,

539
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,330
an international rescue expert.

540
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:46,720
From now on,

541
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:48,400
Mr. Robert

542
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:50,010
will guide our training

543
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:52,640
from obtaining visas
and customs clearance

544
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:54,480
to technique standardization,

545
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,680
rescue procedure, etc.

546
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,330
In a word, all matters, big and small.

547
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,290
All the training will be conducted

548
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,480
by the international rescue standards.

549
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,180
(Law Positive Law Firm)

550
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,130
Are you really leaving?

551
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,880
Why don't you consider it again?

552
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:04,610
I really hope you

553
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:05,640
to stay.

554
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:07,920
Thanks for your favor.

555
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:09,290
But I've made the decision.

556
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,880
Is Luo Ben really that important?

557
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:13,640
Even if you can't

558
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:14,880
be together,

559
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:16,880
you can still be good partners.

560
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:18,160
Is it really necessary?

561
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:19,050
Going to the UK for further study

562
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,370
is always my plan.

563
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:21,880
Now it's time.

564
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:24,050
Gao,

565
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,480
Ai Rui'er may meet

566
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,050
a better man

567
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,400
than Luo Ben in the UK.

568
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:29,090
Don't fuss.

569
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:32,680
See you then.

570
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:33,720
Take care.

571
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:00,480
(Bon voyage.)

572
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,010
Take one.

573
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:17,480
You take one, too.

574
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:18,370
Come on.

575
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:18,960
Quickly.

576
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:19,920
Who wants one?

577
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:25,400
Count how many there are in my hands.

578
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:26,610
How many exactly?

579
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,050
Thanks.

580
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:30,610
Uncle.

581
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:32,960
Give these out to them.

582
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:35,770
Come.

583
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:38,200
Why are you here?

584
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:41,370
I didn't expect you to

585
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,160
become close to the children so quickly.

586
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:46,130
This is my experience.

587
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:48,090
Whenever I get to a new place,

588
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:49,370
I must get on well with

589
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,640
the local children.

590
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:52,720
It's helpful to my work.

591
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,160
I feel like you've both

592
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:02,920
changed and unchanged.

593
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,050
You're still the same thoughtful

594
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,050
and considerate Cai Yuxiao.

595
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,050
I think you've changed a lot.

596
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,640
Have I?

597
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,440
You begin to think for others.

598
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:24,010
I was too cold

599
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:25,610
and selfish before.

600
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:27,770
I never thought for others.

601
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:34,850
No, I was wrong before.

602
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,130
I was selfish

603
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:40,640
and did many wrong things to you.

604
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:41,920
I apologize.

605
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,370
Forget about it.

606
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,530
Where are your parents?

607
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,130
After leaving Linjiang,

608
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,770
I took them back to our hometown.

609
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:56,160
Before long,

610
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:58,200
my mom passed away.

611
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:02,530
After I took care of the family affairs

612
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,770
and got my dad settled,

613
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:07,370
I came out.

614
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:10,130
How did you join

615
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,090
Doctors Without Borders?

616
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,720
After I left my hometown,

617
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,410
I travelled around

618
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,410
aimlessly.

619
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,050
I went to some places

620
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,050
with poor medical service,

621
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:24,770
and participated in the

622
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:26,120
international voluntary medical service.

623
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:28,570
I worked with the volunteers

624
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:30,160
to help

625
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,010
local people in need.

626
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,320
Later,

627
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:37,840
I found those days

628
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,160
were very fulfilling.

629
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:42,240
I thought

630
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,490
I was actually valuable.

631
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,320
So I applied to

632
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:47,890
join the organization.

633
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:50,160
What about you?

634
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,530
Why did you come here?

635
00:34:58,610 --> 00:34:59,490
I had a break-up.

636
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:22,050
The company has gone through
the difficult pass.

637
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:25,050
The new project is about to be launched.

638
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,930
You are busy working

639
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:29,490
in the company all day.

640
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,640
Your dad

641
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:32,720
won't return to China
until the end of the year.

642
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:34,800
It's hard to

643
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:36,530
have a meal with you.

644
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,760
Mom, if you say so,

645
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:40,720
I'll send your instructions

646
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:41,890
to my dad immediately

647
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,010
and ask him to come back soon.

648
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,050
And I

649
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,130
won't attend the meeting tomorrow.

650
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,360
I'll spend a whole day with you.

651
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:47,680
Do you want to go shopping

652
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,720
or play mah-jong?

653
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:52,410
Not tomorrow.

654
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,130
Find another day.

655
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:56,240
I don't understand.

656
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,010
Now you don't bother about

657
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,530
what's happening outside.

658
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,410
The company has been

659
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:00,890
handed over to me.

660
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:02,840
You've been resting at home.

661
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:04,010
What important business

662
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,200
can't you decline?

663
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:09,640
I'll go out with Ding Dingding.

664
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:14,360
Dingding?

665
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:15,840
Yeah, Dingding.

666
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:17,050
Your girlfriend.

667
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,240
She'll go to a school tomorrow

668
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,610
to sign books for the children.

669
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,970
She asked me to go with her.

670
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:24,800
I said yes.

671
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,570
My girlfriend?

672
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,800
Mom, do you mean Dingding?

673
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,530
Do you have

674
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,800
another girlfriend?

675
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,610
Mom, have some more.

676
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,720
Come on, have some more.

677
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:45,010
Eat your food. Don't mind...

678
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:45,930
Enough. Enough.

679
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:47,320
Mom, I'm full.

680
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:48,640
I have to go out.

681
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:50,890
You barely ate.

682
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,760
Dingding. Dingding.

683
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,280
Dingding.

684
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:16,050
- Dingding. Dingding.
- Coming. I hear you.

685
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,130
My mom agreed that we can be together.

686
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:19,530
Dingding.

687
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,360
You're strangling me.

688
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:23,130
Dingding,

689
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:24,290
my mom

690
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,160
admitted you.

691
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:26,330
Really?

692
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:27,980
I'm so happy, Dingding.

693
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,220
Put me down.

694
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,220
What's up?

695
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,740
Why are you so excited?

696
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:36,820
My mom

697
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:37,700
agreed us to be together.

698
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,020
Now we can get our

699
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:39,660
marriage certificate.

700
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,900
Luo Ben, do come to

701
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,060
our wedding.

702
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:44,620
Congratulations.

703
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:48,700
Why does he

704
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,860
look unhappy?

705
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,540
What do you think?
He broke up with his girlfriend,

706
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,420
and you sent him
a wedding invitation just now.

707
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,540
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

708
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,060
I was too excited to remember that.

709
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,740
But you shouldn't worry.

710
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,020
Captain talked everything through.

711
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,180
Since they've got rid of the hang-up,

712
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:00,780
the right man and woman

713
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,540
will be together sooner or later,

714
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:02,260
just like us.

715
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,060
It isn't easy for Yan and him.

716
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:05,980
Soon after they were together,

717
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,220
Yan went far away.

718
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,500
They can hardly see each other.

719
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,980
If it were you,

720
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:10,700
no matter where you were,

721
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:11,780
I would go to see you.

722
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,140
Really?

723
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,500
Of course.

724
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:50,660
(Light Chaser Rescue)

725
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,260
You're doing well.

726
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,500
Let's have a friendly competition later.

727
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,700
Your leg injury is recovering well.

728
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,260
Your training results

729
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,260
are almost as good as before.

730
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,420
When you're at work,

731
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,740
I've been practicing.

732
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,020
Good.

733
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,300
Did Guoguo make the bracelet?

734
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,220
Exactly.

735
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:42,900
She wouldn't let me take it off.

736
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,420
I said I had to perform tasks

737
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,340
at work.

738
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,260
I'd lose it easily.

739
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,980
I asked if I could wear it at home.

740
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:48,540
No way.

741
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,020
She was mad at me

742
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,500
and asked me to

743
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:52,420
take a photo every two hours

744
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:53,740
to prove that
I was wearing it all the time.

745
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,740
Can you believe that kid?

746
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,300
She's so lovely.

747
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,220
You know what,

748
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,700
before I knew Guoguo,

749
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,100
I had never

750
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,100
envied you.

751
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,780
But when I saw her as the flower girl

752
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,060
at Luo Yuan's wedding,

753
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,540
I became a fan of her

754
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:09,740
immediately.

755
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,500
If I have such a

756
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,820
lovely daughter like her,

757
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:13,820
I would

758
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,420
stay at home with her on weekends.

759
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:16,860
I wouldn't come here to train.

760
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:17,980
If you like a daughter,

761
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,780
you should have one with Zhan Yan.

762
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:22,020
Others' daughter
is never as good as your own.

763
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,820
You're unbelievable.

764
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,260
It's been a long time.

765
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,700
Why haven't you made up with her?

766
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:34,740
I don't know how to

767
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,060
take the first step.

768
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,980
Is it that difficult?

769
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,860
You just fly there,

770
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,100
and tell her, "I miss you".

771
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,780
Just show up in front of her

772
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,780
and surprise her. That's it.

773
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:48,340
I tell you what,

774
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,340
as long as you see each other,

775
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,980
you can solve any problem.

776
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:54,540
It isn't that complicated.

777
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,260
To tell you the truth,

778
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,420
I've imagined

779
00:40:58,620 --> 00:40:59,620
countless possibilities,

780
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:00,580
but every possibility

781
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:01,860
would fail at the

782
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,220
first step.

783
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,860
That's even easier.

784
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,260
You only have to book an

785
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,380
air ticket on some app.

786
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:08,970
Don't you know that?

787
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:09,910
Let me help you.

788
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,380
She's checking on me again. Look.

789
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:14,700
She asked me to take another photo.

790
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:15,700
Wait a minute.

791
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,540
Guoguo!

792
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,420
Where is the emergency room?

793
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:01,100
Over there.

794
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:07,060
(Emergency)

795
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:18,820
Guoguo,

796
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:20,820
you know what,

797
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,180
the uncles and aunts of the rescue team

798
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,340
all miss you.

799
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,740
When you get well,

800
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:26,620
ask your daddy to take you

801
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:28,780
to the rescue team, OK?

802
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:29,500
OK.

803
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:31,700
Good girl.

804
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,260
I saw the bracelet

805
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,500
you made for your daddy today.

806
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:38,860
It's so beautiful.

807
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:41,220
Make another for me later,

808
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:42,260
will you?

809
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:43,020
OK.

810
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:48,260
You'll get better soon.
