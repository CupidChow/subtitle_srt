00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:08,990

2
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:14,750
♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

3
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,020
♫  I put out mountain fires  ♫

4
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:22,150
♫  and catch the sunset  ♫

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,450
♫  I leave the rhythms of life in my wake  ♫

6
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:35,420
♫  Happiness whispers in my ears  ♫

7
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,270
♫  Chasing the passion for the future  ♫

8
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,500
♫  Like a dream maker  ♫

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,370
♫  Reading the universe and stars  ♫

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,520
♫  My existence in the river of time  ♫

11
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,550
♫  With the body temperature of a moment  ♫

12
00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:02,170
♫  I'm trying to be the extension of light  ♫

13
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:08,850
♫  If the world grants me a frustrating opening  ♫

14
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:15,420
♫  I'll chase back time like a dark horse  ♫

15
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:22,170
♫  Even though I know the truth, I won't be afraid  ♫

16
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:28,300
 I won't miss the moon because of mediocrity  ♫

17
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,670
♫  I won't lose the light  ♫

18
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:36,040

19
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,140

20
00:01:48,499 --> 00:01:52,400
Gain strength and courage from them.

21
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,779
Everyone, please keep on going.

22
00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:08,799
 Hello, Ding. I'm Yan Nuo, an editor at Qingchong Press.

23
00:02:08,799 --> 00:02:11,360
 I want to chat with you when you're available.

24
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,499
 We can help you promote the comic Light Chaser Rescue by film or drama.

25
00:02:13,499 --> 00:02:16,800
 Hello, Ding. I'm Wu Feng from Sky Media.

26
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,099
 If you'll excuse me, I'd like to talk with you.

27
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,239
I guess I'll get famous.

28
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,599
Hello, you are?

29
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:51,639
 Hello, I'm your neighbor Luo Yuan.

30
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,959
 I can't speak, but I can hear you.

31
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:55,639
 My brother likes quiet and is touchy.

32
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:57,599
 Please forgive him.

33
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,780
You're Mr. Luo's younger sister. Right?

34
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:07,819
 You already know my brother?

35
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:12,979
Yes, ages ago. I indirectly gave you my blood in Fengxi.

36
00:03:12,979 --> 00:03:14,500
 Thank you.

37
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,780
 - Thank you  
 - Thank you?

38
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,319
You're welcome.

39
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,300
Just relax. For destiny's sake, I'll pardon your brother.

40
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,819
You know what? Congratulations on your recovery and coming home.

41
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,260
Okay. I'll take it.

42
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,860
Thanks a lot.

43
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,880
Ai Qi, come here.

44
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,399
I've got something.

45
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:26,820
 Miss Ding, let's start.

46
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:30,659
Please hurry up. I'm a little busy.

47
00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:32,760
A lot of the media want to talk to me.

48
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,099
You have three minutes.

49
00:05:35,099 --> 00:05:37,219
 I only need two.

50
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,300
What? Are you sincerely enough?

51
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,080
 Of course.

52
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,159
 From what I can gather, the comic copyright platform has not signed a contract.

53
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:49,579
 Our company is willing to offer 500,000 yuan to buy out the full copyright agent of the project.

54
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:51,899
 Then we can go 50-50.

55
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:53,859
 What's your opinion?

56
00:05:57,859 --> 00:06:02,339
I'm not very casual person.

57
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:04,680
 I don't care what you're like.

58
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,559
 You just need to answer me.  Yes or no?

59
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:08,799
No.

60
00:06:08,799 --> 00:06:10,339
 I'll send you the contract.

61
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:13,360
What? Don't rush into anything.

62
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,120
I'm not a greenhorn, right?

63
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,880
I have experience.

64
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,820
I have to discuss this with my lawyer team.

65
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:25,160
If they say yes, I can sign.

66
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:28,779
 Okay. Reply to me in three days.

67
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:31,560
- Goodbye. 
 - All right. Bye-bye.

68
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,760
Hello.

69
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,719
Can I help you?

70
00:06:56,719 --> 00:06:58,959
As the quote goes, a good neighbor is better than a brother far off.

71
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:02,139
It's better to be close to the door.

72
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:04,880
Thank you, Lawyer Luo, for putting out the fire in my house.

73
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,119
I sincerely invite you over for dinner.

74
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:08,800

75
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,700

76
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,439
No, thank you.

77
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:17,260
Mr. Luo, here's the thing.

78
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:22,120
I have a legal issue to ask for your advice.

79
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,240
If so, find me in my office.

80
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,839
Let's go, Yuan.

81
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:30,100
Sister, I knew you would come to help me celebrate.

82
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,680
 Brother, I want to join in.

83
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,220
I really can't take you.

84
00:07:38,739 --> 00:07:40,160
What? What?

85
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,880
- Yuan. 
 - Come.

86
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,400
Don't worry.

87
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,180
Today, I'm here to announce that I, Ding Dingding, am officially

88
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,379
on my road to being a comic genius.

89
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:58,359
Yuan, if you and your brother meet my stalking fans, just forgive them.

90
00:07:58,359 --> 00:08:01,999
Dingding, I think something is amiss.

91
00:08:01,999 --> 00:08:04,739
No way, you're overthinking it.

92
00:08:04,739 --> 00:08:08,020
I have the contract. 500 thousand yuan.

93
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:11,580
Eat your food.

94
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:38,260

95
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,440
- Mr. Luo. 
 - Yuan needs to drink milk every day. I'm sending it to her.

96
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,259
Yuan.

97
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,020
 I'll drink it.

98
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,659
 Go back, please.

99
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,559
Yuan Yuan,

100
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:05,900
you've just recovered. You can't drink alcohol. Do you know that?

101
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,400
And these...

102
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:15,320
are steaks, roast chicken, and prawns on your invitation?

103
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,059
Right?

104
00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:18,839
No, Mr. Luo.

105
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:22,180
I'm just now a little famous.

106
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,619
The payment hasn't arrived.

107
00:09:23,619 --> 00:09:27,999
These instant noodles are beef, chicken, and seafood flavor. They taste similar.

108
00:09:27,999 --> 00:09:30,360
Or do you want me to make you one?

109
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,819
No, thanks.

110
00:09:31,819 --> 00:09:33,779
Luo Yuan can't eat them either.

111
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:08,180
Yuan Yuan, I envy you so much.

112
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,100
How thoughtful your brother is. We also gained some advantages.

113
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,459
Right, Yan?

114
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:14,540
Looks nice.

115
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:17,159
It's better if you eat some.

116
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:23,680
I didn't expect you to stand out in so many fields.

117
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,220
You'll look at me in a new light in many ways, Dr. Zhan.

118
00:10:32,219 --> 00:10:35,920
Dingding, you're going to sign a contract. Right?

119
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,359
Lawyer Luo happens to be here.

120
00:10:38,359 --> 00:10:44,659
Lawyer Luo should be outstanding in seeking benefits for others, right?

121
00:10:44,659 --> 00:10:46,820
Is it all right, Lawyer Luo?

122
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:54,879
Give me the contract.

123
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:56,580
Thank you.

124
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:02,759
Sis, your way works.

125
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:04,440
You know what?

126
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:10,020
Let me tell you. This morning, he was still all business and told me I must go to the law firm for a consultation.

127
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:17,240
Then I'm also doing this out of respect for your sister

128
00:11:18,699 --> 00:11:20,180
To accompany such high-class food,

129
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:24,139
I have to use my secret weapon and give it a little vibe.

130
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:26,619
Yuan, help me here.

131
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:36,699
What's that?

132
00:11:38,719 --> 00:11:40,459
How's it?

133
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,479
These cheap colored lamps can easily cause a short circuit.

134
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:50,560
Mr. Luo, please concentrate.

135
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,340
I'm reading it.

136
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,999
It's a standard contract of copyright.

137
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:01,899
Basically it's okay.

138
00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:04,679
The follow-up profit allocation is also reasonable.

139
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:06,420
But look at this article.

140
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:11,799
"The direction of the characters in the comics must be confirmed in writing by Party A.

141
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:15,160
If there is any disagreement between the two parties, the opinion of Party A shall prevail."

142
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,319
And this.

143
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:22,040
"Party B is obliged to modify the content of the comics according to Party A's requirements until Party A is satisfied."

144
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,060
I'm afraid these two are improper.

145
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,759
I don't get it.

146
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:31,839
If Party A's request is contrary to your original intention of creation,

147
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,699
then these two are likely to limit your creativity.

148
00:12:35,939 --> 00:12:41,979
But I think they approve of me if they are willing to pay me so much money for my copyright.

149
00:12:41,979 --> 00:12:44,800
Our common goal is to make a fine piece of work.

150
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,079
If they have any advice, I can revise it.

151
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,639
And this. 7-1

152
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,760
The specific work model of Party B after joining shall be determined by Party A.

153
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,800
It's a vague article.

154
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,779
The best way is to write the work model you negotiated into the contract.

155
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:05,820
I'm a comic artist.

156
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,940
What working model can I have? It's just about drawing.

157
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,980
Do you have any other advice except these two?

158
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,519
Not anymore.

159
00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:19,340
Dingding, I suggest you listen to his advice.

160
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,440
If you regret it taking the medicine, no one can help you.

161
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,979
Sis, take it easy.

162
00:13:23,979 --> 00:13:26,319
You are always paranoid.

163
00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:28,999
If I don't grab this great chance and they find another artist,

164
00:13:28,999 --> 00:13:31,119
there's nothing I can do.

165
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,379
I'll contact them soon.

166
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:35,679
Sign the contract earlier, and get paid earlier.

167
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,580
There's no way we have a power failure.

168
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,140
I said you had a problem with these lights.

169
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,940
It's tripped.

170
00:13:53,179 --> 00:13:56,139
Dingding, where is the electrical box here?

171
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:58,379
I've just moved in.

172
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,579
I don't know where it is.

173
00:14:01,579 --> 00:14:03,979
Take it easy. Just stay here.

174
00:14:03,979 --> 00:14:05,999
I know where it is.

175
00:14:05,999 --> 00:14:07,639
I'll go.

176
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,840
Where's my phone?

177
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,679
Who can turn on the flashlight?

178
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:19,480
What's wrong?

179
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,040
Got a problem?

180
00:14:27,479 --> 00:14:29,960
There's your phone.

181
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,299
 Okay, we have light now.

182
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:56,199
- Chairman Fang. 
 - Mr. Luo.

183
00:14:56,199 --> 00:14:58,020
I'm here to visit the child.

184
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,459
Thank you.

185
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:01,880
Here. He just fell asleep.

186
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:05,339
- This way, please. 
 - Sure.

187
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,060
To be honest, before the guarantee case,

188
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:14,339
I really considered that if you won the lawsuit,

189
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:17,159
I would hand over the company's annual report to you.

190
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:20,260
But I have changed my mind now.

191
00:15:21,979 --> 00:15:26,700
You have the intelligence and sense of social responsibility.

192
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:31,219
The position of the legal adviser of Fangqin will be yours.

193
00:15:31,219 --> 00:15:34,860
Because you reassure me.

194
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,560
You really shocked me.

195
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,419
I thought I was not good enough.

196
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,320
You saved my wife and children.

197
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,619
Take this contract as my appreciation.

198
00:15:47,619 --> 00:15:51,339
We can go into more details in the company some other day.

199
00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:52,940
Sure. Thank you, Chairman Fang.

200
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,979
I won't go then.

201
00:15:55,979 --> 00:15:57,700
Thank you for your flowers.

202
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,880
I'm Luo Ben.

203
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,680
Rescue center?

204
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,140
Dr. Zhan.

205
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,400
Okay, I see.

206
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,000
Dr. Zhan,

207
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,020
do you remember the child Lele rescued from the earthquake?

208
00:16:18,939 --> 00:16:20,399
What happened?

209
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,859
After he was sent to the charity house,

210
00:16:22,859 --> 00:16:25,299
he developed anorexia and weakness in his limbs.

211
00:16:25,299 --> 00:16:26,740
Symptoms of being unable to walk.

212
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,900
Is there any way you can help him?

213
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,940
I can't diagnose without an examination.

214
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,639
Transfer him to our hospital.

215
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,920
How about the ward?

216
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,600
I'll arrange it.

217
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,060

218
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:03,340

219
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,939
 Sister Yan didn't answer your phone call.

220
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:16,120
 Disappointed?

221
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,639
Cut it out.

222
00:17:17,639 --> 00:17:19,500
I've got business with her.

223
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,879
 I know.

224
00:17:20,879 --> 00:17:24,839
 A business of love.

225
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:27,959
Now you even make fun of me.

226
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,340
Just listen to me.

227
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,040
Don't rush into selling me out.

228
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,680
 I'm serious. Ben, you have a crush on Zhan Yan.

229
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,999
 We can tell.

230
00:17:36,999 --> 00:17:38,780
 Don't be glib.

231
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,299
What do you mean by we?

232
00:17:44,379 --> 00:17:49,979
 Dingding said three things in this world can't be hidden.

233
00:17:49,979 --> 00:17:52,720
 Poverty. Cough.

234
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,659
 And love.

235
00:17:57,699 --> 00:17:59,259
Just go to sleep.

236
00:17:59,259 --> 00:18:00,919
Who knows?

237
00:18:10,239 --> 00:18:12,559
Don't drink too much water at night.

238
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,580
Dr. Zhan.

239
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,239
Dr. Zhan.

240
00:18:51,239 --> 00:18:52,840
I'm working now. Wait until I knock off.

241
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,859
Can you get in the car now?

242
00:18:54,859 --> 00:18:56,840
- I've called a taxi. 
 - It's Lele.

243
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,279
Mind your conduct.

244
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,260
Let's go.

245
00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:08,119
Every patient is different.

246
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:12,120
So, Lele's treatment may be a very difficult and long process.

247
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,980
Are you ready for it?

248
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,759
No matter how much it costs, Lele must be cured.

249
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:20,140
You're quite interested in Lele.

250
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,779
I rescued him, after all.

251
00:19:23,779 --> 00:19:25,600
I should take responsibility.

252
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,739
I can't give him hope and then let him down.

253
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,880
Are you sure?

254
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,759
Why?

255
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:36,240
Are you even suspecting this?

256
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:40,760
After all, Lawyer Luo has a strong purpose in everything he does.

257
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,080
Why do you say that?

258
00:19:46,899 --> 00:19:50,120
You went to Fengqi to participate in the earthquake rescue for your sister.

259
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,820
You saved Fang Zhihong's son to get a contract.

260
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,219
What do you want by helping Lele?

261
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,520
It turns out that in Doctor Zhan's mind, I am a mercenary person.

262
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:09,659
I just don't want to see a child being hurt.

263
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,919
Let's build blocks, okay?

264
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,039
Look.

265
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,700
Look at this.

266
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,659
What's the color of it?

267
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:45,080
The combination of medicine and psychotherapy

268
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,919
is the best way to treat PTSD.

269
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,279
When can he be cured?

270
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:51,760
I can't tell.

271
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,140
Maybe a few months.

272
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,300
For some patients, a few years.

273
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,639
Some can't get rid of it even after a decade.

274
00:20:57,639 --> 00:21:01,559
Does that mean he has to take medicine all the time?

275
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:05,719
According to his position, yes.

276
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,899
Thank you.

277
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,060
What are you going to do?

278
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,480
Take him away.

279
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,400
Why? Don't you admit the expert's schedule?

280
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,719
She has the same schedule as the welfare house's.

281
00:21:29,719 --> 00:21:32,019
There's no need to be treated here.

282
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,260
But we have professional escorts.

283
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,060
Where are you going to take him?

284
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:40,260
Lele needs company now, not an escort.

285
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,359
Lele, let's go.

286
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:50,140
We won't take any medicine here.

287
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:53,879
You really fancy yourself. He needs medicine.

288
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:56,080
This little child taking so many medicines.

289
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,140
Even his health will be damaged.

290
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,739
You mentioned the company.

291
00:21:59,739 --> 00:22:00,959
Do you have time for him?

292
00:22:00,959 --> 00:22:02,899
Who can be with him when you're working?

293
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,460
Thank you for your attention, Dr. Zhan.

294
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,799
I'll find a way.

295
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,219
Stop.

296
00:22:12,959 --> 00:22:15,020
I want to take Lele somewhere.

297
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:34,059
From the Fengxi earthquake to the hospital,

298
00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:36,859
he has suffered a lot.

299
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,259
Mr. Luo is right.

300
00:22:39,259 --> 00:22:40,899
You need to spend more time with him.

301
00:22:40,899 --> 00:22:42,799
For him to be happy again.

302
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:48,040
Is Ruan you invited capable of it?

303
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:52,280
Anything can happen in a rescue mission.

304
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,340
Especially new members will be involved in stress responses.

305
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,700
A psychotherapist is a necessity in a team.

306
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,619
Sister Ruan is experienced in this field.

307
00:23:00,619 --> 00:23:03,419
Why didn't you tell me you had these good resources?

308
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:06,620
If so, I wouldn't have needed to take Lele to all these places.

309
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:10,780
Was it really necessary for you to hide it from me?

310
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:16,039
There are no absolutely right and unique ways of psychotherapy.

311
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:21,980
You know the rescue team well.

312
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,640
Are you that acquainted with them?

313
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,300
What is it to you anyway?

314
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,500
Are you on the team?

315
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,220
Why do you have so many questions?

316
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,160
Is there a problem with my question?

317
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,259
I'm not the subject of your investigation.

318
00:23:33,259 --> 00:23:37,780
We are now just a simple partnership to help Lele recover.

319
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:41,740
It's the kind of partnership you lawyers usually excel at.

320
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,000
Fine.

321
00:23:58,279 --> 00:23:59,779
It's the contract of Fangqin Group.

322
00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:02,859
Check it out. Then I can send it to them.

323
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:04,259
Luo Ben?

324
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:08,360
Do you know how to make someone happy?

325
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,240
Who's unhappy?

326
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,839
Don't take it the wrong way. I mean a child.

327
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:21,380
It's the child I rescued from the disaster area to the orphanage. Lele.

328
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,759
A child?

329
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:24,579
Children will have simple happiness.

330
00:24:24,579 --> 00:24:27,559
Games, snacks, bingo.

331
00:24:29,819 --> 00:24:32,019
All right, this is going in circles.

332
00:24:32,019 --> 00:24:34,779
You're not married. How could you know about children?

333
00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:36,500
What your saying means...

334
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:41,660
Then if every case we handle is not personally experienced, is it still handled properly?

335
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,640
Yes.

336
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,020
What did you say?

337
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,359
This contract.

338
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:51,020
Take a look at it.

339
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,600
- Dr. Cai, working overtime? 
 - Yes.

340
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,419
Getting off work soon?

341
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:08,800
Right, your patient in Bed 13.

342
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,000
I'll check for you when making rounds. You won't be distracted at home.

343
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,219
Thanks a lot.

344
00:25:13,219 --> 00:25:14,659
No problem.

345
00:25:16,819 --> 00:25:19,020
Cong Zhou is organizing an alumni party.

346
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,159
Let's attend it together.

347
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:23,160
I haven't finished my thesis.

348
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,380
I know. You don't like these parties.

349
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:32,440
This time we would like to focus on the general surgery academic exchange seminar.

350
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,980
I want to share my ideas with them.

351
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,579
Just send me the time of the party.

352
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:41,620
Sure. I'll pick you up tomorrow morning.

353
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,960

354
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,540
We're doctors. We must communicate with patients and their family members.

355
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:57,119
Honestly, we don't know their identity and backgrounds.

356
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,240
From the vocational part,

357
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,940
I suggest you not get too close to them in case of any trouble.

358
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,180

359
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,190
Dr. Zhan, you haven't attended an alumni event in a long time.

360
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:21,720
They'll be surprised tomorrow.

361
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,360
Just don't coax me to drink.

362
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,059
You'll indulge yourself in every party.

363
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:27,679
And we have had too much to drink.

364
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,340
We're friends. We seldom gather together.

365
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,200
What do you want to eat tonight?

366
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,780
Dr. Zhan.

367
00:26:36,239 --> 00:26:38,080
Why are you here?

368
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,800

369
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,199
Mr. Luo, we're having dinner.

370
00:26:45,199 --> 00:26:47,279
Do you have anything urgent?

371
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:50,260
It's the same thing as last time.

372
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:54,619
If it's convenient for you, I want to talk to you alone.

373
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,040
How's it? We'll be waiting for you outside.

374
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,099
Go eat first, I'm not hungry anyway.

375
00:27:00,099 --> 00:27:02,619
I can go home later.

376
00:27:02,619 --> 00:27:03,620
Sure.

377
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:06,239
Okay. Then go your way.

378
00:27:06,239 --> 00:27:08,000
Let's talk on the way up.

379
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:16,400
I know you want to get back together with Dr. Zhan.

380
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:22,139
If you continue to hide your feeling from her, someone will beat you to it.

381
00:27:22,139 --> 00:27:24,720
Enough. Shut up.

382
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,250
I'm just worried.

383
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:30,379

384
00:27:30,379 --> 00:27:32,940
Tomorrow, I want to take Lele outdoors

385
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:36,820
and watch how other children live.

386
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:41,440
Maybe it can mobilize his nature as a child.

387
00:27:42,239 --> 00:27:46,759
Maybe in that environment he can try to open himself up.

388
00:27:49,199 --> 00:27:52,000
You don't need to discuss with me about what you want to do.

389
00:27:54,180 --> 00:28:00,499
You said we're partners for Lele's recovery.

390
00:28:00,499 --> 00:28:05,459
So I invite you, on behalf of Lele, to join us this weekend.

391
00:28:05,459 --> 00:28:07,639
I have work to do. I'm busy.

392
00:28:08,379 --> 00:28:10,680
That's a bit tricky.

393
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:15,030
Look. If I take care of Lele alone, I'll have my hands full.

394
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:17,939
If I ask others, I won't trust them.

395
00:28:17,939 --> 00:28:21,940
You know, Lele's in a very special period.

396
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,599
I have to find someone he trusts.

397
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:27,599
I think you're great.

398
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,259
Have you asked Sister Ruan?

399
00:28:30,259 --> 00:28:33,760
Yes. She also thinks that in order to cure Lele's illness,

400
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,600
he needs to go out to be freed from his emotions after the earthquake.

401
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,039
So how about it?

402
00:28:48,199 --> 00:28:49,900
Are you okay?

403
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,240
Thank you.

404
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:59,260
So...

405
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:01,119
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

406
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,020
We'll talk later.

407
00:29:46,999 --> 00:29:49,680
Mr. Luo, waiting for Dr. Zhan?

408
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,780
Me too.

409
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,379
Thanks.

410
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,379
Zhan Yan.

411
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:08,799
Let's get in.

412
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:21,380
Honestly, I want to attend the alumni party.

413
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,220
But I can't leave Lele alone.

414
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,820
Can you record it for me?

415
00:30:32,139 --> 00:30:33,459
Sure.

416
00:30:33,459 --> 00:30:34,780
Just go and leave it to me.

417
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:37,160
I'll tell them you're busy.

418
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,479
Thank you.

419
00:30:38,479 --> 00:30:42,219
I'm sorry. I forget to tell you so you came for nothing.

420
00:30:42,219 --> 00:30:44,359
No need to be polite.

421
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:45,799
Just go.

422
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,100
Let's go.

423
00:31:01,979 --> 00:31:03,659
Do you see that, Lele?

424
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:05,559
So many bubbles.

425
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,880
Look!  They fly away.

426
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,759
There's a big one. Look at that one, up there.

427
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:13,240
Luo Ben.

428
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,219
Is it beautiful, Lele?

429
00:31:18,339 --> 00:31:21,899
They're so nice. Right?

430
00:31:21,899 --> 00:31:24,260
Now you try it.

431
00:31:25,819 --> 00:31:29,920
Just one try. You'll love it with only one try.

432
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,380
Okay? Yes.

433
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,660
Press here.

434
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,959
Ready?

435
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:36,320
One, two, three.

436
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,880
Go.

437
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:42,600
So beautiful. Right?

438
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,900
Is it?

439
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:48,299
There're red, purple, blue, and yellow bubbles, aren't there?

440
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:50,159
- Lele.  
 - Give me a smile.

441
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,039
Look at me, Lele.

442
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,219
If you don't smile, the photo will be really bad.

443
00:31:57,219 --> 00:31:59,700
Come on. One, two, three, cheese.

444
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:00,960
And smile.

445
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,059
A bigger smile.

446
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:06,399
If you see the photo later, don't accuse me of your ugly face.

447
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,099
Come on.

448
00:32:08,099 --> 00:32:11,060
One, two, three. Cheese.

449
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,239
 You can't catch me.

450
00:32:15,239 --> 00:32:16,820
 Let's go.

451
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,880
 Run and run.

452
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,820
I have no tricks at all.

453
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:27,479
But this kid doesn't even give a smile.

454
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:29,740
It's really tiring to take care of a child.

455
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:32,899
So this is your way to make him happy.

456
00:32:32,899 --> 00:32:34,400
Yes.

457
00:32:35,419 --> 00:32:37,359
What else can you do?

458
00:32:43,659 --> 00:32:45,200
Look.

459
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:48,639
After our cooperation from the disaster area to the hospital,

460
00:32:48,639 --> 00:32:51,260
I think of us as friends.

461
00:32:52,199 --> 00:32:55,999
I think you have misunderstood me.

462
00:32:58,659 --> 00:33:02,380
It's time to find a time to change your mind about me.

463
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,800
You think too much.

464
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,179
There's no misunderstanding between us.

465
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,020
He should be hungry. Where's the food?

466
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:15,725
The change starts now.

467
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,875
How about it?

468
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,920
- You made it? 
 - Then who made it?

469
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,440
Take it.

470
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,540
Lele.

471
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:35,480
It's time to eat.

472
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,280
Let's go, Lele.

473
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,540
Let's eat some food.

474
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,179
Look at what Sister is holding.

475
00:33:47,179 --> 00:33:50,680
This is a bento made by Brother.

476
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,660
Look.

477
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,859
Cute, right?

478
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,359
What's wrong, Lele?

479
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,600
What's wrong?

480
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,240
Ben, the little bear bento you made is ugly.

481
00:34:04,199 --> 00:34:06,980
An ugly cry?

482
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,659
I miss my mother.

483
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:11,800
She always made bears for me.

484
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,699
Mom!

485
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,440
Easy, easy.

486
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,480
It's okay, Lele.

487
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,199
Don't cry.

488
00:34:25,539 --> 00:34:26,660
Mom.

489
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:29,380
Everything will be fine.

490
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,980
The contract has been signed.

491
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,980
You have a new mission.

492
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,819
With pleasure.

493
00:35:05,819 --> 00:35:08,399
Do you know Yigu VC?

494
00:35:08,399 --> 00:35:11,239
One of the top 10 investment companies.

495
00:35:16,419 --> 00:35:20,440
Our own development of Fangqin Group has encountered a bottleneck.

496
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:25,120
If you want to expand into a larger market, you must have a new capital investment.

497
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:29,880
Yigu VC is seeking an investment chance in China.

498
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:33,179
I want it to be us.

499
00:35:33,179 --> 00:35:36,579
Are you okay with the negotiation and contract?

500
00:35:36,579 --> 00:35:38,760
I will definitely give it my all.

501
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,160
There's one more thing I want to talk to you about.

502
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,019
I'm all ears.

503
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:52,360
Fangqin Group makes certain donations to public welfare undertakings every year.

504
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:57,640
I want to earmark 40% for the development of the Light Chaser Rescue Team.

505
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,440
I need your opinion.

506
00:36:05,859 --> 00:36:07,380
Chairman Fang.

507
00:36:09,819 --> 00:36:14,839
As far as I know, Light Chaser Rescue Team is a non-profit rescue team.

508
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,660
The funds are raised by the members.

509
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:20,440
They won't accept any version of monetary donation.

510
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:23,475
I see.

511
00:36:24,479 --> 00:36:27,700
Can it be changed to a different form?

512
00:36:28,439 --> 00:36:31,920
Fangqin Group set up a similar team

513
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,280
and we'll invite Light Chaser Rescue Team to offer professional training.

514
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,360
We'll provide funds and equipment.

515
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,940
How's that?

516
00:36:41,979 --> 00:36:43,060
Sure.

517
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:48,160
In this way, it not only does public welfare but also can build an emergency rescue team of its own for the enterprise.

518
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,060
Two birds with one stone.

519
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,260
Nice.

520
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:55,039
If you agree, give me a plan.

521
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:57,599
Have a good talk with Captain Qingshan.

522
00:36:58,819 --> 00:37:01,160
- Me? 
 - Yes.

523
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,620
You.

524
00:37:03,919 --> 00:37:07,660
I'm going to leave this team to you to manage.

525
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:11,300
In the future, whether it is the senior management of the company or the ordinary employees,

526
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:14,519
if they join this team, they will be your soldiers.

527
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:20,980
Chairman Fang has given me too much authority as a legal counsel, right?

528
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,440
I believe in what I see.

529
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,039
Trust is the best support.

530
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:28,799
Thank you, Chairman Fang.

531
00:37:28,799 --> 00:37:30,960
Don't mention it.

532
00:37:40,879 --> 00:37:43,720
Boys and girls, look who's coming.

533
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,239
We organized an excursion last weekend.

534
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:11,040
Pipi and a few naughty boys stirred up a hornet's nest.

535
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,600
They were stung by hornets, and Pipi broke his leg.

536
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:18,140
The teacher called 120 at once and did a simple dressing.

537
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,840
But they don't know anything about outdoor rescue.

538
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:24,080
Pipi's treatment was almost delayed.

539
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,900
Chairman Fang is establishing a rescue team. You have to take the lead.

540
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,860
You are going too far as a legal adviser.

541
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,039
Handling donation contracts and forming rescue teams.

542
00:38:38,039 --> 00:38:41,219
All are the accommodation of Party A's entrustment.

543
00:38:42,499 --> 00:38:45,560
Your soul is lost in the rescue thing.

544
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:51,160
Didn't I sell my soul for money long ago?

545
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,700
It's okay if others say that to you

546
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,739
that don't know you well.

547
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,580
The materials of Yigu VC, the more detailed, the better.

548
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,439
Send it to me ASAP.

549
00:39:03,539 --> 00:39:05,420
Can I join you in the training?

550
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:09,399
If it's a commission of Party A, it's also my work.

551
00:39:09,399 --> 00:39:11,840
I'm just a leader. I don't need training.

552
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,939
It's a change of workplace.

553
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:16,639
Don't drive too fast.

554
00:39:26,019 --> 00:39:27,580
Luo Ben.

555
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:32,100
Promoting emergency rescue knowledge is one of the most important missions

556
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,400
of our non-governmental charity organization.

557
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,719
More and more large companies are starting to set up rescue teams.

558
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:42,380
We're happy to help with the training.

559
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:46,819
We'll provide the funds and equipment the training needs.

560
00:39:46,819 --> 00:39:51,259
At the same time, we want to join you in training.

561
00:39:51,259 --> 00:39:54,519
So we can learn from each other.

562
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:56,059
I get it.

563
00:39:56,059 --> 00:40:00,739
You are trying by all means to support our training.

564
00:40:00,739 --> 00:40:02,660
It's a win-win cooperation.

565
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,439
Thank you.

566
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,530

567
00:40:18,539 --> 00:40:22,400
Children are the easiest to get choked.

568
00:40:23,479 --> 00:40:28,160
Food can be stuck in the windpipe if they are inattentive or eat while playing.

569
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:33,560
Once this happen, you can try the Heimlich Maneuver.

570
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:37,840
Using the residual gas in the lungs to form airflow to flush out foreign objects.

571
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,819
Now we'll show it to you.

572
00:40:39,819 --> 00:40:41,320
Look.

573
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:46,560
First, Start by placing the patient's feet slightly apart.

574
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,019
The rescuer stands behind the patient with a slight bow.

575
00:40:50,019 --> 00:40:51,539
Then make a fist.

576
00:40:51,539 --> 00:40:53,240
Everyone, pay attention.

577
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:59,039
The position of the fist and the tiger's mouth is slightly above the patient's navel

578
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:01,990
The other hand grabs the clenched fist.

579
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:06,280
Then quickly push back and up against the patient's abdomen.

580
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,820
Like this, look.

581
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:11,440
Back and up.  Back and up.

582
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,620
Repeat this until the patient vomits the foreign object.

583
00:41:15,319 --> 00:41:16,279
Come.

584
00:41:16,279 --> 00:41:19,259
Now, the teachers can come and practice.

585
00:41:19,259 --> 00:41:21,239
I want a try.

586
00:41:22,859 --> 00:41:25,300
Look. Make a fist with one hand. Yes

587
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:28,200
Use your right hand if you are right-handed.

588
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,699
Find the place above the navel.

589
00:41:29,699 --> 00:41:31,739
Take a try.

590
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,700
- Back and up. 
 - Yes.

591
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,100
Good, very good.

592
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,519
Thank you.

593
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:40,139
Teacher Luo, have a try.

594
00:41:43,879 --> 00:41:45,640
Make one hand a fist. This way.

595
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,979
Yes, a fist.

596
00:41:46,979 --> 00:41:50,120
Then the position of the tiger's mouth is aligned slightly above the patient's navel.

597
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,580
Hold this hand.

598
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:54,180
And back and up.

599
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:00,879
It's okay. It's a little itching.

600
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:03,200
I'll do it.

601
00:42:07,139 --> 00:42:09,639
Look. A fist.

602
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:10,760
Right.

603
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,300
Hold it very firmly.

604
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,619
And find the navel and put your fist above it.

605
00:42:14,619 --> 00:42:16,560
This hand grasps firmly.

606
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,780
And suddenly push back and up.

607
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:21,960
Good, back and up.

608
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,680
Try it.

609
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,360
And once again.

610
00:42:27,379 --> 00:42:29,560
Very good. Again?

611
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,339
Back and up.

612
00:42:32,439 --> 00:42:33,980
Excellent.

613
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:37,199
You've basically grasped the Heimlich Maneuver.

614
00:42:38,419 --> 00:42:40,900
And there's one more special thing.

615
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,660
Every patient treated by the Heimlich Maneuver

616
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:46,979
need to go to the hospital to systematically check whether the internal organs are damaged.

617
00:42:46,979 --> 00:42:50,360
Because this action has a very large impact on the internal organs of the patient.

618
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,159
I have a little question for the teachers.

619
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:57,780
What should we do if a fishbone catches in your throat?

620
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:59,719
Eat an apple.

621
00:42:59,719 --> 00:43:01,240
Drink vinegar.

622
00:43:02,019 --> 00:43:04,019
Sneeze or scratch it out.

623
00:43:04,019 --> 00:43:06,220
All wrong.

624
00:43:06,999 --> 00:43:10,540
The answer is going to the hospital at once.

625
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:24,990

626
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:34,700
♫  At first, there was no sadness in the world  ♫

627
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:41,920
♫  Until luck came and crossed the stage  ♫

628
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:50,000
♫  At first, souls were confused and wandered  ♫

629
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:56,880
♫  Until people hugged each other  ♫

630
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:04,640
♫  I've been on the road  ♫

631
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:12,900
♫  Trying to connect laughter and tears  ♫

632
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:19,840
♫  I suddenly have faith  ♫

633
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:27,440
♫  I can walk by millions of shining household lights  ♫

634
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:35,380
♫  I hope I can admire flowers in the afterglow  ♫

635
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:42,420
♫  Shed tears and hope that you are well  ♫

636
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:51,200
♫  The good times I'm pursuing belong to the light  ♫

637
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:58,880
♫  It can light up the wounds that follow  ♫

638
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,600
♫  Catching the floating stars  ♫

639
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:06,340
♫  Watching as the memories flash by  ♫

640
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:10,020
♫  Traveling through market scenes  ♫

641
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:13,780
♫  With a fiery gaze  ♫

642
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:17,600
♫  I can't fly  ♫

643
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:21,320
♫  But I can look up  ♫

644
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:28,240
♫  I'm always on the road chasing the light  ♫
