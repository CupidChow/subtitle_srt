1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,510

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,620
♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

3
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,064
♫  I put out mountain fires  ♫

4
00:00:18,064 --> 00:00:21,676
♫  and catch the sunset  ♫

5
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:28,324
♫  I leave the rhythms of life in my wake  ♫

6
00:00:28,324 --> 00:00:35,494
♫  Happiness whispers in my ears  ♫

7
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,410
♫  Chasing the passion for the future  ♫

8
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:43,346
♫  Like a dream maker  ♫

9
00:00:43,346 --> 00:00:48,180
♫  Reading the universe and stars  ♫

10
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,560
♫  My existence in the river of time  ♫

11
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,610
♫  With the body temperature of a moment  ♫

12
00:00:55,610 --> 00:01:02,210
♫  I'm trying to be the extension of light  ♫

13
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:08,910
♫  If the world grants me a frustrating opening  ♫

14
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:15,460
♫  I'll chase back time like a dark horse  ♫

15
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:22,290
♫  Even though I know the truth, I won't be afraid  ♫

16
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:28,440
♫  I won't miss the moon because of mediocrity  ♫

17
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,710
♫  I won't lose the light  ♫

18
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,960

19
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,512

20
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,636
First aid kit.

21
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:46,559
How's Yuan now?

22
00:01:46,559 --> 00:01:48,655
She has a fever.

23
00:01:48,655 --> 00:01:51,035
I knew you'd come to save us.

24
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,896
A respiratory infection.

25
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,240
Yuan, take some medicine.

26
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,579
Xiong Fei and your brother both came.

27
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:26,459
We'll definitely get you out of here. Don't worry.

28
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,880
- Sis. 
 - Zhou Mingming also came here.

29
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,096
He's with Rescue 2. If I hadn't stopped him, he would have come in, too.

30
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,960
Which one of you can dive?

31
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,551
- I can swim. 
 - This is different.

32
00:02:41,551 --> 00:02:45,580
They will teach you some basic diving skills, and take you out of here.

33
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,660
Sis, do we have to get into the water? I'm afraid of the water.

34
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,791
This is the only way.

35
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,619
Can you put this in your mouth?

36
00:03:16,619 --> 00:03:19,859
Look. Just keep breathing normally like this.

37
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,196
No, Sis. I can't catch my breath as soon as I get in the water.

38
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:30,320
We have two safety divers here to protect your safety, one in front and one in back,

39
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,499
There's also a dive guide. You'll be fine.

40
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,915
I can't learn it.

41
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:43,276
Okay, I'm good.

42
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:46,799
Ding Dingding, don't be a coward.

43
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,519
I'm going to buy you drinks as an apology after you get out of here.

44
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:53,880
Man, wait for me outside.

45
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,359
Thank you.

46
00:03:56,359 --> 00:03:57,480
I'm going first.

47
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,932
Okay.

48
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:07,939
I'm never going to get out of here.

49
00:04:07,939 --> 00:04:10,208
Don't sound so defeatist.

50
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,059
Zhou Mingming reporting. One of the trapped is coming out of the cave.

51
00:04:57,059 --> 00:05:00,419
It's target No.3. No.3 is coming out of the cave.

52
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,879
- I'm out. 
 - How's it?

53
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:04,379
It's okay. I managed.

54
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:06,100
What's going on in there?

55
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:10,059
One is learning diving skills with Zhan Yan's help.

56
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,839
And another girl has a respiratory infection.

57
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,599
She doesn't have the strength to go underwater.

58
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,880
How about Ding Dingding?

59
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,212
She's extremely nervous and afraid of going into the water.

60
00:05:22,179 --> 00:05:25,179
Director Liu, Zhan Yan and the others have found our target.

61
00:05:25,179 --> 00:05:29,359
I'll take Rescue 2 into the cave and get all three people trapped inside out.

62
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,399
Captain.

63
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,560
Mingming, get prepared.

64
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,760
Yes.

65
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,820
Qingshan, you have to come out safely with all the other ones.

66
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,519
Don't lose anyone.

67
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:43,968
Yes, I'll get the mission fulfilled.

68
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:46,779
Come on, Mingming.

69
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:49,340
Cave diving is nothing like open water diving.

70
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,900
I know, Zhan Yan taught me. If she can do it, so can I.

71
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,440
All right, follow me.

72
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,200
- Okay. 
 - Let's go.

73
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,500
It's fine.

74
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,999
Watch out.

75
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:07,739
How's it, Xiong Fei?

76
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:15,120
Hey. I suggest you give up.

77
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,800
I've lived here for over 30 years.

78
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,079
I haven't heard of any other exit from this Meiren Cave.

79
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:22,580
How do you know if you haven't searched carefully?

80
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,379
The mountain is huge. It'll take more than a month to find it.

81
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:28,880
Even if you do find it, it'll be too late.

82
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,008
We'll look for them no matter how much time it takes.

83
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,200
Dingding.

84
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:55,079
I thought I'd never see you again.

85
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:56,719
Are you an idiot?

86
00:06:56,719 --> 00:06:58,579
I'm right here with you, right?

87
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:08,395
Yan,

88
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:10,440
how's Luo Yuan getting on?

89
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,279
Her fever keeps going up, and her body is weak.

90
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:16,700
The water is too cold, and she can't get into it.

91
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,699
We can't wait much longer.

92
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:22,568
You two send Bobcat out first.

93
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:25,720
Ding Dingding, you two hang on in there.

94
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,359
I'll be waiting for you outside.

95
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,747
Zhou Mingming.

96
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,895
Dingding, let me teach you how to dive.

97
00:07:47,895 --> 00:07:49,059
I can't.

98
00:07:49,059 --> 00:07:50,920
You have to believe in yourself.

99
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,439
I can never learn it.

100
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:56,888
Then I'll stay with you until you learn it.

101
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,959
Idiot.

102
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:02,599
Do you still remember why I learned diver rescue?

103
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:05,560
Because you jumped into the river that day and made me save you.

104
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,903
Back then, you were afraid of nothing.

105
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,579
I didn't think too much that day.

106
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:14,904
No, Dingding.

107
00:08:14,904 --> 00:08:16,792
You did that for me.

108
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,740
Try to be brave one more time just for me.

109
00:08:36,079 --> 00:08:41,779
Yan, in a moment, you and Zhou Mingming leave first with Dingding.

110
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:43,435
What do you mean?

111
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,839
Luo Yuan can't get into the water.

112
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,839
I'm staying with her to find a new exit.

113
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:50,119
This is my responsibility.

114
00:08:50,119 --> 00:08:53,640
I also have my responsibility as a doctor. You guys go first.

115
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,800
This place is going to be flooded soon.

116
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,200
I have more experience than you.

117
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,420
My professionalism is second to none.

118
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:01,440
I was the one who taught you how to dive.

119
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,719
So what?

120
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,599
Yan, time is running out.

121
00:09:04,599 --> 00:09:06,640
I don't want to argue with you.

122
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,520
Luo Yuan is Luo Ben's sister, which means she's also my sister.

123
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:14,071
I'll never ever leave my family behind.

124
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:18,599
If I can't keep Luo Yuan safe, I'll be too ashamed to see Luo Ben.

125
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:19,800
Okay.

126
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,064
If you insist, we can both stay.

127
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:31,280
What you have to do now is try to relax.

128
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,500
Breathe through your mouth.

129
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,152
I'm going to take you into the water on the count of three.

130
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:44,968
Zhou.

131
00:09:44,968 --> 00:09:49,291
You and Zhou Mingming will take Ding Dingding to leave first.

132
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:02,879
Target No.4 came out of the cave.

133
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,520
Come here.

134
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,060
Okay, let's keep waiting.

135
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,060
 - This location in front. 
 - Look.

136
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,260
Director Liu.

137
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,959
 Yeah, yeah.

138
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:15,079
 Let's wait for their news.

139
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:16,959
 Okay, I'll be following this.

140
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,599
 What about the others?

141
00:10:18,599 --> 00:10:20,723
Rescue 2, attention.

142
00:10:20,723 --> 00:10:26,908
The water level will peak and the cave will be flooded in an hour.

143
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,140
 Don't give up. Keep searching.

144
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,820
 I'm still expecting to receive good news from you.

145
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,040
Roger that.

146
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,740
One hour. One hour is not enough.

147
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,572
It's a huge mountain. Can we find them?

148
00:10:40,572 --> 00:10:43,279
I'll keep searching until the last minute.

149
00:10:57,339 --> 00:11:00,379
Ding Dingding. Well, are you ready?

150
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:02,172
Don't worry, Captain.

151
00:11:02,172 --> 00:11:04,399
With me here, she's afraid of nothing.

152
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,899
Good. You'll change the cylinder halfway through.

153
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:11,680
Before that, you'll have to go through a narrow passage.

154
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,959
The divers will keep you posted.

155
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:16,259
Keep up with them.

156
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,780
Don't be scared, I'll be right behind you.

157
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,384
Okay, go ahead.

158
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:07,379
Wait.

159
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,680
There's stagnant water in Meiren Cave.

160
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,900
So there's a humidity difference between the exit and the outside, causing the fog to form.

161
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:19,008
Where the fog is heavier, there may be an exit.

162
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:48,499
Yuan, you're very brave.

163
00:12:48,499 --> 00:12:51,335
I can tell you about the real situation we're in now.

164
00:12:51,335 --> 00:12:58,120
Based on my judgment, this place will be flooded in an hour at the most.

165
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,859
In your current condition, you can't leave here by diving into the water.

166
00:13:01,859 --> 00:13:06,376
So we have to keep looking to find a new exit.

167
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,096
But none of us knows what's up ahead.

168
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,611
Are you scared?

169
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,711
Yan, equipment check.

170
00:13:35,139 --> 00:13:37,232
Wear a hard hat.

171
00:13:42,619 --> 00:13:46,800
You wait here for my signal. And watch the water level.

172
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,300
I'm going.

173
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,740
Go.

174
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:21,179
Come on.

175
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:36,339
Target No.1 came out of the cave. Target No.1 came out of the cave.

176
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:52,930

177
00:21:08,819 --> 00:21:10,799
Go. I'll help you get some rest.

178
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:11,999
Go.

179
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:16,600
Luo Ben, listen to me.

180
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,780
 Sis, my uncle, and Yuan, they are still inside the cave.

181
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:23,207
 Yuan has a fever and she can't dive.

182
00:21:23,207 --> 00:21:24,519
 You have to find ways to help them.

183
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:26,636
The cave is going to be flooded.

184
00:21:26,636 --> 00:21:29,379
They will definitely find other exits. Let's hurry up!

185
00:21:29,379 --> 00:21:31,340
Come on! Go, go.

186
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,940
Go.

187
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:06,559
There's another opening over here.

188
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,624
Yan, this way.

189
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,911
You two be careful.

190
00:23:03,459 --> 00:23:06,451
Yan, I saw a light ahead.

191
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,240
Luo Yuan.

192
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,219
Your brother's still looking for us.

193
00:24:10,219 --> 00:24:12,060
They won't give up.

194
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,331
So, we mustn't give up.

195
00:24:14,959 --> 00:24:16,940
I'm sure they'll find us.

196
00:24:17,619 --> 00:24:19,219
Watch out.

197
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,840
Yan!

198
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,080
Come over here.

199
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:37,075
Yan, how's your shoulder?

200
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:38,879
It's fine.

201
00:24:38,879 --> 00:24:41,648
 Yuan Yuan! Zhan Yan!

202
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,920
It's Luo Ben.

203
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,424
Luo Ben.

204
00:24:50,719 --> 00:24:52,272
He walked away.

205
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,307
Luo Yuan, blow your whistle.

206
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:05,020
♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

207
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,641
What's wrong?

208

♫  and catch the sunset  ♫

209
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:18,212
♫  I leave the rhythms of life in my wake  ♫

210
00:25:18,212 --> 00:25:25,260
♫  Happiness whispers in my ears  ♫

211
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,719
 Yuan Yuan! Zhan Yan!

212
00:25:31,719 --> 00:25:32,880
Luo Yuan!

213
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,039
Is that you, Yuan Yuan?

214
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:39,140
- Go. 
 - Go.

215
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:42,960
By the sound of it, the exit should be at the end of this passage.

216
00:25:45,368 --> 00:25:51,840
♫  I'm trying to be the extension of light  ♫

217
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:58,680
♫  If the world grants me a frustrating opening  ♫

220

♫  I won't lose the light  ♫

222
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:33,459
 Rescue 2 reporting. Target No.2 was found she's safe.

223
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:37,140
 And she's now with Captain Qingshan and Dr. Zhan.

224
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,700
 Great! Great!

225
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:45,280
♫  All those who are struggling will eventually be magnanimous in the end  ♫

226
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:49,799
♫  Courage will take us to fly above the waves  ♫

227
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:52,979
Let's have our attention once again on the Meiren Cave Rescue.

228
00:26:52,979 --> 00:26:58,080
After 30 hours of rescue, four travelers have been rescued.

229
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,160
This was an impossible mission.

230
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:07,380
 Today, our superhero transferred four travelers who'd been trapped for days to safety.

231
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,920
 Just because of their unselfishness, and bravery,

232
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,951
 even the impossible has become possible.

233
00:27:12,951 --> 00:27:17,920
 Next, let's interview Director Liu from Provincial Rescue Coordination and Preparedness Management Office.

234
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,640
♫  Becoming light  ♫

235
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:26,320
 It's just a miracle that they brought all four of them out safe and sound.

236
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:32,819
 Now I'm reminding all of you to not go to unexplored caves without permission

237
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:37,056
 and put your valuable lives in danger.

238
00:27:54,719 --> 00:27:56,592
How are your injuries?

239
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:58,208
I'm fine.

240
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,320
Yan, thank you.

241
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:06,099
Don't thank me. I would have done the same thing to anyone.

242
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:10,999
Can't you say something nice?

243
00:28:10,999 --> 00:28:14,699
It was just because your Light Chaser Rescue Team were not professional enough.

244
00:28:14,699 --> 00:28:17,700
You even don't have a doctor who knows how to dive.

245
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,540
All right, all right. I'll train a doctor as soon as I get back.

246
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,192
Right away.

247
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,559
You were running out of oxygen, why did you give me your oxygen tank?

248
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,600
Didn't you care about your life?

249
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,711
I was more worried about you.

250
00:28:52,711 --> 00:28:54,483
Cut it out.

251
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,284
Let... Let me do it myself.

252
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:06,660
Can you just let me do it myself? I got this.

253
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,159
Why should you care?

254
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,024
Why are you being so nice to me?

255
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:25,583
Are you coming up with evil ideas of how to prank me?

256
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,360
What does that look mean? Did I misunderstand you?

257
00:29:34,179 --> 00:29:36,699
You asked me to work at your company,

258
00:29:36,699 --> 00:29:39,115
and then you just fired me.

259
00:29:39,959 --> 00:29:42,579
You asked me to wait until you return to power, yet right after that

260
00:29:42,579 --> 00:29:45,319
you wanted me to cooperate with others.

261
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:51,759
You told me you'd definitely come to my fan meeting, I waited till the end and you didn't come.

262
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:55,099
You gave me hope and let me down over and over again.

263
00:29:55,099 --> 00:29:57,659
I can't read your mind. I don't want to keep guessing anymore.

264
00:29:59,719 --> 00:30:01,740
Zhou Mingming, in this case, I'll make it clear to you.

265
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,379
If you don't like me, could you just leave me alone?

266
00:30:04,379 --> 00:30:06,300
Don't give me hope over and over again.

267
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,579
Don't try to be nice to me.

268
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 During this cave rescue, there was one person who has a special identity.

269
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,700
 She's Zhan Yan, a member of International Medical Rescue,

270
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,900
 an expert in cave diving rescue,

271
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:56,400
 and also an attending doctor of the General Surgery Department of Linjiang Central Hospital.

272
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:05,200
We all saw Zhan Yan's bravery and calmness during the rescue.

273
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,700
As her colleagues, we should feel proud of her.

274
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,600
We've figured out what happened before.

275
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,000
It was not Zhan Yan's fault.

276
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,800
The hospital decided to reinstate Zhan Yan immediately.

277
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,400
It's all my fault.

278
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,900
I was supposed to go with you when I knew you were going traveling.

279
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,600
I forbid you two to go out alone.

280
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,900
Well, you're no different from Luo Ben now.

281
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,100
What are you...

282
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,700
 Don't blame Dingding.

283
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,300
 She's been feeling deeply sorry for that.

284
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,800
Look, she's still coughing.

285
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,100
Remember to take your medicine on time.

286
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,200
 Then prepare the medicine for me.

287
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,600
 Today, many of my colleagues came to me to show their care.

288
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,400
 They saw the news about how you rescued people

289
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,000
 and all praised you for being amazing

290
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,300
 and how lucky I am to have met you.

291
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:21,000
Good. Be careful, it's hot.

292
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,100
What am I doing here?

293
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,800
Just act like I'm not here.

294
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,400
Ignore me.

295
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,700
Let's not disturb them.

296
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,600
Okay.

297
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,000
Go back to work.

298
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,570
But you've just recovered. Don't work too hard.

299
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,000
I'm going back.

300
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,800
Come to my place tonight.

301
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,800
Got it.

302
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,000
I'll be waiting for you.

303
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,600
See you.

304
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,800
It's been a long time. Why hasn't he come?

305
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,800
Mr. Luo is here.

306
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,300
Mr. Luo is here! Mr. Luo is here!

307
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,200
Luo Ben, do you have a few minutes for an interview?

308
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,700
You rescued the trapped people at the last minute, can you tell us how you felt?

309
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,100
As a rescue hero, is there anything you want to say to us?

310
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,800
I'm not a hero.

311
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,600
I just did what I had to do.

312
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:33,000
But I can take this opportunity to say something to all the outdoor enthusiasts

313
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,500
that being adventurous is a good thing,

314
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:38,000
but don't take on more than you can handle,

315
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,600
and never gamble with your own life.

316
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,600
Thank you.

317
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,200
Please say something more.

318
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,600
Could you share with us how you felt?

319
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,300
- What was the situation like? 
 - Say something more.

320
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,800
Mr. Luo.

321
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,200
You looked so cool when you saved people from danger.

322
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,600
I saw the news about the cave rescue.

323
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,600
I just heard you talk about it a lot.

324
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,700
But now I know what rescue is really like.

325
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,100
Luo Ben, you've got another fan.

326
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:04,300
Mr. Gao, don't make fun of me.

327
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,200
Well?

328
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,400
Are you interested in doing rescues with me?

329
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,000
Me?

330
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,700
I'll pass.

331
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:16,600
But you said you'd introduce me to a girl who works in the hospital.

332
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,300
How's that going?

333
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,600
She looks so pretty.

334
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,100
What's her name?

335
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,600
Shen Ruoxi.

336
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,200
Really like how the name's catching on.

337
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,100
Both sweet and gentle.

338
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,200
Look. How classy she is.

339
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,200
When will you arrange for us to meet?

340
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,400
I'll have to ask for her opinion first.

341
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,800
You didn't show my picture to her?

342
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,500
I did.

343
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:51,500
So did she want to meet me?

344
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,900
I'm a new friend. She'll start to like me only if we see or talk to each other often.

345
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,500
You've been there. You know what I mean.

346
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,100
Luo Ben.

347
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:04,700
Luo Ben, if you have time, organize a team-building activity

348
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,700
for our law firm and the Light Chaser Rescue Team.

349
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:09,700
We need to show them what rescue means.

350
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,800
Do you know?

351
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,200
Just now, the person in charge of the Jilu Group came to me.

352
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,300
They specifically wanted you to be their legal adviser.

353
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:22,000
For all these years, Jilu Group has been committed to the outdoor goods market,

354
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,200
and it's a supplier of large outdoor equipment.

355
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,200
If they cooperate with us, our customer market will be expanded.

356
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:35,800
Luo Ben, I knew that you would never make a bad bargain.

357
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,800
Old He, you really misunderstood me this time.

358
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:44,900
I didn't join the Light Chaser Rescue Team to meet some target clients.

359
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,900
We save lives even at the cost of our own,

360
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,200
and we don't do it to make profits.

361
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,600
Luo Ben's absolutely right.

362
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,200
But I personally agree with Old He's opinion.

363
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:00,400
We should organize more exchange activities with doctors and nurses in the hospital

364
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,200
to learn the significance of rescue together.

365
00:36:05,879 --> 00:36:07,799
 The rescue team arrived at the scene and found

366
00:36:07,799 --> 00:36:10,799
 the entrance to Meiren Cave was flooded after a big rainstorm.

367
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,900
 The only exit was a hidden sinkhole.

368
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:17,200
 The terrain around the sinkhole is steep and hazardous,

369
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,200
 bringing extreme difficulties to the rescue work.

370
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:24,800
 Even so, the rescue team still carried out the rescue work in an orderly manner.

371
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:29,000
 As of press time, all the trapped people have been rescued.

372
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,400
 Once again, we appeal to the general public

373
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,900
 not to go to the undeveloped scenic spots without authorization

374
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,000
 and put your own lives at risk.

375
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,600
Aiqi, come to my office now.

376
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,000
Ding Dingding.

377
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,400
You actually experienced a cave rescue.

378
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,600
After the news report, the views of your comics have skyrocketed.

379
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:11,300
I'm here to talk with you about the renewal of your second comic.

380
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:14,800
Boss, I haven't finished the first one.

381
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,900
Don't worry about the pay.

382
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:21,200
I guess there will be a lot of publishers contacting you.

383
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,200
But you signed with us for your first comic.

384
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,000
So I hope we'll be your priority.

385
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,600
Boss, there's no rush to talk about it now.

386
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,800
Maybe Mingmei Media will want to sign me again.

387
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,600
Mingmei Media?

388
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,500
That's never going to happen.

389
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,100
Why?

390
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,200
 Don't you know it?

391
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:52,000
 One of the movies they invested in is having a problem with its release,

392
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,800
 and they're short of money to support the subsequent development of your comics.

393
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:00,200
 Otherwise, how would they introduce me to copyright your comics?

394
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,900
We can get this thing over with before this Friday.

395
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,700
- Does it work for you? 
 - Okay, it's a deal then.

396
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,100
Here.

397
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,940
- Take care. 
 - Bye.

398
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,300
Ding Dingding.

399
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Perfect timing.

400
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,900
Our CEO asked me to talk to you.

401
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,300
You like Zhou Mingming?

402
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,700
Yeah.

403
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:37,700
He told people here about us?

404
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:41,200
Do you think you're suitable for each other?

405
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,500
Pretty suitable.

406
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,800
You're quite interesting.

407
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,800
But what Mingming needs now is someone who can help him in his career.

408
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,200
In this regard, you're not the right person for him.

409
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Well, about this, can't he find a partner or an assistant?

410
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,700
That won't affect our relationship.

411
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:08,000
Secretary Li, is there anything else? If not, I should leave now.

412
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,700
I ordered him a cake. I'm afraid it'll melt.

413
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,300
See you around.

414
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,600
Due to the incident that happened to the artist, the movie is having a problem with its release.

415
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:27,700
Our solutions to this are: first, replace the problematic artist and remake the movie.

416
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:31,600
Also, I've already contacted an artist with more box office appeal.

417
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,000
He's very willing to work with us.

418
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,100
Now I'm trying to get him to sign the contract.

419
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:38,400
Second, sue the problematic artist and claim compensation.

420
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,600
We've filed a lawsuit and it's going through the legal process.

421
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,300
Please rest assured.

422
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,900
Mr. Ming is getting more like you when you were young.

423
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:46,900
Exactly.

424
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:50,100
Right, this young man is very promising.

425
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:53,100
But it will take some time for us to get all the two plans done.

426
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:57,000
We can't solve the company's cash flow shortage now.

427
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,400
The time will be a problem.

428
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,700
Everyone.

429
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:12,400
If the two plans go well, I'll get the loans we need.

430
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,900
Remember to have lunch. Don't make me feed you.

431
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,500
Mom.

432
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,300
Thank you for supporting me at the meeting.

433
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:48,000
I see you're working so hard for the company, and I'm happy to do anything.

434
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,400
Let's taste the cake.

435
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,600
Such a big cake.

436
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,000
You only want to share it with me?

437
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,900
That'll be a waste.

438
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,400
You've all worked hard these days.

439
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,400
And I'll have to depend on you to get through this crisis.

440
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,000
- Keep going! 
  - That's what we should do.

441
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,300
 - Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

442
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:11,700
Mingming, serve the cakes to everyone.

443
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,800
What've you done!

444
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
What are you doing?

445
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,400
Well, I won't serve the cake to you.

446
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,200
- You get it. 
  - Okay, okay, okay.

447
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,800
 We won't have it.

448
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,300
 Let's go. Let's go.

449
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,300
Mingming has really pissed me off.

450
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:46,290
I just praised him at the meeting, and he dropped the ball like this.

451
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,600
When will he grow up?

452
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,400
Director Ming likes to have fun, but when he gets serious,

453
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,800
he can be very decisive and resourceful.

454
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,200
Ma'am, you'll have a capable helper.

455
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,900
You're such a sweet-talker.

456
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,400
I hope you're right.

457
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,500
Did you make it clear to Ding Dingding?

458
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:13,500
I did, but she didn't seem to care.

459
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,600
Looks like this girl is not an easy target.

460
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,500
Mingming completely ignored me

461
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:23,700
and even risked his life to save her.

462
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,300
Oh, right. I'll be busy in the following days.

463
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,400
Keep a good eye on him for me.

464
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,000
Yes, ma'am.

465
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,500
Why did you give me a cake with such a pattern?

466
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,500
People in the office all saw it, you know?

467
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,800
 I'm always fair and aboveboard in my actions.

468
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,400
 Unlike you, who only knows to sneak around.

469
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,100
Who sneaks around?

470
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,400
 You won't admit it, huh?

471
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,600
I know you went to Ma Baoming.

472
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:52,200
He told me about your company's situation.

473
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,000
 Don't listen to him. He doesn't know what's going on.

474
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,800
As your girlfriend, I can't help much with your career,

475
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,600
but if you're unhappy, don't keep it from me.

476
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,700
- Do you hear me? 
 - I do.

477
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,100
 Kiss me.

478
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,300
 Kiss me, come on.

479
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:23,000

480
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,700
♫  At first, there was no sadness in the world  ♫

481
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:39,486
♫  Until luck came and crossed the stage  ♫

482
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:47,200
♫  At first, souls were confused and wandered  ♫

483
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:54,200
♫  Until people hugged each other  ♫

484
00:43:54,200 --> 00:44:02,000
♫  I've been on the road  ♫

485
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:10,100
♫  Trying to connect laughter and tears  ♫

486
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:17,400
♫  I suddenly have faith  ♫

487
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:24,700
♫  I can walk by millions of shining household lights  ♫

488
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:33,500
♫  I hope I can admire flowers in the afterglow  ♫

489
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:39,700
♫  Shed tears and hope that you are well  ♫

490
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:48,300
♫  The good times I'm pursuing belong to the light  ♫

491
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:55,900
♫  It can light up the wounds that follow  ♫

492
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:59,800
♫  Catching the floating stars  ♫

493
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:03,600
♫  Watching as the memories flash by  ♫

494
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:07,300
♫  Traveling through market scenes  ♫

495
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:11,100
♫  With a fiery gaze  ♫

496
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:14,700
♫  I can't fly  ♫

497
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:18,500
♫  But I can look up  ♫

498
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:26,500
♫  I'm always on the road chasing the light  ♫
