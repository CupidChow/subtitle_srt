(in front of the Lover Tree.)

18
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,620
(I hope you can)

19
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,990
(find them here.)

20
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:18,690
(I've rehearsed this)

21
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,630
(countless times in my heart.)

22
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,630
(Some are grand,)

23
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,710
(and some are whimsical,)

24
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,310
(but I guess)

25
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,310
(you probably also)

26
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,250
(don't care how many people)

27
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,630
(can witness this moment,)

28
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,750
(but want this day)

29
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:36,970
(to be like every other day)

30
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,510
(we've been together,)

31
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,870
(enduring and lasting.)

32
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,150
(So, my first wish)

33
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,430
(is about time.)

34
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,910
(I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.)

35
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,350
(I want my future)

36
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,350
(to start from today.)

37
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,650
(There was only Luo Yuan)

38
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,350
(in my world.)

39
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,590
(But when you showed up,)

40
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,230
(my life started to diverge.)

41
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,350
(One road leads to her,)

42
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,230
(the other leads to you.)

43
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,700
(Sometimes I just want)

44
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,470
(to run to you.)

45
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,750
(Yuan asked me
when I came back from Xishan)

46
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,010
(that if I thought about her)

47
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,510
(when I was trying to save you.)

48
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,350
(I lied.)

49
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,650
(All I could think about)

50
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,470
(was that I can't lose you)

51
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,370
(Therefore, my second wish)

52
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,510
(is about myself.)

53
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,630
(I wish I'd always)

54
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,630
(be able to protect you)

55
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,910
(and give you the courage to love me.)

56
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,150
What about your third wish?

57
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,750
Don't you have an answer?

58
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,190
I want to hear from you.

59
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,790
I got hurt,

60
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,510
but

61
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:12,970
I couldn't stop

62
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,750
thinking about you after I got hurt.

63
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,510
You were all over my mind
before I went to bed at night

64
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,950
and when I woke up in the morning.

65
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,710
Although injured,

66
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,510
I'm happy.

67
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:26,770
Every moment

68
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,630
we spend together

69
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,150
is precious.

70
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,950
I think it's necessary for me

71
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,570
to have a clearer direction

72
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,510
for my future.

73
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:37,950
So,

74
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,910
I healed my wound

75
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,710

you might need to

talk to the bank in person.

115
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,820
Mingming, why are you back so late?

116
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,590
Aiqi has been waiting for you
for a while.

117
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,590
He...

118
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:53,590
Well...

119
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,430
What's wrong with Mingming?

120
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,940
Perhaps he broke up

121
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,990
with Ding Dingding.

122
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,190
This child.

123
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,550
It's okay. Let's continue.

124
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,070
When did you take this one?

125
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,550
This was my first day at work.

126
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,710
I couldn't afford a new suit,

127
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,490
so I wore my senior's clothes

128
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,830
back in college.

129
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,590
You looked plain,

130
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,230
but your eyes were clean.

131
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,420
It's like

132
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:31,110
you lived in the silt but not imbrued.

133
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,710
Am I imbrued now?

134
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,140
Now all I can see

135
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,050
is pretentiousness,

136
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,990
pomposity,

137
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:39,830
and

138
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,470
not following the traffic rules.

139
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,660
Do you still hold a grudge?

140
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,430
I'll hold it for the rest of my life.

141
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,790
Fine, do it.

142
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,610
Just don't tell

143
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:51,650
our future children.

144
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:52,890
It will affect

145
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:53,650
my good image

146
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,130
in their mind,

147
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,770
and it's a bad example.

148
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,670
What's going on with these three girls?

149
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,990
The three of them

150
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,250
all had a crush on me

151
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,190
back in college.

152
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,070
Just keep bragging.

153
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,950
I'm not bragging.

154
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,610
You should have a little faith
in yourself.

155
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,010
You stood out

156
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:13,780
among all those girls

157
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,470
who had a crush on me.

158
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,660
Look how cute

159
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,780
you were as a kid.

160
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,790
Yeah.

161
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,780
Why did you

162
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,070
look so grumpy?

163
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,050
I was too little
and my features were close.

164
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,430
It was in middle school.

165
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,590
Wasn't I handsome?

166
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,230
You know what,

167
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,190
when we had parent-teacher conferences,

168
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,950
I didn't even know who could attend it.

169

Zhan Yan.

170
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,020
My parents would be so happy

171
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,660
if they knew

172
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,020
I'm gonna marry you.

Captain.

176
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,180
There's one thing

177
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,580
we should let you know.

178
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:16,980
What is it?

179
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,700
I proposed to Zhan Yan,

180
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,100
and she agreed to marry me.

181
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,340
Mr. Luo,

182
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,540
you just stole my daughter

183
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,900
without a sound.

184
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,300
Did you ask for my permission?

185
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,060
It's not hard to get your permission.

186
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,820
It's hard to get her to say yes.

187
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,060
Don't you know your daughter?

188
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,100
I'm happy for you two.

189
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,340
Well,

190
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,020
let's start training.

191
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,420
Don't think you can muddle through

192
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,980
just because
you're gonna be my son-in-law.

193
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,780
I know you won't go easy on me.

194
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,460
I'm prepared.

195
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,780
I'm gonna go to the welfare house.

196
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,460
Okay.

197
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,700
Go easy on him.

198
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,700
Rest assured. I won't tire him out.

199
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,220
Don't worry.

Zhan Yan!

207

Have you been a good boy lately?

208
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,380
The teacher praised me.

209
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,300
Lele

210
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,780
has been doing well lately.

211
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,780
He helped us

212

take care of the younger kids.

Everyone loves him.

214
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,820
Sorry to trouble you.

215
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,780
Lele has made such great progress

216
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,220
because of you.

with my friends.

Can you come later

221

to see us build a castle?

222
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,700
Okay.

223
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,300

224

you and Mr. Luo.

225
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,460
And you're here today.

226
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,620
In fact, I'm here today

227
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,100
to ask a favor of you.

228

Here.

229

(A Civilian Hero Zhan Qingshan)
from the earthquake in Qingshan.

231
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,420
I heard that the orphans

232
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,180
were sent to

233
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,500
welfare houses in different places.

234
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,220
You also took in some of them here.

235
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,740
I wonder if he was here.

236
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,260
It was

237
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,780
over 20 years ago.

238
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,220
It's a little hard to find out.

239
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,140
Besides, we've been

240
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,900
renovating the archive lately.

241
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,180
It's kind of inconvenient.

242
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,300
How about this,

243
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,140
I'll contact you

244

246
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,300
Yeah.

is not gonna be enough.

272

You have to treat us
to a big meal at least!

Exactly!

We are not that easy to put off!

275
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,540
As for how big the meal should be,

276
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,620
it depends on

277
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,140
how important Dr. Zhan is

278
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,340
to you.

279
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,540
Well,

280
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,900
let's find some time

281
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,420
and get the boys together.

292

wanted you to marry Zhan Yan.

I'm gonna call you Mrs. Luo from now on.

294

What did she say?

295
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:38,540
She said

296
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,060
we should hold our wedding
as early as possible.

297
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:46,940
Did the smoke choke you?

298
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,540
Did you choke on the smoke?

299
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,700
Let's get back there

300
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,460
and eat something. Come on.

301
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,660
This boy.

302
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,660
Xiong Fei is quite attentive.

303
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,300
You don't have to envy her.

304
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,460
Your future husband

305
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,980
will do better than he does.

306
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,260
Just get a room.

307
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,820
I heard it all.

308
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,020
Are you jealous?

309
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,380
I'm so jealous.

310
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,340
Give me one of those.

311
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,700
Here.

312
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,220
Put it in your mouth.

313
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,140
Take this.

314
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,060
Thank you.

315
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:16,520
Yeah.

316
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,940
Barbecue some veggies.

317
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:18,580
They love that.

318
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,660
Looking at these young people

319
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,540
feels like

320
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,980
looking at the future of
Light Chaser Rescue.

321
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,300
I'm happy to see

322
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,060
you're getting along well

323
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,980
with Yan now.

324
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,180
It wouldn't have taken this long

325
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,700
if I'd listened to you sooner.

326
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,020
Enjoy your meal!

327
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,420
Thank you, Mrs. Luo.

328
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,180
Thank you, Mrs. Luo.

329
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:48,660
Enjoy.

330
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:00,820
Yan.

331
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,340
Right, I forgot to congratulate you.

332
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,060
You and Luo Ben are finally together

333
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,220
after all that you've been through.

334
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,500
It's nice.

335
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,980
Why are you here alone?

336
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,220
Where is Zhou Mingming?

337
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:17,980
We broke up.

338
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,180
Why?

339
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,700
We were just having fun.

340
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,780
We had fun,

341
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,740
so we broke up.

342
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:33,940
Although you two

343
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,660
bicker all the time,

344
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,860
we can see

345
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,620
that you two do like each other.

346
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,020
So why?

347
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,660
I like a lot of people.

348
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,100
I don't need him.

349
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,180
His mother doesn't want us
to be together.

350
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,740
Ding Dingding.

351
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,260
You're making me look down on you.

352
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,220
My little cousin

353
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,580
is not gonna flinch

354
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,860
for such a reason.

355
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,540
Yan.

356
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,220
But I'm not

357
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,140
always invulnerable.

358
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,180
I give up this time.

359
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,660
Don't think about it.

360
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,300
Just go with the flow.

361
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,460
I trust Zhou Mingming.

362
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,180
I mean, he looks unreliable,

363
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,020
but once he makes a decision,

364
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,940
he is not gonna give up.

365
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,380
Like

366
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,460
becoming a rescue diver.

367
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,300
Go to a doctor if you need treatment.

368
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,420
Take it easy. Stop drinking.

369
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,700
He was dumped.

370
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,860
Let him drink.

371
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,700
Aren't you full of ideas?

372
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,460
Make another plan for me.

373
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,420
That's too hard.

374
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,420
I can't do it.

375
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:34,540
Figure it out yourself.

376
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,940
What am I supposed to do?

377
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:41,860
Mingming.

378
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,740
Dingding is your girlfriend.

379
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,980
I'm sure you know her better than we do.

380
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,980
If you still

381
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,780
want to be with her,

382
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,140
you have to find out

383
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,940
what she really wants,

384
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,740
instead of giving her

385
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,140
some ethereal romance.

386
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:10,980
But,

387
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,700
what does Dingding want?

388
00:20:59,200 --> 00:20:59,740
Don't move!

389
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,860
That's a big diamond ring.

390
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:06,900
Something has been dazzling my eyes

391
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,220
since this morning.

392
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,020
You and Luo Ben...

393
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,620
He proposed.

394
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,180
Congratulations, Mrs. Luo.

395
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,500
When do you have time?

396
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,300
Junchi and I would like
to celebrate your marriage.

397
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,620
Are you calling him Junchi now?

398
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,780
What's happening here?

399
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,940
What else could happen?

400
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,260
We're in love.

401
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,940
At this rate,

402
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,020
maybe I'll celebrate
your marriage first.

403
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,620
Thank you for your kind word.

404
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,220
I wonder

405
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,900
when he is gonna give me

406
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,900
a big diamond ring.

407
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,180
Don't worry, you have a boyfriend now.

408
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,020
There will be
a big diamond ring one day.

409
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:49,940
Mr. Gao.

410
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:51,460
Yes.

411
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,780
The photographer has been found?

412
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,180
Okay, I'll be right there.

413
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,900
Something came up. Change my shift.

414
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,740
I took the picture.

415
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,180
There was

416
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,860
an aftershock at that time.

417
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,260
I saw a man

418
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,220
carry the child

419
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,020
out of the rubble.

420
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,780
Hurry!

421
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,700
I need a hand!
There's someone over here!

422
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:16,700
Coming.

423
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,420
Slowly.

424
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:17,980
Be careful!

425
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,180
Give it to me.

426
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,580
Be gentle.

427
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:20,860
Hurry.

428
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,460
At first, I thought

429
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,460
he was saving his son,

430
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,220
but when he gave the kid

431
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,220
to the paramedics

432
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,940
and went to save his wife,

433
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,300
I realized

434
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,220
that he saved the child first

435
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,940
in a life-or-death situation,

436
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,260
and his wife

437
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:37,980
died in the aftershock

438
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,100
because she wasn't

439
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,220
rescued in time.

440
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,220
I was moved,

441
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,980
so I sent the picture

442
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,460
and the story behind it

443
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,220
to the newspaper office.

444
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,500
Do you have

445
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,300
other pictures of this kid?

446
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:54,780
Yes.

447
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,780
Mr. Gao told me about it,

448
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,940
and I brought them with me.

449
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,220
- Here, have a look.
- Thank you.

450
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,700
Push yourself up!

451
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,300
Push yourself up!

452
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,380
The last ten seconds!

453
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,740
Five.

454
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,020
Four.

455
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,300
Three.

456
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:43,860
Two.

457
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,100
One.

458
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,380
Time is up.

459
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,220
Don't stop immediately. Do it slowly.

460
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,780
Slowly.

461
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,860
How are you feeling?

462
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,940
Thanks to Captain,

463
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,780
I feel like

464
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,260
this leg is mine again.

465
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,900
Thank you, Captain.

466
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,100
You're welcome.

467
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,780
That's because you kept it up.

468
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,900
I'm gonna take a shower.

469
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:15,860
You guys talk.

470
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:16,660
Okay.

471
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:20,940
Rehabilitation training

472
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,460
(Light Chaser Rescue)
is painful.

473
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,140
Most people can't make it.

474
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,500
I'm surprised

475
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,980
he's been able to keep it up.

476
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,300
That's why

477
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,180
he is making great progress.

478
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,180
He is a proud man.

479
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,500
He would go all out

480
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,860
for his leg.

481
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,500
The kid...

482
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,980
Did you find something about the kid?

483
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,700
I knew it.

484
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,220
It was many years ago.

485
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,860
It won't be that easy to find him.

486
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,660
If we find him,

487
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,460
are you gonna tell him everything?

488
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:08,740
Yes.

489
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,020
What if he won't forgive you?

490
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,540
After what I

491
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,020
did to him,

492
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,220
I can't ask him to forgive me.

493
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,260
But why would we

494
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,020
interrupt his life again?

495
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:32,540
Why would we

496
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,260
hurt him again?

497
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,300
Maybe not knowing the truth

498
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:40,020
is best for him.

499
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,180
Yan.

500
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,260
If I wasn't

501
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:44,940
made into

502
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,700
a hero who saved his life,

503
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,180
I shouldn't

504
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,540
reopen the old wound.

505
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,500
But the press

506
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,100
put me in that position.

507
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,020
He would think of me as a hero

508
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,420
and be grateful to me

509
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,660
after he saw the report.

510
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,500
He would see me as his lifesaver,

511
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,420
but the truth is I'm a sinner.

512
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,940
I can't keep it from him

513
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,540
after I hurt him.

514
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,260
Besides, he has the right

515
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,420
to know the truth.

516
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:15,940
I see.

517
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,740
Zhan Yan, I'm coming in.

518
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:48,940
What are you looking at?

519
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,020
I just took a look around.

520
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,020
Well,

521
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,220
did you find anything

522
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,460
about the kid today?

523
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,540
It's okay.

524
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,300
Your father's been
looking for him for so long

525
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,620
and still has no clue.

526
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,540
You don't have to be in such a hurry.

527
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:05,620
I know.

528
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,020
Captain has been

529
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,780
helping me with
the rehab training these days.

530
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,380
I think it's working really well.

531
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,500
I'll look for him with you

532
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,220
after my leg heals.

533
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,740
You said

534
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,020
there's no rush.

535
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,740
Just focus on your things.

536
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,020
I'll take my time looking for him.

537
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:20,940
Okay.

538
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,620
You've had a long day.

539
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,940
Go take a shower.

540
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,460
I'll be out.

541
00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:00,260
(Binjiang Heart&Heart Welfare House)

542
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,700
Zhan Yan, I'm coming in.

543
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,220
Here, have a glass of milk.

544
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,460
Thank you.

545
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:16,740
Let me see.

546
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,420
Heart&Heart.

547
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,420
I told you last time.

548
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,260
I was transferred

549
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,180
to this welfare house

550
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,620
after the Earthquake in Qingsen.

551
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,460
Maybe the boy

552
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,940
you're looking for it

553
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:34,980
was also transferred

554
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:35,940
to this welfare house.

555
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:36,940
It's impossible.

556
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,100
I checked it there.

557
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:41,980
That's why

558
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,700
(Binjiang Heart&Heart Welfare House)
I crossed it off.

559
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,540
All right.

560
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,900
Speaking of that,

561
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,180
I haven't seen Lele

562
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,540
for a while.

563
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:53,700
Well, you were supposed

564
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,260
to wait for my leg to heal

565
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,740
and then we could go together.

566
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,540
Your leg isn't healed.

567
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,780
I don't want to put you
to too much trouble.

568
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,260
I went to see Lele.

569
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,500
Everything is fine.

570
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,740
Don't worry.

571
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:11,460
All right.

572
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,940
After my leg heals,

573
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,940
we'll have a lot

574
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,020
to do together.

575
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:20,940
Alright.

576
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,420
I'll take care of

577
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,420
the rest. Go to sleep.

578
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,460
Drink it.

579
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,140
There were meetings all morning.

580
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,780
Don't you need a break?

581
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,740
Notify all department heads.

582
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,700
We'll continue to discuss the plan

583
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,300
in the conference room in ten minutes.

584
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:15,660
Okay.

585
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,700
I've thought it through.

586
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:07,940
Even if Mingming and I

587
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,180
choose to be together,

588
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,180
no matter how much we love each other,

589
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:12,500
we can't stand his mother

590
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,860
stirring things up behind our back.

591
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,460
Though my parents

592
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,260
sound like they despise me,

593
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,460
I know

594
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,260
they are loving me

595
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,940
in their own way.

596
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,460
Even if I'm fine with

597
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,700
what Zhou Mingming's mom did,

598
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,700
I can't let my parents

599
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,180
suffer indignities.

600
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,540
Don't be so categorical.

601
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,220
You and Zhou Mingming

602
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:38,700
are not at the point

603
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,300
where you can't work things out.

604
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,940
Unlike some people who have things

605
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,500
that they can't fix

606
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,500
no matter how hard they try.

607
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,940
If you give up now,

608
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,300
you will regret it.

609
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,940
There will be regrets,

610
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,540
but some regrets

611
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,180
can't be helped.

612
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,180
Yeah, it can't be helped.

No.

If you care about her so much,

624
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,140
why don't you go to see her?

625
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:51,820
We broke up.

626
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:03,820
Well,

627
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:06,540
I've seen you and Dingding

628
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:07,900
have come a long way.

629
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:09,780

630
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,380
from the first time

631
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,540
you asked me to sign her

632
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,220
that she must have

633
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,060
a different place in your heart.

634
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,780
We grew up together.

635

care so much about a girl.

637
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,980
It's rare to have

638
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,340
such a relationship.

639
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,260

640
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,300

with my mom and your family

648

but I've made my mind up.

650

Will you marry me?

659

I'm not gonna go crazy with you
in the morning.

660
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,420
I'm serious.

661
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,260
As long as you say yes,

662
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,500
we'll go get
the marriage license right now.

Dingding.

664
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:45,780
You've been the one

665
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,060
walking towards me

666
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,620
under pressure.

667
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:52,980
From now on,

668
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,380
I want to protect you.

669
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,340
Okay?

670
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,740
Silly.

671
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,300
Mom, look.

672
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:20,860
We got the marriage license.

673
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,500
We got the marriage license.

Don't squeal.

675
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,540
Mom!

676
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:34,820
Have you been waiting long?

677
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:35,500
Dingding.

678
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:36,860
Did you get the household register?

679
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:39,260
Let's go.

680
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,580
Hold on, Mingming.

681
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:48,700
What's the matter?

682
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,660
I think

683
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,060
we shouldn't do it today.

684
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:58,860
Dingding, you promised me.

685
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,340
You can't back out now.

686
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,380
Calm down.

687
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,660
Hear me out.

688
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:04,260
I also can't wait

689
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:06,380
to get the marriage license,

690
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:08,580
but what are you gonna tell your mom

691
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,500
if we do?

692
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,580
How am I supposed to face her?

693
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,380
Are we never gonna

694
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:16,140
see each other again?

695
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:16,780
Dingding.

696
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,140
Don't worry.

697
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:19,620
I'll take care of the rest.

698
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,380
I won't let anyone hurt you again.

699
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,820
That's not what I meant.

700
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,260
I trust you.

701
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,500
I just don't want to drive a wedge

702
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,660
in your relationship with your mom.

703
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:30,820
Trust me.

704
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:33,020
I know how to get her to accept me.

705
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,020
I would like to have

706
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,020
my future mother-in-law's blessing.

707
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,620
Well, you don't believe me?

708
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,260
I do.

709
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:47,500
Dingding.

710
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:49,860
You're so good.

711
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,540
Of course I'm good.

712
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:01,700
I went to

713
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:03,980
the rest of the welfare houses

714
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,180
on the list in the last two days.

715
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,260
There is no sign of that kid.

716
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:09,660
It's okay.

717
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,420
But your leg

718
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,020
is basically healed.

719
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,820
You should get back to the firm.

720
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:17,900
Yeah.

721
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,380
I should probably get back.

722
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,500
Then go ahead and do your things.

723
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,620
Don't let it keep you from your work.

724
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:29,660
You know,

725
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:33,180
going to the welfare houses

726
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:35,220
reminds me of old times.

727
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:37,740
Although the teachers
at the welfare house

728
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,100
were good to me,

729
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,580
sometimes

730
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,860
I still felt lonely.

731
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:44,580
Fortunately,

732
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,500
I met my foster parents.

733
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,060
They gave me

734
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,020
a happy family.

735
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,300
Haven't you been

736
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,860
taking care of Luo Yuan for them?

737
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:59,060
That's why Luo Yuan
is living a happy life.

738
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,420
But Luo Yuan can't speak

739
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,980
also because of me.

740
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,980
We can't always live in the past.

741
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,060
Yuan won't blame you.

742
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:18,060
But the scars of the past

743
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,020
can never

744
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,740
be eliminated.

745
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,780
You didn't do it on purpose.

746
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:30,500
But I can't

747
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:32,060
forgive myself.

748
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,700
Xiong Fei was in prison before,

749
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:42,180
but Luo Yuan doesn't mind.

750
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:45,900
By the way,

751
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,580
when did she find that out?

752
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,500
Xiong Fei confessed

753
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,660
before they got into a relationship.

754
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:54,820
If Xiong Fei had chosen
to keep it from her,

755
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:55,820
I wouldn't have allowed them

756
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:56,780
to be together,

757
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,260
let alone get married.

758
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:09,260
After all, it takes courage

759
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,140
to confess one's past.

760
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:15,300
If two people want to live together,

761
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:17,780
honesty is the most basic requirement

762
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:21,220
and the utmost respect for each other.

763
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:30,780
