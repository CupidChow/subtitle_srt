1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,050

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,800
♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,120
♫  I put out mountain fires  ♫

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,150
♫  and catch the sunset  ♫

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,450
♫  I leave the rhythms of life in my wake  ♫

6
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:35,720
♫  Happiness whispers in my ears  ♫

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,370
♫  Chasing the passion for the future  ♫

8
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:43,520
♫  Like a dream maker  ♫

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,470
♫  Reading the universe and stars  ♫

10
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,620
♫  My existence in the river of time  ♫

11
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,670
♫  With the body temperature of a moment  ♫

12
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:02,070
♫  I'm trying to be the extension of light  ♫

13
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:08,850
♫  If the world grants me a frustrating opening  ♫

14
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:15,520
♫  I'll chase back time like a dark horse  ♫

15
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:22,150
♫  Even though I know the truth, I won't be afraid  ♫

16
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:28,400
 I won't miss the moon because of mediocrity  ♫

17
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,770
♫  I won't lose the light  ♫

18
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:36,020

19
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,339

20
00:01:39,339 --> 00:01:41,259
When I first came to our team,

21
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:45,819
I once got an emergency call as I was on duty in the office.

22
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:50,680
It said that an old lady fell into a sinkhole at their front door.

23
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,560
I couldn't help but wonder what was going on?

24
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,439
Why would someone live by a sinkhole?

25
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,899
Exactly.

26
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:02,939
- As I got there, guess what? 
 - What?

27
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:04,979
They are a family of mountain rangers.

28
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:08,760
They live in the mountain, next to a sinkhole.

29
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,620
That day, they had a fight.

30
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,520
The old lady went out in anger

31
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,999
and fell into the sinkhole.

32
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,619
I have a question.

33
00:02:18,619 --> 00:02:22,059
It's about our team members.

34
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:25,480
Why do some of us have nicknames but others don't?

35
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,120
 I'm wondering about that, too.

36
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,459
That's a good question.

37
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:32,460
Well.

38
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,840
That's a long story.

39
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,220
It originates from the first day of our team.

40
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:43,900
At the very beginning, the first team members got acquainted on an internet forum.

41
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,440
They referred to each other by their screen names.

42
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,260
As time passed by, they met in real life and assembled.

43
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,440
They got used to the screen names, so they kept this tradition.

44
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,559
But things are different for the later members.

45
00:02:57,559 --> 00:02:59,340
Some use their real names.

46
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,999
Some with screen names.

47
00:03:00,999 --> 00:03:02,539
Others have nicknames.

48
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:05,580
Anyway, it's very casual.

49
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,519
What about Sister Ruan?

50
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:10,719
She's a senior, isn't she?

51
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:13,400
That question is even better!

52
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,560
Sister Ruan is very honest.

53
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,200
She uses her real name on the internet.

54
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,819
- I see! 
 - What's the topic? Sounds fun.

55
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:25,659
We're done talking, you're late.

56
00:03:25,659 --> 00:03:26,760
There you are.

57
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,219
By the way, Xiong Fei, I don't have your Wechat account.

58
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:31,420
- Do you mind? 
 - Come on.

59
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,259
Do we all have no WeChat for each other?

60
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:36,100
Well, let's do it now.

61
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,879
- I'll scan your QR code. 
 - Sure. All right.

62
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,799
No one wants my account, really?

63
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:42,179
We do! We do!

64
00:03:42,179 --> 00:03:44,780
I'll scan your code.

65
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,520
Drinking on your own.

66
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,939
Here.

67
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,879
Black tea.

68
00:03:57,259 --> 00:03:58,559
How's the jacket?

69
00:03:58,559 --> 00:04:00,279
Is it good?

70
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:01,939
Not bad.

71
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:03,839
Yan sent it to me.

72
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,219
Looks great. Handsome.

73
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:10,140
And it fits.

74
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:13,499
You look unhappy. Are you jealous?

75
00:04:13,499 --> 00:04:16,100
- Me? How come? 
 - Yes, you are.

76
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,880
No way! It fits you well.

77
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,220
All right. I'm kidding.

78
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,040
This one is yours.

79
00:04:25,059 --> 00:04:27,740
It's the same style but in a different size.

80
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,299
It must be yours.

81
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,860
There's more. A bag full of snacks.

82
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,759
I don't like them.

83
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,360
I'm sure she bought them for you.

84
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,979
There you go.

85
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,979
Did Yan buy me this?

86
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:48,040
Why would I lie to you?

87
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:52,779
Are you happy now? Yes, you are!

88
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,740
I have to give you a lecture.

89
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,539
The kid cares about you.

90
00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:07,639
As her father, you should be tolerant and more active.

91
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:09,040
You should get along with her.

92
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,940
Time flies! So is our life.

93
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,820
We don't have time to waste.

94
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,080
I get it.

95
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,180
By the way, I'll head to the civil affairs bureau tomorrow for a meeting.

96
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,919
Pay more attention to the newcomers' assessment.

97
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,240
Were you listening? What did I just say?

98
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,339
Do you have to leave when Yan's here?

99
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:37,299
I have no choice. That's my obligation.

100
00:05:37,299 --> 00:05:40,580
Besides, she doesn't want to see me.

101
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:43,159
Don't make it hard for her.

102
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:46,199
You didn't mean what you said.

103
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,759
Same goes for her.

104
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,040
I'm tired of it.

105
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:51,539
Dr. Zhan.

106
00:06:54,099 --> 00:06:57,700
Now that you see me, shouldn't we greet each other?

107
00:06:58,499 --> 00:07:01,079
It's so late, Lawyer Luo is working hard.

108
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:03,319
Do you want to join the team?

109
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:11,099
I know. Your time is valuable.

110
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,820
Never mind.

111
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:20,719
I'm used to the way you speak.

112
00:07:20,719 --> 00:07:22,080
Did I get it wrong?

113
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,600
Why are you practicing now if you don't want to join us?

114
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,820
Whether you do it or not, just do it well.

115
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,659
Well.

116
00:07:33,459 --> 00:07:37,220
To be honest, I'm doing this partly for my job.

117
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,979
I have a negotiation next that will involve some rescue content.

118
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:43,319
All right, fine.

119
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:45,160
I'm doing this because it's a volunteer rescue.

120
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,260
I didn't ask.

121
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:56,040
Not only the newcomers, but I was impressed.

122
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,720
Good for you.

123
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,319
You are talking like a captain.

124
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,260
Did you see it? Captain Qingshan was nearby.

125
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,039
He didn't say a word.

126
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,940
That means you're good.

127
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,060
The training is exhausting.

128
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:13,159
Those who stay get what it takes.

129
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:17,720
Obnoxious as Luo Ben is, he finally shows us some respect.

130
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,079
Don't make it personal.

131
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:21,920
Not at all.

132
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,060
Are you serious?

133
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,480
I didn't!

134
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,530

135
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:32,499
 Did you see my brother?

136
00:08:32,499 --> 00:08:35,700
 He said he was taking in your rescue training.

137
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,979
 I couldn't believe it.

138
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:41,280
 He's working hard. He's one of a kind.

139
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,260
Who is it?

140
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:00,880
Is it your date?

141
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,460
 You bet! My brother is great!

142
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,980
 But he has a bad temper.

143
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,840
 Don't mind him if he offends you.

144
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:20,560
 Not at all! He's doing great here.

145
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:37,039
We will do compression over the center of the person's chest, between the nipples.

146
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:40,539
The rate should be 100 to 120 per minute.

147
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:44,220
Place the heel of your hand over the lower sternum

148
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,259
with your other hand on top, lock your fingers.

149
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:49,960
Your elbows should be locked. Your arms are vertical to the ground.

150
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,600
The general compression-ventilation ratio is 30 to 2.

151
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,070
Beauty.

152
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,560
On the training ground, refer to me as Coach or Dr. Zhan. What is it?

153
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,910
Dr. Zhan, this plastic model looks unprofessional.

154
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,400
What's your suggestion?

155
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,740
Well, I volunteer to be the model.

156
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,270
Dr. Zhan can demonstrate the technique.

157
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,450
What's so funny?

158
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,920
Don't you know?

159
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,030
CPR includes chest compression and breathing.

160
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,550
He's taking advantage of my sister.

161
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,740
Exactly. Shameless.

162
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:27,150
No offense if it's embarrassing for you.

163
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,430
You may not know it.

164
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:34,460
It's strictly forbidden to demonstrate CPR on a living person.

165
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,070
What about rescue breath?

166
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,360
Is it funny? You could spend your time on skills.

167
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,250
Emergency rescue is a highly serious matter.

168
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,670
- Chen Xing. 
 - Yes!

169
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,090
Fall out.

170
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,660
Demonstrate the CPR procedure I just showed you.

171
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,870
- But... 
 - Go. She called your name.

172
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,540
Demonstrate?

173
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,990
That's murder. See?

174
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:10,570
Breathing two times.

175
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,690
For real?

176
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:35,180
Field training. Instant noodles again!

177
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,790
The food is so poor.

178
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:40,190
Would you like some beef?

179
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,120
I like instant noodles.

180
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,740
Yeah, you eat out every day.

181
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,540
You only eat this occasionally.

182
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,480
I've been having it for two weeks.

183
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,610
Well, do we have to eat this for every meal?

184
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:53,840
Hard to say.

185
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,700
I heard that at the scene, they don't even have this.

186
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,150
All they have is bread, without water.

187
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,350
Seriously?

188
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,300
Didn't you see the news about the Fengxi disaster area?

189
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,670
It was rough.

190
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:05,170
While there, in the living area, we get to sleep in tents.

191
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:08,760
The armed police, firefighters, and rescue team sleep on the ground.

192
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,510
If it was raining, they'd sleep just like that.

193
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,620
That's true.

194
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,790
I was there at Fengxi. I saw it myself.

195
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,100
I was there, too.

196
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,970
What were you doing there?

197
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,970
He was there to parade his ability.

198
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,640
And she was there to interfere with the rescue.

199
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,490
You two are a match.

200
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,770
Who's that?

201
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,430

202
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,580
Yuan Yuan!

203
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:39,450
What brings you here?

204
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,160
You're my angel!

205
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,070
I was talking about the poor food. And you show up with snacks!

206
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,630
Let me see. Chicken wings!

207
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:50,270
Hello, beauty. I'm Zhou Mingming.

208
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,370
Don't you touch her!

209
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,870
Allow me to introduce her.

210
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,640
This is Luo Yuan, my close friend.

211
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,320
She's brought you some food. Pass it on.

212
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,640
- Thank you so much! 
 - Thanks.

213
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,100
- Give me some. 
 - We owe it to her.

214
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,500
Yuan!

215
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,650
You've grown up.

216
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,550
Glad to see you caring for others.

217
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:28,620
Among all types of disasters,

218
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:33,150
fire hazard is one of the most common secondary disasters.

219
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:38,450
As the accessorized power of national emergency rescue,

220
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:42,430
we must be prepared to cooperate with firefighters.

221
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,230
Why did you assign him to me?

222
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,990
You're afraid you won't be able to handle him?

223
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,920
I'm afraid I can't hold the fury.

224
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,250
Try to work with him.

225
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,670
- It solves your prejudice. 
  - Evacuate the crowd.

226
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,190
You will be divided into four groups.

227
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,520
Follow your leader and finish your mission.

228
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,210
Be careful.

229
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,140
If you are injured,

230
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:09,070
Dr. Zhan and the medical team will treat it in time.

231
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,220
Do we have a problem?

232
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,790
 No, sir!

233
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:16,940
There is a gas explosion in a Chinese restaurant on the second floor of the Youyi Hotel.

234
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,210
The fire is severe.

235
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:20,070
Six people are tapped.

236
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:22,450
51 people are in dire need of evacuation.

237
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:26,850
All the people participating in the exercise are from a professional rescue crew.

238
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:30,820
We must evacuate them and save the trapped ones in 15 minutes.

239
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,710
Remember. You only have 15 minutes.

240
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:37,630
If you stay inside longer, there could be a secondary explosion.

241
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,760
Are we clear?

242
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,320
 Yes, sir.

243
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:44,890
It's 9:40 right now.

244
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:48,250
Southeast wind, gentle breeze. The relative humidity is 62 percent.

245
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,760
Stick to the plan and move out.

246
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,280
 Yes, sir.

247
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:54,160
Don't mess with me later.

248
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,990
Just don't get in my way.

249
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,170
Group one, ready.

250
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:13,510
 Group two, ready.

251
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,840
 Group three, ready.

252
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,320
Copy.

253
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:23,410
Spread out and rescue the people.

254
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,080
This way, hurry up.

255
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,590
Quickly.

256
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,300
This way.

257
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,090
Chen Xing. Wang Yu.

258
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:57,080
You will take notes of the time, site, and participants.

259
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,640
 Yes, sir.

260
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,210
Zhou Mingming. Ding Dingding. Get ready to reinforce.

261
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,220
Reinforce.

262
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,000
Finally, it's my turn.

263
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,950
 There is a second explosion in the pastry room on the second floor.

264
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,420
 The fire has spread to the apartment.

265
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,870
 There is fire on the third and the fourth floors.

266
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,970
At 9:46, there's a second explosion.

267
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,790
The apartment is on fire.

268
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,300
It should be 15 minutes later.

269
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,740
A real disaster never has a script.

270
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:24,490
This is the real deal. You must be prepared for any emergency.

271
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,570
Do you hear that?

272
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:28,570
The real rescue team must be calm in the face of danger, just learn.

273
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,220
 Captain, a member from Group One

274
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,310
 is stuck on the fourth floor due to the abrupt fire.

275
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,100
 We need reinforcements.

276
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,820
Copy.

277
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,800
This is your mission, group four.

278
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,030
- Move out. 
 - Yes, sir.

279
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,740
Hurry.

280
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,880
Back up. Careful.

281
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,460
Help.

282
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:11,630
Hurry up.

283
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,490
- Move, move! 
 - Hurry!

284
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:24,590
It's empty.

285
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:30,050
 Group two has evacuated from the apartment with 35 people.

286
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,710
Hurry, watch your step.

287
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,830
Quickly!

288
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,180
 Help us.

289
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,410
 Help us!

290
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,540
 Help us.

291
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,890
 My leg is stuck.

292
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,390
Attention.

293
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:36,000
Three-minute countdown.

294
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,360
The fire is spreading.

295
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,680
All units in the building, please evacuate.

296
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,650
Hurry!

297
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,640
Zhou Mingming!

298
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,390
Dingding, leave now. I'll find my way out.

299
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:26,050
Be careful.

300
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,750
I'm trapped on the third floor. Need backup.

301
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,260
There's a rope outside Room 304.

302
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,850
Take that.

303
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,230
All units, evacuate now.

304
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,980
 Zhou Mingming, use the rope.

305
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,900
 That's your only exit.

306
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,100
That's too authentic, Xiong Fei.

307
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,030
Pretend that the fire is extinguished. Let me take the stairs.

308
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:13,110
Hold onto the rope. Take security measures.

309
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,550
One-minute countdown.

310
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,650
Steady.

311
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:55,050
- Careful! 
 - Slowly!

312
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,610
Mingming.

313
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,590
 Be careful! 
 - Be careful!

314
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:15,430
 Slowly, Mingming.

315
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,960
 Watch out!

316
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,190
30 seconds.

317
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:33,900
Are you all right?

318
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,400
How is it?

319
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,880
- Are you okay? 
 - Not bad!

320
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,990
- Impressive! 
 - Good for you!

321
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:46,510
Luo Ben is still in Room 506.

322
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:57,420
Group one, Peng! Your teammate Luo Ben is still in Room 506.

323
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:59,960
Hurry! Hurry up!

324
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,230
Watch your step!

325
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:04,710
 Luo Ben, come in!

326
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,960
Luo Ben, I command you to exit now!

327
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,430
Ten.

328
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:30,220
- Nine. 
 - Help!

329
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:33,350
Eight.

330
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,100
Seven.

331
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,090
Six.

332
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:47,290
- Five. 
 - Help!

333
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,380
Four.

334
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,190
Three.

335
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,130
Two.

336
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,340
One.

337
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,460
Time's up.

338
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,130
Luo Ben, KIA.

339
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,600
I can't stand it!

340
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,870
It's either him or me! That's it!

341
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:20,010
- Peng, calm down. 
 - Calm down.

342
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:22,350
- Take it easy. 
 - Move!

343
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,320
Why didn't you carry out the order?

344
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,280
I told you, don't save others unless you're safe!

345
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,190
If we were in a fire, you'd be dead by now.

346
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:35,060
Southeast wind, gentle breeze.

347
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,130
The relative humidity is 62 percent.

348
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:40,110
Firefighters have put out the perimeter fire.

349
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:43,070
The chance for a second explosion in the pastry room is low.

350
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:47,380
Even if it occurs, I'd have several minutes to save their lives.

351
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,520
But that's your hypothesis.

352
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,420
It doesn't work in real life!

353
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,070
Do you understand?

354
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:56,740
Thanks to your disobedience, your group got zero points in this evaluation!

355
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:59,850
- What is this about? To earn points or to save lives? 
 - To live!

356
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:01,290
To live?

357
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:05,070
You told us that we're rescuing them with our lives.

358
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:07,000
I'm willing to save them at the cost of my life.

359
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,460
- Luo Ben. 
 - Enough! That's enough!

360
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,610
There are many possibilities.

361
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:15,560
Luo Ben did it for a reason.

362
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,230
If he doesn't listen to the order,

363
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,550
I don't think it's necessary...

364
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:27,280
for him to take the following exercises.

365
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,990
He's yours.

366
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:29,420
Don't worry.

367
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:33,960
I know how to deal with obnoxious boys like him.

368
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:40,430
You give out the word yourself!

369
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:41,760
You are concerned about him.

370
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,420
I'm just doing my job.

371
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,030
Yeah, right.

372
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,840
The flask.

373
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,680
I told you to drink less.

374
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,550
We're on a mission.

375
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:55,760
Fine, I'll quit.

376
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:15,350
Boy! Head out with me.

377
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,220
What for?

378
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,760
I need your care. Pick up some gear.

379
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:22,790
But I've quit. Find someone else.

380
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:25,070
No one approves of your quitting.

381
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,790
Get in. Let's go.

382
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:41,990
Where is the gear from?

383
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:46,050
Some are provided by Ministry of Emergency Management.

384
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:47,740
Some are sponsored by companies.

385
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,100
Some are bought by our members.

386
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:54,030
Over years of accumulation, they've become our treasures.

387
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,590
Boy,

388
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:01,770
could you tell me why you insisted on saving those people?

389
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:06,610
I'd prefer not to answer that question.

390
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,400
Sure!

391
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,300
Everyone has his secrets.

392
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,160
Are you drinking?

393
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,990
This is the panacea.

394
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,670
Didn't expect you to be humorous.

395
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:29,170
My life used to be miserable.

396
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:32,850
Just seize the day and enjoy the rest of my life.

397
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:40,500
Boy, pull over here.

398
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:42,720
What's up?

399
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,560
I'd prefer not to answer that question.

400
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,580
That's my secret.

401
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:00,040
 Fine. Yeah, sure.

402
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,410
 Let's talk when I get back.

403
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:03,750
 Over here.

404
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,430
 Got to go.

405
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,410
- Dr. Zhan. 
 - Director Zhu, how is he?

406
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:10,930
- Is he your friend? 
 - He's my uncle.

407
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,210
It doesn't look good. Take a look.

408
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,270
 Wait here. We'll see the doctor soon.

409
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,420
 I just talked to the doctor.

410
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,330
 He said it was fine.

411
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,780
You're awake.

412
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,300
Where is the gear?

413
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,290
What?

414
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:59,290
The gear in your car.

415
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:03,260
Is that what you are thinking about?

416
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,330
They're in my car. Still there.

417
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:08,390
You passed out. That's what is important.

418
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:11,710
I'll contact other team members to fetch the gear.

419
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:16,660
Did you tell others that I'm here?

420
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,840
Didn't get to tell them.

421
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,080
After you passed out, I called Zhan Yan. That's all.

422
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,500
Is there someone you want to inform?

423
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,310
Okay.

424
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:26,720
No. No need for that.

425
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,520
I'm fine.

426
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,640
I didn't sleep well.

427
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,850
That's why I fainted.

428
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,300
All right, I should go.

429
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,400
- The team is waiting for me. 
 - Slow down.

430
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,140
Where are you heading?

431
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:43,390
- Lie down. 
 - To the bathroom.

432
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:45,220
Lie down.

433
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,310
Lie in bed.

434
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:48,420
Come on.

435
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,180
I'm all right.

436
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,570
I am speaking as a doctor.

437
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:55,420
I'm here to inform you, we will do the operation on you tomorrow.

438
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:58,160
It's not a big deal. That's not necessary.

439
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,720
Don't bother. I know about my condition.

440
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,050
You know it!

441
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:06,620
How can you be involved in rescue like this?

442
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,890
It's just angioma.

443
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:14,010
- What? 
 - I took the examination. It's benign.

444
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:16,860
That doesn't mean it's safe.

445
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:22,020
May I skip the surgery? I'll be careful.

446
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,130
No.

447
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:25,620
You'd better listen to Dr. Zhan.

448
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,200
The team needs me.

449
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,300
If you insist, I'll have to talk to the captain.

450
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,770
Please don't. Don't do that.

451
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:34,350
Never tell him about this.

452
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:37,360
How about... I have a condition.

453
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,720
As long as you don't tell the captain or other team members,

454
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,300
I will do the surgery.

455
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,410
Otherwise, I'd rather die.

456
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,990
I'll arrange your examinations.

457
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:04,720
Did you already know you were sick?

458
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:17,870
That's why you filled this flask with water all the time.

459
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,000
That's my treasure. I can't live without it.

460
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,500
Keep it a secret for me.

461
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,800
Don't you tell them about my surgery.

462
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:36,200
If anyone asks about me, tell them I'm tired, taking a day off.

463
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,800
I'll come back soon.

464
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,800
Just lie in bed.

465
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:43,000
You can count on me. I'm a lawyer.

466
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
All right, you are dismissed.

467
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,200
There are doctors and nurses around.

468
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,700
I don't need you here.

469
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,600
You've got an evaluation tomorrow.

470
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,200
What's wrong?

471
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,300
Are you afraid?

472
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:05,100
I don't know if it means anything to take the evaluation.

473
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,300
That doesn't sound like Mr. Luo. Why?

474
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,000
If you quit now, they'd think you're a coward.

475
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,600
Don't provoke me.

476
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,900
Just lie down. I'll get you registered.

477
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,000
How is it?

478
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,100
Is Falcon in a bad condition?

479
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,800
It is a benign angioma.

480
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,800
But the location makes it dangerous.

481
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,600
And the size is quite large. We can't cut it off.

482
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,500
We can only do conservative therapy and ligate it.

483
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:02,400
It might burst if he experiences frustration, trauma,

484
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,000
burnout, or gets wounded.

485
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,400
It could be life-threatening.

486
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,900
You care a lot about him.

487
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,200
He's like family to me.

488
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:26,400
I didn't even know that he had such a severe disease.

489
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,600
Don't worry.

490
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:32,400
He'll be all right as long as he cooperates.

491
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,100
I want to take you to a place.

492
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,900
Come with me.

493
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,600
Here we are. This is it.

494
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,700
Why are we here?

495
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:20,200
Whenever I feel confused, I'll come here and sing a song.

496
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,600
You brought me here to sing?

497
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,800
Even a doctor needs to adjust her mood.

498
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,400
That way, she can focus on her job.

499
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,500
I am doing well.

500
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,000
- Just give it a shot. 
 - No!

501
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,700
It works! Come on.

502
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,100
Get in.

503
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,000
Have a try.

504
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,000
Pick a song.

505
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,600

506
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:39,600
♫  Everyone has his own story  ♫

507
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:45,500
♫  We are all chasing a better life  ♫

508
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:51,400
♫  Time slows down as you pass by  ♫

509
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:56,000
♫  I'm longing to see you again  ♫

510
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:06,500
♫  We all have our dreams in this world  ♫

511
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:11,100
♫  I'm only thinking about you  ♫

512
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:18,700
♫  I love the way you look at me  ♫

513
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:23,100
♫  I'd always be touched by it  ♫

514
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:30,700
♫  I promise to the beating heart  ♫

515
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:36,600
♫  I love you the way you love me  ♫

516
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:42,900
♫  Our hearts are beating at the same pace  ♫

517
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:50,100
♫  We'll go after what's appealing to us  ♫

518
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:57,800
♫  Like the stars shining at night  ♫

519
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:02,600
♫  I want to shine in the darkness  ♫

520
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:06,700
♫  I'll be soft and silent  ♫

521
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:10,100
♫  Feeling the pulse  ♫

522
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:13,000
♫  I will always love and be touched by you ♫

523
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Thank you.

524
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,400
I feel much better after singing out loud.

525
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,700
Dr. Zhan, whenever you are sad, feel free to call me. We'll sing together.

526
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,300
Sure.

527
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:30,800
I thought that as conservative as you are, you could control your mood easily.

528
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,900
Turns out you get upset from time to time.

529
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,300
Being a lawyer can be stressful.

530
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:43,200
Sometimes, the future of a company or someone's life depends on my case.

531
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,800
That's why we find ways to alleviate stress.

532
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:53,500
I used to think that being a doctor was a stressful job.

533
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,600
We're both stressed.

534
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:03,300
That's why we must learn to get rid of the burden.

535
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,700
Try to live without the bad feelings.

536
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:10,700
Travel light and we're more likely to succeed.

537
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,700
Hello, Xiong Fei.

538
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,600
What is taking you so long with the gear?

539
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,800
Are you eating out and drinking?

540
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:41,100
Bingo! I am drinking.

541
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,900
I need to take a few days off. It's for personal stuff.

542
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:48,200
I'll be back after. Keep an eye on them.

543
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,600
What stuff? Do you need help?

544
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,000
Not a big deal. Not at all.

545
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,600
Just some trifles.

546
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:58,100
- Take good care of Doubao. 
 - I got it.

547
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,400
Well, don't feed oily food.

548
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,800
He has indigestion.

549
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,300
You can count on me. Call me if you need anything.

550
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,400
All right, that's it.

551
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,600
Are you asleep?

552
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,500
- Hurry up! 
 - What's wrong?

553
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,400
To the grill house. Are you with me?

554
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,600
Now?

555
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,400
You said the food is poor.

556
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,300
I've seen the map. Two kilometers that way.

557
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:13,000
There's a grill house behind the grove.

558
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,100
Let's go.

559
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,500
No. They are on patrol!

560
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,500
What if they catch us?

561
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:23,500
They're gone already! Get back once we finish eating.

562
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,600
Stop dawdling. I've missed it so much!

563
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,700
Forget about it. Follow the rules.

564
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,000
Coward. Just sleep.

565
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,500
Who's there?

566
00:42:50,070 --> 00:43:00,950

567
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:11,100
♫  At first, there was no sadness in the world  ♫

568
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:18,300
♫  Until luck came and crossed the stage  ♫

569
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:26,300
♫  At first, souls were confused and wandered  ♫

570
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:33,300
♫  Until people hugged each other  ♫

571
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:41,200
♫  I've been on the road  ♫

572
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:49,300
♫  Trying to connect laughter and tears  ♫

573
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:56,400
♫  I suddenly have faith  ♫

574
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:03,900
♫  I can walk by millions of shining household lights  ♫

575
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:12,500
♫  I hope I can admire flowers in the afterglow  ♫

576
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:18,800
♫  Shed tears and hope that you are well  ♫

577
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:27,600
♫  The good times I'm pursuing belong to the light  ♫

578
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:35,100
♫  It can light up the wounds that follow  ♫

579
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:38,900
♫  Catching the floating stars  ♫

580
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:42,800
♫  Watching as the memories flash by  ♫

581
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,400
♫  Traveling through market scenes  ♫

582
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,200
♫  With a fiery gaze  ♫

583
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,800
♫  I can't fly  ♫

584
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:57,600
♫  But I can look up  ♫

585
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:04,800
♫  I'm always on the road chasing the light  ♫
