00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,040

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,650
♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

3
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:18,120
♫  I put out mountain fires  ♫

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,050
♫  and catch the sunset  ♫

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,470
♫  I leave the rhythms of life in my wake  ♫

6
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:34,620
♫  Happiness whispers in my ears  ♫

7
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,370
♫  Chasing the passion for the future  ♫

8
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:43,520
♫  Like a dream maker  ♫

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,370
♫  Reading the universe and stars  ♫

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,520
♫  My existence in the river of time  ♫

11
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,570
♫  With the body temperature of a moment  ♫

12
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:02,170
♫  I'm trying to be the extension of light  ♫

13
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:08,870
♫  If the world grants me a frustrating opening  ♫

14
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:15,420
♫  I'll chase back time like a dark horse  ♫

15
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:22,250
♫  Even though I know the truth, I won't be afraid  ♫

16
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:28,200
♫  I won't miss the moon because of mediocrity  ♫

17
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,670
♫  I won't lose the light  ♫

18
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,920

19
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,300

20
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:43,380
For an emergent disease, dialysis only helps maintain the status quo.

21
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,820
A kidney transplant is recommended.

22
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,207
For a kid over one-year-old, the earlier it's transplanted,

23
00:01:48,207 --> 00:01:50,041
the less serious the rejection is,

24
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:51,686
the greater the possibility of curing it.

25
00:01:51,686 --> 00:01:53,306
No problem.

26
00:01:53,306 --> 00:01:54,491
The sooner, the better.

27
00:01:54,491 --> 00:01:56,034
I can donate a kidney to my daughter.

28
00:01:56,034 --> 00:01:57,120
No.

29
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,020
The kidney transplantation of kids differs from that of adults.

30
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:07,790
It depends on the donor which must be a child, so it's very rare.

31
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,210
How long will it take?

32
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,100
Don't be anxious.

33
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:16,140
If you decide to do the operation, we'll apply for transplantation typing

34
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,890
to organ transplantation banks of national major hospitals.

35
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,611
I'm sure you'll find a suitable one.

36
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:23,370
Be ready to pay for the operation.

37
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,540
Once we find a donor, she must have the operation immediately.

38
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,860
Thank you, Doctor.

39
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,210
Stop crying.

40
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,510
How much money left do we have?

41
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,790
We spent it all on goods, and the equipment newly bought.

42
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:48,930
Guoguo needs an operation and dialysis.

43
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,540
What shall we do?

44
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,370
It's okay.

45
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,790
Don't worry about the money.

46
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,210
I'll get it ready.

47
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:01,080
At any cost, we've to get her cured.

48
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,023
Don't worry.

49
00:03:04,023 --> 00:03:06,330
Go visit her.

50
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,440
Mrs. Zhang.

51
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,603
Dapeng.

52
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,030
I'm fine.

53
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,420
Don't console me.

54
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,540
Tell me your bank account number.

55
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:35,910
No, thanks.

56
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:39,200
But... do me a tiny favor.

57
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:43,580
Don't tell the team members about Guoguo's illness.

58
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,430
I don't want to bother them.

59
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:50,680
I'll lease out the store first, and find other ways later on.

60
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,640
What ways?

61
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:59,010
If you lease it out, how will you solve the daily expenses of your family of three in the future??

62
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:03,890
Even if she gets the transplant, you still have to pay for her rehabilitation therapy.

63
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:06,800
What will you do then?

64
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,230
Thanks for your kindness,

65
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,980
but I can't take your money.

66
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:20,250
It's every father's duty to cure his kid's disease.

67
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,280
I can't shirk my duty to others.

68
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,960
In such a rush, don't stand on ceremony.

69
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,740
I'm different from others, Dapeng.

70
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,360
We're bros.

71
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:39,160
Bro, thanks.

72
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:44,150
If I'm really short of money, I'll turn to you.

73
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:02,300
- President Wang. Hi, have a seat. 
 - Mr. Luo. Okay.

74
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,713
President Wang,

75
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,403
why bother coming here in person?

76
00:05:10,403 --> 00:05:13,030
You could have asked me to come to your office.

77
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:16,350
If so, I'm the boss and you're my legal adviser.

78
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,130
We talk about legal affairs.

79
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:21,660
If I come to you, our identities will be different.

80
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,646
You're the head of the rescue team, while I'm an outdoor product salesman.

81
00:05:24,646 --> 00:05:27,780
Isn't it correlated?

82
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,390
Are you here for the rescue business?

83
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,780
Almost.

84
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,050
I want to cooperate with you.

85
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:42,860
Dapeng, you've been the one with the highest attendance rate.

86
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,130
Why do you ask for such a long leave this suddenly?

87
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:48,560
Tell me the truth. Do you have any difficulty?

88
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,740
No.

89
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,440
I just...

90
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,870
want to ease Chen Lin's burden.

91
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,450
For all these years, I've been wrapped up in our rescue team.

92
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:04,350
She has to look after both the store and the child.

93
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,320
It's too hard for her.

94
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,840
Yeah.

95
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,300
Your wife has always supported us.

96
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,930
All of society is concerned about public welfare rescue.

97
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,180
Our team is also developing fast.

98
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:22,320
Well, mind your domestic affairs first during your leave.

99
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,000
Captain, thanks.

100
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,380
Captain, the noodles are about to be ready. Get ready to eat.

101
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,950
Okay. Dapeng, let's have noodles.

102
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,460
- Come on, Captain. 
 - Well.

103
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,810
Taste Luo Ben's noodles.

104
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,800
Today's noodles are lightly seasoned.

105
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,703
- Hope they are fine with you. 
 - That's good.

106
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:47,663
Yan especially told me to keep a scientific diet

107
00:06:47,663 --> 00:06:51,300
with lower sugar, salt, and fat.

108
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,770
Indeed. When will Zhan Yan return?

109
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:58,490
Luo Ben, have you gone to visit her?

110
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:01,900
Dapeng, just eat.

111
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,240
Besides, Captain.

112
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,050
I've news for you.

113
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,450
My client President Wang of Polar Land Group,

114
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:21,900
an outdoor product manufacturer, came to me this morning to promote their products.

115
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:28,650
He wants to sponsor a mountaineering party to climb a snow mountain in cooperation with us.

116
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:31,670
He should turn to a professional mountaineering party,

117
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,360
instead of us.

118
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,910
Our rescue team is getting more famous,

119
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:40,220
and is doing public welfare work.

120
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:45,610
He just hopes to enhance their brand image through our cooperation.

121
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:51,650
Tell him we won't commercially cooperate with other entities.

122
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,110
I said so,

123
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:58,500
but he still hopes that I can gain your approval.

124
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:04,350
He said as long as we'd top the snow mountain in their outfits,

125
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:11,280
he'd reward us generously for us to purchase advanced equipment.

126
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:16,580
Luo Ben, short of equipment as we are, we can get it in the right way

127
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:21,910
like public donations instead of being engaged in business activities.

128
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:28,460
As a captain, you've to keep these principles in mind.

129
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,870
All right, I see, Captain.

130
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,603
I see.

131
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,250
Want a little pepper?

132
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:48,260

133
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,930
I did some research before coming here.

134
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,671
The economy here is driven by husbandry.

135
00:08:57,671 --> 00:08:59,960
Local people have a high risk of echinococcosis.

136
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,410
Yes.

137
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,270
When on duty at the county hospital,

138
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:06,080
I received five patients with hepatic echinococcosis in one morning.

139
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,610
They all require surgery.

140
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,910
How's the county's surgical condition?

141
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:15,700
There is no subdivision of general surgery.

142
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:20,510
Many local people refuse to have surgery at the county hospital.

143
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:23,480
For weekend and night emergencies,

144
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:29,670
routine appendectomy and cholecystectomy both need open operations.

145
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:34,680
Emergency laparoscopic surgery had never been adopted until I came here.

146
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:40,170
External support alone isn't enough to solve such problems.

147
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:45,631
A trustworthy and highly-skilled medical team must be built as soon as possible.

148
00:09:45,631 --> 00:09:48,600
Dr. Zhan, be generous with your skills.

149
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,140
Cultivate several apprentices soon.

150
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:55,460
No problem. Let's do it respectively, and see whose is better.

151
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,130
Deal. Fair competition.

152
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,620

153
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:08,670
Many mountaineers come here to climb snow mountains every year.

154
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:12,460
However, only a few of them can top the mountain.

155
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,290
Judging from their equipment,

156
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:18,270
they don't seem to want to top the mountain.

157
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,600
How can you tell?

158
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,170
In childhood, my dad climbed snow mountains with me.

159
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:27,516
I took special training as well.

160
00:10:27,516 --> 00:10:30,460
Though we didn't make it that high, let alone to the top of the mountain,

161
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,850
I know the difference at least.

162
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,370
You're really something.

163
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,590
What's wrong?

164
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:18,490
Dapeng.

165
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:20,263
Go.

166
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:23,511
Dapeng, you're a professional mountaineer.

167
00:11:23,511 --> 00:11:26,770
Why can't your physical strength compare with us amateurs?

168
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:30,968
Duojie, you're so ungrateful.

169
00:11:30,968 --> 00:11:35,310
When reaching the top, it was Dapeng who pulled us up one by one with ropes.

170
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:37,920
Dapeng consumed the most physical strength.

171
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,520
Or could you have made it yourself?

172
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:46,350
With no photo of topping the mountain, we can't even get the award.

173
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,330
Forget it.

174
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,860
We succeeded by topping it.

175
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,350
Uncle Da,

176
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,160
shall we find a place to rest?

177
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,710
I feel dizzy.

178
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,430
Dapeng!

179
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,240
Dapeng, what's wrong?

180
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,490
He has a fever with altitude stress.

181
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:28,150
He seems to be unable to return to the base camp.

182
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,680
Then we've to carry him up there.

183
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,910
If you ask for death, don't bring us with you.

184
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:36,242
It's hard for one to walk here. Is it possible to carry someone else?

185
00:12:36,242 --> 00:12:38,270
Or leave him alone here?

186
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,320
We've no choice.

187
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,520
On the way to Mount Qomolangma, many mountaineers' bodies can't be carried down.

188
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,670
Their relatives also had no choice.

189
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,330
We're not climbing that mountain.

190
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:51,130
Stop quarreling!

191
00:12:55,930 --> 00:13:02,320
It seems there'll be a snowstorm tonight.

192
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,770
We can't reach the camp now.

193
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:09,780
Let's camp here. Okay?

194
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,810
I have the phone number of a local doctor.

195
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:20,680
Let me ask if she can come here.

196
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,950
No doctor is willing to treat a patient here.

197
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,340
Give it a shot.

198
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:29,260
If she refuses,

199
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,040
that'll be his fate.

200
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:39,663
Uncle Luodan, did you take the medicine every day?

201
00:13:39,663 --> 00:13:42,510
Yes, every day.

202
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:45,670
Your blood pressure has dropped, but you have to keep on taking it,

203
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:48,680
or the blood pressure will easily go up.

204
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,190
Excuse me.

205
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,793
Hello?

206
00:14:01,793 --> 00:14:03,250
 Is that Dr. Zhan?

207
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:07,650
 Now, I'm on the snow mountain with my team.

208
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:11,680
 A team member has a fever and can't move.

209
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,770
Can you come to save him?

210
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,730
How old is he? Any other symptoms?

211
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,990
Just has a fever.

212
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:22,490
I don't know if he has other symptoms.

213
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:27,460
I heard he was a member of the Light Chaser Rescue Team,

214
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,830
and saved a lot of people.

215
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:32,470
Can you save him?

216
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,180
Please!

217
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,420
Light Chaser Rescue Team. What's his name?

218
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,990
Zhang Dapeng!

219
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,630
Zhan Yan, will you really go up the snow mountain?

220
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:49,040
Dapeng has a fever with altitude stress.

221
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,560
If he's badly ill, many complications will be caused.

222
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,180
If I don't go, he'll be in danger.

223
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,220
Don't be impulsive.

224
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,081
It's a snow mountain with high altitude,

225
00:14:57,081 --> 00:15:01,430
low temperature, a varied topography, snowstorms, glaciers and cliffs.

226
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,240
The danger is seen everywhere.

227
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,290
Don't worry.

228
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:08,641
I've been here for so long, and familiar with the environment and climate here.

229
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,151
I climbed snow mountains with my dad.

230
00:15:10,151 --> 00:15:13,140
I know what you said. I'll be careful.

231
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:16,610
If you must go, I'll go with you.

232
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:25,040
You've no experience. If anything goes wrong, I've to protect you.

233
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,440
Stop arguing with me and persuading me.

234
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,700
There'll be a snowstorm tonight.

235
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,610
I'll pack up, and set out tomorrow morning.

236
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,333
Let's go.

237
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,160
All was well last night.

238
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,580
I had the soundest sleep since I came here.

239
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,830
Where's the snowstorm?

240
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,963
Uncle Da.

241
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:13,710
Are you cheating us for Dapeng?

242
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,940
The climate here is unpredictable.

243
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:22,820
Though it's sunny now, the snowstorm will come at any time.

244
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:25,730
I won't be wrong.

245
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,490
Stop fooling around with me.

246
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:30,790
Boy, you don't understand.

247
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,390
Each frequent mountaineer knows

248
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:38,990
sometimes helping others is helping himself, got it?

249
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,660
Will the doctor you turned to come here?

250
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,860
Take care.

251
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:58,788
Come on.

252
00:16:58,788 --> 00:17:00,588
Give me your hand.

253
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,303
Over there.

254
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:37,910
Without Dapeng, we'd have had a celebratory dinner with awards.

255
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:41,640
We'd better leave together as we came together as a team.

256
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:11,540
Zhan Yan, there are tents ahead.

257
00:18:12,684 --> 00:18:14,830
- Are they who we're looking for? 
 - Go.

258
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,403
Go. Hurry.

259
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,630
Never expected a doctor would come indeed.

260
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,090
We're here. Here!

261
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:23,153
Uncle Da!

262
00:18:23,153 --> 00:18:27,650
Uncle Da.

263
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,770
- Uncle Da. 
 - Great.

264
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:35,740
Uncle Da, where's Dapeng?

265
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:39,870
Dapeng is unconscious in this tent.

266
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,620
Go. Okay.

267
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:53,560
- Give me the medical kit. 
 - Here you are.

268
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,970
Go.

269
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:16,300
Hurry to pack up your belongings.

270
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:20,460
We must arrive at the hillside camp before the snowstorm comes.

271
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,900
Hurry up. Hurry.

272
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,590
Snowstorm.

273
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,080
Snowstorm is just on your lips.

274
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,480
 Get out.

275
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,830
 Withdraw to the hillside camp.

276
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,573
 Hurry.

277
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,590
- Dapeng. 
 - Dapeng.

278
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,851
He has woken up.

279
00:19:43,851 --> 00:19:44,830
You're awake.

280
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:48,180
Zhan Yan, why are you here?

281
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,840
Lie down. Don't move.

282
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,670
Are you okay?

283
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,630
Rest first.

284
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:03,020
I'm asking you, why did you join the mountaineering party?

285
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,778
The resource isn't enough.

286
00:20:06,778 --> 00:20:09,760
We can only help reduce your fever and inflammation.

287
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,320
Let's talk when we get down the mountain.

288
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,470
Don't talk or move.

289
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,530
Save your strength.

290
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:17,160
Hold on.

291
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,220
Bad news. The storm is getting bigger.

292
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,500
Peg down the tent.

293
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,990

294
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,610
What shall we do?

295
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:43,690
All kits and supplies are blown away.

296
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:48,910
We've no cellphone to communicate with people down the mountain.

297
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:59,403
No signal.

298
00:21:59,403 --> 00:22:01,830
Uncle Da, what to do now?

299
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,770
Will it be okay if we reach the hillside camp?

300
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:09,390
I've never camped here as well.

301
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:12,070
We can only walk down the path in my memory.

302
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:14,740
This snowstorm hasn't ended.

303
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,240
I'm afraid it'll come again.

304
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,000
Now let's go down. Hurry.

305
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,930
What about Dapeng?

306
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:25,910
Please carry him down to the hillside camp

307
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:28,150
which is flat and sheltered from winds.

308
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,870
Then you may withdraw first.

309
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:32,320
Dr. Cai and I will stay to await the rescue.

310
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,670
Yes.

311
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:35,670
It's on you.

312
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:41,350
It's hard to walk while carrying someone, but if we do it together

313
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:44,940
and walk carefully, we're likely to reach the hillside camp.

314
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,020
Good.

315
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,430
Thank you all.

316
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:48,700
Thanks.

317
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,100
Come on. Let's get to it.

318
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:02,053
Look!  The rescue robot can be used with life detectors

319
00:23:02,053 --> 00:23:06,668
and night vision cameras to replace our team members

320
00:23:06,668 --> 00:23:08,840
to get into the ruins for detection.

321
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,373
Here.

322
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:14,041
Go on. Let me answer a phone call.

323
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:17,340
Now technology's getting more advanced.

324
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:21,570
Hello, President Wang. What happened?

325
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,290
What?

326
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:30,190
Did you call the police?

327
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:34,680
Okay, I see.

328
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,273
What's wrong?

329
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:40,000
The mountaineering party sponsored by Polar Land is missing at Mount Mayo.

330
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,090
They called the police.

331
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:42,890
Polar Land?

332
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:46,740
The group you mentioned that engages in outdoor products?

333
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,173
Yes.

334
00:23:48,173 --> 00:23:53,050
We turned them down, so they employed a group of amateur mountaineers

335
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:58,430
at a high price to climb Mount Mayo for the promotion of their new products.

336
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,870
What a farce!

337
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:07,010
Zhan Yan and Dapeng are also in that missing party.

338
00:24:16,926 --> 00:24:21,160
 You're all elites of Light Chaser Rescue Team.

339
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,230
 Although there is already a wealth of rescue experience,

340
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:29,010
 the special geographical environment of snow mountain rescue missions is complex,

341
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,330
 with heinous climate conditions,

342
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:39,370
 and many unpredictable emergencies, so you must be careful.

343
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:41,920
 No matter what happens,

344
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,040
 you should follow orders.

345
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,880
 Don't make decisions yourself.

346
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:53,400
 Remember, our mission is to find the missing mountaineers,

347
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,070
 not to risk our lives.

348
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:20,870

349
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,300

350
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,300
 Enough.

351
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,931
 When will they arrive?

352
00:25:48,931 --> 00:25:50,220
 They should come soon.

353
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,500
 Thanks for your hard work.

354
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,400
 President Wang, you may drink.

355
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,330
 No, thanks.

356
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:57,610
 That's...

357
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:59,680
 Where did they get lost?

358
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,130
 When they phoned yesterday afternoon,

359
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:05,620
 they said they were coming down the mountain.

360
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,753
They've come.

361
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:17,640
What a grand scene!

362
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,010
President Wang's style.

363
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:21,360
Dapeng?

364
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,980
How could he endorse the brand?

365
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:29,323
Captain Luo. Finally, I was looking forward to you guys.

366
00:26:29,323 --> 00:26:32,360
In such a critical time, I'm so anxious.

367
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,940
We came here as soon as we were notified.

368
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,910
We hoped you would come here, we will be saved.

369
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:40,670
President Wang, brief us on what happened.

370
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:44,110
The case is that we've six people in total including five members and a guide.

371
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,926
Yesterday afternoon, they topped the mountain,

372
00:26:45,926 --> 00:26:47,670
but a man got sick on the way back.

373
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:50,430
A doctor was asked there but lost contact with us, too.

374
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:52,430
When did you contact them last time?

375
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:54,300
About 16:30 yesterday.

376
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,740
The weather report indicated a snowstorm.

377
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:00,940
My biggest concern is that they had an accident in the snowstorm.

378
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,220
Well, find two guides for us.

379
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,350
We'll go uphill right now.

380
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,500
The guides are ready.

381
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,430
This is Uncle Luodan. This is Danba.

382
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:12,170
Both of them are local mountain people, familiar with uphill conditions.

383
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:13,733
Okay.

384
00:27:13,733 --> 00:27:18,210
Captain Luo, be free to tell me what you want and how much.

385
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:19,670
Money is not a problem.

386
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:22,800
We've to go uphill as soon as possible. Talk while walking.

387
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,391
- Let's go. 
 - This way. 
 - Yes.

388
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,700
Uncle Da.

389
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,340
Is the route wrong?

390
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:01,120
It didn't take us this long when coming.

391
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,390
Indeed.

392
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:04,023
Really?

393
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,630
I can't make it.

394
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:07,920
I'm exhausted.

395
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,690
I quit. I can't do it.

396
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:13,360
Hold on.

397
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,900
We're all in a bad state.

398
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:21,250
With no signal, we lost contact with the camp.

399
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:24,370
If we're not sure about this route,

400
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:30,980
we should find a safer place to rest, and wait for the rescue.

401
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:33,020
It won't do.

402
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:37,920
It's getting stormy.

403
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,670
On the snow mountain,

404
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:47,000
we can not leave our lives to others, but depend on ourselves.

405
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,140
Though deviating from the route,

406
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:55,210
we ought to be close to the camp.

407
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:57,600
I agree.

408
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,240
Get up. It's hard to get up once lying down.

409
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,150
Leave me alone.

410
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:07,270
Whether to go or lie down here, I'm doomed for sure.

411
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,680
Don't talk nonsense on a snow mountain.

412
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:17,830
We lost supplies and equipment, and we're lost.

413
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:21,630
In such weather, even if we don't starve, we'll be frozen.

414
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:23,830
Ma Yue, can't you shut up?

415
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:26,863
No! He's so burdensome.

416
00:29:26,863 --> 00:29:29,400
Without him, we'd have long gone down.

417
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,630
What're you saying?

418
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,710
So what?

419
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,340
You've been picking on me. Do you want to fight?

420
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,263
Enough!

421
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:45,360
You'd better save your energy.

422
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:53,270
Let them go.

423
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:54,670
Leave me aside.

424
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:56,630
I'm fine.

425
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:59,050
Just need to rest.

426
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:03,930
So inhumane. I do want to kick your ass.

427
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:06,343
Come on!

428
00:30:06,343 --> 00:30:07,810
What are you doing?

429
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:09,340
Stop fighting!

430
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,863
Stop!

431
00:30:10,863 --> 00:30:11,910
Stop fighting!

432
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,290
- Stop. 
 - Hands off!

433
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,460
Zhan Yan!

434
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:26,670
Zhan Yan!

435
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:30,630
Zhan Yan, hold on! Never let go!

436
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,740
We'll pull you up.

437
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:38,020
Harder!

438
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,530
Hold on!

439
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:43,840
Pull on the rope.

440
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:15,650
- Dr. Zhan! 
 - Zhan Yan!

441
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:17,970
Zhan Yan!

442
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,900
Look.

443
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,100
Here. There.

444
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:57,200
These suspicious areas are within 3.5 km of the camp.

445
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,400
Let's split into East Team and West Team, led respectively by me and Xiong Fei.

446
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,400
Expanding the search to the east and west sides,

447
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,860
the two teams will follow the descent route from the mid-level camp to the foot of the mountain,

448
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:13,100
and then each will go northeast and rendezvous in the northwest.

449
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,500
Everyone must follow orders.

450
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,300
Don't leave the team without permission.

451
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,500
Keep communication unimpeded.

452
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,700
Keep in touch. Understand?

453
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,000
 Understood!

454
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,400
- All right. 
 - Let's get started.

455
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,400
 Zhan Yan!

456
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,700
 Dr. Zhan.

457
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,700
 Are you okay?

458
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,200
 Dr. Zhan.

459
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,400
I'm down here.

460
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,600
- She's alive. 
 - Fetch the rope.

461
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,500
Get the rope.

462
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,800
Zhan Yan, don't be afraid.

463
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,800
They're fetching the rope.

464
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,300
 We'll pull you up soon.

465
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,200
Hurry.

466
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,400
Dr. Zhan, I'll drop the rope.

467
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,700
Wait for a second,

468
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,100
I can't move yet.

469
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,100
She can't get up herself.

470
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,800
One of us should go help her down there.

471
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,200
Hurry!

472
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,000
Move.

473
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,500
You're professional mountaineers.

474
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,400
You should know how to save her.

475
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,200
Who dares?

476
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,600
Let alone saving her, he may not be able to come back up.

477
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,500
We're not professional, but merely amateurs.

478
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:39,600
It's the first time for us to run into such a dilemma.

479
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,600
Cowards! If you refuse, let me do it.

480
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,800
- Give me the rope. Don't stop me. 
 - Calm down!

481
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,100
It's no use going down.

482
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,400
Can you climb the ice cliff?

483
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,600
Do you know how to use the rope?

484
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,600
It's no use wasting time here.

485
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,400
When we still have energy, go downhill and ask for help.

486
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,000
That sounds right.

487
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,400
If the snowstorm comes, no one can leave.

488
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,700
Uncle Da is the most experienced.

489
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,600
He even agrees with me.

490
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,800
At this time of crisis, face reality.

491
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:12,200
At best, we'll show mercy to take Dapeng back.

492
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:16,400
We really can't save this female doctor.

493
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,000
Come on!

494
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,300
- What're you doing? 
 - What're you doing?

495
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,700
What are you doing?

496
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,500
You can't leave her alone.

497
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,400
You can't leave her alone.

498
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:43,300
Brother Peng, you can't move now, let alone save her.

499
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:46,400
I won't go.

500
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,400
Dr. Cai, it's no use staying here.

501
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,300
Come with us.

502
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,500
I won't go.

503
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,400
I'll stay here with Dr. Zhan,

504
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,300
waiting for the rescue team you'll bring with you.

505
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,500
Let's go.

506
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,000
Go.

507
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,900
 Cai Yuxiao!

508
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,600
Uncle Da!

509
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:31,000
Zhan Yan, don't be afraid.

510
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
They went to call the rescue team.

511
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,700
I'm here with you.

512
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,500
Follow me.

513
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:53,200
Wait, let me look.

514
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,500
There.

515
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,300
Almost there.

516
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,800
A drone!

517
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,000
We're here!

518
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,300
Xiong Fei, they've been found!

519
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,200
They've been found!

520
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,800
Here.

521
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,600
Yes, it's them.

522
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:10,800
About a kilometer straight ahead of us.

523
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,100
Over there.

524
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,900
- Go. 
 - Go. Go.

525
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,400
Eat something.

526
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,100
Thanks.

527
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,700
Have some water.

528
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:37,600
Xiong Fei, Dapeng is awake.

529
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,100
How do you feel?

530
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,200
- Hurry... Hurry... 
 - Hurry what?

531
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,200
- Zhan Yan... 
 - What happened to Zhan Yan?

532
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,400
Hurry to save Zhan Yan.

533
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,600
Wait!  Where's she?

534
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,000
In an ice crevasse.

535
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,600
- Which one? 
 - She fell into an ice crevasse.

536
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,000
Which one?

537
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,400
Hurry to save Zhan Yan.

538
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:07,000
Just... Just around that corner.

539
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:13,000
You left her alone there?

540
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,200
That direction is in Luo Ben's search range.

541
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,600
 Luo Ben, we've found Dapeng,

542
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:37,900
 but Zhan Yan fell into an ice crevasse right in your direction.

543
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,100
- Hurry to find her. 
 - Roger.

544
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,000
 Keep in touch.

545
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,800
We'll go find you.

546
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,600
Understand.

547
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,400
Keep your distance.

548
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,200
Don't leave the rope's range.

549
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,600
There are crevices under the snow.

550
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,000
Watch your step!

551
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,100
Go.

552
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:57,100
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

553
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,900
Speed up.

554
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,100
Mind your step.

555
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,900
Hurry.

556
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,000
Faster! Faster!

557
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,300
Don't go further!

558
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,800
The snowstorm is coming!

559
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,600
- Before it comes, we've to... 
 - We've no time!

560
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,200
The weather here is different.

561
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,800
The snowstorm seems far away. It comes at any time.

562
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,500
You may withdraw, but we must go.

563
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:36,900
No, you can't, or no one will come back.

564
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,800
Clouds are low; the wind blows snow.

565
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,300
It's a force 8 gale.

566
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,500
Luo Ben, report your current location.

567
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,800
Luo Ben!

568
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,400
Let's go.

569
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,600
- Go. 
 - Go.

570
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,500
Don't go!

571
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,800
Dr. Cai.

572
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:35,600
Where's Zhan Yan?

573
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,000
Where's Dr. Zhan?

574
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:43,700
Hurry... save... save her... In the ice crevasse.

575
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,900
Hurry to save... Hurry.

576
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,400
Zhan Yan!

577
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,000
Dr. Zhan!

578
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,400
- Zhan Yan! 
 - Zhan Yan!

579
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,800
Zhan Yan!

580
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:07,030

581
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:18,700
♫  At first, there was no sadness in the world  ♫

582
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:25,900
♫  Until luck came and crossed the stage  ♫

583
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:33,700
♫  At first, souls were confused and wandered  ♫

584
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:41,000
♫  Until people hugged each other  ♫

585
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:48,800
♫  I've been on the road  ♫

586
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:56,900
♫  Trying to connect laughter and tears  ♫

587
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:04,000
♫  I suddenly have faith  ♫

588
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:11,500
♫  I can walk by millions of shining household lights  ♫

589
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:20,300
♫  I hope I can admire flowers in the sunset  ♫

590
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:26,600
♫  Shed tears and hope that you are well  ♫

591
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:35,300
♫  The good times I'm pursuing belong to the light  ♫

592
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:42,900
♫  It can light up the wounds that follow  ♫

593
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:46,700
♫  Catching the floating stars  ♫

594
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:50,400
♫  Watching as the memories flash by  ♫

595
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,100
♫  Traveling through market scenes  ♫

596
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:57,900
♫  With a fiery gaze  ♫

597
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:01,500
♫  I can't fly  ♫

598
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:05,300
♫  But I can look up  ♫

599
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:12,800
♫  I'm always on the road chasing the light  ♫
