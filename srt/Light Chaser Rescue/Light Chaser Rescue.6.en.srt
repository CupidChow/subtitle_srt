16

Is it all right now?

17
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,500
Did you put the bag

18
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,580
into the microwave?

19
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:59,740
I forgot.

20
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,580
You forgot?

21
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,300
Did you just move here?

22
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,460
Don't tell me
you're living across the hall.

23
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,740
What do you think?

24
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,100
What a coincidence.

25
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,500
It's too much of a coincidence.

26
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,420
Hold on.

27
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,300
The property manager said the new tenant

28
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,180
is in the rescue business

29
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,580
with strong consciousness
of fire and safety.

30
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,460
That's why

31
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,860
I didn't stop by.

32
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,780
Who would know you...

33
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,700
It was just a mistake.

34
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,860
Just a mistake?

35
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,020
Don't you know
you can't take the elevator

36
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,740
when there is a fire?

37
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,180
I was in a hurry.

38
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,340
What's more,

39
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,420
this is my house,

40
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,020
not yours.

41
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:41,900
Why should I listen to you?

42
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,060
All right.

43
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,740
Then I'll keep filing complaints

44
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,580
with the property management

45
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,700
until your landlord ends the lease.

46
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,180
Fine.

47
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,860
Tell me what you want.

48
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,060
You can stay here,

49
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,180
but you have to

50
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,300
learn about fire safety first.

51
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,180
All right, I got it.

52
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,540
Yan?

53
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,060
Mr. Luo, I'm so sorry.

54
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,420
We haven't had a chance

55
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,420
to hand out safety manuals
to new tenants.

56
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,780
Please do us a favor

57
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,860
and stop filing complaints.

58
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,020
We will correct our mistakes

59
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,020
until you are satisfied.

60
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,180
What are you talking about?

61
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,260
I won't eat you.

62
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,300
Yes.

63
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:32,860
Mr. Luo!

64
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:33,980
I believe the tenant across the hall

65
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:34,540
has realized

66
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,460
her mistake.

67
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,980
Please let her go.

68
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,860
Here, give this to them,

69
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,180
just in case.

70
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,740
That's what happened.

71
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,060
Is he really gonna stop

72
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:00,860
filing complaints against me?

73
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:01,900
Yes.

74
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,020
Thanks.

75
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,100
That was really scary.

76
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,100
If we were

77
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,340
in the comic book world,

78
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,900
something romantic would happen

79
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,980
between Luo Ben and me.

80
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,340
Why?

81
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,980
Isn't it obvious?

82
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,540
At first, he helped
Ma Baoming entrap me,

83
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,180
then I saved his little sister

84
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,220
in the earthquake.

85
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:38,780
He helped me get

86
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,460
some money back,

87
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,460
and I rented an apartment with the money,

88
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,740
and now we live across the hall.

89
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,540
Who knows what might happen?

90
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,980
You should eat less junk food.

91
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,300
I'm going

92
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,220
to learn how to cook.

93
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,020
You could even trip the alarm
when you were using the oven.

94
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,460
You'd better study

95
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,660
the safety manual first.

96
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,780
Yan, why are you

97
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,900
on his side?

98
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,420
You just moved out like this.

99
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,340
What are you gonna do?

100
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,900
What can I do?

101
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,860
Keep drawing comics.

102
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,420
I can't do anything else,

103
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,340
and I don't want to,

104
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,740
but I have

105
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,100
hit a bottleneck in creation lately.

106
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,220
I don't know what to draw.

107
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,900
Go for a walk.

108
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,100
I dare not.

109
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,420
The last time when I went for a walk,

110
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,420
I ended up in an earthquake.

111
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,540
I lost my job

112
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,300
and met Zhou Mingming.

113
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,340
By the way, Yan,

114
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,460
you're full of ideas.

115
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,980
Help me think about it.

116
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,340
Don't you like superheroes?

117
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,220
Draw your own one.

118
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,300
Draw a superhero?

119
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,460
That's a good idea.

120
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,540
Why didn't I think of that?

121
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,780
Look at those superheroes abroad,

122
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,540
the Hulk, Spider-Man,

123
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,580
Captain America.

124
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,100

126
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,860
Yan, if you don't want me

127
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,740
to draw them,

128
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,580
I'll draw something else.

129
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,860
This is your work.

130
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,220
Don't worry about how I feel.

131
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,980
Then I might

132
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,220
visit the rescue team a lot.

133
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,660
Will you be unhappy?

134
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,100
Why would I be unhappy

135
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,460
when you're doing what you love?

136
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,660

Slow down. The sky won't fall.

Is she really gonna
let Cai Yuxiao have it

172

00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,980
Why would Zhan Yan be like this?

175
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:52,780
Rest assured.

176
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,420
That's not who she is.

177
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,020
It's really weird.

178
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,420
Please come in.

179
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,420
President.

180
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,100
I need to censor myself.

181
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,220
You've always been

182
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,100
on your high horse.

183
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,580
When have you ever censored yourself?

184
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,660
What is it? Tell me about it.

185
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,860
The Second Medical Team

186
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,780
has been preselected

187
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,660
as the Advanced Disaster Relief Team.

188
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,860
I'm responsible for this.

189
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,020
This is the decision of the hospital.

190
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,340
What does it have anything
to do with you?

191
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,900
As the head

192
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,660
of the First Medical Team,

193
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,540
after returning to the hospital,

194
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,900
I didn't report our work

195
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,900
to the leadership
and the hospital's Party committee

196
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,260
in a timely manner,

197
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,420
as a result,

198
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,940
the leadership isn't clear about

199
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:46,780
what the First Medical Team did,

200
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,020
and I'm responsible for that.

201
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,300
Therefore, I wrote up

202
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,180
a report on
the First Medical Team's work.

203
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,380
in the disaster area

204
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,500
(Work Report of the First Medical Team)
Please take a look.

205
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,420
I hope

206
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,660
the First Medical Team's work

207
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,140
can be evaluated objectively,

208
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,660
and we should be given this honor

209
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,780
if we meet the standards.

210
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,020
But there can only be

211
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:03,700
one advanced team.

212
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,500
That will be

213
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,420
your work.

214
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,380
President.

215
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,660
This honor

216
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,660
is not mine.

217
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,140
It belongs to my team,

218
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,060
so I'm going to fight for it.

219
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,500
Come on.

220
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,020
Well done.

221
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,420
- Keep going.
- Your turn.

222
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:44,820
A little higher.

223
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,380
Come on.

224
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,380
40.

225
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,020
Keep going.

226
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:55,380
Okay.

227
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,540
One more group.

228
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,060
Yes.

229
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,940
(Support for Light Chaser Rescue
(Water Rescue Gear))

230
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,780
What's the matter?

231
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,420
Mingming!

232
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,060
I know we can count on you.

233
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,300
Don't say that. I just lifted a finger.

234
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,140
You should lift your finger more often.

235
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,380
Lift your finger once you get a chance.

236
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,500
Falcon.

237
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:50,780
To be frank,

238
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,020
I'm here this time

239
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,500
to create a chance for myself.

240
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,540
I think you guys are really cool,

241
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,380
and I want to join you.

242
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,180
G-Guys.

243
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,180
What do you think?

244
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,820
The gear is pretty good.

245
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,780
The gear is good.

246
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,420
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

247
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,020
Why not, Uncle?

248
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,420
Joining the non-profit rescue team

249
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,500
is nothing to play with.

250
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,420
I'm not playing with it.

251
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,820
I take it very seriously.

252
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,380
Do your parents know about this?

253
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,900
I'm an adult now.

254
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,540
Look, I've become

255
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,900
a big girl.

256
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,140
I even moved out.

257
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,300
They don't need to know.

258
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,300
Dingding.

259
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,660
When we rescue lives,

260
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,420
every detail is a matter of life.

261
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,900
It requires professional rescue skills,

262
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,020
a strong body,

263
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,060
and a high sense of responsibility.

264
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,540
You've never engaged
in such things before.

265
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,380
How can you do it?

266
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,500
Don't worry, Uncle.

267
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,660
I can learn from scratch.

268
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,780
I won't be shy from working hard.

269
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:46,660
Okay.

270
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:48,900
Let me ask you,

271
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,020
why do you want to join
the Light Chaser Rescue?

272
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,060
I admit

273
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,380
I have a personal reason.

274
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,060
Can't you just put me

275
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,180
in a less challenging position?

276
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,420
You haven't joined us yet,

277
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,660
and you're starting to get picky.

278
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,300
Listen to yourself.

279
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,900
Uncle.

280
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:11,020
Uncle.

281
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,260
Actually, my cousin asked me to come.

282
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,660
Yan?

283
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,900
Did Yan put you up to this?

284
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,380
How's she doing?

285
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,180
Is she doing well?

286
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,540
She's been fine lately.

287
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,660
Rest assured, Uncle.

288
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,180
Well,

289
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,900
here's what it is.

290
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,140
A few days ago,

291
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,300
my new house almost caught fire.

292
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,540
Yan was really worried.

293
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,700
She said I should learn
something about safety.

294
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,940
I think

295
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,260
this is a ready-made

296
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,420
professional place.

297
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,660
It's perfect, right?

298
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,940
Safety.

299
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:47,940
Dingding.

300
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,380
If you just want to learn

301
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,260
the common knowledge of safety,

302
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,660
I can teach you right now.

303
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,300
You don't have to join us.

304
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,420
I want to join you

305
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,940
because I want to learn

306
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,900
more professional knowledge

307
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,420
of rescue.

308
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,180
Besides,

309
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:03,780
Uncle,

310
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,420
I also want to make a contribution

311
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,940
to the public welfare.

312
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,180
What's more,

313
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,780
I can come more often

314
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,700
and bring you news of Yan.

315
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,260
All right?

316
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,540
If you don't say anything,

317
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,620
I'll take that as a yes.

318
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,180
Thank you, Uncle. I'm leaving.

319
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,780
I'm not gonna eat the apple. Bye-bye.

320
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,500
Don't worry.

321
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,820
I'll put in a good word

322
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,420
for you later.

323
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,300
Thank you.

324
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,180
What are you doing here?

325
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,420
What do you mean?

326
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,900
If you can come, I can come, too.

327
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,140
Well,

328
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,820
Zhou Mingming wants to join
the rescue team.

329
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,380
I'm taking him to meet Qingshan.

330
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,060
He can't.

331
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,380
His integrity is questionable.

332
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,300
Not at all.

333
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,660
He just brought some gear to us.

334
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,900
This young man

335
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,660
is good.

336
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,020
Do you hear him?

337
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,180
The Light Chaser Rescue
is a non-profit organization.

338
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,140
We mustn't yield to the capitalists.

339
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,420
If you're truly generous,

340
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,780
you can leave the gear here.

341
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,540
If it's just for trading,

342
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,420
you should get out of here
with the gear.

343
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,780
No.

344
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,900
We can talk about it later
whether he should leave or not,

345
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,260
but the gear has to stay.

346
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,420
Doing rescue is not for him.

347
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,180
He faints at the sight of blood.

348
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,260
He can't even save himself.

349
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,660
You're not the boss here.

350
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,540
It's not up to you.

351
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,020
I'm a member

352
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,180
of the rescue team now.

353
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,540
I have the right to object.

354
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,620
What?

355
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,900
Are you also on the rescue team now?

356
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,300
Falcon.

357
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,820
She is selfish.

358
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,420
When we were in Fengxi,

359
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,180
she just wanted to escape.

360
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,620
You know, she didn't care...

361
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,420
Say it again.

362
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:38,940
Fire her.

363
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,020
Did you see that?

364
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:40,820
She is also prone to violence!

365
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,780
Who are you calling selfish?

366
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,420
It's dangerous

367
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,180
to let people like her join you!

368
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:44,620
- Stop!
- Say it again!

369
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,060
What are you two doing?

370
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,900
Hello, I'm also here!

371
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,500
She started it first.

372
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,260
Shut up!

373
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,780
Are you playing house?

374
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,020
You even brought up old scores.

375
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,620
Listen,

376
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,140
no one is perfect.

377
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,940
Take the guys in the rescue team

378
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,420
for instance,

379
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,700
everyone has advantages

380
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,540
and disadvantages.

381
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,300
If we make a mistake, we correct it.

382
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,420
If you two

383
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,500
want to join the rescue team,

384
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,540
you must keep in mind

385
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,420
that friendship comes first.

386
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,420
That's the rule.

387
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,420
No more fighting,

388
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,180
or neither of you can stay.

389
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,020
Nod if you two

390
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,500
understand what I'm saying.

391
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,540
There you go.

392
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,180
Shake your hands and make up.

393
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,020
(Advanced Disaster Relief Teams)
Dr. Zhan, Dr. Cai.

394
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:46,820
(Team leaders: Zhan Yan, Cai Yuxiao)
Congratulations.

395
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,420
That's awesome.

396
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,660
Thank you, guys.

397
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,300
Well, let's not gather around.

398
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,300
Go to work.

399
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,020
Congratulations.

400
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,300
I heard you went to the president.

401
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,620
It's nothing personal.

402
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,140
I just asked for what we deserve.

403
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,420
Got it.

404
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,420
I know you.

405
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,260
It's good.

406
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,540
The president pushed for another spot.

407
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,700
Everyone's efforts are appreciated.

408
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,620
You probably won't

409
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,060
feel that way by the time

410
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,420
when the associate senior doctor
is to be selected.

411
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,660
I won't complain

412
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,900
if I lose to you.

413
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,700
It's a fair competition.

414
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,620
You can try your best.

415
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,300
Okay.

416
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,540
If I get selected,

417
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,660
you mustn't cry.

418
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,300
Have you ever seen me cry?

419
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:41,780
No.

420
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,620
Cheers.

421
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:51,780
Zhan Yan.

422
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,620
Thank you for pushing for the honor

423
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,620
for our team.

424
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,820
Now we can hold our heads high.

425
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:56,900
Zhan Yan.

426
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,660
This is for you.

427
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,420
We deserve it.

428
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,500
Thank you, Zhan Yan.

429
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,300
The family of the patient in Bed 13,

430
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,060
the attorney,

431
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,620
you should buy him some coffee.

432
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,860
Why?

433
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,060
When you took a leave that day,

434
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,100
President Qiu made rounds

435
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,620
and he put in a good word for you.

436
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,220
He deserves credit for our team

437
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,380
getting the honor.

438
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,820
He did help with that.

439
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,260
Yeah.

440
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,700
This one's on me.

441
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:29,420
Okay, Dr. Zhan.

442
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,180
I heard you guys got selected
as the advanced team.

443
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,140
Congratulations.

444
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,180
That's why I bought you coffee

445
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:37,740
as a thank you.

446
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,060
If you're talking about the time

447
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,420
when I put in a good word
for you in the ward,

448
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,900
it was actually Luo Yuan
who asked me to do it.

449
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,740
I just passed on a message for her.

450
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,260
Well, thank you for passing on
a message for her.

451
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,100
You're someone who returns every favor.

452
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,700
So are you.

453
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:00,820
It tastes good.

454
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,940
(Savor Coffee)

455
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:23,940
It's raining.

456
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:25,940
Hurry!

457
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,580
Let's go. Go slowly.

458
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,580
Do you like it so much

459
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,980
that you're willing to wait in the rain?

460
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,380
You said Luo Yuan likes it.

461
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,100
I'm just trying to return her favor.

462
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,420
The rain stopped.

463
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,980
You can drop me
at the bus station ahead.

464
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,260
It's thoughtful of you

465
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,420
to buy snacks for Luo Yuan

466
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,220
in the rain.

467
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,380
I should at least

468
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,420
take you home,

469
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,420
or Luo Yuan will blame me.

470
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,620
Turns out you're afraid

471
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,460
to ruin your image

472
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,740
as a good brother to her.

473
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,180
My image as a good brother is solid,

474
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,900
but I think

475
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,420
my image as a bad attorney

476
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,820
can be changed.

477
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,820
Since when

478
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,620
do you care what other people think?

479
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,740
I didn't care before.

480
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:35,740
(Please tell me what you need.)

481
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,220
Play some soft music.

482
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,980
(Okay, playing soft music for you.)

483
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,380
The other company is insolvent.

484
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,500
If we,

485
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,140
as the guarantor,

486
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,620
have to bear the responsibility

487
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,940
of paying back the loan,

488
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:26,900
our capital chain

489
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,500
will go seriously wrong.

490
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,420
Therefore,

491
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,140
you've done a great job

492
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,420
in winning

493
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,900
this case.

494
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,460
I owe you one.

495
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,220
Don't say that, Mr. Fang.

496
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,420
I just did

497
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,700
what an attorney should do.

498
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,260
Speaking of that,

499
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,860
I think I owe you one.

500
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:44,980
Did you forget

501
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,580
that I broke your motorcycle
when I rode it

502
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,180
in the earthquake-stricken area?

503
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,820
You haven't asked me

504
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,220
for compensation yet.

505
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,100
Well, Mr. Luo,

506
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,500
you're not just good at your job,

507
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,660
you're also a good conversationalist.

508
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,420
We need to talk more often.

509
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:00,660
Then I'm looking forward to

510
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,260
further cooperation with you, Mr. Fang.

511
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:02,900
No problem.

512
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,500
Chairman, there is a call for you.

513
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:07,900
Excuse me.

514
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,500
What's the matter, Lansheng?

515
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:11,820
What?

516
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,180
Okay, I'll be right there.

517
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,180
My child is missing.

518
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:21,980
Jiejie!

519
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,180
- Jiejie!
- Jiejie!

520
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,260
- Jiejie!
- Jiejie!

521
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,140
Jiejie!

522
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,820
Switch to the lounge room.

523
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,220
Okay.

524
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,340
It's Jiejie.

525
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,420
It's my fault.

526
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,460
How did I fall asleep?

527
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,900
We don't know

528
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,180
where he went.

529
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:54,700
What if...

530
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,740
What if he is in danger...

531
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,180
Don't scare yourself.

532
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,700
I've called the police.

533
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,900
Jiejie will be fine.

534
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,900
No, I have to go find him.

535
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,740
- Lansheng!
- I'm going to find him!

536
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,260
Manager.

537
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,420
Let me take a look at the drone footage.

538
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,100
Pause.

539
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:29,580
Zoom in.

540
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,860
Look, it's the boy's balloon.

541
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,420
He must still be at the stadium.

542
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,380
Keep looking for him.

543
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,180
I'll go check it out.

544
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:42,900
Okay.

545
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,140
The wind comes from
the southeast today.

546
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,380
The wind speed is
of category three to four,

547
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,620
which means the wind is

548
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,660
blowing towards the northwest

549
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,900
at six to eight meters per second.

550
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,140
The footage shows

551
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,660
that the last time he showed up

552
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,060
was 16 minutes ago.

553
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,980
(Construction Ahead, Stay safe)

554
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,180
Jiejie!

555
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,660
Jiejie!

556
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,420
Jiejie!

557
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,220
Jiejie!

558
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:46,900
Mr. Fang.

559
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,420
I think I found Jiejie.

560
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,260
Jiejie!

561
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,060
- Jiejie!
- Mr. Fang.

562
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,180
Be careful!

563
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:54,820
Mr. Fang.

564
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,660
Jiejie might have fallen down.

565
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,140
We bought

566
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,620
this place

567
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,620
to develop it.

568
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,260
For safety,

569
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,900
there is always a safety net.

570
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:06,660
Well...

571
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,060
We don't know

572
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,180
how this kid got in here.

573
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,100
Listen,

574
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,420
if anything happens

575
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,700
to my son,

576
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,060
I won't let you go!

577
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:14,900
Well, Mr. Fang...

578
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,420
Sorry.

579
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,860
We need to make sure

580
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,260
if the child fell into the hole first.

581
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,900
We've called the fire brigade.

582
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:22,420
Mr. Fang.

583
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:23,660
I suggest we call

584
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,380
the Light Chaser Rescue
at the same time.

585
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,180
They have a professional rope team

586
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,460
who can go straight down into the hole.

587
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,260
Okay.

588
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,140
Good.

589
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:30,900
Good.

590
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:32,940
Jiejie.

591
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,860
It's all right.

592
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,620
Hello, This is Light Chaser Rescue.

593
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,060
(Light Chase Rescue)

594
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,580
(I've left the hospital.)

595
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,380
(I know a good noodle restaurant.)

596
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,860
(It's on the way
to the express station.)

597
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,140
(How about we eat there together?)

598
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,660
(I'm out on a mission.)

599
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,420
(It's okay.)

600
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,860
(I have nothing to do anyway.)

601
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,180
(I'll be here waiting for you.)

602
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,100
(I don't know how long it will take.)

603
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,420
(Don't wait for me.)

604
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:33,820
Is it here?

605
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:34,980
Right here.

606
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:35,420
Okay.

607
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,580
Captain.

608
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,180
The hole is 15 meters deep.

609
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,860
15 meters. That's deep.

610
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,260
Mr. Fang.

611
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,940
After our evaluation and judgment,

612
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:50,740
we decide

613
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,980
to carry out

614
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:52,740
this mission

615
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,900
with the Light Chaser Rescue.

616
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,820
It will take the shortest time

617
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,700
with the highest success rate.

618
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:56,660
Mr. Fang.

619
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,340
I've personally been
in one of the rescue operations

620
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,660
of the Light Chaser Rescue.

621
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,660
I trust them.

622
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:02,980
Please rest assured.

623
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,700
Captain Qingshan.

624
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,580
I don't know much about rescue,

625
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:08,460
but you must

626
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,900
save my son, please.

627
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,180
We're working on it.

628
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,820
The hole is 15 meters deep,

629
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,900
but there is security inside the hole.

630
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,180
Although in disrepair

631
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:16,980
and not solid anymore,

632
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,100
it still served

633
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:18,860
as a buffer.

634
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,220
Okay.

635
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,500
Don't worry, Mr. Fang.

636
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,180
Well, is it tight enough?

637
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:35,500
Yes.

638
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,180
Okay.

639
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,980
Stay safe.

640
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,060
Get the kid out as fast as you can.

641
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:43,620
Yes.

642
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,180
Okay. Put it on.

643
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,420
It's on.

644
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,380
Be careful.

645
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,060
Be careful!

646
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:01,660
Drop him down.

647
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,420
Come on.

648
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,060
Get ready! One, two, pull!

649
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,620
One, two, pull!

650
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,660
One, two, pull!

651
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:25,980
Pull!

652
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,100
One, two, pull!

653
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:27,820
Pull!

654
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,580
Come over.

655
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,220
Pull the rope.

656
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,580
Pull the rope.

657
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,500
Jiejie!

658
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,100
Hold it. Hurry.

659
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,820
Go to the safety zone.

660
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:45,340
Come on. Slowly.

661
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,220
Come on. Slowly.

662
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:47,380
Put him down.

663
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:47,820
Let him go.

664
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,660
Be careful.

665
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,980
Stretcher!

666
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:56,420
Jiejie.

667
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,500
- How are you doing, bro?
- It's okay.

668
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:57,900
Hurry.

669
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,100
Thank you.

670
00:28:59,220 --> 00:28:59,660
Be careful.

671
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,580
Oxygen!

672
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,100
Hurry!

673
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,260
Hurry up!

674
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,340
- Go!
- Be careful!

675
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:04,660
Okay.

676
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,180
Come on.

677
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,180
Xiong Fei is still down there.

678
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:17,420
Come on.

679
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:28,900
Pull the rope.

680
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:29,900
Are you okay?

681
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,460
I'm fine.

682
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,100
I'm leaving, Hai.

683
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:41,980
Okay.

684
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:42,900
Take care.

685
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,500
Okay.

686
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,460
(SSD Express)
Drive safely.

687
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:45,900
I'm leaving.

688
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,900
All right.

689
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,380
See you tomorrow, Hai.

690
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,140
Go to rest early.

691
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:49,620
Okay!

692
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,660
Be careful!

693
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,340
Okay.

694
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,140
Bye, Hai.

695
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,100
Okay.

696
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,180
Stay safe.

697
00:29:59,060 --> 00:29:59,860
Bye, Hai.

698
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,100
Little girl.

699
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,180
Are you here to pick up your delivery?

700
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:09,980
Are you looking for someone?

701
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,700
Who are you looking for?

702
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:15,620
Look,

703
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,100
we're off work.

704
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,100
Why don't you

705
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,220
come back tomorrow?

706
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,180
(I know a good noodle restaurant.)

707
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,660
(It's on the way
to the express station.)

708
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:55,940
(How about we eat there together?)

709
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:27,740
(SSD Express)

710
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,620
It's late. Why are you still here?

711
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:48,700
Let me take you back.

712
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,940
Don't

713
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,580
come to me again.

714
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:00,820
You know that your brother

715
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,980
doesn't want us to keep in touch.

716
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,660
He always thinks too much.

717
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,500
He thought I was gonna
fall in love with you.

718
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,260
You don't feel the same way, do you?

719
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,700
No.

720
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,420
Do you think
the noodle restaurant is still open?

721
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,180
Have a try. Just...

722
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,660
Eat slowly. Okay?

723
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,820
What would you like to eat?

724
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,180
- Pork liver noodles?
- I'll have pork liver noodles.

725
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:01,980
Okay, I'll order it.

726
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:06,340
Bro.

727
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,460
I'll have two bowls
of pork liver noodles.

728
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,820
(Brother)
- Okay. - One spicy

729
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:10,420
and one not spicy.

730
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,420
All right, just a minute.

731
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,940
(I'll be home soon.)

732
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,180
(Don't bother me.)

733
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,100
It'll be ready soon. Wait a minute.

734
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,420
The not spicy noodles are for you.

735
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:38,900
You just had surgery.

736
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,900
You'd better not eat spicy food.

737
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,260
Do you also like vinegar?

738
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,740
Do you want some more?

739
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,420
There you go. Okay.

740
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,500
(Brother)

741
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,620
Come on, let's get you home.

742
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,180
Get on.

743
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,060
Sit well.

744
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,460
Yuan.

745
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,260
Where have you been?

746
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,860
Why are you back so late?

747
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:55,660
Brother.

748
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,140
You're still up.

749
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,380
You hung up on me.

750
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,340
Do you have any idea

751
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,180
how dangerous it is

752
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,700
for a girl to be out alone

753
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,580
this late at night?

754
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,580
If you're back any later,

755
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,660
I'm gonna call the police.

756
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:07,940
Brother.

757
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,340
When are you gonna

758
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,700
find a sister-in-law for me?

759
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,220
Why do you mention that all of a sudden?

760
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,460
Yuan.

761
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:15,980
Hey.

762
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,460
Is she going through a rebellious phase?

763
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,940
Thank you, Grandma Qin.

764
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,300
Thank you, Mr. Luo.

765
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,020
You're welcome.

766
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,180
Well done.

767
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,060
In this way,

768
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,540
you're the one who saved Mr. Fang's son.

769
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,660
The legal counsel of the Fangqin Group

770
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,780
will definitely be you.

771
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,620
Mr. Fang didn't say anything about that.

772
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,700
Mr. Fang owes you a big one.

773
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,180
It's only a matter of time for him
to return your favor.

774
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,100
We can't count on favors
to reach a deal.

775
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,780
I know,

776
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,780
but humans are

777
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,060
emotional animals.

778
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,180
What's happening right now

779
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,220
reminds me of the time

780
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,460
when we had our first case.

781
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:42,500
Was I really stupid

782
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,580
at that time?

783
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,620
I believed that God rewards
those who work hard,

784
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,740
and I could succeed
as long as I work hard.

785
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,100
But the truth is

786
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:51,980
it's all about

787
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,300
the right place at the right time.

788
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,780
Sometimes,

789
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,580
luck is also part of strength.

790
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,060
At that time,

791
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,700
He and Gao Junchi told me about

792
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,140
your glorious deeds all the time.

793
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,180
They did like

794
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,380
your dedication and persistence.

795
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,100
You were always the first one to come

796
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,100
and the last one to leave.

797
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,620
You also squatted downstairs,

798
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,820
eating instant noodles
and going through the info.

799
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,140
I remember

800
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,460
your first case

801
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,820
was against

802
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:19,860
the most famous attorney.

803
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,060
Everybody thought

804
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:21,980
you were gonna lose.

805
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,380
Even the client

806
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,700
asked He to replace you.

807
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,860
Gao Junchi was ready
to take the case over,

808
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,780
but you convinced He

809
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:29,740
on your own.

810
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,580
You got the evidence

811
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,820
and won the case.

812
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,700
That's why

813
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:35,940
Gao Junchi and I

814
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:36,980
started a feud.

815
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,300
But seriously,

816
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:41,780
the reason I chose you

817
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,100
to be my partner

818
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,220
instead of Gao Junchi

819
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:46,020
is because I thought

820
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,100
you had a more promising future.

821
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,300
Well,

822
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,700
I hope you're not disappointed.

823
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,180
Of course not.

824
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,620
You exceeded my expectations.

825
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,220
That's all for today's training.

826
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,020
Dismiss!

827
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,620
Bro, your wife is here.

828
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:02,980
Are you here to pick up Dapeng?

829
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:03,540
Good to see you.

830
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:04,780
Darling.

831
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:05,700
What are you doing here?

832
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,300
I'm here to see Captain Ruan.

833
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:08,580
Wait, why would you want to see her?

834
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,460
Just go. Go home.

835
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,260
Don't touch me. Get out of my way!

836
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,460
You brat.

837
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,540
Have you been a jerk again?

838
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:33,980
Have some water.

839
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,220
All these years,

840
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:46,780
I've been supporting him

841
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:47,780
no matter what he does,

842
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:50,980
but he doesn't

843
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:53,860
care about me

844
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:54,860
nor our family anymore.

845
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,660
I think we should

846
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,540
get a divorce.

847
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,030
I understand.

848
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,100
Is it because

849
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,180
Dapeng has been on mission too often?

850
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:10,740
Well,

851
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:11,780
I'll talk to him.

852
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:12,500
Dapeng.

853
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:15,020
- Your wife is really pissed.
- I'll ask him not to take every task.

854
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,020
You have to take this seriously.

855
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,180
As for the tutoring thing,

856
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,860
you should ask her to let it go.

857
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,580
Even a professor at Peking University

858
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:27,340
might not be able

859
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,020
to get his child into Peking University.

860
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:29,660
Right?

861
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,180
All right. Stop listening.

862
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,180
Come on, let's go.

863
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:37,980
Let's hear it for a while.

864
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,300
Take care.

865
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,260
He broke my heart.

866
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:50,940
Well...

867
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,100
Just coax her.

868
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,140
I'm not

869
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,020
a selfish person.

870
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,300
I just can't figure out

871
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:04,980
how come a man

872
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,180
who can't even take care
of his own family

873
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,460
has the right to save other people?

874
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,020
You're right.

875
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,980
Our principle

876
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,580
is that participating
in non-profit rescue

877
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:20,820
requires the support of one's family.

878
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,380
How about this,

879
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,700
we will make Dapeng

880
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:25,860
take a month off

881
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:28,060
and keep him away
from rescue missions and training.

882
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:28,700
No.

883
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,260
That's not what I meant.

884
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,540
I won't quit the rescue team.

885
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:33,180
Dapeng.

886
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,020
You must obey

887
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,500
our order in this matter.

888
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,220
It was my fault

889
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,020
that I forgot our wedding anniversary.

890
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,300
It was also my fault that I failed

891
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:06,540
to help you with the housework.

892
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:08,020
But now that we're married,

893
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,500
you can't bring up divorce.

894
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,820
This is the lipstick

895
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,180
you failed to snap up

896
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,540
in the online studio last time.

897
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:27,660
It was the last one in the mall.

898
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,180
I bought it.

899
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,620
It's too expensive in the mall.

900
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,220
So what?

901
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:41,740
As long as my wife likes it,

902
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:42,700
I would buy it no matter
how expensive it is.

903
