16
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,780
It's good

17
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:08,620
to see you again.

18
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,860
Unless you die in the fire,

19
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,420
you have to

20
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,820
keep watching me.

21
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,340
Is that

22
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,500
a confession in your way?

23
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,180
That's quite special.

24
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,820
Can you consider my feelings

25
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,500
when you rescue people
in such a situation

26
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,820
next time?

27
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,300
Have you cried?

28
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,020
What did they say?

29
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,340
Is my leg injury serious?

30
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,340
Will I be able to stand up again?

31
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,180
Do you trust me?

32
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,620
Will I be able to stand up again?

33
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,340
Yes.

34
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,020
Zhan Yan.

35
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,900
I want you to be honest with me.

36
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,660
Whatever the situation

37
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,060
or the result is,

38
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,060
I can take it.

39
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,180
You might need to

40
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,380
have amputation.

41
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,460
I see.

42
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,340
Is there another way?

43
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,060
It's the safest option.

44
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,500
I don't want safety.

45
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,060
I want my leg.

46
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,180
Has the operation been scheduled yet?

47
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,340
It can't be put off any longer.

48
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,140
I'll be with you the whole time.

49
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,580
Leave me alone

50
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,900
for a moment.

51
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,580
I'm fine.

52
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,620
I'm always there.

53
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,060
I'll come to see you later.

54
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,820
The formalities are all done.

55
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:16,620
Yuan.

56
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,380
Yuan, it's gonna be okay.

57
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:23,940
I don't know

58
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,820
what to do

59
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,020
if you're being like this.

60
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,340
It's okay.

61
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,020
I'll recover soon.

62
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:39,820
Luo Ben.

63
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,820
It's time to get into
the operating room.

64
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,020
You should leave.

65
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,140
We'll be waiting for you.

66
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,580
Hold on.

67
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,580
I've checked his test results.

68
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,100
He was treated promptly

69
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,250
and the injury didn't get worse.

70
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,220
Although his leg was severely damaged

71
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,340
and showed signs of ischemia,

72
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,580
it did not last long.

73
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,140
As long as we treat it in time

74
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:14,380
with wound reconstruction
and decompression,

75
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,260
and dredge the vessels

76
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,580
to restore blood flow,

77
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,500
combined with a series of

78
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,620
subsequent treatments,

79
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,820
tissue necrosis can be avoided

80
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,190
and most of the functions

81
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,460
of the affected limb can be preserved.

82
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,140
If we adopt

83
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,500
Dr. Zhan's approach,

84
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,820
you don't have to be amputated,

85
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,260
but I have to tell you

86
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,700
that Dr. Zhan's approach

87
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,780
is risky.

88
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,940
If it fails,

89
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,460
your life will be in danger.

90
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,620
Mr. Luo.

91
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,940
It's your choice.

92
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,500
I trust Zhan Yan.

93
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,020
Mr. Qiu.

94
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,070
I suggest

95
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:50,940
that we invite Professors Sun

96
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,700
and Jiang from the Sixth Hospital

97
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,380
to guide and join the operation.

98
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:55,900
They're the top orthopedic specialists

99
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:56,780
in China.

100
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,020
With them on board,

101
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,500
we'll have a better chance of success.

102
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,900
Thank you, Mr. Wei.

103
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,700
I'll contact these two experts.

104
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,780
You get ready for surgery.

105
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,260
To be honest,

106
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,380
I'm not 100% sure.

107
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,140
My trust in you

108
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,700
is 100%.

109
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,700
But what if...

110
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,020
I mean, what if

111
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,020
it fails?

112
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,380
I won't regret it.

113
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,380
I'm gonna face it with you

114
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,220
no matter how the operation turns out.

115
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,220
If it succeeds,

116
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,540
I'll help you through
the rehabilitation training.

117
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,300
If it fails,

118
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,820
I'll be your leg.

119
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:49,980
It won't fail.

120
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,700
(Luo Ben)

121
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,060
Go sit down for a while.

122
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,340
Let's go.

123
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,540
How is it, doctor?

124
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,660
The surgery was a success.

125
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,980
The blood supply is stable.

126
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,300
Thank you.

127
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:52,860
Thank you.

128
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:53,340
You're welcome.

129
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:57,940
That's great.

130
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,660
I'm fine.

131
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,180
Have some more sleep.

132
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,420
These two weeks after surgery
are critical.

133
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,220
I have to check

134
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,940
your blood supply every hour.

135
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,740
How am I doing now?

136
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,220
Very good.

137
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,340
Lie down next to me for a while.

138
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,540
Slowly.

139
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,220
Come here.

140
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,460
What are you thinking about?

141
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,060
You.

142
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,700
I'm thinking

143
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,460
what if the operation failed

144
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,220
and you had to get amputated.

145
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,300
I'll live my life bravely

146
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,460
and I won't be your burden.

147
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,980
I knew

148
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,820
you would dump me.

149
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,460
I'm supposed to have your back.

150
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,300
How could I let myself drag you down?

151
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,580
That's my bottom line

152
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,460
and my dignity.

153
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,420
You won't have a chance anyway.

154
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,820
No matter what happens,

155
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,580
I'm not gonna let you dump me.

156
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,540
(Linjiang Central Hospital)

157
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,460
The cause of the warehouse fire

158
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,740
has been found.

159
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,580
A guy was smoking in the warehouse

160
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,740
and throwing cigarette butts around.

161
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,060
Not only that,

162
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,180
he also teamed up with someone

163
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,340
to steal goods from the warehouse

164
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,700
and sell them under the table.

165
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:11,940
Are you talking about

166
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,660
the two people I saved?

167
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,180
See?

168
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:15,820
It's not worth the damage

169
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,060
you went through

170
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,860
to save such two people, isn't it?

171
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,580
I saved them. They committed a crime.

172
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,820
These are two different things.

173
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:22,860
The law will punish them

174
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,420
as they deserve.

175
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,860
So they did it.

176
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,180
I knew Qiangzi was wronged.

177
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,820
Their director

178
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,860
accused Qiangzi of stealing the goods.

179
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,230
Just because he was in prison before,

180
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,580
he takes the blame every time
when bad things happen.

181
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,740
Qiangzi almost died

182
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,060
trying to save me.

183
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,060
He's still in the hospital right now.

184
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,820
But no one would believe

185
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,540
he can become a better person,

186
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,700
and no one cares what he did.

187
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,820
Mrs. Xiong.

188
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,820
Mrs. Xiong, why are you here?

189
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,580
I'm sorry.

190
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,060
I shouldn't be prejudiced against you.

191
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:43,740
Mrs. Xiong.

192
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,340
I'm the one who should say sorry.

193
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,580
I should say sorry.

194
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,300
Thank you for saving Xiong Fei.

195
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,700
Why did Xiong tell you that?

196
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,340
It's nothing.

197
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,420
From now on,

198
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,060
in addition to Xiong Fei,

199
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,820
I'm also your friend,

200
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:29,940
okay?

201
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,680
Of course, Mrs. Xiong.

202
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,380
Well, Dingding hasn't

203
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,100
been back for days.

204
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,900
Do you think

205
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,460
we're too indulgent?

206
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,420
Here she is.

207
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,780
I'll open the door.

208
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,260
Who are you looking for?

209
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,220
I'm Zhou Mingming's mother.

210
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,900
You are Zhou's mother.

211
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,420
Honey, Mrs. Zhou is here.

212
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,300
Please come in.

213
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,980
Mrs. Zhou, please come in.

214
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:00,700
Come on.

215
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,020
Mrs. Zhou, have a seat.

216
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:02,590
Have a seat.

217
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,180
Sit down.

218
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:03,900
Bring some water.

219
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:05,940
Don't bother.

220
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,140
I only have a few words to say.

221
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,180
Please.

222
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,980
I'll cut to the chase, then.

223
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,700
I want you to talk to Dingding

224
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,660
and ask her to leave my son.

225
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,260
They're not the right one
for each other.

226
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,540
May I ask why?

227
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,100
Since Mingming was born,

228
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,740
I've been giving him the best thing,

229
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,420
and I want

230
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,140
the best for him

231
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,980
in terms of his marriage.

232
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,940
Clearly,

233
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,660
your daughter, Dingding,

234
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,660
is not the right person.

235
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,260
May I ask

236
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,100
how do you define the best?

237
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,300
In a family like ours,

238
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,220
I want to find him a suitable match

239
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,660
who can help him, and he can help her.

240
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,460
You mean

241
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,780
a marriage of convenience, I guess.

242
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,660
You don't understand.

243
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,940
Running a business
that can be passed down

244
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,220
involves sacrificing time and freedom,

245
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,780
and even health.

246
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,260
Love is insignificant

247
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,140
in front of that.

248
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,460
Mingming

249
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,740
will have to take
his responsibility one day.

250
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,460
Even if I don't interfere,

251
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,460
reality will push him

252
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,660
to make a choice.

253
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,220
We don't agree

254
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,300
with your theory.

255
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,860
This is your family affair.

256
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,180
Just like how we educated our child.

257
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,500
We raised Dingding

258
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,420
in an environment

259
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,660
without any restraints

260
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,460
and taught her to do what she wants.

261
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,540
Now she has grown up.

262
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,180
We're gonna

263
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,300
let her love

264
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,180
whoever she wants.

265
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,220
Do you understand?

266
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,100
I had my son's life

267
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,260
planned out

268
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,260
elaborately.

269
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,980
That's why

270
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,740
I won't allow some girl

271
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,700
to affect his future

272
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,460
just like that.

273
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,700
Then I'm also telling you

274
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:04,940
that our daughter

275
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,260
didn't grow up just like that.

276
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,500
She is also

277
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,620
the most precious person to us.

278
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,300
No one can equal her.

279
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,860
That's great.

280
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,100
Let us

281
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,940
cherish our own children.

282
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,140
Thank you.

283
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,420
Alright.

284
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:22,780
It's okay.

285
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,500
I can walk by myself.

286
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:56,900
Be careful.

287
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,460
I'm not familiar with housework.

288
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,620
It kind of

289
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,660
got messy today.

290
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,020
I'll get used to it tomorrow.

291
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,180
You should

292
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,140
get used to being the hostess

293
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,180
as soon as possible.

294
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,020
You wish.

295
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:22,900
I'm not gonna be any hostess.

296
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:23,700
I don't care.

297
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,020
It has to be you.

298
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,220
You're a little different today,

299
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,940
but I like it.

300
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,620
That's your bedtime story?

301
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,260
It's just

302
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:59,380
a normal men's magazine.

303
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:04,480
Turns out you like

304
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,260
this kind of stuff.

305
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,860
Getting too excited

306
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,940
is not good for wound healing.

307
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,540
What...

308
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,700
What are you talking about?

309
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,380
Dr. Zhan.

310
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,540
It's not what you think.

311
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:14,940
Dr. Zhan.

312
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:15,740
I'll take it.

313
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,980
Go to sleep early.

314
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:19,460
Are you gonna walk away

315
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,460
from a patient?

316
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,420
Yeah.

317
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,020
I need someone to take care of me.

318
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,510
Drop the idea.

319
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:25,940
I'll sleep in Luo Yuan's room.

320
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,940
Mom, Dad. I'm back.

321
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,380
Is it a bad time?

322
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,860
You're back just in time.

323
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,020
Your dad and I

324
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,500
were about to come to you.

325
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,300
I didn't expect

326
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,460
that she would come here.

327
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,780
Actually,

328
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,220
your dad and I

329
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:08,980
were hesitant about

330
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,500
telling you this.

331
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:11,740
Mom.

332
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,260
You should have

333
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,260
told me in the first place

334
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,380
and let me deal with her.

335
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,940
We were afraid you'd be too impulsive.

336
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:19,700
Dad, Mom, well...

337
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,100
You just stay out of this.

338
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,660
I'll take care of it.

339
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,780
Dingding,

340
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,780
you know, your dad and I

341
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,180
gave you plenty of freedom

342
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,300
as you were growing up.

343
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,140
In the eyes of others,

344
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,220
you didn't get into a good college

345
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,940
and didn't get a good job.

346
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:38,940
They think

347
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,620
you're our biggest failure

348
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,140
in education,

349
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,860
but we don't think so.

350
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,020
We love you.

351
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,460
We want to give you

352
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,940
the best education,

353
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:50,740
which is seeing you

354
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,020
work,

355
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,220
live,

356
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,380
and love

357
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,380
the way you want.

358
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,220
Zhou

359
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,780
is a nice kid,

360
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:07,980
but

361
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,260
if you want

362
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,740
to get married to him,

363
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:11,540
it's not just

364
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,460
about the two of you.

365
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,100
It's about

366
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,380
these two families.

367
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,380
Zhou's mother

368
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,780
doesn't respect you

369
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,660
and our family.

370
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,220
I'm afraid

371
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,700
you won't be happy with Zhou.

372
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,180
Dear.

373
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,940
Your mother and I

374
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,940
are just giving you a piece of advice.

375
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,980
You have to

376
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,460
make your own decision.

377
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,300
You need to design

378
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,540
the press conference.

379
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,900
Ask the reporters questions

380
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:51,460
relevant to...

381
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,100
Ding Dingding.

382
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:53,620
Ding Dingding.

383
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,780
Ding Dingding, what are you doing?

384
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:55,300
Miss Li.

385
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,540
This is not your business.

386
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,100
You can't just go in there.

387
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,100
Ding Dingding!

388
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,380
Didn't your parents teach you

389
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,740
to knock first?

390
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,140
Sorry, ma'am.

391
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,180
I'll...

392
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,180
Mrs. Zhou.

393
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,380
You are Mingming's mother,

394
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,460
and I respect you.

395
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,700
It's fine

396
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,660
with me

397
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,740
that you don't like me,

398
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,230
but you have no right

399
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:24,700
to insult my parents.

400
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:25,980
Insult?

401
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,980
Isn't that word too serious?

402
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,260
I think

403
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,220
I had an open conversation

404
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,540
with your parents.

405
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,740
I made my point

406
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,220
and my appeal.

407
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,620
I was just doing my duty

408
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,500
as a mother.

409
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,780
I hope they can

410
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,220
also discipline you

411
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,380
as your parents.

412
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,220
My parents aren't

413
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,620
as selfish as you are.

414
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,180
You treat your son

415
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,460
as tradable property,

416
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,540
asking Mingming to live

417
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,900
the way you want,

418
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,300
making him do things he doesn't want to

419
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,660
and love people he doesn't like.

420
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,980
The best education

421
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,220
from my parents

422
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,220
is that I grew up

423
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,700
happily and freely.

424
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,220
That's why

425
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,220
they raised you like this.

426
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,940
No manners, no breeding.

427
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:10,940
I created a good life

428
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,700
for Mingming

429
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,500
so that he would be able to reject

430
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,540
the unsuitable things.

431
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,700
You are

432
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,420
the unsuitable thing now.

433
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,220
Of course,

434
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,420
you've spent a lot of time with my son.

435
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,380
I won't let you get nothing out of it.

436
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:48,980
Please leave.

437
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,700
Is this what you call breeding?

438
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:54,940
I see.

439
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,980
Chu Yun, here!

440
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:29,940
Here.

441
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:56,700
What's wrong?

442
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:00,740
Where does it hurt?

443
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:02,620
It's okay.

444
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,220
I was just trying to

445
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,620
practice walking.

446
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:09,460
Keep it straight.

447
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,220
I told you

448
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,700
you can't rush the rehabilitation.

449
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,140
You have to do it slowly.

450
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,740
It was too slow.

451
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:18,900
When am I gonna

452
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,500
get back on the team at this rate?

453
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,260
Are you still thinking about
rescuing people being like this?

454
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,180
I must be the most professional

455
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,900
and the best rescuer.

456
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,580
Does it sound

457
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,020
a handicapped pep talk for myself?

458
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,220
Don't be ridiculous.

459
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,540
In your condition,

460
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,300
it's not hard

461
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,380
to walk normally again.

462
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,340
It's just

463
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,700
it might take you a while

464
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,100
having rehabilitation training

465
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,100
to be able to do rescue work again.

466
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,540
I know.

467
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,060
Actually,

468
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,820
I'm lucky enough

469
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,100
to save my leg.

470
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:05,980
I can

471
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:08,020
put you with

472
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:11,500
a really good rehabilitation teacher,

473
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:16,780
but he is kind of tough.

474
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,860
I don't know if you can take it.

475
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:22,820
Who is it?

476
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:28,220
Relax your waist. Loosen up.

477
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,780
That's right. Good.

478
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,540
Can you be gentle?

479
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:37,260
Are you worried about him?
It's just the beginning.

480
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,820
I'm fine. It's no big deal.

481
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,220
The rehabilitation just got started.

482
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,220
Can't you take one step at a time?

483
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,580
Don't worry.

484
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,180
I know what I'm doing.

485
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,540
You're not the one in pain.

486
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,500
Luo Ben.

487
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,260
Maybe we should stop.

488
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,980
Someone can't bear seeing you

489
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,340
go through this.

490
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,060
Zhan Yan. Why don't you

491
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,780
take a walk outside?

492
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,300
Come on.

493
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,100
Well done, boy.

494
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,300
You made a girl

495
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,020
care about you so much.

496
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:15,980
I do have

497
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,020
some charm.

498
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,260
Yeah?

499
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,020
Let me see

500
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,300
your charm.

501
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,500
I'm feeling it.

502
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,020
Bear with it.

503
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,100
Easy! Captain, it's gonna break.

504
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,580
One more time.

505
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,780
Relax.

506
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,540
Yes, I am.

507
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,300
What a rich meal.

508
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,580
Editor Gao.

509
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,300
Slowly.

510
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:50,740
Okay.

511
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:51,540
What's the matter?

512
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:54,780
That's great.

513
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:57,780
What is this?

514
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,260
Throat lozenge.

515
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,380
Why would I need this?

516
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,860
Okay.

517
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,620
You screamed so loud

518
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,380
that everyone in the yard heard it.

519
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,700
Thank you very much.

520
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,260
I'll be there as soon as I can.

521
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,060
Yan.

522
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,940
We found something about that kid.

523
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,740
Do we know who the adopter is?

524
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:21,980
I just got a call.

525
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,220
There is a lead on him.

526
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,540
Not from the adopter,

527
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,100
it's the chief editor of a newspaper.

528
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,060
What kid?

529
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,460
The kid my dad saved

530
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,860
in that earthquake.

531
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,740
Are you looking for him?

532
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:33,780
Yes.

533
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:35,620
After I gave him

534
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,340
to the paramedics,

535
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,180
they put him in a welfare center

536
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,980
and I've never heard about him again.

537
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,300
You're looking for him

538
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,540
because...

539
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,100
I want to

540
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,300
make this...

541
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:50,820
Dad.

542
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,060
Well, the team is busy now,

543
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,580
and you need to help him with the rehab.

544
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,620
I'll go

545
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:57,620
to see the editor.

546
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:58,460
Okay.

547
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,340
I'll send you the address later.

548
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,460
Let's eat now.

549
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,460
Here, Captain.

550
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:03,300
Okay.

551
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:03,780
Let's eat.

552
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,780
I've asked Dapeng

553
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,100
to take you to rehab

554
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,300
in the next few days.

555
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,580
Ding Dingding
will take care of your meals.

556
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:14,780
If you need someone,

557
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,580
you can ask Xiong Fei or Yuan

558
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,100
to stay with you for a few days.

559
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:18,620
Okay?

560
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:19,620
All right.

561
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,380
It's not like you'll be gone
for three years.

562
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:24,580
Can't we get past this?

563
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,620
If it's good there,

564
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,820
I might stay and not come back.

565
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,820
Just go ahead.

566
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:32,780
I give you my word.

567
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,460
I'll get down to the rehab training.

568
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:36,780
Okay.

569
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,580
Well, be good.

570
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,860
Have a safe journey.
I'll be waiting for you.

571
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,620
Bye.

572
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,900
(A Civilian Hero in the Earthquake
Zhan Qingshan)

573
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,660
I have memories of this.

574
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,740
It was from a public contributor.

575
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,980
The editor reported it to me

576
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,140
when he received it.

577
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,300
Then I had the report

578
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,820
written right away.

579
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,060
Can you still

580
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:27,780
get in touch with

581
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,500
this contributor?

582
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,580
The contributor is not
a professional photographer.

583
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,700
He just captured

584
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:38,060
this precious moment in the earthquake

585
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,140
and

586
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,780
sent it to the newspaper office.

587
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,260
How about his contact information?

588
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,060
Can you find it?

589
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,780
He sent it by letter.

590
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,460
We didn't store it digitally.

591
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:56,380
Later, the newspaper office
moved several times.

592
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,260
We didn't keep

593
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,580
the contact information

594
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,260
of these public contributors.

595
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:02,900
Isn't there

596
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,380
another way?

597
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,300
I can ask

598
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:08,140
my old colleagues.

599
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,180
But,

600
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:11,300
don't get your hopes up too high.

601
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,460
Thank you.

602
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:15,820
Oh, right,

603
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,300
it occurred to me

604
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,780
that those rescued orphans

605
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,700
were housed

606
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,460
in the aid station
of the Civil Affairs Bureau

607
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:24,600
before they were sent to

608
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,380
different welfare homes.

609
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:31,260
You can ask about it at the aid station.

610
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,660
The aid station...

611
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:36,180
Okay, thank you.

612
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:37,780
You're welcome.

613
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:40,180
Well?

614
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,300
I'm much better now.

615
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,660
Your cast is off?

616
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,380
Yes.

617
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,860
He is doing better.
He can walk on his own now.

618
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,100
Look at you.

619
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,860
Aren't you a little inconsiderate

620
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:53,980
to dress so cool

621
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,620
when you're here to pick me up?

622
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,980
Dr. Zhan said

623
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,500
we have to provide Mr. Luo

624
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,900
with the best service.

625
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:01,730
Let's go.

626
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:02,120
You need

627
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,820
extra protection now.

628
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,260
Come on, get in the car.

629
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,180
(Starlight Relief Center)

630
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,300
The earthquake orphans

631
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,220
were sent to different welfare homes

632
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,860
through the aid station,

633
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,580
but you don't know the name or origin

634
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,060
of the child you're looking for.

635
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:19,740
You only have

636
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,100
a piece of vague newspaper.

637
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,700
There isn't much we can do.

638
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,300
Which welfare homes

639
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,140
were these kids sent to?

640
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,660
Is there any record of the transfer?

641
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,580
Yes. Hold on a minute.

642
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,100
(Thanks to you, Dr. Zhan,)

643
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:36,740
(everyone on the team has come)

644
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,780
(to take care of me these days.)

645
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,980
(Cherish it.)

646
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:42,680
(You won't have such treatment)

647
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,180
(when you recover.)

648
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,900
(How much longer
are you gonna stay there?)

649
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,340
(I miss you.)

650
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,300
(I'll be back today.)

651
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,100
This is a copy

652
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:58,820
of the transfer record.

653
00:37:58,980 --> 00:37:59,460
Take a look.

654
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:01,420
Thank you.

655
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,180
You're welcome.

658
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,460
(You've changed.)

659
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,900
(You don't reply to me immediately now.)

660

(I'm so bored.)

661
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,060
(Text me back.)

662
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,420
(What are you doing?)

663
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:08,020
(Zhou Mingming)

664
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:20,500
Hello.

665
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,220
What are you doing?

666
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,380
Why didn't you text me back?

667
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,620
Are you busy?

668
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,500
We should break up.

669
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:55,660
(Ding Xiaoxiao, will you marry me?)

670
00:39:55,660 --> 00:40:03,180
(Yes.)

671
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,060
Dingding!

672
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:09,740
Dingding!

673
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,580
Ding Dingding!

674
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:14,990
Dingding, I know you're home.

675
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,740
Open the door.

676
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:18,580
Dingding, I need to talk to you.

677
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:19,660
Open the door, Dingding.

678
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:20,660
Zhou Mingming.

679
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:21,500
I have nothing to say

680
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,580
to you.

681
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,140
Just open the door, Dingding!

682
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:25,740
Dingding, open the door.

683
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:26,740
I have something to say, Dingding.

684
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,220
Why break up with me?

685
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,300
I don't like you anymore.

686
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,420
You are lying.

687
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:38,900
How could you

688
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,340
stop liking me all of a sudden?

689
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,860
What did I do wrong?

690
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,300
Are you running out of
romance material again?

691
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,180
Just tell me, and I'll figure it out.

692
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,100
Don't break up with me like that.

693
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:46,740
This is bad.

694
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:47,980
I don't need anything.

695
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:48,740
Love is something

696
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:49,900
you can't explain.

697
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,260
It comes and goes.

698
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:52,740
I don't agree to break up with you.

699
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,260
It doesn't matter
whether you agree or not.

700
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,620
Don't come to me again.

701
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:56,340
You should leave.

702
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,300
I'm going to draw.

703
00:40:58,780 --> 00:40:59,460
I'm not going anywhere today

704
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,820
until you tell me why.

705
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,980
Did my mom come to you again?

706
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:09,500
Did she come?

707
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:11,980
What did she say to you?

708
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:13,740
Say something, Dingding!

709
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:14,620
Your mother paid me

710
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,220
to leave you.

711
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:18,300
That's the way she is.

712
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,580
There is no need
to get angry because of her.

713
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:20,780
I'm not angry.

714
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,260
I took the money.

715
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,620
So I must break up with you.

716
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:27,260
Don't lie to me.

717
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,460
That's not who you are.

718
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,140
That's who I am.

719
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,060
I love money more than I love you.

720
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:31,780
Are you satisfied now?

721
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,260
No!

722
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:34,980
Our relationship is up to us.

723
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,220
What does it have to do with my mom?

724
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:36,860
Do you care about me at all?

725
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:37,460
Say something!

726
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,340
What do you want me to do?

727
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:40,780
You can choose not to listen

728
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:41,460
to what your mother said,

729
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:42,420
but can I do the same?

730
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,380
Your mother came to me several times.

731
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:44,740
What did you do?

732
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:53,980
Do you have any idea
how hard it is for me

733
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,420
to be with you?

734
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,620
I don't want to do this anymore.

735
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:03,220
I've thought it through.

736
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,820
We should break up.

737
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,380
I'm back!

738
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:20,900
(I'll wait for you at the Lover Tree.)
