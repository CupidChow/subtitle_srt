00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,050

2
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:14,776
♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

3
00:00:14,776 --> 00:00:18,096
♫  I put out mountain fires  ♫

4
00:00:18,096 --> 00:00:22,012
♫  and catch the sunset  ♫

5
00:00:23,476 --> 00:00:28,526
♫  I leave the rhythms of life in my wake  ♫

6
00:00:28,526 --> 00:00:35,530
♫  Happiness whispers in my ears  ♫

7
00:00:36,696 --> 00:00:39,346
♫  Chasing the passion for the future  ♫

8
00:00:39,346 --> 00:00:43,496
♫  Like a dream maker  ♫

9
00:00:43,496 --> 00:00:48,316
♫  Reading the universe and stars  ♫

10
00:00:49,976 --> 00:00:52,696
♫  My existence in the river of time  ♫

11
00:00:52,696 --> 00:00:55,546
♫  With the body temperature of a moment  ♫

12
00:00:55,546 --> 00:01:02,146
♫  I'm trying to be the extension of light  ♫

13
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:08,846
♫  If the world grants me a frustrating opening  ♫

14
00:01:08,846 --> 00:01:15,396
♫  I'll chase back time like a dark horse  ♫

15
00:01:15,396 --> 00:01:22,226
♫  Even though I know the truth, I won't be afraid  ♫

16
00:01:22,226 --> 00:01:28,276
♫  I won't miss the moon because of mediocrity  ♫

17
00:01:28,276 --> 00:01:31,746
♫  I won't lose the light  ♫

18
00:01:31,746 --> 00:01:35,936

19
00:01:35,936 --> 00:01:39,007

20
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,260
Zhou Mingming, what's wrong with you?

21
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,210
You were flaunting, weren't you?

22
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,980
Zhou Mingming, what happened to your legs?

23
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,451
- Trembling? 
 - Continue. You need more exercise.

24
00:01:53,451 --> 00:01:55,958
Call me an ambulance to the hospital.

25
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:58,390
You can't always play it cool, Zhou Mingming.

26
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,020
We have better training here.

27
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,670
Yes, I got it.

28
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:02,920
Hurry up, man.

29
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,260
Zhou Mingming, get up early tomorrow.

30
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,532
- Sure. 
 - Do it again.

31
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,830
Hello?

32
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:43,200
Ai Qi, call me a designated driver.

33
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,260
Hello, your mail has been delivered.

34
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,960
Please check it.

35
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,294
 Go abroad?

36
00:03:17,294 --> 00:03:19,680
What will you and Xiong Fei do with it?

37
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,400
Does he know it?

38
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,760
Does your brother know it?

39
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,150
Oh, god.

40
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,950
Why now?

41
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,920
You and Xiong Fei haven't turned romantic.

42
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,900
Now you have to leave for two years.

43
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,456
How would Xiong Fei feel?

44
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,710
Yuan Yuan, don't worry.

45
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,980
Everything can be very good.

46
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,420
You can go abroad and realize your dream.

47
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,200
Xiong Fei is not your boyfriend yet,

48
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,670
but he's deeply attached to you and will remain pure and wait for you.

49
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,710
At last, it's a success both in career and love.

50
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,410
Wonderful.

51
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,260
Why can't I really believe what I said?

52
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:18,220
How can love come with a career?

53
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,632
Can't you just wait first?

54
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,400
 Will you come tomorrow?

55
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,510
 Of course.

56
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:46,770
 I'll wait for you. I have something to tell you.

57
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,422
Xiong Fei?

58
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,740
What did he say? Let me see it.

59
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:04,340
You even hide it from me? I'm helping you keep a secret.

60
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,690
Show me.

61
00:05:11,681 --> 00:05:14,110
Wow. He's holding himself back.

62
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:17,380
You don't have to worry. He has already made up your mind.

63
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,600
Don't be sad.

64
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,116
Eat one.  It's sweet.

65
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,460
Yuan, I'm back.

66
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,720
Have you eaten?

67
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,940
I've bought you some bread.

68
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,234
 Yuan, I'm coming in.

69
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,430

70
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,220
You're back.

71
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,964
 You did well.

72
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,190
What makes you so happy?

73
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:54,070
 You've learned how to take care of Doubao.

74
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:56,202
 Sure, I'm happy.

75
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,616
Yuan Yuan.

76
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,430
I asked Stephen to contact the British school for you, and there's good news.

77
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:12,818
Have you received the admission letter?

78
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,812
It doesn't matter if you didn't receive it.

79
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,160
I've already contacted them for you.

80
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,970
You can learn the language first.

81
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,040
You don't have to worry about living there.

82
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:32,884
If you need anything, find Stephen and he'll fix everything.

83
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,920
 I'm not in a hurry.

84
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,670
 We can wait for it.

85
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,526
Wait for what?

86
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,520
Why don't you want to go abroad?

87
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:03,430
I've called your headmaster and Dean of Studies.

88
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,720
They both support you studying abroad.

89
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,990
And don't worry about your work.

90
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:11,180
Someone will continue to do it.

91
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,600
I've booked the air ticket for you. You'll fly there tomorrow.

92
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:18,070
 Why didn't you discuss it with me?

93
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:20,170
 Cancel it.

94
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,766
I can cancel the ticket.

95
00:08:22,766 --> 00:08:25,700
But you must tell me your reason.

96
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,120
Why don't you want to go abroad?

97
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,650
 Just stay home today.

98
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,808
 I'll drive you to the airport.

99
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:05,920
♫  I want to be a shining star  ♫

100
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,560
♫  I will give out my light  ♫

00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:17,240

A new phone is in your luggage.

110
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,748
Don't forget to call me when you land.

111
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,730
Yuan, morning.

112
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,676
Why are you in such a hurry?

113
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,600
Stephen will be waiting for you at the airport.

114
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,480
He can do anything for you.

115
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,476
I will fly to see you when I'm not busy.

116
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,870
I know you're not very happy.

117
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:33,560
I don't want to do this either.

118
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,984
But I can't just watch you get confused.

119
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,840
Just think about it.

120
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:46,172
You'll understand me when you figure it out.

121
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,340
Be careful.

122

Hello. I want a serving of wonton.

134
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,520
Sorry. It's closed.

135
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,172
 Where are you?

136
00:13:01,172 --> 00:13:03,544
 Shall we train together today?

137
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,690
 If you want to probe Luo Yuan, I can tell you. She's gone abroad.

138
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,460
Luo Ben, bloody relentless.

139
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,200
Separating the love birds.

140
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:02,690
Ding Dingding, come and see me now.

141
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,754
Run.

142
00:14:13,754 --> 00:14:16,438
Mr. Ming, how can I help you?

143
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,990
- What's this? 
 - A photo.

144
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,650
I know. Where's mine?

145
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:23,770
There isn't one.

146
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,810
Why? Why do they have photos?

147
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:27,790
You took so many photos, why didn't I have a single one?

148
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:31,640
Mr. Ming, do you want to talk about the rescue team at the office?

149
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,290
Oh, cut the crap. Answer me.

150
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,990
If you say that, okay, I'll be blunt.

151
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,600
They have photos because they're handsome.

152
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,528
And I'm not?

153
00:14:43,528 --> 00:14:45,300
Not? Not on the same level.

154
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,360
Well. Just look at yourself.

155
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:53,922
Putting your face on a brochure is not a disgrace.

156
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,290
What? You know how to use photoshop, don't you?

157
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,630
Photoshop? Stretch your legs?

158
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,260
Use a filter? Slim your face?

159
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,681
I'm sorry. I don't have that time.

160
00:15:06,681 --> 00:15:07,750
Mr. Ming, don't forget.

161
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,530
I carry the key performance indicators of the entire comics department by myself.

162
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:13,540
I have no time. Anything else?

163
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,370
No? I'm leaving. Bye.

164
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,940
Ding Dingding, you did it on purpose. Didn't you?

165
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,020
Stop. Ding.

166
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,570
Ding Dingding.

167
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,120
Hello, Luo Yuan.

168
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,918
Where are you?

169
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,410
Hello?

170
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,752
Luo Yuan's gone abroad.

171
00:16:04,752 --> 00:16:06,782
You sent her away?

172
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:11,802
Luo Yuan got an offer from an overseas school.

173
00:16:11,802 --> 00:16:15,678
But she'd rather stay here for you.

174
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:23,840
Studying abroad has long been her biggest dream.

175
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,324
She paid a lot for her dream.

176
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,792
But now she's losing it.

177
00:16:29,792 --> 00:16:34,570
Xiong Fei, if you were her, what would you do?

178
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,730
I get it.

179
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:18,078
 I...

180
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:24,270
 like you.

181
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,060
 Let go of my sister!

182
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,260
 Leave her alone.

183
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,620
 Let her go.

184
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,100
 Are you all right?

185
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:52,142
 No, no, stop it.

186
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,444
 He killed him.

187
00:18:07,444 --> 00:18:09,228
 He's dead.

188
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,474
 Dead.

189
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,350
 Are you okay?

190
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:43,360

191
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,490
Why are you here?

192
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:01,398
May I come in?

193
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:21,646
I sent Luo Yuan overseas.

194
00:19:21,646 --> 00:19:24,022
She must hate me now.

195
00:19:24,022 --> 00:19:25,590
Why?

196
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:29,036
She received an admission letter to study abroad.

197
00:19:29,036 --> 00:19:33,162
But she didn't tell me and hid it from me

198
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:38,140
only to stay and date Xiong Fei.

199
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,040
She's dating Xiong Fei?

200
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:44,000
You don't know how much effort she put into this opportunity to study abroad.

201
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,100
I can't just watch her give up so easily.

202
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,980
Do you understand?

203
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:57,251
Even so, you should sit down and talk to her,

204
00:19:57,251 --> 00:19:59,550
instead of meddling so rudely in her life.

205
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,410
She's an adult.

206
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:06,820
Besides, it's very common for a girl like her to have a boy she likes

207
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,000
so, of course, she'll be a bit willful.

208
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,136
Xiong Fei's been in jail.

209
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:22,452
It's manslaughter. He wanted to protect her sister.

210
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,216
He's been in jail.

211
00:20:27,216 --> 00:20:28,920
He's paid for that.

212
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,060
I don't question his moral quality at all.

213
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:35,920
But according to his situation, it's very difficult for him to find a job.

214
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,520
How can he bring happiness to Luo Yuan?

215
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:44,280
So I think it's the best choice if Luo Yuan goes abroad now.

216
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,380
Am I wrong?

217
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,218
No.

218
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,068
She'll figure it out.

219
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,430
You really believe that?

220
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,434
Thank you.

221
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,884
Can I borrow your sofa and lie down for a bit?

222
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,730
I'll bring you a blanket.

223
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:44,194
Have a nap.

224
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:52,110
 A day of hard work. Appreciate it.

225
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,808
 I heard a gift makes a girl happy.

226
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:17,886
 Don't only drink and neglect meals.

227
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:54,010
 Less cold food. More soup for a good stomach.

228
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,692
Why are you here?

229
00:26:27,692 --> 00:26:29,420
Why can't I?

230
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,440
For me?

231
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,560
For everybody.

232
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,830
Shall I take you around for a stroll?

233
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:37,250
I'm more familiar with this place than you.

234
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:48,730
Take good photos.

235
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:51,690
- If I pick one, you'll have a day off. 
 - You said it.

236
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:53,240
You have my word.

237
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,972
Okay. Go up.

238
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,480
- Hey, you... Can you smile? 
 - How's it?

239
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,551
Do you have facial paralysis?

240
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:30,890
 Help. Someone's drowning. Help.

241
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:33,642
He fell into the water. Help.

242
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,796
 He's drowning.

243
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,536
 Anyone?

244
00:27:41,536 --> 00:27:43,416
 Help.

245
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,360
 Hurry up.

246
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:50,482
Take care.

247
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:53,730
 There.

248
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:56,050
 Help.

249
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,670
 Hurry up.

250
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,840
Zhan Yan, don't forget to drink it.

251
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,660
Thank you, Jing Jing.

252
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:30,070
Dr. Ruan,

253
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:34,760
- you didn't tell her I made it, did you? 
 - Of course not.

254
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:39,652
But you can't be like this forever.

255
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:46,590
 Ding Dingding said Zhan Yan hadn't hesitated for a second

256
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,954
 before she jumped and rescued him.

257
00:28:48,954 --> 00:28:51,202
The daughter is like her father.

258
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,530
Yes.

259
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:12,390

260
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,440
Ma.

261
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,380
It's you.

262
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,590
Now you recognize me?

263
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:34,630
How can you have the face to come here?

264
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:36,220
What do you mean? I saved you.

265
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,380
You what?

266
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,864
You beat me.

267
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,140
 Take care. Knock him out.

268
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,220
 Or you'll be drowned too.

269
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:58,770
Without me, you would have died. Do you know that?

270
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:01,100
Without you, I would have been rescued by someone else.

271
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,260
I wouldn't have been beaten by you.

272
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,020
You know nothing at all.

273
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,953
If I didn't knock you out, you and I would have died in the water.

274
00:30:07,953 --> 00:30:10,240
You're a member of the rescue team, aren't you?

275
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,868
Aren't you supposed to do good?

276
00:30:11,868 --> 00:30:14,040
The rescuer also knocks people out?

277
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,790
- I was only trying to... 
 -  Stop.

278
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,250
Just stop talking.

279
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,630
I sort of see where the problem is.

280
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:22,280
What you did, why do it?

281
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,000
Don't act like a hero.

282
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,240
You don't have the ability.

283
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,960
You can save the living.

284
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,520
A rescuing member? You don't deserve it.

285
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,450
- What are you talking about? 
 - What?

286
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:31,680
You want to knock me out?

287
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,650
Come on. You're good at it.

288
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:34,780
Here, hit me here.

289
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:37,660
You hit me here last time. Just come on now.

290
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:42,146
Rescue team members like you?

291
00:30:42,146 --> 00:30:43,380
Who can trust you?

292
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,320
You come here and say you saved me with your own mouth. What?

293
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,204
You have no shame!

294
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,681
He saved your life. What's that supposed to mean?

295
00:30:51,681 --> 00:30:52,870
Yes, you saved me.

296
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:54,930
I admit it. Thank you very much.

297
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:56,970
But he? I won't admit it.

298
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:59,340
He almost killed me.

299
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:02,620
It was you grabbing him in the water. It was you who almost killed him.

300
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:05,520
He's a rescue team member. He should be capable of it.

301
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,110
If not, don't be a member.

302
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:10,394
A rescuer is a person, not a god.

303
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,280
Mingming, you did nothing wrong.

304
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,440
Don't mind him.

305
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,440
Dr. Zhan, don't comfort me.

306
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:20,970
Are you leaving?

307
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:22,280
It's not going to stop here.

308
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,040
You put me in the hospital and I'm going to sue you.

309
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,200
Sue him?

310
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,336
According to the law,

311
00:31:27,336 --> 00:31:31,110
in voluntary emergency relief, if a recipient is injured,

312
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:34,238
the rescuer bears no liabilities.

313
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,970
Mingming.

314
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:48,066
Dr. Zhan.

315
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:51,130
You did very well.

316
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:54,857
Without your help, perhaps he couldn't have been saved.

317
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:58,122
But without your help,

318
00:31:58,122 --> 00:32:01,966
I might have killed him as he said.

319
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:08,610
After all, I am not capable enough.

320
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:10,700
Don't push yourself so much.

321
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,048
Just follow your heart.

322
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,350
Coming. I'm coming.

323
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:26,254
Who's that?

324
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,784
Yuan Yuan!

325
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:36,116
What happened?

326
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:39,060
I didn't expect that, Yuan Yuan.

327
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:41,468
You are quite brave.

328
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,210
 Even my brother can't control my love.

329
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:51,066
I support you.

330
00:32:51,066 --> 00:32:55,650
But I think your brother will find out soon enough that you didn't get on the plane.

331
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:57,570
What are you going to do?

332
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,172
What is your plan?

333
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,844
You don't want to live with me, do you?

334
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,170
No way.

335
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:09,380
Let me tell you.

336
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:12,650
If your brother finds out, you're the principal offender, I'll be the accomplice.

337
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:14,520
If he doesn't give me a death sentence, he will give me a life sentence.

338
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,020
No, no.

339
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:20,154
Don't beg me. No way.

340
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:28,410
Okay, you go back.

341
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:29,790
Sit down, sit, please.

342
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:33,266
I can't be mad at you, at a woman in love.

343
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:37,100
Does Xiong Fei know about this?

344
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,620
You don't go to him and don't tell him.

345
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,820
Think about it.

346
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:45,590
Once your brother finds out that you didn't get on the plane, he will definitely keep an eye on Xiong Fei. Right?

347
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:48,390
And you'll be caught in the scene. Then it's game over.

348
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,970
- Hello? 
  - Hi, Luo Ben.

349
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:17,170
 Are you sure about Luo Yuan's flight number?

350
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:19,140
 I've been waiting for her for three hours at the airport.

351
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:22,200
 And I checked the passenger list. She was not on it.

352
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,420
What?

353
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:26,450
 Don't worry. I can ask for other flights.

354
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:32,020
No, thanks. She might not be on the plane.

355
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,640
 Okay. If she's well, that's okay.

356
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:39,160
Sorry. It's a wild goose chase.

357
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,840
 It's nothing. As long as she's well.

358
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,880
I have to go. Bye.

359
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:58,456
 Yuan. Where are you?

360
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:04,358
Luo Ben?

361
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:07,550
The time has come.

362
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:10,179
He must have found out you weren't on the plane.

363
00:35:10,179 --> 00:35:13,480
You have to reply to him. Or he'll freak out.

364
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:21,362
You... You want me to do it for you, too?

365
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:27,142
I... just can't refuse you.

366
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:29,662
Let me think about it.

367
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:51,750
 Ben, I didn't get aboard. I'm now with a friend.

368
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:54,118
 I want to calm down.

369
00:35:54,118 --> 00:35:55,820
 Don't worry about me.

370
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:00,410
 - I've paid the bill. 
 - Okay, thanks.

371
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,770

372
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:08,070
Xiong Fei. One minute, please.

373
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,392
What's up?

374
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:18,850
Where did you hide Luo Yuan?

375
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:20,581
What are you talking about? Where is who hiding?

376
00:36:20,581 --> 00:36:22,660
Answer me. Where is Luo Yuan?

377
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,370
- You told me she went abroad. 
 - She never got on the plane!

378
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:31,390
Xiong Fei, I'm warning you now.

379
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:33,370
Do not play tricks with her.

380
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:35,150
She will never be with you.

381
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:37,394
Never will.

382
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:41,990
I know you are doing it for Luo Yuan's good.

383
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,330
But I like her, I really do.

384
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:46,378
Shut up!

385
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,800
Yes.

386
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,814
I was a criminal.

387
00:36:52,814 --> 00:36:55,500
I have an ordinary family, and a bad job.

388
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:00,290
In other people's eyes, I'm not good enough for her in any way.

389
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:04,578
So in the beginning I always avoided her and rejected her.

390
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:10,722
But luckily,

391
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:14,242
Luo Yuan is different.

392
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:18,250
She never looked down on me because of my family.

393
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:21,050
She never alienated me because I was in prison.

394
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:25,630
Instead, she was with me and helped me when I wanted to start a business.

395
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:31,314
I feel really happy and at ease when I'm with her.

396
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,416
Yes, I admit my love to her.

397
00:37:35,416 --> 00:37:37,174
I won't run away.

398
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:41,022
I will work hard for her.

399
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,608
You're her brother.

400
00:37:51,608 --> 00:37:54,800
I hope you will give me a chance to take care of her.

401
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:59,330
Do you think I will believe you?

402
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:05,414
Xiong Fei, you're really capable.

403
00:38:05,414 --> 00:38:09,620
You played all the tricks to keep her with you.

404
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,830
Our relationship is aboveboard.

405
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:14,998
I won't hide her.

406
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:20,286
Anyway, this matter has nothing to do with you.

407
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,100
How about you?

408
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:26,744
Shouldn't you also think about why she avoids you?

409
00:38:26,744 --> 00:38:28,882
It's a family issue.

410
00:38:28,882 --> 00:38:30,820
It's none of your business.

411
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:05,306
Luo Yuan.

412
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:15,200
 Okay.

413
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,420
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

414
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:19,490
If there is any news about Luo Yuan, please let me know as soon as possible.

415
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:22,550
Thank you. Goodbye.

416
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:38,050
Zhan Yan, I have something to tell you.

417
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:40,132
Where did you go?

418
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:42,646
I couldn't get in touch with you.

419
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,100
 Were you worried about me?

420
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:50,870
It's not safe for you alone.

421
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,272
 Is it because...

422
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,750
 you like me?

423
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,400
I like you.

424
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:42,840
I've been regretting since I knew you were going abroad.

425
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,460
I regretted I didn't tell you how I feel.

426
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,744
It's a gift for you.

427
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:09,260
 Give it to me. I can fix it.

428
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,194
 It'll be as good as new.

429
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:57,332
Luo Yuan didn't show up yet?

430
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:02,970
Sit.

431
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,444
She's grown up.

432
00:42:14,444 --> 00:42:16,636
She has her own ideas.

433
00:42:16,636 --> 00:42:21,206
She doesn't need me as a brother anymore.

434
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:22,962
Take it easy.

435
00:42:22,962 --> 00:42:24,744
She will understand you.

436
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:31,682
Now I only want to know if she's safe.

437
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:36,506
Does she often come here?

438
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:44,030
Yes. She used to come here alone to look at the lake and see the scenery.

439
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:58,090

440
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:06,952
♫  At first, there was no sadness in the world  ♫

441
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:14,406

00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:44,930
♫  Trying to connect laughter and tears  ♫

446
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:52,394
♫  I suddenly have faith  ♫

447
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:59,610
♫  I can walk by millions of shining household lights  ♫

449
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:14,660
♫  Shed tears and hope that you are well  ♫

450

♫  The good times I'm pursuing belong to the light  ♫

451
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:30,960
♫  It can light up the wounds that follow  ♫
