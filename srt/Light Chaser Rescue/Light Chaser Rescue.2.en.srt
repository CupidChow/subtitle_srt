What are you doing?

17
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,300
He was filming you.

18
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,630
Hey!

19
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,820
You're welcome.

20
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,160
I mean, why didn't you

21
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,660
call the police?

22
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,000
There's an app

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,600
called Smart Police.

24
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:19,840
And that guy

25
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,930
has deleted

26
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:21,880
all the footage about you.

27
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,250
Why would I still waste

28
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,130
time on him?

29
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,840
Hello, sir. Your bread.

30
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:26,970
Thank you.

31
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,440
Sorry, everyone.

32
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,280
We have sold out

33
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,250
all the bread today.

34
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:31,970
I'm really sorry.

35
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:32,720
Yeah.

36
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,160
This gentleman bought it all out.

37
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:34,810
Well, let's go.

38
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:35,210
Let's go.

39
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:35,650
You bought

40
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:36,600
all the bread?

41
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,410
Can't you see

42
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,250
all the people in the queue?

43
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,530
It's all about yourself, huh?

44
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,810
You're so selfish.

45
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,210
Well, it happens

46
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,650
that I'm in front of the queue.

47
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,690
I don't see any problem here.

48
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:49,840
If someone in front of me

49
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,160
bought out all

50
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,320
the bread,

51
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,930
I would just be here earlier next time

52
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,530
instead of making a complaint.

53
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:57,810
If you want some,

54
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:58,760
I can give you a bag of bread.

55
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,130
Your phone.

56
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,530
Your phone!

57
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,970
You want evidence?

58
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,040
Is your name really Zhan Yan?

59
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,600
We've met three times,

60
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,840
and you always wear a stern face.

61
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:16,650
Zhan Yan, really?

62
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,130
For the very last time. Your phone.

63
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:24,970
Put on a nice attitude

64
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,210
when you ask a favor.

65
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,130

00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:29,720

Sorry. Sorry.

73
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,160
It's you.

74
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,760
You're the teacher, right?

75
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,560
This is yours?

76
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,280
Alright, you take this.

77
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,730
Or how about I get it inside for you?

78
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,200
Thank you.

79
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,320
Thank you.

80
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:28,810
Sure.

81
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:39,960
Where do I put it?

82
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,520
Just here? Sure.

83
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,000
It's quite heavy.

84
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,690
I'm good. Thank you.

85
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,400
Wash your hands.

86
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,080
I'll be off work after this.

87
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,170
I'll wash my hands at home.

88
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,490
I'm off.

89
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,490
I think I'll just clean myself up.

90
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,290
Sorry.

91
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,130
Inside.

92
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:31,370
Don't move.

93
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,690
Put it down.

94
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Who are you?

95
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,490
Hi, I'm here to drop off a delivery.

96
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:42,760
Deliveryman?

97
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:43,640
Why are you

98
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,000
in my bathroom?

99
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,000
Please hear me out.

100
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,610
I really am a deliveryman.

101
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:48,520
Why would I?

102
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,080
Yuan, go into your room.

103
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,850
Call the police.

104
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,050
No. Please don't call the police.

105
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,000
Back off!

106
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,490
Listen!

107
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:54,290
I really am here to drop off a delivery!

108
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,000
Alright, I won't move!

109
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,690
I will take measures.

110
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:56,730
I saw that she needed help.

111
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:06,170
What are you doing?

112
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:07,850
Taking evidence.

113
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,250
Is that necessary?

114
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,320
Pardon me,

115
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,560
but I'm a lawyer.

116
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:15,640
It's my work habit.

117
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,050
Name?

118
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,370
Xiong Fei.

119
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,130
Employee number?

120
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,170
I just explained to you.

121
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,320
It's all but a misunderstanding. I…

122
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:25,930
Excuse me,

123
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,520
but if you refuse to cooperate,

124
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,760
I'll call the police.

125
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,850
Now, employee number?

126
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,320
3310151.

127
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,520
Am I free to go now?

128
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,170
Yeah, you can leave.

129
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:43,760
Sorry. I'm sorry.

130
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yuan,

131
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:54,960
how many times did I tell you

132
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,810
not to open doors for strangers?

133
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,640
Do you have any idea

134
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,640
how dangerous it could have been?

135
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,290
What if he was a bad person?

136
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,200
You should apologize to him.

137
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,760
I apologize to him?

138
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:06,370
No way.

139
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,850
Yuan.

140
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:23,560
Yuan.

141
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:29,690
Yuan.

142
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,290
I know that you're kind-hearted.

143
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:33,320
I did that

144
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,810
only to protect you.

145
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,730
You think everybody

146
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:40,610
is a good person,

147
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:41,920
but you'll regret it someday.

148
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,760
Do you know that?

149
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,000
Alright, alright.

150
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:47,450
No sulking.

151
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,280
I bought bread.

152
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,210
Your favorite.

153
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,160
You knew nothing.

154
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,400
He was a good guy.

155
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,210
He saved a choking kid

156
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,920
at my school.

157
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,970
You knew him long ago?

158
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,450
How come I never knew that?

159
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,640
When did that happen?

160
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,970
I don't want to speak to you anymore.

161
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,090
Yuan.

162
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:13,330
Come on.

163
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,490
Come here.

164
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,610
Sit.

165
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,370
Look.

166
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,610
Look at this.

167
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,160
I got a professional designer

168
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,330
to design this for you.

169
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:42,490
It can work

170
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,330
as a whistle.

171
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,210
I'm thinking

172
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,210
that if you're in trouble

173
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,570
or in danger,

174
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,850
you can blow the whistle,

175
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,730
and when I hear it,

176
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,210
I'll come to you right away.

177
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,090
I'll put it on you.

178
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,160
Look.

179
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,400
Isn't it nice?

180
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,400
Right?

181
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:17,400
I will

182
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,370
always be there for you.

183
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,730
Does it cheer you up?

184
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:27,400
Look at you.

185
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,400
You're such a little girl.

186
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,970
Why are you packing up your clothes?

187
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,640
Are you going to leave the house?

188
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,160
No, no.

189
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,090
Fengxi Special Education School

190
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:39,250
wanted me to be a teacher there.

191
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,280
I'm leaving tomorrow.

192
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,250
Fengxi?

193
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:46,000
That's good.

194
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,730
I'll go to Fengxi tomorrow,
too, to deal with some work.

195
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,920
I'll go with you.

196
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,090
Have you bought the ticket?

197
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,640
I'll have Ai Rui'er change my ticket.

198
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,800
I'll have her change my ticket now.

199
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,640
I'll go with you.

200
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:58,450
I'll give you a lesson about

201
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,800
how much danger you may
run into in this world,

202
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,370
or you couldn't imagine…

203
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,040

One!

209
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,210
One!

210
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,520

Two.

216
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,280
One!

217
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,920
Arms straight, Dapeng.

218
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,680
Two.

219
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,760
If my arms are straight

220
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,160
it'll be too high for Wukong.

221
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,400
One!

222
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,130
As if I can't.

223
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:41,970
Straighten your arms,

224
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,250
you can't do many.

225
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,210
Alright, Xiong Fei.

226
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,680
Push to the top. Lock your shoulders.

227
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:48,800
A standard push for Xiong Fei.

228
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,640
One.

229
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,130
Push to the top. Lock your shoulders.

230
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,680
That's a full push.

231
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,610

You have made some progress,

but your stamina and explosive power

are far more from satisfaction.

237
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:13,130
We'll train again next week.

238
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,520
Here. Have some water.

239
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:22,730

240

Are you jealous?

247
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,730
Nonsense.

248
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:49,040
I just lifted some weight yesterday,

249
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,880
or I would have outgamed them.

Hey, Falcon,

251
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,880
let's change to something else.

252
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,520
It's not about me myself.

253
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,450
Look at Wukong.

254
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:00,450
Look, look, look.

255
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,280
Look how skinny he is.

256
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,090
No matter how hard he trains,

257
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,400
he won't grow any muscle.

258
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,000
Good idea.

259
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:12,520
We won't be

260
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,970
lifting logs.

261
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,400
Only Dapeng will do the training.

262
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:15,970
How about that?

263
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:16,880
OK.

264
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,850
OK, good idea.

265
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:19,400
Hey, you're persecuting

266
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,400
the good guy here.

267
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,570
Yeah, all the businessmen

268
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,570
claim they have a good heart.

269
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,210
Just you wait.

270
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:25,970
I'll rest for a few days,

271
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:26,920
and we'll compete.

272
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,920
Buddy, you keep training.

273
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,640
I'm off.

274
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:37,880
He leaves in a hurry.

275
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,210
I bet he craves a drink.

Hello.

277
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:50,970
I'm not at work.

278
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:55,330
Why am I pulled out?

279
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,490
Alright, I got it.

280
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,450
What?

281
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,570
The company has narrowed down

282
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,880
my area.

283
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,400
Why?

284
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,160
Because I'm always on a mission

285
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,490
and have little time for work.

286

You're on duty

287
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,880
like 24/7.

288
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,450
Can't you have several days-off
as reimbursement?

289
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,250
You'll make less money

290
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,850
now that your turf is shrunken.

291
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,800
Your boss is a jerk.

292
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,570
Give me your phone.

293
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:25,330
I'll talk to him.

294
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,130
It's fine.

295
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,250

I'm still your honey, huh?

311
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,880

312
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,800
it is today?

Stock replenishment.

315

You don't need to go back home.

on the rescue team.

She came all the way

352
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,050
from Linjiang.

353
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:15,160
Miss Luo is young,

354
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:18,240
but she has a lot
of teaching experience.

355
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,640
I believe

356
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,050
you'll love her lessons.

357
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,610
Please clap for her.

358
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:31,530
Do you enjoy dancing, kids?

359
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:38,050
Maybe we

360
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,850
cannot hear any music,

361
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,640
but our body

362
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,640
can feel the rhythm.

363
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:48,050
Our heart

364
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,400
can sense its beauty.

365
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,050
Good job, everyone.

366
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,200
Miss Luo, please sit.

367
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,130
You again.

368
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,200
You again.

369
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:44,640
He's a naughty one.

370
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,480
Now, this is life.

371
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:21,920
Come in, please.

372
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,480
Sir, here's my report.

373
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,720
The national general surgery

374
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,610
academic session next week,

375
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:31,330
I want to attend it.

376
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:34,920
You

377
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,920
have been working hard

378
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,010
academically,

379
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,610
but with patients,

380
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,680
you should improve your
communication skills.

381
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:43,400
I know

382
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:44,720
that someone filed
a complaint against me.

383
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:47,050
I was told

384
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,240
that you told them

385
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,920
where the complaint room was.

386
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:54,130
Yes, I admit that I shouldn't
have put on that attitude,

387
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,880
but I couldn't sit around

388
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,400
and watch the patient

389
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,720
miss the best

390
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,680
treatment window.

391
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:00,400
I'll accept any punishment

392
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,200
from the department.

393
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,480
Yuxiao.

394
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,640
Come to my office.

395
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:40,570
The national general surgery

396
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:41,810
academic session will be held

397
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:42,920
in our city.

398
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:43,920
Yuxiao,

399
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:46,200
you will attend the session

400
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,010
and make a speech
on behalf of the hospital.

401
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,400
Sir, I prepared a lot

402
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,610
for the session,

403
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:52,770
and I submitted my application first.

404
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,290
Right.

405
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:56,570
I think Dr. Zhan is more
qualified than me.

406
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:59,370
Why must the first applicant

407
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:00,720
get to attend the session?

408
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,010
Dr. Cai

409
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,640
has worked with us longer than you,

410
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:05,770
and he has more clinical experience.

411
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,480
He's the ideal representative

412
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,570
of our hospital.

413
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:09,200
Sir,

414
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,330
I don't agree.

415
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,530
Everybody is equal academically.

416
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:13,920
Hierarchy is not right.

417
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:15,960
The opportunity goes to
the best ones.

418
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,290
So you think

419
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:21,480
you are one of the best?

420
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,050
Yuxiao.

421
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,290
You go get

422
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,290
prepared for the session.

423
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:34,440
OK.

424
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:35,330
Zhan Yan.

425
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:38,160
You will reflect on yourself.

426
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:42,720
Sir,

427
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,090
I'll talk to her.

428
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:47,880
Zhan Yan,

429
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,050
you shouldn't have used that tone.

430
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,810
I wasn't referring to you.

431
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:53,720
Don't take it personal.

432
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,130
I know you.

433
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,290
Don't worry.

434
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:58,640
I will take

435
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,290
a record of the session

436
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,240
and share it with you.

437
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:01,850
Thanks.

438
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,200
No problem.

439
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:15,810
Good one.

440
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,680
Mr. Luo.

441
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:21,240
You're an excellent golfer.

442
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:22,530
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

443
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:23,530
Please.

444
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:23,880
Here.

445
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,640
It's the first time
you came to Fengxi, right?

446
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:27,770
Yes.

447
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:29,130
I tell you what.

448
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:30,090
The environment is wonderful.

449
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:31,200
And the court was built

450
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,770
in accordance
with international standards.

451
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:34,130
A man of my age

452
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:35,200
needs more exercise.

453
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:36,810
Right.

454
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,290

Quickly! An earthquake!

466
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:36,850
Quickly! To the football field!

467
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:50,050

468
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,640
Run!

471
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,050
Run! Quickly!

The Light Chaser Rescue Team

530
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:11,530

00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:14,640
Affirmative.

539
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,010
the rescue goes smoothly.

I can't get in touch with Luo Yuan.

But don't go any further.

570
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,610
There are constant aftershocks.
It's very dangerous.

571
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:39,810
Come on.

592

and get in position at once.

593
00:31:58,290 --> 00:31:58,720
OK.

Just hang in there.

I can't get you out by myself.

598

I'll find someone

599
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,720
to get you out together.

600
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,240
Please don't leave.

601
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:30,330
Don't go. I'm scared.

602
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:32,920
I'll be right back.

603
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,770
Hang in there.

604
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,400
Anyone?

605
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,160
Anyone?

606
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,090
A kid is in here.

607
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:43,330
Come and help him!

608
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,400
Kid!

609
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:55,920
Kid!

610
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,090
Get the supplies here.

611
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:20,960
Doctor.

612
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,480
Be easy on me, doc.

613
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,530
Doctor!

614
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,370
Doctor! Doctor!

615
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:27,530
Check him out.

616
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:28,920
Quickly. Check him out.

617
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:30,290
I'm good, thanks.

618
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:31,290
Confirm transfusion position.

619
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,440

Sister.

621

Sister.

622
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:35,610
What are you doing here?

623
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:38,200
I… I'm here to enjoy life.

624
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,530
What's wrong with your forearm?

625
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,920
I ran too hurriedly

626
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,240
that I fell.

627
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,680
Find a nurse,

628
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,370
get your wound treated.

629
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:46,920
When the ambulances

630
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,010
are here,

631
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:48,770
go home with them.

632
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:49,920
Don't cause trouble here.

633
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,720
I have an operation to perform.

634
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:52,920
Don't leave me behind,

635
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,130
(Operation Room)
please.

636
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:02,920
Kid!

637
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:05,160
Kid, can you hear me?

638
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,330
Kid!

639
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:14,610
Kid!

640
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,640
Talk to me.

641
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,570
OK?

642
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,680
What's your name?

643
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,130
My name…

644
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,610
My name is Lele.

645
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:24,410
Lele.

646
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:25,970
Good boy.

647
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,570
Is someone with you?

648
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:30,890
My mom.

649
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:32,320
Your mom?

650
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:34,410
Can she speak?

651
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:37,320
Mom is asleep.

652
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:42,240
Lele.

653
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,050
Your mom is too tired.

654
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,610
Let her sleep.

655
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:53,320
Lele,

656
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,200
stop crying.

657
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,010
I'll tell you a story,

658
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:03,280
okay?

659
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:16,890
Lele.

660
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,320
Once upon a time,

661
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:21,720
there was a boy about your age.

662
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,280
Like you,

663
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,930
he, too,

664
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,720
experienced a severe

665
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,720
earthquake when he was little.

666
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,320
He and his mom

667
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,800
and dad

668
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:37,200
were buried

669
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,360
in a collapsed house.

670
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,490
It was dark.

671
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,490
They couldn't see anything.

672
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:45,530
He was very scared.

673
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:50,890
So he kept crying.

674
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:03,640
Mom, I'm scared.

675
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,640
It's okay, my boy.

676
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,720
Mummy's here.

677
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:09,840
Don't worry.

678
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,200
People are on their

679
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,890
way to our rescue.

680
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:13,930
Don't be afraid.

681
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:16,640
Will they find us?

682
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:18,130
They will.

683
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,890
I'm sure they will.

684
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,530
But he didn't give up.

685
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:27,280
Lele.

686
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:29,570
He was rescued.

687
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,010
He survived.

688
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,410
And he had a little sister
because of the disaster.

689
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:36,320
He lived a happy life.

690
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:38,450
So…

691
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,760
So please trust me.

692
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,530
Don't give up.

693
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:44,200
Hang in there.

694
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:46,240
You will be saved.

00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,090
Lele.

699
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:16,680
Lele.

00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:22,050
Lele, you mustn't fall asleep.

702
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:23,720
Lele!

703
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,280
Lele!

704
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:30,890
You can't fall asleep, Lele!

705
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:51,160
Wait!

706
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:51,970
Wait!

707
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,130
A kid is trapped down there.

708
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:54,840
Stop!

709
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:56,130
What's the situation?

710
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:56,970
His name is Lele.

711
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:59,240
He was talking to me,

712
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,610
but now he isn't making a sound.

713
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:01,610
- Xiong Fei.
- I think he's dying.

714
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:02,280
Use snake eye

715
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,280
to check what's going on inside.

716
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:03,720
Yes, sir.

717
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:05,930
Kid. Kid.

718
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,930
Can you hear me?

719
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,720
- You are the delivery guy.
- Can you move?

720
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:18,800
Wait.

721
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,130
It has a blind spot from this angle.

722
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:22,930
You'd better try another angle.

723
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:24,160
In case of a second collapse

724
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,360
during the debris removal.

725
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:27,240
You sound professional.

726
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:28,010
Here.

727
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,050
To the left.

728
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:33,610
Keep going. Stop.

729
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,570
It's not too tricky inside.

730
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,360
Dapeng, ready for the removal.

731
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:43,890
Yes.

732
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,570
Falcon, you take everybody

733
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,240
to the rendezvous point.

734
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,720
We'll be right there.

735
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,490
Roger that.

736
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,160
The rest of you, follow me.

737
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:51,840
Yes!

738
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:57,640
Lele.

739
00:38:58,010 --> 00:38:58,680
Come on.

740
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:05,410
Come on. Move out of the way.

741
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,200
Stopped bleeding.

742
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,320
You'll stitch up the cut.
I'll move on to the next operation.

743
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:18,970
OK.

744
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,490
Dapeng,

745
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,640
take the kid

746
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,640
to the nearest hospital.

747
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,280
Yes.

748
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:22,570
Wukong.

749
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,200
Move. Move.

750
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,530
Sir,

751
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,090
you'd better leave here immediately.

752
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:28,890
It's very dangerous.

753
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:29,800
The rest of you,

754
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:30,840
follow me.

755
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:32,360
We'll meet up with Falcon.

756
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:33,800
Captain, you go first.

757
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,890
We'll take care of this place

758
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:35,800
OK. I'll leave it to you.

759
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,130
Sure.

760
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:13,410
Doctor!

761
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,410
Doctor!

762
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,760
Dapeng.

763
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:18,090
What's his situation?

764
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:19,530
Just got him out.

765
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:20,970
Name's Lele.

766
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:21,800
His mother sheltered him

767
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,890
before she died.

768
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,530
It wasn't easy for us
to separate them.

769
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:30,200
Come with me.

770
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:31,450
Come on.

771
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:29,320
Quickly. Quickly.

772
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,450
Be careful. Be careful.

773
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:31,970
Quickly. Quickly.

774
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,200
Quickly. Quickly.

775
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,320
Quickly. Quickly.

776
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,890
Move. Move. Move.

777
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,490
Hello,

778
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:40,450
did you see a teacher

779
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:41,720
named Luo Yuan?

780
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,050
Is she out?

781
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:44,610
The one from Linjiang?

782
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:45,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

783
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:45,840
That's her.

784
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,720
Where is she?

785
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,010
She went in to save a child.

786
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:49,130
She's not out yet.
