00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,770
Do you want to

17
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,640
listen to my gab more?

18
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:49,440
OK.

19
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,280
You want to know

20
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,170
why I want my ex-wife

21
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,480
to have the house, don't you?

22
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,000
Many years ago,

23
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,330
I took my son

24
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,440
to fish by the river,

25
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,970
and accidentally,

26
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,490
he drowned to death.

27
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,410
I lost my son.

28
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:34,840
My wife

29
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,440
left me.

30
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,650
She said

31
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,650
she didn't want to stay

32
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,090
in this sad place anymore.

33
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,600
At the time,

34
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:50,720
I felt

35
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,280
there was nothing in this world

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,090
worth holding on to.

37
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,440
A complete family

38
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,490
was broken

39
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,250
into pieces.

40
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:06,880
Back then,

41
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:08,760
I was

42
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,410
dead

43
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,320
inside.

44
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,690
When

45
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:17,280
I was at the most difficult stage

46
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,250
in my life,

47
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,840
I ran into Qingshan.

48
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,160
He gave me a chance

49
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,810
to live a second life.

50
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:30,880
Over the years,

51
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,370
I did many things.

52
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,000
I saved many lives.

53
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,810
But

54
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,720
I'm going to die now.

55
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,720
I'm content, though.

56
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:51,930
Please don't say that.

57
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,370
The only person

58
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,600
that I'm sorry to

59
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,160
is my ex-wife.

60
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,130
She could

61
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,840
have had a happy family.

62
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,210
It's all my fault.

63
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,440
Our family is gone.

64
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,210
Our son

65
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,490
is gone.

66
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,170
So

67
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,610
you want to make it up to her.

68
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,610
Make it up to her?

69
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,170
Would a house

70
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,200
be enough?

71
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,320
My wallet.

72
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,370
My wallet.

73
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:46,960
Wallet.

74
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,320
My wallet.

75
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:49,490
I'll get it for you.

76
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:55,320
Here.

77
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,930
Open it for me.

78
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,960
This is your son?

79
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,000
Cong.

80
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,560
He was a clever boy,

81
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:26,690
but he wasn't studious.

82
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:30,370
He was a naughty little boy.

83
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,400
And a righteous one.

84
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,080
All the kids he knew

85
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,560
followed him.

86
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,760
Kind of like you,

87
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,400
brat.

88
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:56,290
Falcon.

89
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,490
Falcon.

90
00:05:59,130 --> 00:05:59,640
Falcon.

91
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:08,960
Falcon.

92
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,320
Can I entrust you with something?

93
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,250
Can you drive faster?

94
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,080
Sit tight.

95
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,000
Have you kept it in mind?

96
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:34,080
Yes.

97
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,640
Please see to it for me

98
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,440
as soon as possible.

99
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,490
Don't worry.

100
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,560
I'm kind of

101
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,320
hungry for no reason.

102
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,490
What would you like to eat?

103
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,610
I'll go out to buy you some.

104
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,690
I want a drink.

105
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:01,810
Or how about…

106
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,080
Congee?

107
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:08,690
Congee, then.

108
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:11,560
Millet congee.

109
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,130
Cooked with chicken soup.

110
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:15,000
OK.

111
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,490
Give me a minute.

112
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,320
I'll get some for you right now.

113
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,080
You'd better

114
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:31,730
stop talking.

115
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,290
Get some rest.

116
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,880
Yan.

117
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:43,690
I…

118
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,850
I'm leaving.

119
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:49,730
The one who concerns

120
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,520
me the most

121
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,520
is you.

122
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,810
You are not.

123
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,690
I always

124
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,440
see you

125
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:05,930
as my daughter.

126
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,130
I know.

127
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,250
You may

128
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,640
seem tough.

129
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,640
But deep down, you're soft-hearted.

130
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,080
You're vulnerable.

131
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,610
When you're hurt,

132
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,930
you don't share your feelings.

133
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,290
You keep everything to yourself.

134
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,370
Your dad

135
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,850
is the same.

136
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:38,680
I know

137
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:42,330
that you haven't forgiven your dad,

138
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,760
but he still takes up
a place in your heart.

139
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,970
You care about him.

140
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,040
And you should tell him that.

141
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,850
I'm leaving.

142
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:04,760
Your dad is getting old, too.

143
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:07,850
There are certain things

144
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:09,760
that need to be said

145
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,730
because life

146
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,880
is short,

147
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,640
or you'll regret it.

148
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:18,880
Stop talking, okay?

149
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,090
Please.

150
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,520
Stop talking, please.

151
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,090
You should rest.

152
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,400
Listen to me.

153
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:27,920
I'm glad

154
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,680
that all the people

155
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,490
around you

156
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,040
care about you.

157
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:38,850
You should

158
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:42,000
have some patience

159
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:45,680
with them.

160
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:46,880
OK.

161
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:47,680
OK.

162
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:53,490
Picture.

163
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,000
The picture.

164
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,160
Son,

165
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:10,090
I'm coming for you.

166
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,280
I have saved

167
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,760
many lives over the years.

168
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,970
When we meet again,

169
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,970
you won't blame me,

170
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,850
will you?

171
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,880
Daddy Fan.

172
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:49,760
Daddy Fan.

173
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:51,760
Quickly.

174
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,610
AED.

175
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:54,210
Got it.

176
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:01,640
Clear!

177
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,130
Zhongwen.

178
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,780
(Patient Zone (3))

179
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,880

00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:25,570
I'll drive.

351
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,090
You'll be my driver?

352
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:27,920
Good day for me.

353
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:04,240
All right.

354
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,530
Buckle up.

355
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:35,370
I wasn't late today.

356
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:36,770
I'll hand in the new chapter next week.

357
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:37,920
Anything else?

358
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:43,050
Is Falcon

359
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,240
the Wonder Hawk in your comic?

360
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:49,480
I always wanted him

361
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,640
to see my work.

362
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,720
I think he'd love

363
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,050
my Wonder Hawk.

364
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,850
But I was too late.

365
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:58,610
Ding Dingding,

366
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:00,770
why are you into comics?

367
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:01,920
Why do you ask me

368
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,850
this silly question all of a sudden?

369
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,810
I'm your boss.

370
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:04,850
Please answer me carefully.

371
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:08,920
Because I think

372
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,090
there are many regrets

373
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:12,160
in real life,

374
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,530
but in the comic world,

375
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:16,640
in my comic world,

376
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,570
regrets can be amended.

377
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:20,570
All endings

378
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:22,090
can be good endings.

379
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,400
Falcon still lives on

380
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,330
in this world.

Thank you, Mrs. Qin.

400
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,160
You're welcome.

401
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:23,720
Bye.

402
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,480
W-What's the matter with…

403
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,530
Come in.

404
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,770
He.

405
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,770
Come on. Sit.

406
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,680
What's up with you?

407
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,440
You look casual.

408
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:47,720
He.

409
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,330
I'd like to ask for a vacation.

410
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:52,050
No problem.

411
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:53,480
You deserve it.

412
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:55,160
You need to take a break,

413
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,530
or it'll be too much pressure for others.

414
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:58,720
Tell me, how long?

415
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,160
Maybe half a month.

416
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:01,290
Or maybe half a year.

417
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,920
Or maybe even longer.

418
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:06,530
I'm aware

419
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:07,440
you're on vacation.

420
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,480
Others may

421
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,480
think you quit.

422
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:10,770
I tell you what,

423
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:12,330
the firm needs you.

424
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:14,400
Gao and you

425
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,770
can run this firm.

426
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:17,130
Wait a minute.

427
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,010
Are you going to travel around the world?

428
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,290
Why so long?

429
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,010
I'm not going anywhere.

430
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:27,010
I only want to have a long break.

431
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,330
To be fair,

432
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,200
I should approve it,

433
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:37,680
but it's too much of a request.

434
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,440
I honestly don't know
how to reply to you.

435
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:41,200
Don't worry.

436
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,370
If anything important occurs,

437
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:44,530
I'll be back.

438
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,720
Alright, fine.

439
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:48,160
That's a deal, then.

440
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,130
Thanks.

441
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,130
Bye.

442
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:53,880
OK.

443
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:56,720
Keep your phone on, though.

444
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:03,530
Today, we will be practicing

445
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:05,050
all kinds of knots.

446
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:07,480
The figure 8 knot.

447
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:10,680
Fisherman's knot.

448
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,880
Bowline.

449
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:23,680
Ready.

450
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,050
Go.

451
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:52,400
Time's up.

452
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:01,810
Luo Ben.

453
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:03,680
Tell everybody

454
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,400
what your knot is.

455
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:09,570
It's a bowline.

456
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:12,850
What, you didn't have breakfast?

457
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,530
Be Louder.

458
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:17,680
A bowline.

459
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,680
What is it for?

460
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:20,850
Tie one end

461
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:22,200
of the rope to an object

462
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,850
to weigh people or things.

463
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,530
When you rescued

464
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:28,480
your neighbor
who jumped off the building,

465
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,480
what knot did you use?

466
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,440
A bowline.

467
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,720
Nonsense!

468
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,570
Dapeng! Dapeng!

469
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,610
Calm down, Dapeng!

470
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:37,610
If that was a bowline,

471
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:38,720
why would it loosen up?

472
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,290
Calm down, Dapeng!

473
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:40,530
Why would Falcon be injured?

474
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,130
We're all brothers.

475
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:42,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

476
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,010
Get away from me!

477
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:45,240
Why won't you speak?

478
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:46,960
You are a lawyer, aren't you?

479
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,010
A lawyer should be talkative, no?

480
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:49,470
Why aren't you saying anything?

481
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,130
What are you doing?

482
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,330
Why do you defend him?

483
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,960
If this smug

484
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,330
had managed to tie a knot properly,

485
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:57,850
Falcon wouldn't have died.

486
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,770
Stop it.

487
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,570
I don't accept it.

488
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,610
I don't understand

489
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:12,570
why we let someone like him

490
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:13,960
join the team.

491
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,850
I don't accept it!

492
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,530
I don't accept it!

493
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:33,960
You're dismissed.

494
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:45,570
Dapeng is straightforward.

495
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,290
Don't take it to heart.

496
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,720
I don't blame him.

497
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:52,330
I'm responsible

498
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,240
for Falcon's death.

499
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,050
I failed

500
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,240
to tighten the knot.

501
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,920
Don't be too stressed.

502
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:07,010
Everybody makes mistakes.

503
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:10,440
No one wanted that to happen.

504
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,340
(My food truck will be open tomorrow.)

505
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,020
(Do you have time?)

506
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:29,230
(It's the beginning of your new life.)

507
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,270
(I will be there.)

508
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,820
Soccer.

509
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,300
Soccer. This means ball,

510
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,540
and this means feet.

511
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,380
It means soccer.

512
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,340
Soccer.

513
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,620
Your wonton.

514
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,540
OK. Thanks.

515
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,380
Please enjoy.

516
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:07,340
(Big Bear Wonton)

517
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,380
You came.

518
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:32,860
Thank you.

519
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,140
Have you had lunch?

520
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,140
Wait a minute.

521
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:52,820
Wontons will be ready soon.

522
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:53,620
I'll get you some.

523
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:54,620
Sir,

524
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,020
I want some wontons.

525
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:56,700
Just a second.

526
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,620
They will soon be cooked.

527
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,580
No cooked ones? Never mind, then.

528
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:00,660
Sorry.

529
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,420
You seem busy.

530
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,660
Let me help you.

531
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,460
I'm fine. Thanks.

532
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,620
I need to get up at 4 o'clock

533
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,660
every day in the morning to make doughs.

534
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,980
The stand is to be open at 6.

535
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:20,940
That's too early.

536
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:59,340
(Zhou Mingming)

537
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,140
Get up for morning exercise.

538
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,220
I don't want my employee

539
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,160
to sit all day

540
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,900
and get weak at a young age.

541
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,520
When you're at work at 10:00 AM,

542
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,020
I'll check if your WeChat steps

543
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,060
exceed 8,000.

544
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,520
Zhou Mingming,

545
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,520
what's the matter with you?

546
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,760
It's only 5 o'clock.

547
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,680
Don't be a jerk.

548
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,240
Where are you going in the early morning?

549
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,360
You wear this for morning exercise?

550
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,680
Who are you fooling?

551
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,000
What are you going to do?

552
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,080
You won't tell me?

553
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,600
I'll ask your brother, then.

554
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,840
Tell me, what are you going to do?

555
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,840
I swear.

556
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,600
I'll help Xiong Fei with his food truck.

557
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,200
You and Xiong Fei?

558
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,080
I didn't know that.

559
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,760
What's going on between you two?

560
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,800
When did you two start dating?

561
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,280
You will tell me about it

562
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,360
when you're back.

563
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:18,200
(Big Bear Wonton)

564
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,680
Sir, I want a portion of wontons.

565
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:49,880
Me, too.

566
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,680
Just a minute.

567
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:55,680
Sir,

568
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,720
I want two portions.

569
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,640
Sir,

570
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,080
one portion. I'll eat here.

571
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,600
I didn't expect it to be so busy.

572
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:01,360
(Big Bear Wonton)

573
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,280
Luo Yuan.

574
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,000
You

575
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,680
did

576
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
well today.

577
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,640
Thank you.

578
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,400
I

579
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:23,720
am

580
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,800
learning

581
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,200
sign language.

582
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,520
Am I

583
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,800
doing…

584
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,000
Doing

585
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,640
it right?

586
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,840
Right. This means right.

587
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,280
I'll clean these up.

588
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,000
You get some rest.

589
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,800
Let me. Let me.

590
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,560
Let me. Let me.

592
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,400
Time to get up.

Yuan.

594
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,120
Yuan.

595
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,520
Yuan.

596
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,520
I'm coming in.

597
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,040
Where is she?

598
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,840
She got up early.

599
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,200
I'm sorry.

600
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,840
Did you see this person?

601
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,560
No.

602

No.

603

Thanks.
