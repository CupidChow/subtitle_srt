1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,040

2
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,720
♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,140
♫  I put out mountain fires  ♫

4
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,670
♫  and catch the sunset  ♫

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,470
♫  I leave the rhythms of life in my wake  ♫

6
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:35,540
♫  Happiness whispers in my ears  ♫

7
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,390
♫  Chasing the passion for the future  ♫

8
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,540
♫  Like a dream maker  ♫

9
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:48,290
♫  Reading the universe and stars  ♫

10
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,540
♫  My existence in the river of time  ♫

11
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,390
♫  With the body temperature of a moment  ♫

12
00:00:55,390 --> 00:01:02,190
♫  I'm trying to be the extension of light  ♫

13
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:08,890
♫  If the world grants me a frustrating opening  ♫

14
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:15,440
♫  I'll chase back time like a dark horse  ♫

15
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:22,270
♫  Even though I know the truth, I won't be afraid  ♫

16
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:28,320
♫  I won't miss the moon because of mediocrity  ♫

17
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,690
♫  I won't lose the light  ♫

18
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:36,040

19
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,940

20
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,180
Aren't we having a meeting?

21
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,940
Let's do it. Hurry up.

22
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,700
See? Dingding is willing to help.

23
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,500
Yes, tell me quickly if there is a work plan.

24
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,100
I've read the statistics for this week, they're just so-so.

25
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,580
It has even declined slightly.

26
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,960
That's because of you.

27
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,280
You changed the story randomly.

28
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,620
I asked you to optimize it.

29
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,080
- If you didn't change it, it might be even worse now. 
 - That's bullsh—

30
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,480
As the supervisor, I will never accept a performance decline.

31
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,860
So, we need to set a KPI

32
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,420
and execute it by the timeline strictly.

33
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,760
What's a KPI?

34
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,780
Within a month, the click rate, topic heat, and trending statistics

35
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,680
should rank ahead over the same period.

36
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,780
Within 3 months, rank top ten.

37
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:29,380
Within 6 months, complete serializing and publish an offprint.

38
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,980
Within a year, complete the integrated incubation of the IP.

39
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,040
Your company wants to promote my comics,

40
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,060
which makes me feel happy as the author.

41
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,800
But should we invite colleagues from the Publicity Department,

42
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,360
Marketing Department, and R&amp;D Department to attend today's meeting as well?

43
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,360
It doesn't seem to work by just telling me.

44
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,220
You can't ask an author to do the marketing, can you?

45
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:14,080
It's not just me in the Comics Department?

46
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,860
I have to complete these KPIs by myself?

47
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:31,200
So, Dingding, you are taking great responsibility.

48
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,160
Good luck.

49
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,640
Zhou Mingming...

50
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,160
This is too unreasonable.

51
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,940
Fine.

52
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,820
Heaven is about to grant me great responsibility.

53
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,740
But there's no need to send Zhou Mingming to supervise me.

54
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,220
 You keep arguing with me after you came back!

55
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,820
 What do you want?

56
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,600
 You've seen so many things of mine!

57
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,580
Enough, okay!

58
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,820
 Throw it away!

59
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,420
 Can't you calm down?

60
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,100
It's annoying.

61
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,720
 Go back home first.

62
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,540
Are you Lawyer Luo?

63
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,700
I'm your neighbor living upstairs.

64
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,740
I want to consult you about something.

65
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:46,580
You can go to my law firm for consulting if you've got any legal problems.

66
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,940
If there is a man who promised to marry you

67
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:54,280
but went back on his word later, could it be solved by law?

68
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,060
What he said is just an oral promise with no legal effect.

69
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,740
It may change easily.

70
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:05,060
A person like him will only get moral condemnation instead of legal sanction.

71
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,480
What if...

72
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,780
What if we are living together?

73
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,120
The law protects marriage but not cohabitation.

74
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,200
Marriage is not the inevitable outcome of cohabitation, either.

75
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,560
You... You are a lawyer anyway.

76
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,060
Can you think of any way to sue him?

77
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,220
You want to put him in prison?

78
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,880
No, no no. Not like that.

79
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,280
I just want him to marry me.

80
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,760
Getting married is an act by initiative.

81
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,700
The law can't ask anyone to do anything they don't want to.

82
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:38,480
As far as I think, he may not have had the intention to be with you from the very beginning.

83
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,340
Actually, you can ask him carefully.

84
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,820

85
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,620
 I tried to create a new filling and want to invite you to taste it.

86
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,020
 I'm at home, you can come at any time.

87
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,080
 My brother is away from home. Trust me.

88
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,000
Yuan Yuan, I forgot to bring my key.

89
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,200
I came back to get it.

90
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,980
 Where is it? I can help you to find it.

91
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,640
In the pocket of my coat.

92
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,120
You can stay here, I'll go by myself.

93
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,660
Yuan Yuan!

94
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,300
Yuan!

95
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,840
Pretty quick.

96
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,760
Thanks.

97
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,240
What else is left?

98
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,160
Nothing forgot. I want a cup of coffee.

99
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,060
I can help you.

100
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,760
Why are you so considerate today?

101
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,860
Wait, wait.

102
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,580
Being nice without reason.

103
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:11,480
Tell me. Is there anything you don't want me to know?

104
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,180
You've interrupted my practice.

105
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,700
Right. You need to practice your new dance.

106
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,400
All right, I won't bother you.

107
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,040
Make good practice.

108
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,500
Bye-bye.

109
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,660
 I'm arriving.

110
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,100
How is it?

111
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,900
Doesn't fit your taste?

112
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,260
I feel it's not bad.

113
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,680
I can adjust it if you think it's not good enough.

114
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,780
Do you think it's good?

115
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,660
Your expression just now made me worried.

116
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,840
I've made up my mind. Open a steamed wonton shop.

117
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,340
But now a shop is needed.

118
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,660
Why are you more anxious than I am?

119
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,420
A ghost!

120
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,260
What do you want?

121
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,600
How did you get in?

122
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,280
Come on, Zhou Mingming. Explain it to me.

123
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:41,780
What does it mean by "The employee is eligible to create an active working environment for the boss"?

124
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,980
Why?

125
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,840
Mind your words.

126
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,560
Now I'm your boss.

127
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,900
How can you call your boss by his name?

128
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,040
Won't you tell me?

129
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,880
That means, you're eligible to make me happy.

130
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,700
If I ask you to go east, you can't go west.

131
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,560
If I let you serve me tea, you can't offer coffee.

132
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,400
Do I have to serve you tea?

133
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,220
What do you think? You are the only staff of the Comics Department.

134
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,820
I am the director. Do you want me to do it if you don't?

135
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,440
Figure out the situation, okay?

136
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,060
I'm an artist.

137
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,240
You're my subordinate as well.

138
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,000
All right.

139
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,440
Let's talk. Why do you do this?

140
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,720
If you can draw comics to slander me, why can't I be your boss?

141
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,980
It's unreasonable.

142
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,460
Just for that?

143
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,780
You are too mean!

144
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,160
Your wages will be deducted if you say any bad words about your boss.

145
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,720
- You— 
 - If you have any advice, talk with Li Aiqi and let her pass them on to me.

146
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,620
You just broke in suddenly. How could it be like this?

147
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,140
- Get out. 
 - Don't you think you are too...

148
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,040
Want another to fight? Want to beat me again?

149
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,180
- Guards! Guards! 
 -  Mr. Ming.

150
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:53,080
I dare not. Right?

151
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,300
Tell me. What kind of tea do you want?

152
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,360
I'll get it for you.

153
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,020
- I want a cup of latte. 
 - Okay.

154
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,340
- Quickly. 
 - All right.

155
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,120
- Run. Hurry. 
 - Wait a minute.

156
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,840
Wait for me.

157
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,780

158
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:16,300
 No. 20, Zhang Kexin,

159
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,520
 please go to room No. 5 for treatment.

160
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:25,380
 No. 21, Guo Xingyun,

161
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,520
 please go to room No. 3 for treatment.

162
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,790

163
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:36,120
 No. 26, Luo Ben,

164
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,540
 please go to room No. 1 for treatment.

165
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:44,660
 No. 23, Zhou Yiran,

166
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,060
 please go to room No. 2 for treatment.

167
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:50,480
The wound has recovered well. But it may scar.

168
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,260
Good. Leave it as a souvenir.

169
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,600
Why is it worthy of commemoration?

170
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,120
It's important to me.

171
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,440
Dr. Zhan, actually, I have been feeling chest distress these days.

172
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,820
I don't know whether there's any sequela left?

173
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,500
Let me check.

174
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,460
I'll wait for you to come off duty.

175
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,460
What do you want to eat for dinner?

176
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,000
I'll work overtime today.

177
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,440
So I can drive you to work tomorrow.

178
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,180
Tomorrow is my day off.

179
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,740
Did I come at the wrong time?

180
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,120
Yes.

181
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,600
Sorry to bother you. Take your time.

182
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,960
Go on.

183
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,620
You just sent Luo Ben away like that?

184
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,340
He must be blaming me.

185
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,580
Latte?

186
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,340
No, iced Americano.

187
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:20,780
Latte is not able to support my hardworking body now.

188
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,640
You're right. The work pressure recently is heavy.

189
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,440
You attend five to six sets of surgery every day.

190
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,600
If you keep working like this, you will be excellent soon.

191
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,700
I'm not the most hardworking one. Cai Yuxiao is.

192
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,840
He hasn't ever asked for any day off; only eating and living in the hospital.

193
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,360
He keeps working day and night.

194
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,320
I know it. He works so hard for you.

195
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,100
He was stimulated.

196
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,520
I've talked clearly with him.

197
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,580
I don't want him to be like this.

198
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:56,580
But actually, Cai Yuxiao is really an aspirant person.

199
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,800
Maybe because he has become the deputy director, he has higher requirements for himself.

200
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,620
Don't... Don't think too much.

201
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,840
Thank you.

202
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,020
 Please enjoy it.

203
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:14,120
By the way. Any update between you and Luo Ben?

204
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,660
Do you want to keep it a secret from me?

205
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,840
I can see it clearly.

206
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,380
He confessed to me.

207
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,460
Confessed?

208
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,980
But why do you avoid meeting him?

209
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,640
I don't know, I...

210
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,740
I don't know why..

211
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,420
I hated him before,

212
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:48,220
but I can't tell even by myself now.

213
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,820
I can't figure out if I feel moved

214
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,960
or have fallen in love with him.

215
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:00,120
You really should figure it out.

216
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,280
Come on. Let an expert on love like me help you.

217
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,760
Agree?

218
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,960
Agree.

219
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:15,860
When... did you feel that he was not that annoying?

220
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,720
 Dr. Zhan, have you played sandboarding?

221
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,760
 Yes, why?

222
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,580
 Hold me tight.

223
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:55,120
♫  Everyone has his own story  ♫

224
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,940
And when did you start to think that he was kind of cute?

225
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,420
 What are you doing here?

226
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:09,060
 If I had anything hard to decide, I would come here to sing songs.

227
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,260
 So you brought me here to sing songs?

228
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:14,980
 Even though you're a doctor, you should learn to control your emotion well first,

229
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,920
 so that you can deal with the patients better.

230
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,260

231
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:27,375
♫  I'm only thinking about you  ♫

232
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:35,060
♫  I love the way you look at me  ♫

233
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:39,560
♫  I'd always be touched by it  ♫

234
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,020
Have you or have you not felt emotionally affected?

235
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,580
♫  I love you the way you love me  ♫

236
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,640
 In our childhood,

237
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,600
 we could even survive an earthquake.

238
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,240
 This time...

239
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,740
 This time we can survive as well.

240
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,680
 Let's make a wish.

241
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,980
 What do you want to do?

242
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,200
 When we get out,

243
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,100
 I will help you to complete it.

244
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,940
 You may not know

245
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:22,780
 that I'm a top-level cook.

246
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:26,180
♫  Feeling the pulse  ♫

247
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:33,200
♫  I will always love and be touched by you ♫

248
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:42,660
♫  I'll always believe that you still love  ♫

249
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,340
♫  me like that  ♫

250
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,380
Look at your expression.

251
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:50,160
I got it. Diagnosis confirmed.

252
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,140
The appearance of love has come.

253
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,580
Here, let me do that.

254
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,700
Hold me tight.

255
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:41,730

256
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,580
Couldn't it be cheaper?

257
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,180
We want to rent it for a long time.

258
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:53,300
Three hundred thousand yuan a year is the lowest price in this location and area.

259
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,320
Consider that.

260
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,420
What's wrong?

261
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,400
Doubao, are you impatient?

262
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,800
I will take you out when I finish my work at hand.

263
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:49,440
All right. Let's go out for fun.

264
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,220
Doubao, let's go. Go.

265
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,880
- Falcon. 
 - Hello, Falcon.

266
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:07,720
Boys, straighten your arms.

267
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,840
Straighten, extent!

268
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,620
Waist!  Use your power.

269
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,260
Two!

270
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,660
One!

271
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:24,500
Lifting the log will practice your bone and muscle as well as your spirit.

272
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,040
Got it?

273
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,420
Falcon.

274
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:32,520
What you said is useless, you should show us a standard move.

275
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,460
That's right!  Show us.

276
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,760
Words are nothing.

277
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,160
- Show us. 
 - Boy, are you looking down upon me?

278
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,900
- No. 
 - Okay.

279
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,900
Put it down.

280
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,300
Here.

281
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,680
Then I'll show you.

282
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,100
Come on.

283
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,360
You, everybody, watch with your eyes open.

284
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,860
See what the standard log lifting is.

285
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,500
On the shoulder.

286
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,540
Watch carefully!

287
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,300
One.

288
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,540
Two.

289
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,500
One.

290
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,480
What's wrong, Falcon?

291
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,540
Nothing.

292
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:29,180
Just suddenly think of that I haven't fed Doubao.

293
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,520
Come, hurry, lend a hand.

294
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,280
Come on, help him.

295
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,320
Here.

296
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,600
- All right, you've seen it clearly. 
 - Put it off.

297
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,880
Practice carefully.

298
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,600
Okay.

299
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,180
Remember to feed Doubao something delicious.

300
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,400
Doubao, it's all right.

301
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,840
Doubao.

302
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,120
Brothers meet.  Each get half.

303
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,060
The meat is for me, and the bone is for you.

304
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,400
Come, Doubao.

305
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,880
Here.

306
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,440
Falcon.

307
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,540
Your body is recovering, how can you eat like this?

308
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,440
No way.  It's fine like this.

309
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,280
What's more. Life is bitter and short.

310
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:32,560
If I can't eat what I want, how boring my life would be.

311
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,020
The training ground is in full swing,

312
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:41,320
how about I go there with you?

313
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,600
I'm good here.

314
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,140
My buddy Doubao is with me.

315
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,000
Do you think I'm that miserable that you came to accompany me especially?

316
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,760
Listen, it's unnecessary.

317
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,120
I'll enjoy the scenery with Doubao here.

318
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,880
Pretty blissful.

319
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:03,420
All right, I'll be here with you.

320
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,640
I want to be blissful, too.

321
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,280
Has your wound healed?

322
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,900
It doesn't matter.

323
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,040
Yan has changed her attitude toward you.

324
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,280
You should catch this chance.

325
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,720
Make hay while the sun shines.

326
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,480
I prefer going with the flow.

327
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:32,880
Look at you!  This shouldn't be spoken out by you, Qingshan.

328
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,600
You can't follow me to be disorganized and undisciplined.

329
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,300
Don't be random.

330
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,200
Besides, you are her father.

331
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,640
She's your daughter.

332
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:47,180
You are eligible to untie your daughter's knot in her heart as her father.

333
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,360
All right.

334
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,920
I'll try my best.

335
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,020
- What about you? 
 - What's wrong with me?

336
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,680
How long have you not met with Yulian?

337
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,940
You should untie the knot in Yulian's heart as well.

338
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,240
This is your responsibility, too.

339
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,100
- I'm talking to you. 
 -  Fine, I know.

340
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,640
Doubao.

341
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,760
Won't eat more? Are you full?

342
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,200
Come here.

343
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,360
Hello, Falcon.

344
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,460
 Boy, do you have time?

345
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,420
 Let's have a cup of tea together.

346
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,100
 I'll send you the address.

347
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,360
Okay.

348
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:48,400
Well, weren't you unwilling to join the rescue team?

349
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,780
Why did you change your mind?

350
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,200
To make money.

351
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,720
Rescuing can make money?

352
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,360
It's hard to say. What if I can?

353
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,200
Would it make sense by making that much money?

354
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,320
You can't take it with you when you die.

355
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,420
But at least when I'm alive, I won't be worried about money.

356
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,060
Greedy.

357
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,240
Not to say anything else, let's just talk about the tea.

358
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:22,180
A pot of tea costs 500 yuan or 5 yuan.

359
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,200
Is there a difference between them?

360
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,540
Just drink it and it'll turn into piss.

361
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,220
Noting more.

362
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:32,200
But if the 500 yuan is used to buy a household first aid kit,

363
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,560
it may save many people's lives.

364
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,140
I think you can only focus on your profession at any time.

365
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,840
Occupational disease.

366
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,340
Tell me.

367
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,720
Why do you call me out?

368
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,960
This is your occupational problem: straightforward to the topic.

369
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,120
Lend me a hand.

370
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,560
I want to give my house to my ex-wife.

371
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,280
Can I ask you a question?

372
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,280
Of course, before I formally represent you in your case,

373
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,600
you can choose not to reply.

374
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,560
Say it.

375
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,640
I've never heard you mention your family.

376
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:20,000
Why do you want to give your house to your ex-wife suddenly?

377
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,640
You want to know?

378
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,620
All right.

379
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,880
I'll talk about it with you.

380
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:33,760
It was a long time ago.

381
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,980
Where should I start...

382
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,200
Bad news. Something is wrong. Hurry.

383
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,840
 What made you feel upset?

384
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,580
- I live here. 
  - Get down.

385
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,180
 Right, get down.

386
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:55,660
 - Don't commit suicide. 
 - Take it easy.

387
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,960
She's my neighbor from upstairs.

388
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,800
- Let's go. 
  - Get down.

389
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,480
- Get back, stop. 
 - Don't be mad.

390
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,000
Let's go back to talking, okay?

391
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,840
Zhu Pengfei, I've been with you for so many years. Why?

392
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,500
Why won't you marry me?

393
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,680
I didn't mean that.

394
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,500
I... I think it's enough for a couple to be happy together.

395
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,320
Why do we have to apply for that certificate?

396
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,560
You don't love me anymore, do you?

397
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,000
I do.

398
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,820
I never planned to get married from the very beginning.

399
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:27,840
People will separate even with marriage. My parents are an example.

400
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,260
You are lying.

401
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,720
- You are lying to me. 
 - Jenney.

402
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,260
Jenney, calm down.

403
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,280
I'm begging you, come down. Okay?

404
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,220
I'm on my knees. Okay? Please get down.

405
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,880
Zhu Pengfei, stand up.

406
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,780
- Stand up, you! 
 - I won't.

407
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,400
Come back with me, okay?

408
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,020
Stop it.

409
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,380
 What you said is not true.

410
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,660
Let me take this.

411
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,180
 I won't believe you anymore.

412
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,380
Listen to Zhan Yan.

413
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,960
Let me do this.

414
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,700
- Let me protect you. 
 - Okay.

415
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,040
Take care.

416
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,040
Okay.

417
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,980
- Go to persuade her, we'll seek a chance to save her. 
  - What did I do that was so wrong?

418
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,500
- Me? 
 - Calm down.

419
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,400
 - Just up here. 
 - Hurry up.

420
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,520
Stop watching. Come on, get back.

421
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,860
You'd rather kneel down than marry me.

422
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,620
Is that right, Zhu Pengfei?

423
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,200
I'll marry you. I will!

424
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,200
Let's get the certificate now. Okay?

425
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,180
My upstairs neighbor, can you calm down?

426
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,400
- Go away. 
 - No, that's not it.

427
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,160
It's none of your business. Go away.

428
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,640
Lady, listen to me.

429
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,420
 I've been cheated by a man before.

430
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:48,000
 Would you like to listen to what I have to say?

431
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,480
 I wanted to make it serious as well. I was confused and wanted to jump off a building.

432
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,660
 But after I messed it up, I regretted it at once.

433
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:58,040
 Think about it, so many people still love you.

434
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,940
I admit that it's my fault.

435
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,640
I am wrong.

436
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,920
I'll make up for it. Okay?

437
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,300
You...

438
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,280
Jenney.

439
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:10,440
Zhu Pengfei, I want you to feel regret for your whole life.

440
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,880
Jenney. Jenney!

441
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,920
 She really jumped!

442
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,000
Jenney!

443
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,540
- Let me go! 
 - Hold tight.

444
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:28,360
- Let me go. 
 - Don't move.

445
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:32,000
- Don't save me. Just let me die. 
 - Don't move!

446
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,280
We'll die together if you keep moving.

447
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:41,520
Let me go!

448
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,800
 Hold tight!

449
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,380
Help me.

450
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,600
Pull hard!

451
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,160
Pull!

452
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,500
- Are you okay? 
 - Jenney, are you okay?

453
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,620
Look-Look at me.

454
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,300
Are you all right?

455
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,460
Jenney.

456
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:32,280
It's all because of you.

457
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,480
Yes, I was wrong.

458
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,140
Don't do that anymore.

459
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,840
I saved her.

460
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,300
How foolish you are.

461
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:42,060
You jumped. You just jumped for real!

462
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,640
Falcon.

463
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,720
Falcon!

464
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:58,180

465
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,800
He is in surgery.

466
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,000
The situation is unclear.

467
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,400
What's going on, Captain?

468
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,400
Still in surgery.

469
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,000
You knew that he had a sickness.

470
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Why did you allow him to participate in the rescue?

471
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,100
Peng, you know Falcon's characteristics.

472
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,200
It's not Luo Ben's fault.

473
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,100
No.

474
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,500
It's my fault.

475
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,400
I should be blamed.

476
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,200
I didn't tie the knot tightly.

477
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,100
What did you say?

478
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,400
It's because of you?

479
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,600
Peng, calm down.

480
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,900
You are as self-righteous as when you were being trained.

481
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,000
Peng!

482
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,300
- Captain. 
 - Let go.

483
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,600
We are in a hospital.

484
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,800
What are you doing?

485
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,500
Listen.

486
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,500
If there is anything wrong with Falcon,

487
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,900
I'll let you take the consequence.

488
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,700
Twenty units of red blood cells.

489
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,700
Prepare for suture.

490
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,400
Zhan Yan.

491
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,600
If we don't force suturing now, he won't be able to live longer than this surgery.

492
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,900
Prepare for sutures.

493
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,300
Quickly.

494
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:33,300

495
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
What about the surgery?

496
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,600
During the process of the surgery,

497
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,400
the hemangioma ruptured resulting in hemorrhage...

498
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:13,400
and the blood flowed into the abdominal cavity, which caused shock.

499
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,600
The tumor was not removed.

500
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,100
He doesn't have much time to live.

501
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:56,870

502
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,700
Have something to eat.

503
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,600
A disaster is always beyond our expectations.

504
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,800
Beyond our expectations, there might be other accidents.

505
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,700
None of them is what we hope to happen and see.

506
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:42,400
But we have to face it and bear it.

507
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:48,900
But some accidents caused too heavy a price.

508
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,200
But we still have to bear it.

509
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,800
This is the meaning of us as humans.

510
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,600
Falcon.

511
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:27,500
The girl we saved wants to thank you soundly.

512
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,500
You have to recover soon.

513
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,800
Don't disappoint her kind will.

514
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,400
I should say thank you, too.

515
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:43,000
If you didn't drag me up with all your efforts,

516
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,200
I would have died.

517
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,500
Falcon.

518
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,200
Falcon.

519
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,000
Are you awake?

520
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,600
How do you feel?

521
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,300
Be careful.

522
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,800
Why are you the first person I see

523
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:23,600
whenever I wake up?

524
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,000
Because we are predestined.

525
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,700
Father Fan, are you awake?

526
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,400
- Dr. Zhan. 
 - Don't speak and don't move.

527
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,800
Save your energy and get some good rest.

528
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,200
How do you feel?

529
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:42,600
Don't worry, I'm still alive.

530
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:48,000
I still want to attend your wedding.

531
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:53,000
I'm going to change the dressing for you.

532
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,200
Get some good rest.

533
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,400
Zhan Yan.

534
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,800
Falcon is awake.

535
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,500
Does it mean that there is a change?

536
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,700
His situation is not good,

537
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,300
so he has to be watched every second.

538
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,600
Well.

539
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,600
So... Isn't there any other method?

540
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,500
I want to keep him alive more than anyone else.

541
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,400
I've tried every method that I can.

542
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,900
But I'm just a doctor. I'm not a god.

543
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:15,600
How long can I survive according to Yan?

544
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,100
Don't say nonsense.

545
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:22,100
She said you will be fine once you wake up.

546
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,500
Don't fool me.

547
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:29,500
I know my illness clearly.

548
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,700
I'm the one who got you involved.

549
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,500
Don't mention that.

550
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:42,400
We saved that person together.

551
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,900
I need to thank you.

552
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,600
Come on.

553
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:51,500
You've just woken up and need more rest.

554
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:57,000
If I don't say it now,

555
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,900
then I won't have a chance.

556
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:07,200
Don't you want to hear me talk more?

557
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,100
Okay.

558
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:24,020

559
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,800
♫  At first, there was no sadness in the world  ♫

560
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:41,200
♫  Until luck came and crossed the stage  ♫

561
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:48,870
♫  At first, souls were confused and wandered  ♫

562
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:56,100
♫  Until people hugged each other  ♫

563
00:43:56,100 --> 00:44:04,100
♫  I've been on the road  ♫

564
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:12,000
♫  Trying to connect laughter and tears  ♫

565
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:18,900
♫  I suddenly have faith  ♫

566
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:26,600
♫  I can walk by millions of shining household lights  ♫

567
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:34,400
♫  I hope I can admire flowers in the afterglow  ♫

568
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:41,700
♫  Shed tears and hope that you are well  ♫

569
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:50,400
♫  The good times I'm pursuing belong to the light  ♫

570
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:58,000
♫  It can light up the wounds that follow  ♫

571
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,800
♫  Catching the floating stars  ♫

572
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:05,600
♫  Watching as the memories flash by  ♫

573
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:09,200
♫  Traveling through market scenes  ♫

574
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:13,000
♫  With a fiery gaze  ♫

575
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,700
♫  I can't fly  ♫

576
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:20,500
♫  But I can look up  ♫

577
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:27,800
♫  I'm always on the road chasing the light  ♫
