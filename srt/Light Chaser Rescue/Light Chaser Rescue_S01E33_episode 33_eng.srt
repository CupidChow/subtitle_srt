1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,800
♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,200
♫  I put out mountain fires  ♫

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,000
♫  and catch the sunset  ♫

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,400
♫  I leave the rhythms of life in my wake  ♫

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:35,000
♫  Happiness whispers in my ears  ♫

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,400
♫  Chasing the passion for the future  ♫

8
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,500
♫  Like a dream maker  ♫

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,500
♫  Reading the universe and stars  ♫

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,600
♫  My existence in the river of time  ♫

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,600
♫  With the body temperature of a moment  ♫

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:02,200
♫  I'm trying to be the extension of light  ♫

13
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:08,900
♫  If the world grants me a frustrating opening  ♫

14
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:15,600
♫  I'll chase back time like a dark horse  ♫

15
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:22,200
♫  Even though I know the truth, I won't be afraid  ♫

16
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,300
♫  I won't miss the moon because of mediocrity  ♫

17
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,700
♫  I won't lose the light  ♫

18
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,100

19
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,300

20
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,800
It feels so good to see you again.

21
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,600
Unless you die,

22
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,500
or you'd have to keep your eyes only on me.

23
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,100
Is it the way Dr. Zhan says I love you?

24
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,000
It's unique.

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,800
If you go for rescue,

26
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,700
could you think about me for just a moment?

27
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,100
Did you cry?

28
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,000
What did they say?

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Is my leg hurt severely?

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,200
Can I stand up again?

31
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,000
Do you trust me?

32
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,800
Can I stand up again?

33
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,500
You can.

34
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,900
Zhan Yan.

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,400
I hope you can be honest with me.

36
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,000
No matter how serious it is, or whatever the consequence is,

37
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I will accept it.

38
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,100
Maybe...

39
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,400
Amputation.

40
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,300
I see.

41
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,600
Isn't there another way?

42
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,400
This is the best and safest way.

43
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,000
I don't want safety.

44
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I want my leg back.

45
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,000
Have you scheduled my surgery?

46
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,400
We can't put it off any longer.

47
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,100
I'll be with you, always.

48
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,600
I need a moment... alone.

49
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,600
I'm fine.

50
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,600
I'm here with you.

51
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,100
See you later.

52
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,800
The procedure is done.

53
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,600
Yuan Yuan.

54
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,600
It's fine. Yuan, I'm fine.

55
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,800
If you cry, I'll be more worried and not know what to do.

56
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,700
It's all right.

57
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,700
I'll recover soon.

58
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,400
Luo Ben, it's time for your surgery.

59
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,300
- You should leave. 
 - We'll stay and wait for you.

60
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Wait a second.

61
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I've checked his assessment and medical report,

62
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,400
it didn't get worse for the medical care was in time.

63
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,400
Although his leg is seriously injured and has symptoms of ischemia,

64
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,800
before it gets more serious,

65
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,700
if he undergoes debridement and decompression,

66
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,800
unclog the arteries, then revascularization,

67
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,000
with some medical treatments,

68
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,200
there won't be necrosis,

69
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,900
and we can almost keep his leg.

70
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,900
If we do as Dr. Zhan said, there would be no need for amputation surgery,

71
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:35,000
but I want to tell you the risk of Dr. Zhan's plan is very high.

72
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,600
If the plan doesn't work out, your life will be in danger.

73
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:43,000
Mr. Luo, you make the decision.

74
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,200
I believe in Zhan Yan.

75
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,400
President Qiu,

76
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:55,000
I suggest we invite Dr. Sun and Dr. Jiang of Sixth Hospital to monitor the surgery.

77
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
They are at the top of orthopedic experts.

78
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,800
If they join us, the possibility of successful surgery is higher.

79
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,200
Thank you, Dr. Wei.

80
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,900
I will contact them.

81
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,600
You must be ready for the surgery.

82
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,200
To be honest, I am not 100% sure.

83
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,200
But my belief in you is 100%.

84
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,000
What if...

85
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I mean, what if we lose it?

86
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,500
I won't regret it.

87
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:40,600
No matter what the result is, I will be with you to face it.

88
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,400
If it works, I'll help you during rehabilitatation.

89
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,600
If it doesn't work, I will be your leg.

90
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,000
It will work.

91
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,100
Let's sit for a while.

92
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,500
Go.

93
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,700
How is he, Doctor?

94
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,800
The surgery was successful.

95
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,810
The revascularization was good.

96
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,600
Thank you so much.

97
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,500
- Thanks. 
 - All right.

98
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,200
It's great.

99
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,800
I'm fine.

100
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,900
Get some sleep.

101
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,200
These two weeks of post-surgery are important.

102
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,600
I have to observe your blood every hour.

103
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,300
How is it now?

104
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,200
Very nice.

105
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,100
Take a nap with me for a moment.

106
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,400
Careful.

107
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,500
Come on.

108
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,300
What are you thinking?

109
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,900
Of you.

110
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,300
I am thinking, what if the surgery was a failure,

111
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,100
you had to be amputated.

112
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,800
I will keep living,

113
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,200
and won't be your burden.

114
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,800
I knew it, you'd dump me.

115
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,800
I should be the one to protect you.

116
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,400
How can I be your burden?

117
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,200
That's where I draw the line.

118
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,300
It is also my dignity.

119
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,400
Now you won't have the chance to do it.

120
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:46,100
No matter what happens, I won't let you leave me.

121
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:59,570

122
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,200
We've figured out why the storehouse caught fire.

123
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,300
A person was smoking there and left many cigarette butts.

124
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,600
And what's more, he plotted theft with someone else

125
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,400
and sold the stock.

126
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,600
The people I saved were them, right?

127
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,500
How do you feel? You were injured so badly for those two bad guys.

128
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,200
Isn't it unfair?

129
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,200
That I saved them has nothing to do with their crime.

130
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,300
The law will punish them.

131
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,300
They did it.

132
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,800
I knew Qiang was innocent.

133
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:36,700
The director of that company said Qiang stole all the storage because he was in prison, so he blamed it on Qiang.

134
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,200
Qiang nearly got himself killed to save me.

135
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,800
He's still lying in a hospital bed now.

136
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,900
But no one believes he's a good man,

137
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,700
and no one cares what he's been through.

138
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,700
Sister-in-law.

139
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,900
Sister-in-law, why are you here?

140
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,500
 I am sorry.

141
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,000
 I shouldn't have a prejudice against you.

142
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,800
Sister-in-law, I should say I am sorry.

143
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,600
It was me...

144
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,300
 Thank you for saving Xiong Fei.

145
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,400
Why did he tell you?

146
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,200
It was nothing.

147
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,600
 Besides Xiong Fei, I want to be one of your friends,

148
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,600
 so is it okay with you?

149
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,600
Sure, Sister-in-law.

150
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,400
Dingding hasn't been back home for a few days.

151
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,400
Are we giving her too much freedom?

152
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,400
Now she's back home.

153
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,700
I will open the door.

154
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,800
I am sorry, you are?

155
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,400
I am Zhou Mingming's mother.

156
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,000
You are Zhou's mother.

157
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,200
Honey, Zhou's mother has come.

158
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,200
Please come in.

159
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,700
Mrs. Zhou, please. Here.

160
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,000
Welcome.

161
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,200
Mrs. Zhou, please sit.

162
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,400
Here, please.

163
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,000
Water.

164
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,800
No, you don't have to.

165
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,000
I have something to say shortly.

166
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,400
Please.

167
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,800
I won't beat around the bush.

168
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:23,600
I hope you can talk to Dingding to leave my son.

169
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,000
They're not good for each other.

170
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,200
Can I ask why?

171
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,100
I have arranged everything perfectly for him till now.

172
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:39,800
Speaking of his marriage, I hope I can find someone best for him.

173
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:45,500
Obviously, Dingding is not the one for him.

174
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,830
So may I ask you who is the best?

175
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:58,400
A marriage between families of equal social rank is best for families like mine.

176
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,000
As you said, it is called a business marriage.

177
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Actually, you don't understand.

178
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
To run a family business,

179
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,400
you have to sacrifice time, freedom.

180
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,300
Love is nothing compared with business.

181
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,800
Mingming,

182
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,600
he will do his duty for the business.

183
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:25,800
Even if I leave him alone, the reality will force him to make a choice.

184
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,800
I can't entirely agree with your theory of education.

185
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,600
It is the way your family does.

186
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,800
But we also have our way of teaching Dingding.

187
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,800
We wanted her to grow up in a world of freedom,

188
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,200
and to do whatever she wanted to do.

189
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,200
Now she has grown up,

190
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,400
so she can love whoever she loves freely.

191
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,600
Do you understand it?

192
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,800
I've arranged carefully every step of my son's life,

193
00:20:54,800 --> 00:21:01,000
so we won't let any girl change his future as she loves to do.

194
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,800
Well, I have something to tell you, too.

195
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:08,000
My girl did grow up freely but she is well-educated.

196
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,600
And to us, she is the most precious.

197
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,100
She is the only one we love most.

198
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,800
It's good to hear that.

199
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,500
We should take care of the one we love.

200
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,100
Thank you.

201
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,800
Watch out.

202
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,600
I'm fine.

203
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,300
I can walk to bed.

204
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,800
Slowly.

205
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,800
I haven't gotten used to it today,

206
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,800
so I made a mess at home.

207
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,400
Tomorrow, I will do a better job.

208
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:20,800
You should get used to being the lady of the house.

209
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,200
Dream it. I haven't decided yet.

210
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,900
I don't care. It is and will always be your house.

211
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,900
You look different today,

212
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,700
but I like it.

213
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,300
Is it your bedtime book?

214
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,100
It is just a magazine like Playboy.

215
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,900
So this is your type.

216
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,500
If you get way too excited, it would be bad for your wound to heal.

217
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,400
What? What? What are you thinking?

218
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,500
Dr. Zhan, it is not what you think.

219
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,000
- Dr. Zhan. 
 - It is confiscated.

220
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,700
Good night.

221
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,700
I'm a patient but you leave me alone?

222
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,300
 - Or what should I do?  
 - I need you to take care of me.

223
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,800
 Don't overthink. I will sleep in Yuan's room.

224
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,200
Dad. Mom. I'm back.

225
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,800
Shouldn't I come home at this moment?

226
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,200
You just come back in time.

227
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,300
Your dad and I need to talk with you.

228
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,400
I didn't expect that she would come to see you.

229
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:11,400
Actually, your dad and I hesitated if we should tell you about it.

230
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,600
Mom, you should have told me immediately. I would have talked with her.

231
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,800
We're afraid you wouldn't be able to take it easy.

232
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,700
Dad, Mom, just... Don't worry about it.

233
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,000
I will figure it out.

234
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,600
Dingding,

235
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:32,200
actually, since you were a kid, your dad and I have given you enough freedom.

236
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,300
In others' eyes,

237
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,400
you didn't go to a good university,

238
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,200
you didn't get a good job,

239
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:44,000
so they think we failed in your education.

240
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
But we don't think so.

241
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
We love you.

242
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,200
The best way to cultivate your capabilities is to let you do what you like,

243
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,200
to work freely, to live freely, and to love freely.

244
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,500
But for Zhou,

245
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,200
he is a child.

246
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,200
But if you want to get married to him,

247
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,000
it is not only your business.

248
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,900
It is about our two families.

249
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,900
Zhou's mom didn't respect you,

250
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,000
and didn't respect our family, either.

251
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,600
If you're with Zhou, you won't be happy.

252
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:35,800
My girl. It's just our suggestion.

253
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:40,400
What you will do is up to you.

254
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,800
 You have to think about the details of this press briefing,

255
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:52,500
 like reporters' questions and...

256
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,900
- Ding Dingding. 
 - Ding Dingding.

257
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,000
Ding Dingding, what are you doing?

258
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Miss Li, It's none of your business.

259
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
You can't just break in. Ding Dingding!

260
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:10,200
Your parents didn't teach you how to knock on the door?

261
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,900
Sorry, Madam. I will...

262
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,000
Aunt,

263
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,700
you're Mingming's mother, so I show you respect.

264
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:22,200
You dislike me and ignore me. That's okay.

265
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,300
But you can't humiliate my parents.

266
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,500
Humiliate?

267
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,800
Is it too much?

268
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,800
I think I was honest with your parents.

269
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,400
I proposed my ideas and solutions.

270
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,000
I was doing what a mother should do.

271
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,700
And I hope your parents can do what they should do to teach you.

272
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,400
My parents won't be as selfish as you.

273
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,700
You just regard your son as your possession, to exchange for more.

274
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,000
You just require Mingming to live the life you want,

275
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,800
force him to do that he doesn't like, and marry the one he doesn't love.

276
00:27:54,800 --> 00:28:00,500
My parents hope that I can grow up happily and live a free life.

277
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:06,000
So, that's why you became like this.

278
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,600
No politeness. No order.

279
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:13,100
I created a good environment for Mingming.

280
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:17,300
So he can marry a good girl and reject the one who isn't a match.

281
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:23,100
Now, you are the one who is not a good match.

282
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,800
Of course.

283
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,000
You've been with my son for a long time.

284
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,200
I will not treat you unfairly.

285
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,800
Please.

286
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,400
This is politeness you mentioned?

287
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,600
Fine.

288
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,000
 Chu Yun, I'm here.

289
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 Here you are.

290
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,900
What's wrong?

291
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,000
It hurts?

292
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,400
It's okay.

293
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,300
I just want to walk more.

294
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,800
Stretch your leg.

295
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,800
I told you.

296
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,400
You should take it easy. Recover step by step.

297
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,000
It's too slow.

298
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,600
If it's like this, when can I return to the team?

299
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,600
You think about rescue even now?

300
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:26,800
I must be the most professional and top member of the rescue team.

301
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,100
Does it sound like I'm disabled but ambitious?

302
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,900
Nonsense.

303
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,700
With your current status, it's not difficult for you to recover.

304
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:51,200
But if you want to reach the standard of rescue,

305
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,800
it'll take longer to recover.

306
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,200
I know.

307
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:03,700
Actually, I can keep my leg this time, it's lucky enough.

308
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:11,900
I can introduce an excellent rehabilitation trainer.

309
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,000
But it's not easy.

310
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,400
Can you go through it?

311
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,600
Who is it?

312
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,400
Relax, don't be nervous.

313
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,000
Okay, right.

314
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,300
Would you please be gentle?

315
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,900
It just started.

316
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,500
I'm okay, it's nothing.

317
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:45,200
He just feels well. Can you help him to recover gradually?

318
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,800
Don't worry.

319
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,800
I know it well.

320
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,800
It's not you who feels pain.

321
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,700
Luo Ben,

322
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,000
I think we'd better quit.

323
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,400
Someone is really worried about you.

324
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:03,400
Zhan Yan, how about hanging out for a while?

325
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,100
Oh my god.

326
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,900
You're good, man.

327
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:15,000
She cares about you so much.

328
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,400
Yeah, I'm a little bit charming. Right?

329
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,600
Really.

330
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:23,000
Also, show me your charm.

331
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,600
I feel that.

332
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,000
Hang in there.

333
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,500
Please, captain, my leg.

334
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,000
One more time.

335
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,800
Relax.

336
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:41,020
It's me.

337
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,319
Wow, it looks delicious.

338
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:49,599
It's Editor-in-Chief Gao.

339
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:50,780
- Be careful. 
 - Okay.

340
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,359
What's wrong?

341
00:32:53,539 --> 00:32:55,460
That's great.

342
00:32:57,019 --> 00:32:59,960
- What's this? 
 - Throat lozenges.

343
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,299
Why did you give this to me?

344
00:33:01,299 --> 00:33:03,179
Okay, good.

345
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:04,739
You shouted so loudly.

346
00:33:04,739 --> 00:33:06,799
All of us could hear you.

347
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,880
Thank you.

348
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,940
I will be there soon.

349
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,679
Yan.

350
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,120
It's about that child.

351
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,920
Is it about the adopter?

352
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,360
I just received the call. There is a clue.

353
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,920
Not the adopter. But an editor-in-chief of the newspaper.

354
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,579
What child?

355
00:33:28,579 --> 00:33:31,740
During the earthquake, the one my dad rescued.

356
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:34,120
- You're looking for him. 
 - Yes.

357
00:33:34,939 --> 00:33:37,450
I handed him to the doctor.

358
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:39,460
And they sent him to a welfare center.

359
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,860
But I haven't heard from him ever since.

360
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:45,120
So, why are you looking for him?

361
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:51,780
- I'm thinking that... 
 - Dad.

362
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:55,779
You're so busy. And help him to recover.

363
00:33:55,779 --> 00:33:57,830
I can meet the editor-in-chief.

364
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:58,940
Okay.

365
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,859
I'll send you the address later.

366
00:34:00,859 --> 00:34:02,840
- Try the food. 
 - Thanks, Captain.

367
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,719
- Okay. 
 - Come on.

368
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,999
I told Peng.

369
00:34:08,999 --> 00:34:11,719
He'll take care of you these days and pick you up to do exercises.

370
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:13,999
Ding Dingding will make meals for you.

371
00:34:13,999 --> 00:34:18,780
Or you can ask for help from Xiong Fei and Luo Yuan. Okay?

372
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:21,900
Come on. You won't stay there for three years.

373
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:25,160
Can you forget that?

374
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:30,700
Maybe if it's a nice place, I might stay there.

375
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,039
Don't worry, go!

376
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:35,099
I promise I will rehabilitate my leg.

377
00:34:36,419 --> 00:34:39,099
Okay. That's good.

378
00:34:39,099 --> 00:34:41,479
Stay safe. Goodbye.

379
00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:46,400
Bye.

380
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:08,360

381
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:19,120
I remember when the writing was submitted.

382
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,399
The editor found that and reported it to me.

383
00:35:22,399 --> 00:35:25,380
I arranged for someone to interview and write this article.

384
00:35:26,019 --> 00:35:30,010
Could you contact the contributor?

385
00:35:31,499 --> 00:35:33,760
The contributor is not a professional photographer.

386
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,580
He just captured this cherished moment at the earthquake site.

387
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,920
And he sent it to our newspaper.

388
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,640
How about the contact?

389
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,540
Do you have the contact?

390
00:35:48,319 --> 00:35:51,060
At that time, it was submitted by mail.

391
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,879
No digital recording.

392
00:35:53,899 --> 00:35:57,099
Our office was moved several times.

393
00:35:57,099 --> 00:36:01,760
These contacts of contributors wouldn't be stored.

394
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,990
There are no other ways?

395
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:08,420
Well, I'll ask my old colleagues.

396
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:11,860
Well, don't expect too much.

397
00:36:12,419 --> 00:36:14,079
Thanks a lot.

398
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:16,039
Right.

399
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:16,980
Oh, I recalled that

400
00:36:17,219 --> 00:36:19,499
I recalled that those orphans saved at that time

401
00:36:19,899 --> 00:36:23,770
stayed at the rescue station of the Civil Affairs Bureau first.

402
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:27,140
And later, they were sent to welfare centers.

403
00:36:28,439 --> 00:36:31,640
You can go to the rescue station to ask.

404
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,040
Rescue station?

405
00:36:34,799 --> 00:36:36,860
Okay, thanks.

406
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,399
You're welcome.

407
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,360
- Are you all right? 
 - I feel much better.

408
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,740
The cast has been removed, right?

409
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,199
Yeah.

410
00:36:46,099 --> 00:36:47,879
Yeah, I can walk now.

411
00:36:47,879 --> 00:36:49,480
Look at you.

412
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:54,190
Why do you dress neatly to fetch me today?

413
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,700
Is it a little over?

414
00:36:55,700 --> 00:37:00,599
Doctor Zhan told us that we should serve you at a high level.

415
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,930
- Go. 
 - Now you're the one we should focus on.

416
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,640
Come on.

417
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:16,119
The earthquake orphans were sent to welfare centers through our rescue station.

418
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:19,260
But the child you are looking for, there is no name and background,

419
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,180
but only one obscure newspaper.

420
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:23,380
It's too hard.

421
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:26,319
What welfare centers were these children transferred to at that time?

422
00:37:26,319 --> 00:37:27,840
Do you have any transfer records?

423
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,960
Yeah, wait a moment.

424
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,640

425
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:39,380
 Thanks to you, these days, the whole team comes to take care of me.

426
00:37:40,819 --> 00:37:41,999
 Enjoy it.

427
00:37:41,999 --> 00:37:44,560
 When you've recovered, no one will treat you like this.

428
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,119
 When will you come back?

429
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:48,859
 I miss you.

430
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,980
 I'll be back today.

431
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:00,330
Here is a copy of the transfer record. Have a look.

432
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:03,139
- Thanks. 
 - You're welcome.

433
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:37,720
 Dingding, are you drawing?

434
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,779
 You're different. Now you don't reply to me at once.

435
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,459
 It's so boring. Reply me.

436
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,839
 What are you doing?

437
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:08,400

438
00:39:19,999 --> 00:39:21,419
 Hello.

439
00:39:21,419 --> 00:39:23,500
What are you doing? Why don't you reply to me?

440
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,200
Are you busy?

441
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:31,319
We should break up.

442
00:40:07,219 --> 00:40:09,230
Dingding.

443
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:10,540
 Dingding.

444
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,160
Dingding.

445
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,500
 You're at home. Just open the door.

446
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,160
 Dingding, let's talk about it. Dingding.

447
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:22,460
Zhou Mingming, I have nothing to say.

448
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:25,020
Open the door first, Dingding.

449
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,820
 Open the door. I want to talk with you.

450
00:40:32,919 --> 00:40:35,500
Why break up?

451
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,019
- I don't love you. 
 - You liar.

452
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:40,350
How can you say you don't love me all of sudden?

453
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:42,079
Did I do something wrong?

454
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:43,619
You need more love materials again?

455
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:45,260
Just tell me, I will think about methods.

456
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,780
Don't say "break up" easily. It's not good.

457
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,199
I don't need anything.

458
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:49,910
I can't explain love clearly.

459
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:51,940
It comes and goes quickly.

460
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:54,320
- I don't agree. 
 - I don't care whether you agree or not.

461
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,800
Don't come later.

462
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,180
Just leave. I'm going to draw.

463
00:40:58,799 --> 00:41:01,779
I won't leave if you don't give me a reason.

464
00:41:05,419 --> 00:41:07,399
Is it my mom?

465
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,319
She came again?

466
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,599
What did she say?

467
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:13,820
Just say something, Dingding.

468
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:16,739
Your mom gave me money and asked me to break up with you.

469
00:41:16,739 --> 00:41:19,660
Well, please don't be angry with her.

470
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:21,160
No, I'm not.

471
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,040
I received that money.

472
00:41:24,259 --> 00:41:26,200
So I must break up with you.

473
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,840
Don't lie. You wouldn't do that.

474
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,120
Yes, I did.

475
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,940
I love money more. Is it fine?

476
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,940
No.

477
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:36,199
It's our business. Never mind her.

478
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:37,679
Do you love me? Say it.

479
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:40,059
Well, what should I do?

480
00:41:40,059 --> 00:41:42,470
You don't care about what your mom said but I care.

481
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:45,399
Your mom has visited me a lot. Did you do anything to help me?

482
00:41:52,999 --> 00:41:55,899
It's really hard for me. Do you know that?

483
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,100
I don't want to go on.

484
00:42:01,979 --> 00:42:04,400
I've made up my mind.

485
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,539
Let's break up.

486
00:43:02,359 --> 00:43:04,099
I'm home.

487
00:43:19,299 --> 00:43:21,519
I'm waiting for you at the Tree of Love.

488
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:35,050

489
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:43,790
♫  At first, there was no sadness in the world  ♫

490
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:51,240
♫  Until luck came and crossed the stage  ♫

491
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:59,210
♫  At first, souls were confused and wandered  ♫

492
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:06,290
♫  Until people hugged each other  ♫

493
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:13,960
♫  I've been on the road  ♫

494
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:22,210
♫  Trying to connect laughter and tears  ♫

495
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:29,360
♫  I suddenly have faith  ♫

496
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:36,860
♫  I can walk by millions of shining household lights  ♫

497
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:45,590
♫  I hope I can admire flowers in the afterglow  ♫

498
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:51,840
♫  Shed tears and hope that you are well  ♫

499
00:44:51,840 --> 00:45:00,610
♫  The good times I'm pursuing belong to the light  ♫

500
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:08,190
♫  It can light up the wounds that follow  ♫

501
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:12,010
♫  Catching the floating stars  ♫

502
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:15,740
♫  Watching as the memories flash by  ♫

503
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:19,410
♫  Traveling through market scenes  ♫

504
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:23,290
♫  With a fiery gaze  ♫

505
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:26,910
♫  I can't fly  ♫

506
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:30,610
♫  But I can look up  ♫

507
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:38,440
♫  I'm always on the road chasing the light  ♫
