1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:10,220

2
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,910
♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

3
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,180
♫  I put out mountain fires  ♫

4
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,910
♫  and catch the sunset  ♫

5
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:28,530
♫  I leave the rhythms of life in my wake  ♫

6
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:35,280
♫  Happiness whispers in my ears  ♫

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,430
♫  Chasing the passion for the future  ♫

8
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:43,560
♫  Like a dream maker  ♫

9
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:48,430
♫  Reading the universe and stars  ♫

10
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,580
♫  My existence in the river of time  ♫

11
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:55,610
♫  With the body temperature of a moment  ♫

12
00:00:55,610 --> 00:01:02,310
♫  I'm trying to be the extension of light  ♫

13
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:08,910
♫  If the world grants me a frustrating opening  ♫

14
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:15,480
♫  I'll chase back time like a dark horse  ♫

15
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:22,330
♫  Even though I know the truth, I won't be afraid  ♫

16
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:28,460
♫  I won't miss the moon because of mediocrity  ♫

17
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,730
♫  I won't lose the light  ♫

18
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:36,020

19
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,010

20
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,699
 I made three wishes to the love tree.

21
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:12,520
 I wish you could find them here.

22
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,060
 I've rehearsed in countless ways in my heart.

23
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,060
 Some are big ones.

24
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,140
 Some are unconstrained.

25
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:29,870
 But I'm afraid you don't care

26
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,160
 how many people can witness this moment just as I do.

27
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,980
 I hope this day can be like the days we've been together,

28
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,400
 flowing like fine water.

29
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,160
 So... my first wish is for time.

30
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,440
 I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

31
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,930
 I want the rest of my life to start today.

32
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,019
 There used to be only Luo Yuan in my world.

33
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:10,020
 When you showed up, two possibilities appeared in my life.

34
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,880
 One to her, another way to you.

35
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,980
 Sometimes I can't help it and I just want to run for you.

36
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,419
 Yuan asked me after I came back from Xishan

37
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:30,219
 that if I'd ever thought about her when I fought my life to save you.

38
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:31,780
 I lied.

39
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,000
 At that time, my mind was full of the idea that I couldn't lose you.

40
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:43,200
 So my second wish is for myself.

41
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,199
 I hope I will always have the ability to protect you,

42
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:51,240
 always let you have the courage to love me.

43
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:56,680
And your third wish?

44
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:00,380
Don't you have an answer in your heart?

45
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,859
I want to hear you say it yourself.

46
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,659
Although I'm hurt,

47
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:14,590
all I can think about is you.

48
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,879
It's you before going to bed at night.

49
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:19,519
It's you when I open my eyes in the morning.

50
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,840
I'm injured, but I'm very happy.

51
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,399
Every minute and every second we're together, I'm very happy.

52
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:37,079
I think I need to give my future a clearer direction.

53
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:43,419
So I recovered from my injury and prepared this for you.

54
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:48,650
♫  I'm only thinking about you  ♫

55
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:53,400
♫  I love the way you look at me  ♫

56
00:04:53,400 --> 00:05:00,625
♫  I will always love and be touched by you ♫

57
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:05,470
♫  I promise to the beating heart  ♫

58
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:07,059
Zhan Yan.

59
00:05:07,059 --> 00:05:12,460
I hope my future days can have you with me.

60
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,460
Will you marry me?

61
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,560
♫  Our hearts are beating at the same pace  ♫

62
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:28,660
♫  We'll go after what's appealing to us  ♫

63
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:35,320
♫  Like the stars shining at night  ♫

64
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:40,120
♫  I want to shine in the darkness  ♫

65
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,180
♫  I'll be soft and silent  ♫

66
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,560
♫  Feeling the pulse  ♫

67
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:54,300
♫  I will always love and be touched by you ♫

68
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:27,140
♫  Joys and sorrows in different rooms  ♫

69
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:33,840
♫  We're all busy living our own life  ♫

70
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,180
♫  Time slows down as you pass by  ♫

71
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:43,940
♫  I'm longing to see you again  ♫

72
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:54,300
♫  We all have our dreams in this world  ♫

73

♫  I'm only thinking about you  ♫

00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:10,240
♫  I will always love and be touched by you ♫

76
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:18,440
♫  I promise to the beating heart  ♫

77

♫  Our hearts are beating at the same pace  ♫

79
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:38,780
♫  We'll go after what's appealing to us  ♫

80
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:45,400
♫  Like the stars shining at night  ♫

81
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:50,280
♫  I want to shine in the darkness  ♫

82
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,300

85
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:14,120
♫  I'll always believe that you still love  ♫

86
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:19,480
♫  me like that  ♫

87
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:39,019
Well, if that's the case, I may still have to trouble you to solve it.

88
00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:45,860
Why are you back so late, Mingming?

89
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,320
Qiqi has been waiting for you for a long time.

90
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,220
Look at him.

91
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,659
What?

92
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,960
What happened to him?

93
00:08:58,859 --> 00:09:01,859
He probably broke up with Ding Dingding.

94
00:09:01,859 --> 00:09:03,820
How naughty he is.

95
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,180
It's okay. Go on.

96
00:09:07,439 --> 00:09:09,900
When was this taken?

97
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,180
It was my first day at work.

98
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,940
I didn't have money for a new suit,

99
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,360
so I wore the suit of a senior at college.

100
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,120
It looks plain.

101
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,799
But your eyes were clean.

102
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:32,179
It's like glowing beneath the dirt.

103
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:34,179
So they're polluted now.

104
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:39,059
Now in your eyes are pretentiousness, arrogance,

105
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:43,200
and also breaking the traffic rules.

106
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,640
How can you still remember this?

107
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,560
I will remember it all my life.

108
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,720
Just remember it.

109
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,659
But you can't tell it to our future children.

110
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:55,159
It'll break the good image of me in their hearts.

111
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:56,740
It's also not good for education.

112
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,300
And these three girls?

113
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,259
These three girls.

114
00:10:02,259 --> 00:10:05,420
They all liked me in college.

115
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,539
You boast.

116
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:09,919
I'm not boasting.

117
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:11,620
You'd have some confidence in yourself.

118
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:16,020
You have to have some confidence in yourself.

119
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:18,820
How cute you were when you were a kid!

120
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,720
Of course.

121
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,560
A sad face. Why's that?

122
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,059
That's a juvenile face.

123
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:27,160
I was in middle school.

124
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,259
Handsome, wasn't I?

125
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,399
You know what?

126
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:40,520
I didn't even know who I should call for parent-teacher meetings.

127
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,540
Zhan Yan.

128
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:54,690
If my parents knew I married you, they would be happy for me.

129
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:01,310

130
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,820
Dad.

131
00:11:09,819 --> 00:11:15,320
Captain, I should have let you know earlier.

132
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,179
What is it?

133
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:20,060
I proposed to Zhan Yan.

134
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,899
She said yes.

135
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:29,800
Mr. Luo, you took my daughter away quietly.

136
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,280
Did you get my permission?

137
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,059
It is not difficult to have yours.

138
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:36,980
It's hard to get hers.

139
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,659
Don't you know your daughter?

140
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,799
I'm happy for you.

141
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,139
So, let's start training now.

142
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:51,300
You can never bluff it out even with such a relationship.

143
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,899
I know you won't make an exception.

144
00:11:52,899 --> 00:11:55,459
I have already prepared myself.

145
00:11:55,459 --> 00:11:56,919
I'll go to the welfare home first.

146
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:58,710
Sure.

147
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:59,899
Go easy.

148
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:02,460
Don't worry. He'll be fine.

149
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,019
Take it easy.

150
00:12:07,699 --> 00:12:12,399
- Today, we try on some apparatuses. 
 - Sure.

151
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,560

152
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,919
Lele.

153
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,280
Sister Yan.

154
00:12:26,439 --> 00:12:28,120
Have you been good recently?

155
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,400
The teacher praised me.

156
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,899
Lele has been good recently.

157
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:34,139
He often helps teachers take care of younger children.

158
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:36,880
We all like him.

159
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,839
Sorry to trouble you, Dean.

160
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:43,539
It's all your credit that Lele has made such great progress.

161
00:12:43,539 --> 00:12:46,860
Sister Yan, I'm building blocks with my friends.

162
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,139
Can you come over later and see us building a castle?

163
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:51,499
Sure.

164
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:57,819
Lele has been missing you and Mr. Luo a lot these days. And now you're here.

165
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:01,399
Actually, there is one more thing I want to ask you.

166
00:13:04,939 --> 00:13:06,139
Please look at this.

167
00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:09,839
They're the earthquake orphans from Qingshan County.

168
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,440
I heard that the orphans were sent to orphanages all over the area.

169
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,580
Some were sent here, too.

170
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,639
I want to look for them.

171
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:21,439
It was over 20 years ago. It's a little difficult.

172
00:13:21,439 --> 00:13:24,980
And our archives center is being renovated these days.

173
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,340
It's not open.

174
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,660
How about this?

175
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:32,459
After the renovation is finished, I'll contact you right away. Is it okay?

176
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:35,319
Sure. I'm sorry to trouble you.

177
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:54,480
I'm sorry. We didn't find anything about the child.

178
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,159
Thanks.

179
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,340
Sorry that we couldn't help.

180
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,859
Thank you.

181
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,520
 Come on, come on. Take one!

182
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,620
 Take a drop. Come on, man.

183
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,980
 Let's have it.

184
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,680
 I'll get you some kebabs.

185
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,900
Come on. Enjoy yourselves.

186
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,040
 Sure.

187
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:49,560
Luo Ben, amazing. You've got the daughter of our captain.

188
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,780
It's not enough to treat us to only a barbecue, isn't it?

189
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,999
It has to be a big one.

190
00:14:53,999 --> 00:14:58,499
Of course. We're not that easy to get rid of.

191
00:14:58,499 --> 00:15:00,659
And how big the meal is

192
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:04,959
depends on how important Dr. Zhan is in your heart.

193
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:07,150
Well.

194
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,719
I'll find a time and invite all of you to any restaurant you want in Linjiang.

195
00:15:12,719 --> 00:15:16,639
 - Bravo. 
 - You're a man, bro.

196
00:15:17,979 --> 00:15:21,139
- Have it. 
 - Thanks.

197
00:15:21,139 --> 00:15:22,460
Here we are. Made fresh.

198
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,739
Enjoy it.

199
00:15:23,739 --> 00:15:28,279
Congratulations. Yuan has been looking forward to your wedding with Zhan Yan.

200
00:15:31,119 --> 00:15:34,680
 I have to call you sister-in-law.

201
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,560
What did she say?

202
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:40,820
She said let's have the wedding earlier.

203
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,639
Choked with smoke?

204
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:49,920
Is it because of the smoke? Let's go back.

205
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,359
Eat some.

206
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,360
This guy.

207
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,920
Xiong Fei is considerate.

208
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,319
You don't have to envy him.

209
00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:03,830
Your future husband is better than him.

210
00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:06,340
You just keep showing your affection, don't you?

211
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,019
I heard it all.

212
00:16:08,019 --> 00:16:09,100
Jealous?

213
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,660
Of course, I'm jealous. Give me a kebab.

214
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,999
Okay.

215
00:16:12,999 --> 00:16:16,180
- Just eat and shut your mouth. Here you are. 
 - Thank you for that.

216
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:19,090
Grill some vegetables. They like it.

217
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:24,820
Looking at these young people is like seeing the future of our Light Chaser Rescue.

218
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:33,020
I'm so happy for you because you're going well with Yan.

219
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:38,599
If I had listened to you earlier, it might not have taken so long.

220
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,079
Eat well and drink well.

221
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,439
 Thank you, Dr. Zhan.

222
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:46,940
 Thank you, Yan.

223
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,520
Just enjoy it!

224
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,819
Sis.

225
00:17:03,479 --> 00:17:05,739
I forgot to congratulate you.

226
00:17:05,739 --> 00:17:09,779
You've been through so much with Luo Ben. Finally, you're going to be married.

227
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,899
How nice it is!

228
00:17:11,899 --> 00:17:15,179
Why are you here alone? Where's Zhou Mingming?

229
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,879
We broke up.

230
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,940
Why?

231
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,720
We were just playing.

232
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,639
Had enough playing, so we broke up.

233
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:36,320
You always fight for fun,

234
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,620
but everyone can see that you two really like each other.

235
00:17:42,939 --> 00:17:44,719
So why is that?

236
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,960
I like so many people, not just him.

237
00:18:01,219 --> 00:18:04,040
His mother doesn't agree with our relationship.

238
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,539
Ding Dingding,

239
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:13,159
then I really look down on you.

240
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,599
My cousin won't shrink back because of this reason.

241
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:23,839
Cousin, I can't be invincible forever.

242
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:25,940
I threw in the towel this time.

243
00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:31,420
Don't think about it.

244
00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:36,099
Just let it be.

245
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,120
I believe in Zhou Mingming.

246
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,640
He seems quite unreliable,

247
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,100
but he won't give up on what he has decided.

248
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:51,240
Such as diving rescue.

249
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,399
Call a doctor if you need healing.

250
00:19:18,899 --> 00:19:20,780
Mind yourself and stop drinking.

251
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,620
What's the matter with drinking some wine after falling out of love?

252
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,099
You have many plans, don't you?

253
00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:31,220
Arrange another one for me.

254
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,680
This question is too difficult.

255
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,780
I can't do this.

256
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,739
You need to solve it yourself.

257
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:41,139
But what can I do?

258
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:44,120
Mingming, Dingding is your girlfriend.

259
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,579
You must know her better than we do.

260
00:19:46,579 --> 00:19:50,279
If you really want to be with her,

261
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:53,100
you have to know what she really wants,

262
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:57,000
not these romantic things.

263
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:15,499
But what exactly does she want?

264
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,700
Wait.

265
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,200
Such a big diamond ring.

266
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,400
I wonder what light dazzled me this morning.

267
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,000
You and Luo Ben...

268
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,000
He proposed.

269
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,300
Congratulations, Mrs. Luo.

270
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,700
When do you have time?

271
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:19,000
Junchi and I will celebrate with you guys.

272
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,400
Oh, you call him Junchi now.

273
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,900
What happened?

274
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,100
What can happen between us?

275
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,200
A love affair.

276
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,000
So fast.

277
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,200
I wonder if I'd celebrate you first.

278
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,400
Oh, thank you very much.

279
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,300
I don't know when he will send me a large diamond ring.

280
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:42,900
Don't worry. If he is yours, a large diamond will be yours soon.

281
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,000
Editor-in-Chief Gao.

282
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,400
Yes.

283
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,700
You found the photographer?

284
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,500
Okay, I'll be there right away.

285
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,700
I'm leaving. Help me with a shift.

286
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,600
I took the picture.

287
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,300
There was just an aftershock then.

288
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:11,700
I saw a man taking a child out of the ruins.

289
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,000
 Hurry. Hurry up.

290
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,600
 - Here. I have a man here. 
 - Coming.

291
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,400
 Mind your step.

292
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,800
 I'll take him.

293
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,400
 - Take him slowly. 
 - Hurry!

294
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,800
At first, I thought he saved his own son.

295
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,500
Until he handed him over to the medical staff

296
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,400
and then saved his wife,

297
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:36,200
I found out he saved the child first at the supreme moment.

298
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:41,100
And his wife died because she didn't get help in time

299
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,800
in an aftershock.

300
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,700
I was very touched.

301
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:50,800
So I sent this photo with the story to the newspaper office.

302
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,500
Do you have other photos of this child?

303
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,600
Yes. Editor-in-Chief Gao told me to bring them to you.

304
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,000
- Here you are. 
 - Thanks.

305
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,100
Last 10 seconds.  Last 10 seconds!

306
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,200
Good. Last ten seconds.

307
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:45,600
Five. Four. Three. Two. One.

308
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,400
Time's up.

309
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,400
Don't stop. Slow down.

310
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,500
Take it slow.

311
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,800
How are you feeling?

312
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:05,900
Thanks to the captain, I can feel my leg again.

313
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,200
Thanks, Captain.

314
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,300
You're welcome.

315
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,300
It's you who stuck to it well.

316
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,100
I'll take a shower first.

317
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,200
You can talk.

318
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,700
Sure.

319
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,600
The rehabilitation training is painful.

320
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,500
Most people can't stand it at all.

321
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,500
I'm surprised he can make it.

322
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:31,000
So it has got a very good effect.

323
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,300
He is a proud man.

324
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:39,800
So for that leg, he'll fight for his life.

325
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,200
The child...

326
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,700
Any update on the child?

327
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,200
I told you.

328
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,600
It's been so many years.

329
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,800
He's not easy to find.

330
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,300
If we do find him, will you tell him everything?

331
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,600
Yes.

332
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,800
What if he doesn't forgive you?

333
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:22,300
I caused him that much harm.

334
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,100
I dare not ask for his forgiveness.

335
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:32,000
But why should we disturb his life again?

336
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Why are we hurting him again?

337
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,400
Maybe it is best for him if he doesn't know the truth.

338
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,000
Yan,

339
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,500
if I hadn't been shaped into the hero who saved his life,

340
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,700
I really shouldn't uncover his scars.

341
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,800
But because of the public opinion at that time,

342
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,800
he would also regard me as a hero and feel grateful to me

343
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,000
if he saw the report.

344
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
He would regard me, a sinner, as his benefactor.

345
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,600
I can't keep it from him after I hurt him.

346
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,200
And he has the right to know the truth.

347
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,500
I see.

348
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,600
Zhan Yan, I'm coming in.

349
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,800
What were you reading?

350
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,100
Just skimming over something.

351
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:56,100
How was it? Did you get anything from going out today?

352
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,200
That's okay.

353
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,200
Your father didn't find him for so many years.

354
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,200
You don't have to be in such a hurry.

355
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,400
I know.

356
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,100
The captain gave me recovery training these days.

357
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,600
I think it's particularly effective.

358
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,000
When my legs are recovered, I'll look for him with you.

359
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,800
You said we don't need to be in such a hurry.

360
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,300
Do your things, I'll find him by myself.

361
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,800
Sure. It's a long day.

362
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,600
Go take a shower.

363
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,400
Then I'll go.

364
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,200

365
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,800
Zhan Yan, I'm coming in.

366
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,000
Have a glass of milk.

367
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,600
Thank you.

368
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,000
Let me have a look.

369
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,300
Heart-to-heart Welfare Center.

370
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:31,800
I told you I was transferred to this welfare center after the Qingsen earthquake.

371
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:36,300
Maybe the boy you're looking for was also transferred there.

372
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,900
No way.

373
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I've been there.

374
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,800
So I crossed it out.

375
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,400
All right.

376
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,200
Speaking of it, it's been a long time since I visited Lele last time.

377
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,400
You should go there with me when my legs are recovered.

378
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,800
Your legs haven't recovered yet.

379
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,600
I don't want to bother you too much.

380
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,800
I went to see Lele. Everything is fine.

381
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,700
Don't worry about him.

382
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,500
All right.

383
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:18,800
After my legs are fine, I have a lot of things to do with you.

384
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,400
Well, go to bed.

385
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,000
I'll take the rest of it.

386
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,500
Drink it.

387
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,600
You've been having meetings all morning.

388
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,400
Won't you take a break?

389
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,900
Tell the department heads.

390
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:15,200
Continue to discuss the program in the meeting room in ten minutes.

391
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,700
Okay.

392
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,160
I've figured it out.

393
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:12,140
Even if I'm together with Mingming and we have a good relationship,

394
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:15,420
we can't withstand the troubles made by his mother.

395
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:23,580
Although my parents always dislike me, I know they love me in their own way.

396
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:27,760
Even if I'm okay with his mother,

397
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,840
I can't let my parents suffer.

398
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:35,339
Never say never.

399
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:40,699
You and Zhou Mingming still have hope.

400
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:44,400
There are some people and some things...

401
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:50,099
you just can't solve even if you try your best.

402
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:54,999
You'll regret it if you give up now.

403
00:32:58,459 --> 00:33:00,600
Yes, I will regret it.

404
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:06,839
But for some regrets, I have nothing to do with them.

405
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:13,740
Yes, nothing to do with them.

406
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,650

407
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:30,730

408
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:39,240

409
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:46,090

410
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:52,060

411
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,460
You didn't eat anything all day.

412
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,740
Are you in a bad mood?

413
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,319
No.

414
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,459
Here.

415
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:41,860

416
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,840
You care so much about her.

417
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,700
Why don't you go find her?

418
00:34:50,499 --> 00:34:52,619
We broke up.

419
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:09,099
I can see the relationship between you and Dingding clearly.

420
00:35:09,099 --> 00:35:14,100
From the first time you asked me to sign her,

421
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:17,820
I knew she was different in your heart.

422
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,860
We grew up together.

423
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:26,519
I've never seen you care so much about a girl.

424
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:34,720
It's very rare to have a relationship like that.

425
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,460

426
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,259
Mingming.

427
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:43,999
Don't make yourself regret it.

428
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:19,700

429
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,720

430
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:25,480

431
00:37:46,339 --> 00:37:48,699
It's early. What are you doing here?

432
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:53,680
Dingding, you were right.

433
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:58,540
I didn't deal with the relationship between my mom and your parents well.

434
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,480
You must feel aggrieved.

435
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,360
But I figured it out now.

436
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,999
It is our own matter.

437
00:38:03,999 --> 00:38:06,119
No one can stop us.

438
00:38:07,339 --> 00:38:12,899
Ding Dingding, I want to be with you for my whole life.

439
00:38:12,899 --> 00:38:14,799
Marry me, please.

440
00:38:19,379 --> 00:38:22,940
Dingding, will you marry me?

441
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,400
I don't want to make a fuss in the morning.

442
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,219
I mean it.

443
00:38:29,219 --> 00:38:33,159
As long as you want it, we can go and register now.

444
00:38:43,299 --> 00:38:45,040
Dingding,

445
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:51,080
in the past, you were under pressure and tried to come to me.

446
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:56,440
In the future, I want to guard you.

447
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,139
May I?

448
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:07,339
You idiot.

449
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,440

450
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,259
Mom, look. We're married.

451
00:39:21,259 --> 00:39:22,660
Aunt, we married today.

452
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,039
- Aunt? 
 - Mom.

453
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,939
Have you been waiting for a long time?

454
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:37,460
Dingding, have you got the household register?

455
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:40,150
Let's go.

456
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:45,630

457
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:48,040
Wait a minute, Mingming.

458
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,560
What's wrong?

459
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:57,620
I don't think we can register today.

460
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:00,579
Dingding, you promised me. You can't go back on your word now.

461
00:40:00,579 --> 00:40:03,679
Don't worry. Hear me out first.

462
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:07,079
I wish I could register at once.

463
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:08,740
But what about the thing after it?

464
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,860
What will you tell your mother?

465
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:13,040
How can I face her?

466
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,120
Will we never meet again?

467
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,279
Dingding, rest assured.

468
00:40:18,279 --> 00:40:19,980
Leave the rest to me.

469
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:22,479
I won't let you feel wronged again.

470
00:40:22,479 --> 00:40:23,919
That's not what I meant.

471
00:40:23,919 --> 00:40:26,459
I believe you.

472
00:40:26,459 --> 00:40:29,860
I don't want to affect the relationship between you and your mother.

473
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:33,519
Believe me. I can get her to accept me.

474
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:36,480
I want to get the blessing of my future mother-in-law.

475
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:43,280
What? You don't believe me?

476
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,959
I believe in you.

477
00:40:46,779 --> 00:40:50,860
Dingding, it's very kind of you.

478
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,300
Of course.

479
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:06,799
Recently, I went to the rest of the welfare houses on the list,

480
00:41:06,799 --> 00:41:08,559
but didn't find the boy.

481
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:10,220
It's okay.

482
00:41:11,739 --> 00:41:14,280
Your leg is almost recovered.

483
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,419
It's time to go back to your office.

484
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,899
Yes. I have to go back.

485
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,660
Then go back to your work.

486
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:26,180
Don't let this delay your work.

487
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:30,120
Do you know?

488
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:33,540
Going to the welfare centers these past few days,

489
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,819
it reminds me of the past.

490
00:41:36,859 --> 00:41:39,360
The teachers in the welfare centers were so nice to me,

491
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:43,759
but sometimes I felt lonely.

492
00:41:43,759 --> 00:41:47,340
I'm lucky because I met my adoptive parents.

493
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:51,680
They gave me a very happy home.

494
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,979
You've taken care of Luo Yuan for them.

495
00:41:56,979 --> 00:41:59,520
So she is very happy now.

496
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:06,619
But it's also because of me, Luo Yuan can't speak.

497
00:42:09,739 --> 00:42:12,440
People can't always live in the past.

498
00:42:13,339 --> 00:42:15,520
Yuan doesn't blame you.

499
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:21,220
But the scars of the past won't be made up for a lifetime.

500
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:25,679
You didn't mean to.

501
00:42:29,479 --> 00:42:32,620
I can't just forgive myself.

502
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,899
Xiong Fei also went to jail.

503
00:42:39,899 --> 00:42:42,840
And Luo Yuan didn't mind it.

504
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,640
Well, when did she know about the imprisonment?

505
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,860
Before they started their relationship, Xiong Fei told her first.

506
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:54,919
If Xiong Fei chose to hide it at first,

507
00:42:54,919 --> 00:42:59,179
I wouldn't have allowed them to start it, much less a marriage.

508
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:13,000
After all, confessing the past needs courage.

509
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,999
If they want to live together, honesty is the most basic thing

510
00:43:18,999 --> 00:43:21,980
and also the greatest respect for each other.

511
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,679
Eat some shrimp.

512
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:50,040

513
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:59,010
♫  At first, there was no sadness in the world  ♫

514
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:06,260
♫  Until luck came and crossed the stage  ♫

515
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:14,330
♫  At first, souls were confused and wandered  ♫

516
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:21,410
♫  Until people hugged each other  ♫

517
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:29,380
♫  I've been on the road  ♫

518
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:37,430
♫  Trying to connect laughter and tears  ♫

519
00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:44,480
♫  I suddenly have faith  ♫

520
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:51,880
♫  I can walk by millions of shining household lights  ♫

521
00:44:51,880 --> 00:45:00,710
♫  I hope I can admire flowers in the afterglow  ♫

522
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:06,960
♫  Shed tears and hope that you are well  ♫

523
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:15,730
♫  The good times I'm pursuing belong to the light  ♫

524
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:23,310
♫  It can light up the wounds that follow  ♫

525
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:27,130
♫  Catching the floating stars  ♫

526
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:30,860
♫  Watching as the memories flash by  ♫

527
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:34,530
♫  Traveling through market scenes  ♫

528
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:38,310
♫  With a fiery gaze  ♫

529
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:42,030
♫  I can't fly  ♫

530
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:45,830
♫  But I can look up  ♫

531
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:53,460
♫  I'm always on the road chasing the light  ♫
