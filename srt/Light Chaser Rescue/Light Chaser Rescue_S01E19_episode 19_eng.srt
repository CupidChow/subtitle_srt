00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,020

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,800
♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,100
♫  I put out mountain fires  ♫

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,600
♫  and catch the sunset  ♫

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,400
♫  I leave the rhythms of life in my wake  ♫

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:35,900
♫  Happiness whispers in my ears  ♫

7
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,400
♫  Chasing the passion for the future  ♫

8
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,500
♫  Like a dream maker  ♫

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,100
♫  Reading the universe and stars  ♫

10
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,600
♫  My existence in the river of time  ♫

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,600
♫  With the body temperature of a moment  ♫

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:02,200
♫  I'm trying to be the extension of light  ♫

13
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:08,900
♫  If the world grants me a frustrating opening  ♫

14
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:15,400
♫  I'll chase back time like a dark horse  ♫

15
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:22,200
♫  Even though I know the truth, I won't be afraid  ♫

16
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,300
♫  I won't miss the moon because of mediocrity  ♫

17
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,600
♫  I won't lose the light  ♫

18
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,000

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,200

20
00:01:43,796 --> 00:01:48,824
Is it your brother with Dr. Zhan?

21
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,300
 He knows I like to come here.

22
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:57,500
 So, I guess he's here waiting for me.

23
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,300
Luo Ben will be worried about you, as he doesn't know where you are.

24
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,800
Why don't you go back now?

25
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,200
 No.

26
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:15,500
 I told him I want to be alone.

27
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,800
To be honest, I support your studying abroad.

28
00:02:35,056 --> 00:02:37,960
You can't give up your dream just because of me.

29
00:02:39,246 --> 00:02:43,678
No matter how long you will stay abroad, I will wait for you.

30
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,400
 It's a hard decision for me to give it up.

31
00:02:52,236 --> 00:02:54,586
 Now, Ben insists on letting me go abroad.

32
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,100
 Next time, he will be against us being together.

33
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,800
 I can't accept his unreasonable arrangements.

34
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:08,000
 All in all, this time, I will never compromise and go abroad.

35
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,400
 Xiong Fei, please be on my side.

36
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Thanks for being with me.

37
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,200
Every day, I work on an operating table.

38
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,100
It's a good time to relax.

39
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,200
So I came with you to see the lake.

40
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,000
Thank you, Dr. Zhan.

41
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,600
Zhou Mingming, let's practice after work.

42
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,000
Leave me alone. I'm not in the mood.

43
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,400
What's wrong?

44
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,300
- Is it because of Ma? 
 - Don't mention him.

45
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,900
I shouldn't have saved him.

46
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,800
Well, you did nothing wrong to save him.

47
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,600
Can't you handle such a little setback?

48
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,000
He's not the only one.

49
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,200
It's worthless to me.

50
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,200
I thought you didn't care that much.

51
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,200
What's the point in caring about this kind of person?

52
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,400
Hello? Night Glory?

53
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,300
I'm coming.

54
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:45,800
While rescuing, we will meet different kinds of difficulties.

55
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,600
Every day we exercise hard,

56
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,700
acquire and improve various rescue skills proficiently.

57
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:58,600
It's for dealing with difficulties and finishing rescue tasks at the key moment.

58
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,600
But we can't solve some problems by technology solely.

59
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,900
Sometimes, people don't understand us or trust us.

60
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,100
Some people we rescue feel suspicious about us.

61
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:17,100
Some even blame or curse us.

62
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,800
Zhou Mingming's story is a case.

63
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,700
We need to face various stress.

64
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,800
We can't be with our family and keep a good balance with work.

65
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,800
But I say it for the record that what we do is to save people's lives.

66
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,000
We have no shame.

67
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,500
So, I beg all of you.

68
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,600
Please clear your mind and don't be distracted.

69
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,600
Help others, save lives, and make all efforts.

70
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,800
Whatever problems or issues you may encounter,

71
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,000
we will support you.

72
00:05:52,900 --> 00:06:00,200
Light Chaser Rescue Team will always stand by your side.

73
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,000
Well said!

74
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,900
Mr. Ming.

75
00:06:24,716 --> 00:06:27,176
Mr. Ming, you're late. You should drink more.

76
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,800
Well, enjoy.

77
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,900
Excuse me, Mr. Ming.

78
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,700
It's been days since we last met.

79
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,600
Don't go so fast!

80
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,000
- Mr. Ming, long time no see. 
 - Long time no see.

81
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,300
Long time no see.

82
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,300
Your business is growing.

83
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,000
Enjoy the party.

84
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,100
Then we'll go there first.

85
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,700
Nice to see you.

86
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,000
My big hero!

87
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,500
Here you are!

88
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,500
Why are you jeering?

89
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,600
Everyone, I've got something to say.

90
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,900
Yesterday, Mingming rescued someone from the river.

91
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,600
Amazing!

92
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,300
You don't care about Mingming.

93
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,400
It's been on the news.

94
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,200
Come on, I propose let's make a toast for our hero!

95
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,000
Come on!

96
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Wait.

97
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,700
Excuse me. I forgot.

98
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,700
It was a girl who saved someone from the river.

99
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,500
It wasn't Mingming.

100
00:07:31,746 --> 00:07:35,286
He was the one who punched that person.

101
00:07:35,286 --> 00:07:38,400
 Was he going to rescue people or kill them?

102
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,700
How funny!

103
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:44,400
That guy was asking for help, when Mr. Ming knocked him out.

104
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,700
You're so drunk.

105
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,600
Do you have any common sense?

106
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,800
I did it to save him.

107
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,000
Nonsense.

108
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,600
You were also rescued by that girl.

109
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,400
You are incompetent.

110
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,100
Don't take on tasks when you're not capable of dealing with them.

111
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,200
- Come on. Let's drink! 
 - Drink!

112
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,200
- Have a drink! 
 - Come on.

113
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,800
 - Mr. Ming. 
 - Mr. Ming.

114
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,500
 Are you leaving, Mr. Ming?

115
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,200
Why did you do that?

116
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,200
Are you his friends?

117
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,200
I was just kidding.

118
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,400
Where are you going?

119
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,900
Mom.

120
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:36,122
I know what happened in two days ago.

121
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:43,400
Since your childhood, it's my first time seeing you so into something.

122
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,500
My son, everyone has their advantages and abilities.

123
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,400
You're kind and love to help others.

124
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:01,500
But have you ever thought about whether you really have the ability to save people in person?

125
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,400
If not, and you insist on doing so,

126
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,400
would it be a waste of chances to live?

127
00:09:09,866 --> 00:09:15,434
Mom, I understand what you mean.

128
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,300
You...

129
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:30,400
CEO, I think Mingming is really devoted to rescuing.

130
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,100
He has also grown up a lot because of it.

131
00:09:35,716 --> 00:09:41,408
But his safety is the most important thing for me as his mother.

132
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,300
What's wrong?

133
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,600
I've made several calls to you. Why didn't you answer?

134
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,000
Why should I, your boss, report my private life to you?

135
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:25,100
I'm telling you. It's a big loss that you didn't come to the team.

136
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,600
I'll be there tomorrow.

137
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:36,956
Hung up on me.

138
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,200
Mingming, you're so early today.

139
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,000
Sister Jing.

140
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,000
I want to quit the team.

141
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,100
Zhou Mingming, I ask you to retrieve your decision to quit.

142
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,000
Why do you care?

143
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Aren't you just denying yourself because of what they said?

144
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,600
Do you know how Captain Qingshan supported you?

145
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,700
It's none of my business.

146
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,300
It's just one little setback.

147
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:20,500
Do you know how many times a great cartoonist will be rejected before he or she becomes famous?

148
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,500
How many times an athlete will be injured before he or she can win a prize?

149
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,800
Everyone's life is tough.

150
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,000
We're different. I'm not like them.

151
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,600
- Did you really make up your mind to quit? 
 - Yes.

152
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,200
- Do you dare to be the coward? 
 - Right.

153
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,600
Dingding.

154
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,300
You would have died!

155
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,100
I do care about myself, but I trust you.

156
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,200
See, you still ran and rescued me from the river.

157
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:31,190

158
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,200
Sister Jing, I'm sorry.

159
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,300
This morning, I got too impulsive.

160
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,600
Did you say anything?

161
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,100
I didn't hear it.

162
00:13:44,386 --> 00:13:45,496
Drink this.

163
00:13:45,496 --> 00:13:47,200
Thank you, Sister Jing.

164
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,500
You should thank me.

165
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,100
Perhaps you should treat me to a decent meal.

166
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,500
If I weren't there, you would have died.

167
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,300
Who should buy you a meal?

168
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,400
It's up to you. I don't care.

169
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,500
All right, I'll buy you dinner.

170
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:10,900
But you have to promise me that you'll never do such dangerous things again.

171
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,400
Do you understand?

172
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,500
I know.

173
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,400
- Drink before it gets cold. 
 - Thank you, Sister Jing.

174
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,300
- Be careful. 
 - Thanks.

175
00:14:38,316 --> 00:14:39,656
Wait!

176
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,300
What a coincidence.

177
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,400
You look wretched.

178
00:14:53,506 --> 00:14:55,834
Same goes for you.

179
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,500
What do you mean?

180
00:15:03,456 --> 00:15:07,636
I mean you look a bit tired.

181
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,700
Wait.

182
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,300
How did my feet suddenly cramp up?

183
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,600
Let me have a break.

184
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,700
Has Luo Yuan contacted you?

185
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,700
Luo Yuan?

186
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,100
Didn't she go abroad?

187
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,600
She's supposed to be in the UK already.

188
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,900
I'll call her later.

189
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,200
She didn't go abroad. She's hiding somewhere.

190
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,900
Hiding?

191
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,000
How bold Yuan is!

192
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,500
Where? Did you find her?

193
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,200
She didn't get in touch with you?

194
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,000
No.

195
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,000
I've recovered a bit. I'm going home.

196
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,400
He scared me!

197
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,200
 Yuan, come back home.

198
00:16:39,956 --> 00:16:43,700
 I will but not now.

199
00:16:50,746 --> 00:16:54,838
 Perhaps you need to think about why Luo Yuan wants to hide from you.

200
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,700
Hello? Have you met Luo Yuan?

201
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,200
 Let's meet tomorrow.

202
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,100
 Brother.

203
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,500
It's good to have a talk.

204
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,400
Yuan, it's my fault for forcing you to go abroad.

205
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,700
My attitude was bad.

206
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:58,400
But I still think you shouldn't give up your future just because of a man.

207
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,700
 I didn't.

208
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,700
 I will study abroad if there's a chance in the future.

209
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,300
But you do give it up now.

210
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,800
Do you understand how impulsive you are?

211
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,700
 It's all because you pushed me so hard.

212
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,300
I'll say something.

213
00:19:19,226 --> 00:19:22,254
We are in love.

214
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,600
Is it the reason you asked me out, to hear this news?

215
00:19:40,866 --> 00:19:47,358
Luo Yuan doesn't mind that I've gone to prison or that I'm a little vendor.

216
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:52,400
I feel grateful to her and appreciate our relationship.

217
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,200
You're Yuan's family.

218
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,100
I promise you I will treat her well.

219
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,300
I won't let her down.

220
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,600
If she wants to study abroad, I'll support her fully.

221
00:20:05,626 --> 00:20:09,562
Today, we're here hoping you could bless us.

222
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,600
Yuan.

223
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:23,800
When our parents passed away, I promised that I'd take good care of you.

224
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:29,900
I've spoiled you because I wanted you to live happily and freely.

225
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,100
I don't want you to be with someone and go selling together.

226
00:20:33,906 --> 00:20:35,782
 But I want.

227
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,400
You don't get it now.

228
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:44,700
But one day you'll realize what I've done is all for you.

229
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,600
Come back home with me.

230
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,600
 Since my childhood, I've obeyed every order from you.

231
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,800
 But I want to decide my relationship for myself.

232
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,000
 Don't push me.

233
00:20:59,756 --> 00:21:01,896
He isn't even able to take care of you.

234
00:21:01,896 --> 00:21:04,100
If you want to go abroad, how can he support you financially?

235
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,400
 I can work.

236
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,800
 I don't need anyone to take care of me.

237
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,100
Really?

238
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,300
Who made you live a carefree life?

239
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,700
 And who made me become what I am now?

240
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,000
 Brother, I'm sorry.

241
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,800
 I didn't mean to. I...

242
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,700
 Brother, it's my fault.

243
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,400
 I didn't mean to talk like that.

244
00:21:53,426 --> 00:21:55,182
It's my fault.

245
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,900
I'm not a good brother.

246
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,000
 No.

247
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,800
All right.

248
00:22:05,626 --> 00:22:08,314
I know you didn't mean to.

249
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,500
Let's go home.

250
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,100
Come on.

251
00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:00,270

252
00:23:00,276 --> 00:23:01,876
Dr. Zhan.

253
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,715
Why are you here?

254
00:23:08,836 --> 00:23:12,348
I want to learn about diving rescue from you.

255
00:23:14,146 --> 00:23:16,626
I've heard that you haven't been in a good mood recently.

256
00:23:16,626 --> 00:23:18,326
Now you look good.

257
00:23:19,276 --> 00:23:20,666
It's all over.

258
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:23,894
If I'm not competent, I'll just continue training.

259
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,736
Many people can do diving rescue.

260
00:23:27,736 --> 00:23:29,528
Why me?

261
00:23:31,146 --> 00:23:36,226
Well, I've heard you're at the top in professional diving rescue.

262
00:23:36,226 --> 00:23:40,042
As I'm going to learn it, I'll find the best coach to teach me.

263
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:45,266
But I have no plan to take students.

264
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:47,686
I have a plan.

265
00:23:47,686 --> 00:23:51,706
I want to build a top professional team specializing in diving rescue.

266
00:23:51,706 --> 00:23:54,216
We'll provide training for other rescuing teams.

267
00:23:54,216 --> 00:23:57,326
Once people need diving rescue, they'll think of us.

268
00:23:57,326 --> 00:24:00,026
Our team can be world-known.

269
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:02,706
How ambitious you are!

270
00:24:02,706 --> 00:24:07,358
Dr. Zhan, are you interested in developing our team in the future?

271
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,186
I'm only available on Sunday.

272
00:24:10,186 --> 00:24:11,924
No problem.

273
00:25:00,796 --> 00:25:03,000
 I had a fever when I was little.

274
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,636
 My brother gave me the wrong medicine

275
00:25:05,636 --> 00:25:08,186
 then I couldn't talk anymore.

276
00:25:08,186 --> 00:25:10,860
 But I never blamed him for it.

277
00:26:09,226 --> 00:26:12,358
You might strain your muscles with such intensive training.

278
00:26:17,386 --> 00:26:18,886
Thank you.

279
00:26:22,076 --> 00:26:25,726
You didn't answer my call. I guessed you were here.

280
00:26:25,726 --> 00:26:27,846
I know you're stressed.

281
00:26:27,846 --> 00:26:31,526
Being a doctor, I often get stressed out.

282
00:26:31,526 --> 00:26:34,416
Would you like to try my way to release stress?

283
00:26:37,866 --> 00:26:39,326
Boss, I'll take five lottery tickets.

284
00:26:39,326 --> 00:26:41,274
Okay, wait a second.

285
00:26:44,416 --> 00:26:46,146
Here you are.

286
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,496
- Thank you. 
 - No worries.

287
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,366
Is it your way to relieve stress?

288
00:26:54,366 --> 00:26:56,266
To buy lottery tickets?

289
00:26:57,556 --> 00:26:59,948
So you want to get rich overnight.

290
00:27:04,046 --> 00:27:05,646
I see.

291
00:27:06,466 --> 00:27:08,086
You're doing charity.

292
00:27:08,086 --> 00:27:10,366
Consider it as a donation if you don't win anything.

293
00:27:10,366 --> 00:27:12,746
Stop talking, okay?

294
00:27:30,906 --> 00:27:32,326
Have a try.

295
00:27:32,946 --> 00:27:34,346
No.

296
00:27:35,016 --> 00:27:36,766
What if you win some money?

297
00:27:36,766 --> 00:27:38,496
Greenhand has the best luck.

298
00:27:38,496 --> 00:27:41,856
But if I win the lottery but you don't, how embarrassed you will be.

299
00:27:43,426 --> 00:27:46,016
All right. Let me scratch.

300
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:48,206
Wait.

301
00:27:48,206 --> 00:27:52,554
♫  I'm always on the road chasing the light  ♫

302
00:27:52,554 --> 00:27:58,982
♫  Still, I light up the way for others  ♫

303
00:27:58,982 --> 00:28:02,276
♫  I think I'm a star  ♫

304
00:28:02,276 --> 00:28:03,976
Start.

305
00:28:07,036 --> 00:28:08,426
Use your strength.

306
00:28:08,426 --> 00:28:10,026
I know.

307
00:28:18,756 --> 00:28:20,056
How much?

308
00:28:20,056 --> 00:28:21,176
How much is it?

309
00:28:21,176 --> 00:28:22,876
Let me check.

310
00:28:23,356 --> 00:28:24,860
Nothing.

311
00:28:26,486 --> 00:28:28,578
How annoying you are!

312
00:28:29,596 --> 00:28:31,836
Do you like scratch-cards so much?

313
00:28:31,836 --> 00:28:35,418
If you won the lottery just now, wouldn't you be happy?

314
00:28:37,226 --> 00:28:38,794
Wait for me.

315
00:28:55,466 --> 00:29:00,386
♫  The world is getting brighter  ♫

316
00:29:00,386 --> 00:29:06,666
♫  Within glistening teardrops there is my love for you  ♫

317
00:29:06,666 --> 00:29:19,126
♫  Two free forms embrace the world  ♫

318
00:29:19,126 --> 00:29:20,276
How do you feel?

319
00:29:20,276 --> 00:29:22,292
Are you feeling better?

320
00:29:22,836 --> 00:29:24,236
Much better.

321
00:29:24,946 --> 00:29:26,946
Besides, we also won 20 yuan.

322
00:29:26,946 --> 00:29:30,786
Well, we shouldn't consider 100 yuan that we used to spend on it.

323
00:29:31,596 --> 00:29:34,376
So have you decided how to spend the money?

324
00:29:38,466 --> 00:29:39,866
Yes.

325
00:29:40,516 --> 00:29:42,016
Follow me.

326
00:29:57,466 --> 00:29:58,796
Why don't you eat?

327
00:29:58,796 --> 00:30:00,676
Is there anything else?

328
00:30:00,676 --> 00:30:02,416
Lamb's loin is their specialty.

329
00:30:02,416 --> 00:30:04,016
Have a try.

330
00:30:06,216 --> 00:30:09,276
I'm thinking all over about anatomy class.

331
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:25,956
How is it?

332
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:29,040
I think I'm hungry.

333
00:30:31,426 --> 00:30:33,234
No worries.

334
00:30:33,866 --> 00:30:36,394
Boss, we're ready to order.

335
00:30:46,146 --> 00:30:47,646
Is it good?

336
00:30:51,226 --> 00:30:53,266
But it went over our budget, right?

337
00:30:54,946 --> 00:30:56,706
Lamb's loin with beer.

338
00:30:56,706 --> 00:30:58,562
Tasty and addictive.

339
00:31:00,426 --> 00:31:02,570
How do you know about this place?

340
00:31:05,426 --> 00:31:10,476
This restaurant is where I invited Luo Yuan to eat barbecue for the first time.

341
00:31:11,466 --> 00:31:14,902
When we were still in school, we were poor.

342
00:31:14,902 --> 00:31:16,256
She wanted to eat barbecues.

343
00:31:16,256 --> 00:31:18,056
But we didn't have much money.

344
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:21,996
Then I worked part-time.

345
00:31:21,996 --> 00:31:27,300
After I received my wages, I brought her here and ate a great meal.

346
00:31:30,076 --> 00:31:35,176
At that time, I told her that when I got rich,

347
00:31:35,176 --> 00:31:38,056
she could eat as much as she wanted.

348
00:31:38,946 --> 00:31:40,646
You said it.

349
00:31:47,036 --> 00:31:49,196
I don't want her to endure hardship.

350
00:31:50,356 --> 00:31:52,628
You're a good brother.

351
00:31:52,628 --> 00:31:54,554
Luo Yuan will know it.

352
00:31:59,316 --> 00:32:01,196
What a great meal.

353
00:32:04,666 --> 00:32:08,134
If Luo Yuan insists on being with Xiong Fei, what will you do?

354
00:32:10,706 --> 00:32:12,306
Then I'm asking you.

355
00:32:12,306 --> 00:32:17,626
If Ding Dingding loves someone not reliable, will you bless them?

356
00:32:17,626 --> 00:32:18,976
She's not reliable enough.

357
00:32:18,976 --> 00:32:21,776
I do wish that kind of guy could control her.

358
00:32:23,866 --> 00:32:26,326
You all think I'm wrong.

359
00:32:27,276 --> 00:32:28,920
So let me ask you.

360
00:32:29,836 --> 00:32:34,186
Do you hate staying with people like me, like Yuan?

361
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:35,486
No.

362
00:32:36,076 --> 00:32:38,388
Then you do like being with me.

363
00:32:39,316 --> 00:32:40,708
Neither.

364
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:57,746
Hasn't your brother talked to you?

365
00:33:02,356 --> 00:33:04,672
He's unexpectedly childish.

366
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:12,226
Well, I think the reason he refuses to talk is to let you make a choice.

367
00:33:12,226 --> 00:33:16,576
Guess who is more important in your mind: your brother or your boyfriend?

368
00:33:23,186 --> 00:33:27,256
 I don't want to lose Xiong Fei or my brother.

369
00:33:27,256 --> 00:33:31,237
It's very hard. I think he made up his mind to break you two up.

370
00:33:35,316 --> 00:33:37,860
But don't worry, I'm on your side.

371
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:40,116
I wanted to teach your brother a lesson.

372
00:33:40,116 --> 00:33:42,426
But he's a lawyer! He's good at speaking.

373
00:33:42,426 --> 00:33:44,636
I can't win the rebuttal.

374
00:33:45,906 --> 00:33:48,222
I don't know who can defeat him.

375
00:33:56,516 --> 00:33:59,148
 You support me, right?

376
00:33:59,866 --> 00:34:02,916
But it's worthless. It's your brother's decision.

377
00:34:04,516 --> 00:34:06,740
You want me to persuade him?

378
00:34:07,906 --> 00:34:11,496
You know him well. He won't listen to anyone.

379
00:34:16,436 --> 00:34:19,508
 But you're different in his mind.

380
00:34:22,746 --> 00:34:24,770
Why do you love Xiong Fei?

381
00:34:25,956 --> 00:34:30,996
 Being with him, I feel really relaxed and happy.

382
00:34:30,996 --> 00:34:32,556
 I feel very secure, too.

383
00:34:32,556 --> 00:34:36,296
 His family has been nice to me since the first time we met.

384
00:34:36,296 --> 00:34:38,288
He's so lucky.

385
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,510

386
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:55,010

387
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:57,476
 - Hey! 
 - Takeaway, right?

388
00:34:58,266 --> 00:35:01,642
You chose this place on purpose, right?

389
00:35:05,456 --> 00:35:07,276
Did Luo Yuan meet you?

390
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:10,306
Why are you here, then?

391
00:35:11,396 --> 00:35:13,856
It's meaningless if you persuade me.

392
00:35:13,856 --> 00:35:16,636
I'm here to see what other tricks you have.

393
00:35:17,826 --> 00:35:19,426
All right.

394
00:35:19,426 --> 00:35:22,176
I hope later you'll be as confident as now.

395
00:35:22,176 --> 00:35:23,566
Yep.

396
00:35:26,226 --> 00:35:27,786
Hi, here you are.

397
00:35:27,786 --> 00:35:29,286
Thank you.

398
00:35:40,626 --> 00:35:42,290
 Let me take it.

399
00:35:43,876 --> 00:35:46,620
I've protected Luo Yuan so well.

400
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:50,402
That's why she only sees the beauty in life.

401
00:35:52,266 --> 00:35:54,590
She trusts people easily.

402
00:35:55,556 --> 00:35:57,996
Though I promised her to help,

403
00:35:57,996 --> 00:36:00,746
I didn't tell her I asked you to come here today.

404
00:36:00,746 --> 00:36:05,098
I want you to see what they look like without any disguise in daily life.

405
00:36:05,098 --> 00:36:08,824
For the rest, it's your judgment.

406
00:36:10,226 --> 00:36:12,026
 Mom.

407
00:36:12,026 --> 00:36:13,736
 Here is some green bean soup I made.

408
00:36:13,736 --> 00:36:15,636
 Nice, I'm going to get some bowls.

409
00:36:38,916 --> 00:36:41,996
- Son, I learned some basic sign language. 
 - Did you?

410
00:36:41,996 --> 00:36:44,592
You've worked hard.

411
00:36:49,186 --> 00:36:54,690
 Do you know when he was in primary school, he still wet the bed?

412
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:58,158
 He drank too much soup that night.

413
00:36:58,776 --> 00:37:00,768
 Have more, Yuan.

414
00:37:03,876 --> 00:37:06,246
 Yuan, I have a secret.

415
00:37:06,246 --> 00:37:08,046
 Do you want to know?

416
00:37:09,226 --> 00:37:11,606
 Check if Ben's wearing the shirt backward.

417
00:37:11,606 --> 00:37:14,354
 You're wearing your shirt backward!

418
00:37:16,706 --> 00:37:18,574
 Mom!

419
00:37:18,574 --> 00:37:21,722
 Do you have any secrets to share with me?

420
00:37:26,146 --> 00:37:28,016
 What did Yuan say?

421
00:37:28,016 --> 00:37:29,716
 It's the secret between us girls.

422
00:37:29,716 --> 00:37:32,364
 We won't tell you. Right, Yuan?

423
00:37:42,076 --> 00:37:46,504
Luo Yuan told me that Xiong Fei made her happy.

424
00:37:46,504 --> 00:37:48,560
Now I believe it.

425
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,266
Because some emotions can't be hidden.

426
00:37:55,116 --> 00:37:59,416
She has found love and family affection from Xiong Fei.

427
00:37:59,416 --> 00:38:03,440
As her brother, you can't replace those emotions.

428
00:38:09,786 --> 00:38:12,386
- Take your time, Mom. 
 - Goodbye.

429
00:38:12,386 --> 00:38:15,446
- Send me a message when you're home. 
 - All right, bye!

430
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:29,150
 Brother, I'm not going home.

431
00:38:31,036 --> 00:38:32,540
Xiong Fei,

432
00:38:33,396 --> 00:38:36,316
are you really prepared to be with Luo Yuan?

433
00:38:36,876 --> 00:38:38,306
I'm ready.

434
00:38:38,306 --> 00:38:39,814
For real?

435
00:38:44,226 --> 00:38:46,506
We're both in Light Chase Rescue Team.

436
00:38:47,076 --> 00:38:51,332
We know what we may sacrifice when rescuing.

437
00:38:52,076 --> 00:38:55,126
Don't worry. I can do what you can do.

438
00:38:55,126 --> 00:38:56,366
No.

439
00:38:57,476 --> 00:38:59,648
You have to do more than me.

440
00:39:01,706 --> 00:39:04,658
Luo Yuan isn't an ordinary girl.

441
00:39:04,658 --> 00:39:07,598
She's very simple and kind.

442
00:39:08,306 --> 00:39:10,526
She needs much more care from people.

443
00:39:11,666 --> 00:39:13,934
She also gets hurt easily.

444
00:39:14,706 --> 00:39:21,450
When you go to rescue, she might be in need more than anyone else.

445
00:39:24,746 --> 00:39:28,974
Tell me. How will you protect her?

446
00:39:30,186 --> 00:39:31,586
I...

447
00:39:39,436 --> 00:39:41,228
Xiong Fei,

448
00:39:41,228 --> 00:39:45,162
if you've decided to be with Luo Yuan for sure,

449
00:39:45,162 --> 00:39:47,550
then you have to accept my deal.

450
00:39:48,626 --> 00:39:50,026
Say it.

451
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:53,386
Quit the team.

452
00:40:12,556 --> 00:40:15,880
You know the team's meaning for Xiong Fei.

453
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,416
I do.

454
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,612
But he has to make the choice.

455
00:40:36,076 --> 00:40:37,780
 I'm sorry.

456
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:40,166
 It's difficult for you.

457
00:40:47,226 --> 00:40:49,046
I understand your brother.

458
00:40:50,596 --> 00:40:55,396
Give me some time and I'll deal with it.

459
00:41:14,866 --> 00:41:20,010

460
00:41:55,306 --> 00:41:57,336
 Kid! Kid...

461
00:41:58,956 --> 00:42:00,076
 Young man.

462
00:42:00,076 --> 00:42:02,076
 It's dangerous to go down like you.

463
00:42:02,076 --> 00:42:03,652
 Call 120 now.

464
00:42:04,336 --> 00:42:08,106
 People'll be unconscious if the brain is deprived of oxygen for 8 to 15 seconds.

465
00:42:08,106 --> 00:42:11,416
 Once over 6 to 10 minutes, they will be in a coma.

466
00:42:11,416 --> 00:42:14,916
 Some severe cases may be brain death.

467
00:42:19,786 --> 00:42:23,016
 Can you tell me which organization you're from?

468
00:42:23,016 --> 00:42:26,892
 We're a non-profit rescue team,

469
00:42:26,892 --> 00:42:29,118
 Light Chaser Rescue Team.

470
00:42:29,118 --> 00:42:31,276
 Are you looking for people to join?

471
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:33,796
 Do you want to join us?

472
00:42:33,796 --> 00:42:34,956
 Can I?

473
00:42:34,956 --> 00:42:36,560
 Why not?

474
00:42:37,746 --> 00:42:39,436
 But I've been in prison.

475
00:42:39,436 --> 00:42:41,036
 What?

476
00:42:43,226 --> 00:42:45,170
 I was in prison.

477
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:49,690

478
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:52,980

479
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:09,990

480
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:19,672
♫  At first, there was no sadness in the world  ♫

481
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:27,026
♫  Until luck came and crossed the stage  ♫

482
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:34,664
♫  At first, souls were confused and wandered  ♫

483
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:41,630
♫  Until people hugged each other  ♫

484
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:49,734
♫  I've been on the road  ♫

485
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:57,450
♫  Trying to connect laughter and tears  ♫

486
00:43:57,450 --> 00:44:04,914
♫  I suddenly have faith  ♫

487
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:12,230
♫  I can walk by millions of shining household lights  ♫

488
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:20,950
♫  I hope I can admire flowers in the afterglow  ♫

489
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:27,280
♫  Shed tears and hope that you are well  ♫

490
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:35,880
♫  The good times I'm pursuing belong to the light  ♫

491
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:43,380
♫  It can light up the wounds that follow  ♫

492
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:47,204
♫  Catching the floating stars  ♫

493
00:44:47,204 --> 00:44:51,136
♫  Watching as the memories flash by  ♫

494
00:44:51,136 --> 00:44:54,734
♫  Traveling through market scenes  ♫

495
00:44:54,734 --> 00:44:58,520
♫  With a fiery gaze  ♫

496
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:02,230
♫  I can't fly  ♫

497
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:05,984
♫  But I can look up  ♫

498
00:45:05,984 --> 00:45:13,610
♫  I'm always on the road chasing the light  ♫
