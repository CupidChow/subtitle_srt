00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,210
All right, that's a relief.

176
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,640
I asked you to take some rest,

177
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:12,760
but you came back to do surgery again.

178
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,800
I'm going back to Linjiang soon.

179
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,570
I'll try my best to save
as many people as I can.

180
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,130
There are also television journalists

181
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,330
coming with us this time

182
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,570
who want to do an interview

183
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:23,450
with our medical team.

184
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,040
The director asked us to be cooperative.

185
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,450
I don't have the time.

186
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,640
There are two patients
who have postoperative reactions.

187
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:31,970
I'm going to attend to them later.

188
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,370
You know

189
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,490
I don't like

190
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,610
such occasions.

191
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:37,730
Okay.

192
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,250
I'll try to turn it down for you.

193
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,400
Thanks.

194
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,850
It's such a small child.

195
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,490
(Supplies)

196
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:45,490
What's your name?

197
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,160
- Okay.
- It's not enough.

198
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,090
Tent 3, right?

199
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:53,680
Yes.

200
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:54,250
Okay.

201
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,400
What's your name?

202
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:14,450
Sister.

203
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,330
Here are some instant noodles for you.

204
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,680
They're still warm,

205
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,400
but they have been soaked
in water for too long

206
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:22,970
and gotten soft.

207
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:23,800
Go ahead and eat.

208
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:26,280
Sister, you don't know

209
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:27,730
how hard it is to wait in line

210
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:28,640
to get some hot water.

211
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,490
When it was finally my turn,

212
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,450
there was no water left.

213
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:32,370
I had to start all over again.

214
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,880
It was too hard.

215
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:36,680
Have you eaten?

216
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,250
I ate while I was waiting for you.

217
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,400
Hot water didn't come easily.

218
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,450
Eat all the soup.

219
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,330
Thank you.

220
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,370
Don't just thank me. Start eating.

221
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,610
Zhan Yan, I remember I got into trouble

222
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,000
when I was a kid

223
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,850
and my mom wouldn't let me eat,

224
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,610
you just brought me food secretly.

225
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:54,610
Do you still remember it?

226
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,160
It was a bucket of instant noodles.

227
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,330
We ate it in turn,

228
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:58,970
and we really enjoyed it.

229
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:05,920
Be careful.

230
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,920
Slowly.

231
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,680
This way.

232
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,880
Be careful.

233
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,250
Put your feet on it.

234
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:25,000
Miss Luo.

235
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,730
How are you feeling now?

236
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:40,520
Knowing you're fine

237
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,370
with the kids,

238
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:46,160
the dean left rest assured.

239
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:20,280
Have some rest.

240
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:21,400
I'm gonna go.

241
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,250
Luo Ben.

242
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,610
You haven't apologized to him yet.

243
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,610
Take the medicine first.

244
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,330
He saved me.

245
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:04,970
I know

246
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,680
that he saved you.

247
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:09,490
Okay.

248
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,370
I'll go and apologize to him right now,

249
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,250
all right?

250
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:16,800
Have some rest.

251
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:18,970
Remember to take the medicine

252
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:20,570
I'll put it right here.

253
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:41,970
Xiong Fei.

254
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,450
What's the matter?

255
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,640
You saved my sister this time.

256
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,040
I'll remember

257
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,210
your favor.

258
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,040
We save people

259
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,330
not asking for anything in return.

260
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,490
Thank you.

261
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:56,880
Don't worry.

262
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,160
I'll

263
00:14:58,610 --> 00:14:59,730
return this favor,

264
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,760
but

265
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:03,280
I don't want you to get too close

266
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,160
with Luo Yuan.

267
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,570
You're thinking too much about it.

268
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,490
I'm not.

269
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,370
Maybe you're not, either.

270
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,210
But I don't want Luo Yuan
to think too much about it.

271
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,400
She is a simple girl.

272
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,450
I don't want her

273
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,250
to be influenced
by the things around her.

274
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:25,280
Don't worry.

275
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,680
I'm just a stranger

276
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,000
to Miss Luo,

277
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,760
and we won't meet again.

278
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,280
Good.

279
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,520
Well,

280
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:37,800
if you need

281
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,760
and advice or help

282
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,370
with legal matters,

283
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:41,730
you can come to me.

284
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,940
Come in with me.

285
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,700
Miss Luo.

286
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,580
How are you feeling?

287
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,700
Are you feeling better?

288
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,060
Dr. Cai.

289
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,660
Can you tell us

290
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,100
about Miss Luo?

291
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,340
Miss Luo.

292
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,740
They are reporters

293
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:17,660
from Linjiang.

294
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,540
What are you doing here?

295
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,340
Please leave.

296
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:22,980
Well,

297
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,700
I'm a doctor

298
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,180
from Linjiang Hospital,

299
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:26,940
Cai Yuxiao.

300
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,580
They are reporters from Linjiang

301
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,420
who would like to interview your sister.

302
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,820
Interview?

303
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,700
We don't need an interview here.

304
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,180
What my sister needs is rest.

305
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,460
Please leave.

306
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:38,820
Don't get us wrong.

307
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,420
They just want to

308
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,060
bring back some good news

309
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,340
to the viewers concerned about
the earthquake in Fengxi.

310
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,460
Good news?

311
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,460
Stop filming.

312
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,580
Put down the camera.

313
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,820
The citizens of Fengxi

314
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,820
are either sick, wounded,

315
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,700
or dead.

316
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,100
As a doctor,

317
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,060
you're not treating patients,

318
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,460
instead, you're here making interviews

319
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,300
and showing off you.

320
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,580
What good news can there be?

321
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,060
Just leave.

322
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:03,940
In this case,

323
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:04,580
I will

324
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,220
show you around outside.

325
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:05,820
Okay.

326
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:06,820
Sorry about that.

327
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,060
Let's go.

328
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,700
Are you all right, Yuan?

329
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:20,980
Don't mind them.

330
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,500
Medical assistance after the earthquake

331
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,380
is urgent.

332
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,220
We can see

333
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:25,940
that there are

334
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,460
many simple operating tables here.

335
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,220
Dr. Cai.

336
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,500
How many operations like this

337
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,980
do you need to do in one day?

338
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,660
I've never counted them.

339
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,380
As long as there are patients
who need surgery,

340
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,220
we'll do it.

341
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,140
(Linjiang Hospital Rushed to the Rescue)
Thank you very much, Dr. Cai.

342
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,940
You've been working really hard

343
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:39,660
to save

344
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,700
all these lives.

345
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,700
What kind of belief

346
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,700
is supporting you?

347
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,860
It's our job

348
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,540
to treat patients as doctors.

349
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,660
Dr. Cai looks really good

350
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,940
on TV.

351
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,460
He's a good-looking guy.

352
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,460
He just acted

353
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,180
the way he usually does

354
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,420
and made the hospital look good.

355
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,700
That's so Dr. Cai.

356
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,460
When I heard him
saying in a trembling voice,

357
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:02,620
“Let me save one more”,

358
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,220
I was about to burst into tears.

359
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,180
The First Medical Team

360
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,620
did the job well.

361
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,980
Well done, guys.

362
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,860
Now that the Second Medical Team
has arrived,

363
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,220
we need attending doctors

364
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,860
in the hospital.

365
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:19,980
Zhan Yan.

366
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,660
You should come back
with critically ill patients

367
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,660
who need to be transferred.

368
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,180
Yes.

369
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,140
Now we're at

370
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,020
the temporary processing site.

371
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,300
Lele.

372
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,700
I'm going

373
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,940
to leave soon.

374
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,300
There will be other doctors

375
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,740
to take care of you.

376
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,740
Okay?

377
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,420
Lele.

378
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,380
I'll come to see you

379
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,180
when I have time.

380
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:25,700
Good boy.

381
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,380
Watch your steps.

382
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,500
Don't fall on your face.

383
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:47,540
What?

384
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,020
Let me do it.

385
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:48,940
Be careful. Slowly.

386
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,500
What?

387
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,220
He might want to say something.

388
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,220
He's dying.

389
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,220
Buddy.

390
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,220
Don't sleep.

391
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,940
Hang in there. Don't fall asleep.

392
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:06,980
Adrenaline.

393
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:07,620
Okay.

394
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,380
Hang in there, buddy.

395
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:13,700
Hang in there.

396
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,220
Please.

397
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,020
Please

398
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,380
save them.

399
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,740
Save...

400
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,900
Save...

401
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,620
Who?

402
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,140
Save...

403
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:30,780
Who?

404
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,260
Buddy!

405
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,020
Buddy!

406
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,700
The call leads us to believe

407
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,660
that the deceased's wife

408
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,180
is trapped in a place called

409
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,220
Cliff Guo.

410
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,660
She's probably

411
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,700
not the only one trapped there.

412
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,460
The communication team

413
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,460
is trying to locate her

414
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,460
based on cell signals.

415
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,140
We sent her a message

416
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:09,740
an hour ago,

417
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,860
but she hasn't replied.

418
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,500
Maybe her phone died.

419
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,460
There is also a chance that...

420
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,700
In that case,

421
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,180
we have to get there sooner

422
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,660
and see what's going on there.

423
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,460
Captain!

424
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:22,900
We've found Cliff Guo!

425
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,420
Good.

426
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,620
Where is it?

427
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:26,780
In Daxiang Village, Lulong County,

428
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,140
ten kilometers away from Fengxi.

429
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,460
Right here.

430
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,940
But images from the satellite

431
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:31,940
show no sign

432
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,700
of houses.

433
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,700
How is the road condition there?

434
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,860
They're making an urgent repair.

435
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,660
If we leave now,
I think we can get there

436
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,020
in the wee hours at the earliest.

437
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,460
We don't know

438
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,220
the situation there.

439
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,980
I suggest we leave as early as possible.

440
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:45,660
Then we'll have to

441
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,940
take the mountain road.

442
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,300
Yes.

443
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,100
After reaching the top of the cliff,

444
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:48,860
we'll rappel down.

445
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,420
This is the fastest way to go.

446
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,300
There can't be too many people.

447
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,700
Xiong Fei, Dapeng.

448
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,900
Get prepared

449
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:54,700
to go with me.

450
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,540
- Yes.
- Got it.

451
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,740
Keep your feet steady, guys.

452
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,420
Be careful, Captain.

453
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,220
Watch your steps.

454
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:34,940
Captain.

455
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,180
Captain.

456
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,300
Look.

457
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,740
Get ready to rappel down.

458
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:44,780
Okay.

459
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,700
Yes.

460
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,220
Let's go.

461
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,180
Watch the rolling stones.

462
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,780
Put on your goggles.

463
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,260
Safety first.

464
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,300
Let's go.

465
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,620
Dapeng, Xiong Fei.

466
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,540
Scour separately.

467
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,140
Okay.

468
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,220
I'll go in the back.

469
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,220
Okay.

470
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,300
Captain!

471
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,220
Miss.

472
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,980
Can you hear me?

473
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:23,860
Come on.

474
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,700
Tell me where you got hurt.

475
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,420
Save me.

476
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,660
Save my baby.

477
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,460
She's pregnant.

478
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,140
- Pregnant?
- Miss, get up first.

479
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:42,700
Sister.

480
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,300
I drew this for you.

481
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,420
Thank you, honey.

482
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,700
You must be a good girl.

483
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,260
Thank you.

484
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,140
Thank you.

485
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,620
Slowly.

486
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,700
Take good care of her.

487
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,660
Wait, wait.

488
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,380
There is no seat left.

489
00:24:59,380 --> 00:24:59,900
Let me squeeze in there.

490
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,980
I have to go back.
I have something urgent.

491
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,460
It's not safe to overload the bus.

492
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,460
Just wait for the next one.

493
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,780
Attention, everyone.

494
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,180
Attention, everyone.

495
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,460
The target is Cliff Guo.

496
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,860
We found a pregnant woman here

497
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,220
who is about to give birth.

498
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,780
Obstetricians are urgently needed.

499
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,540
I need to know which doctor
is available on the team.

500
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,220
This is Flying Fish. Roger.

501
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,540
I'm in the base.

502
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,220
All doctors on the team

503
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,100
have other tasks.

504
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:18,700
All doctors on the team

505
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,620
have other tasks.

506
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,500
I can go.

507
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,140
You are...

508
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,940
I'm Zhan Yan, a surgeon

509
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,420
from Linjiang Central Hospital.

510
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,220
I minored in obstetrics in college

511
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,460
and have experience in midwifery.

512
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,540
That's great.

513
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,940
I'll check in with the captain right now.

514
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,380
Captain, this is Flying Fish.

515
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,260
You should take my seat and go back.

516
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,020
What about you?

517
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,220
I have a task.

518
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,300
Zhan Yan, stay safe.

519
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,100
How is it?

520
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,020
Dr. Zhan.

521
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,140
You might not be able
to go to Cliff Guo.

522
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:48,700
Why?

523
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,220
Our captain doesn't agree.

524
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,460
Captain Qingshan, this is Zhan Yan.

525
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,100
You need an obstetrician in Cliff Guo.

526
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,540
Why don't you let me go?

527
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,180
I understand how you feel.

528
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,180
You're a doctor,

529
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,780
but you don't have

530
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,220
professional outdoor skills.

531
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,940
The terrain of Cliff Guo is complicated.

532
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,940
It will be dangerous

533
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:08,740
for you to come.

534
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,500
Isn't it dangerous for other doctors?

535
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,420
Fine.

536
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,460
May I ask you

537
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,420
if you know how to rappel down?

538
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,020
No, right?

539
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,780
After arriving at Cliff Guo,

540
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,140
you have to rappel down the cliff.

541
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,740
That's why I asked for

542
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,860
the doctors on our team

543
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:22,980
to carry out this mission.

544
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,540
Do you understand now?

545
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,860
Though I don't know how to rappel down,

546
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:30,620
your team members

547
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,380
can help me.

548
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,220
Dr. Zhan.

549
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,940
We have no time right now

550
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,460
to teach a novice

551
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,540
how to rappel down.

552
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,220
Besides, we can't take the risk!

553
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,940
That's ridiculous.

554
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,780
Thank you, Dr. Zhan.

555
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,700
I'll try to contact other members.

556
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,220
I'm a member of

557
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,260
the International Medical Rescue Team.

558
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,140
For the safety of the puerpera at Cliff Guo,

559
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,300
take me there right now.

560
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,260
I got hurt because of you.

561
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,700
You shouldn't let me stand, should you?

562
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,380
If you can't stand,
just wait for the next bus.

563
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,140
My sister left the seat for me.

564
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,140
Your sister chose to stay here
to save more lives,

565
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,460
but you chose to run away
when you're totally fine.

566
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,220
You two are sisters.

567
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,020
Why are you not like her

568
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:11,740
at all?

569
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,140
Well...

570
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:15,900
I'll kick you out

571
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,940
if you scream again.

572
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,940
It's fine. Stop looking at us.

573
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,220
Sir, we can leave now.

574
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,460
Weren't you a doctor before?

575
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,980
But I was not an obstetrician.

576
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,420
I can help her,

577
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,860
but I'm worried about
special clinical circumstances.

578
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,620
Can we get her out of here?

579
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,500
No.

580
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,700
Her water broke.

581
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,700
That would be too much for her.

582
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,220
Can we use the car?

583
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,740
No, it doesn't work.

584
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:43,220
Save my baby.

585
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,940
I wish there was a helicopter.

586
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,940
What's the use to say that?

587
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,700
I'll make a call.

588
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,740
Hang in there.

589
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:57,900
Director Liu.

590
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,460
I'm Qingshan.

591
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,940
We're at Cliff Guo.

592
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:03,700
What?

593
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,380
That's great.

594
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,500
Got it.

595
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,420
Got it.

596
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:15,980
Flying Fish.

597
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,940
I just got the news

598
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,740
that the road to Cliff Guo is clear.

599
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,180
Find a car

600
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:21,940
to bring Zhan Yan here right now.

601
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:22,700
A car?

602
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,220
Where am I gonna find a car?

603
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,260
Let's go.

604
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,700
The road to Cliff Guo is clear.

605
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,460
You don't have to rappel down.

606
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,260
Captain asked me to find a car

607
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,100
to take you there.

608
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,540
Where am I gonna find a car?

609
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:39,940
Dr. Zhan.

610
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:40,900
Get on it.

611
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,900
Hold on to me.

612
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,140
Dr. Zhan.

613
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:01,540
This is the second time

614
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,780
that I give you a ride.

615
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,140
Do you think I want this?

616
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:05,860
Is this

617
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,260
how you talk to people?

618
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,100
It depends.

619
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,220
Can't you stop

620
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,620
holding on to your preconception?

621
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,540
Hold on to what?

622
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,900
Preconception.

623
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,180
What?

624
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:16,740
Me.

625
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,380
Eyes on the road!

626
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,020
It's ready, captain.

627
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:31,980
It's ready. Come on.

628
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,220
Let's get her over there.

629
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:33,780
Slowly.

630
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,180
Come on.

631
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,380
Three.

632
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:36,940
Go.

633
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:39,780
Come on.

634
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:46,900
Okay.

635
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:47,980
Slowly.

636
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,940
Is there another way?

637
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:00,860
Yes.

638
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,380
We can go on foot first

639
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,780
and rappel down

640
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:05,940
like Captain Qingshan.

641
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,660
Are you kidding me?

642
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,860
Can the patient wait?

643
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:11,700
Dr. Zhan.

644
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,260
Have you ever played desert saferi?

645
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,780
Yeah. What?

646
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,100
Hold on to me.

00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,180
Just hold on a little longer.

651

Dapeng.

652
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:51,460
Coming.

653
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,540
Dapeng, stay with her.

654
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,660
The doctor has arrived.

655
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,220

How do you make preliminary judgments

662
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,980
about patients in different conditions?

663
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,100
It's important to note

664
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,020
that just because
someone is moaning loudly

665
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:46,740
doesn't mean

666
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,460
he is critically ill.

667
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,100
Dr. Cai is also handsome today.

668
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,740
There are citizens sending flowers
and journalists making interviews.

669
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,620
All the outpatients are making
an appointment with him.

670
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,860
He's about to become a famous doctor.

671
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,740
Don't ever think about dating him.

672
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,700
When the earth trembled

673
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,700
and disaster struck,

674
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,380
you saved lives

675
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,300
and brought hope.

676
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,700
Salute to Cai Yuxiao,
the warrior in white.

677
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,940
Hello, Dr. Cai.

678
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,220
I'm a reporter from Linjiang Daily.

679
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,380
I would like to interview you

680
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,460
on the medical relief

681
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,220
this time.

682
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:15,940
That's not necessary.

683
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,260
As doctors, our job

684
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,940
is to save lives.

685
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:19,660
Therefore,

686
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,180
you can pay more attention

687
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,260
to the disaster area.

688
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:27,700
Zhan Yan.

689
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,860
You've been to the disaster area
the longest

690
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,140
and treated the most victims,

691
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,620
but he is the one

692
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,420
to be interviewed.

693
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,300
I don't care

694
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,620
who is being interviewed.

695
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,100
I don't want it anyway,

696
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,220
and I can't handle it.

697
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,740
You have to learn to handle it.

698
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,620
You're not representing

699
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,660
yourself this time,

700
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,660
but the First Medical Team

701
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,940
who rushed to the rescue.

702
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:46,980
What do you mean?

703
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,100
Don't you know it?

704
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,220
The hospital will select

705
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,140
an outstanding team.

706
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,300
If you don't strive for it,

707
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,220
and it keeps going like this,

708
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:52,620
Cai Yuxiao and the Second Medical Team

709
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,780
will be selected.

710
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,140
(After the earthquake in Fengxi,)

711
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,100
(leaders at all levels,)

712
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,460
(major enterprises,)

713
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,420
(institutions,)

714
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,500
(and the people of all localities
have taken actions)

715
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,900
(to give the greatest attention
and support)

716
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:11,700
(to the disaster areas)

717
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,220
(through various means.)

718
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,180
(Today, our reporter connected)

719
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,220
(the chairman)

720
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,260
(of the Midas Touch Media,)

721
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,460
(Mr. Ma Baoming.)

722
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,220
(Mr. Ma said)

723
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,220
(that when he learned of
the earthquake in Fengxi,)

724
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,100
(he immediately sent
the most urgently needed supplies,)

725
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,220
(which are 2,000 boxes of water)

726
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,420
(and 1,000 boxes of instant noodles)

727
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,660
(to the disaster area)

728
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,780
(to express his sincere greetings)

729
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,940
(to the affected people.)

730
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,980
(Just because)

731
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,220
(there are so many people like Mr. Ma)

732
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,020
(who did...)

733
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,820
(Ma Baoming)

734
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:46,860
Mr. Ma.

735
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,540
I just heard

736
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,180
the news of your donation
to the disaster area.

737
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,780
I'm calling to pay respects.

738
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:53,940
In the end,

739
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,500
I should thank you, Attorney Luo.

740
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,900
Thanks for dealing with Ding Dinging.

741
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,660
Our company immediately

742
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,980
sold the film rights

743
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,220
and got financing.

744
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,020
You only spent some money

745
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,700
on water and instant noodles,

746
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,100
but got the best publicity.

747
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,100
That's your style, Mr. Ma.

748
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,180
Well...

749
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:14,860
By the way, Mr. Ma,

750
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,660
I have a new idea

751
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:17,700
with the case of Ding Dingding

752
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,100
and I like to discuss it with you.

753
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,420
Hello, Weiwei.

754
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:34,900
Dingding.

755
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:35,820
How's the drawing going?

756
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,980
I'm working on it.

757
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,300
You'd better hurry up.

758
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,340
Don't miss the deadline.

759
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:41,540
I chose to work with you

760
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,540
because you're fast.

761
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,220
Don't worry.

762
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,260
I'll finish it on time.

763
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,700
By the way, Weiwei,

764
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,660
the deposit.

765
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:51,500
Well...

766
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,700
I'll transfer it to you soon.

767
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,340
How soon?

768
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,100
Hello?

769
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:56,900
Hello?

770
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,700
What kind of person is that?

771
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,540
He rushed me actively

772
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,020
but hung up on me when it came to money.

773
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,660
(Receive 100,000 yuan
From Midas Touch Comics)

774
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,380
Holy cow.

775
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,140
That's fast.

776
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:18,980
Wait,

777
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,780
I shouldn't get paid a hundred grand.

778
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:27,060
(Ma Baoming)

779
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:30,900
Mr. Ma.

780
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,660
Ding Dingding.

781
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:33,980
Looks like you haven't

782
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,180
blocked my number.

783
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:36,860
How come?

784
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,860
I know you.

785
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,700
Although you're saying this,

786
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,500
maybe you've been cursing me
behind my back.

787
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,900
I transferred a hundred grand to you.

788
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,820
Have you received it?

789
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,580
The money...

790
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,740
Take it

791
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,860
and call my names less often.

792
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,380
Mr. Ma.

793
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,020
You must make it clear,

794
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,340
or I wouldn't dare take the money

795
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,140
in case this is another trap you set

796
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,580
to get me sued.

797
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,700
I can't afford that.

798
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,860
Rest assured.

799
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:06,780
My attorney

800
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,980
advised me to give you the money.

801
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,220
You little girl

802
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:11,700
can be impulsive

803
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,660
sometimes,

804
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,420
but you do

805
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,660
have potential.

806
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,380
We might

807
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:17,740
have a chance

808
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,700
to work together again.

809
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:21,220
We should leave the chance open,

810
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:21,860
right?

811
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,180
It was advised by your attorney?

812
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,820
Hold on, Mr. Ma.

813
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:27,380
Well,

814
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,700
please repeat what you just said

815
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,860
and let me record it as evidence.

816
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:33,420
Well...

817
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:40,860
Zhan Yan.

818
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,740
What are you doing here?

819
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,540
My dad made wontons in chicken soup.

820
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,740
He asked you to come home
for dinner on weekends.

821
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,260
I have to work overtime on weekends.

822
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:49,700
Tell auntie

823
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,660
and uncle thanks for me.

824
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,820
You said you had things to do last time.

825
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:53,620
If you don't come this time,

826
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,140
my mom will blame it on me.

827
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,660
Fine. When do you have time?

828
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,700
Maybe when I'm not this busy.

829
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,380
By the way,

830
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,020
please give these

831
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,700
to the E.R. doctors for me.

832
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:12,020
I caused them trouble

833
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:12,980
when I wanted to jump off

834
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,980
the building last time.

835
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,420
Are you feeling guilty?

836
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,060
You've become introspective.

837
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,380
Stop it.

838
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,340
I was desperate

839
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,500
at that time.

840
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,140
Unexpectedly,

841
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,100
that unscrupulous publisher

842
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,260
regained his conscience

843
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,820
and said something about sharing

844
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:31,700
the copyright of the film with me.

845
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,020
It's a hundred grand.

846
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,780
There is no such thing as a free dinner.

847
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:35,660
Are you sure

848
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,260
it's not a trap?

849
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:39,660
I don't think so.

850
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,140
He said his attorney advised it.

851
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:41,980
I've recorded it.

852
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:43,820
Luo Ben.

853
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,220
It's him.

854
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,500
I think he should

855
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,820
help me.

856
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,100
When his sister had surgery,

857
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,180
I mobilized everyone

858
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,420
to donate blood for his sister.

859
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,140
Anyway,

860
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,820
we're even this time.

861
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,660
Thank you.

862
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,740
Come back for dinner when you have time.

863
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:28,490
Yuan.

864
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:32,980
Is he okay?

865
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,340
Honey.

866
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,620
Sorry, he's sleeping too soundly

867
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:36,220
and having a nightmare.

868
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,980
Honey, why did you kick me?

869
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:38,980
I bought you some bread.

870
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,020
You fell off by yourself.

871
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,260
I didn't.

872
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,540
You must have kicked me.

873
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,260
I didn't.

874
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,700
Are you happy?

875
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,380
I didn't kick you.

876
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,180
You fell off by yourself.

877
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:48,980
Don't you know

878
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:49,700
I have a protruding disc in my waist?

879
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,020
Don't hit me. I'm telling you.

880
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,060
- Why are you being so mean?
- You can't be like this.

881
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,700
Are you happy because of the bread

882
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,020
or because of me?

883
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,180
Of course

884
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,220
it's you.

885
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:00,540
Go ahead and eat.

886
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,220
I just snored. Do you have to do this?

887
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,220
Every man snores.

888
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,140
Yuan.

889
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,380
Have they always been like this?

890
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:10,140
Look at

891
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,300
this disc in my waist.

892
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,700
All right, I get it.

893
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,580
It hurts more than ever.

894
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,700
Do they bother you?

895
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,020
- Are they too noisy?
- Keep your voice down.

896
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,180
I've tried to be quiet.

897
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:17,700
It's not that loud.

898
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,420
Luo Yuan.

899
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,580
I'm here to check
the recovery of your wound.

900
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,220
Do they care how I feel?

901
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,140
You snore too loudly.

902
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:23,860
Do you know it?

903
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:24,860
Is snoring

904
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,380
something I can control?

905
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,020
You know what,

906
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,580
you can find a doctor to treat me,

907
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,700
or just make me stop breathing.

908
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:33,700
I'm not gonna argue with you.

909
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:34,380
You can always justify yourself.

910
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,980
- I can't help it, can I?
- Come on.

911
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:37,740
Dr. Zhan.

912
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,340
Yuan is recovering well.

913
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:45,500
Thank you.

914
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,420
It's what I should do.

915
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,300
You don't need to thank me.

916
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,220
But Ding Dingding said

917
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,500
you helped her get the compensation.

918
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,100
It's not like I paid for it.

919
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,660
The rose's in her hand,

920
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,420
the flavor in mine.

921
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,580
Looks like there are a lot of things

922
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,980
an attorney can do.

923
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,580
It depends on

924
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:06,180
how cooperative that person is.

925
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,220
Dr. Zhan.

926
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,580
Dr. Zhan.

927
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,860
There's one more favor

928
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,100
I'd like to ask you.

929
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,140
What is it?

930
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:19,700
Luo Yuan needs rest.

931
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,260
You also saw

932
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,860
how noisy those two patients are

933
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,420
in the next bed.

934
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,340
They've affected

935
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,340
Luo Yuan's rest,

936
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,300
so I hope

937
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,580
you can move her

938
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,700
to a single room.

939
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,220
The single rooms are all occupied.

940
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,620
Do something about it.

941
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,340
The single rooms are occupied.

942
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,420
What can I do?

943
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,540
You're a doctor. There must be

944
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,620
something you can do.

945
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,020
Are you saying

946
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,820
we have available wards

947
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,340
but we won't let you use it

948
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,740
unless you

949
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,260
bribe the doctors?

950
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,620
What do you take this hospital for?

951
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,780
What do you take us for?

952
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,380
I just want to move her
to a different ward.

953
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,220
You don't have to take the high ground.

954
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,780
I'm not taking the high ground.

955
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,860
I'm just talking about the truth.

956
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:25,860
Well,

957
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:28,100
I thought your sister would come.

958
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,740
I made all these dishes

959
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,780
so that she can have
something nutritious,

960
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,540
but she doesn't come.

961
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,700
I'm your daughter, okay?

962
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:37,700
You just can't stop talking about her.

963
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,020
Yan has been a good girl
since childhood.

964
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,060
When has she ever
made us worry about her

965
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,820
no matter when it came
to school or work?

966
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,100
She is not like you.

967
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,180
Yes, I know.

968
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,700
You two are college teachers,

969
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,300
intellectuals.

970
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,500
But you failed
to make your only daughter

971
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,500
a high achiever.

972
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,140
I understand it.

973
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,260
Just wait and see.

974
00:41:59,260 --> 00:41:59,860
You know what,

975
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,740
the high achievers end up leaving home.

976
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:02,660
I'm the angel

977
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:05,060
sent to stay with you

978
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,540
for the rest of your lives.

979
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:07,140
Mom.

980
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,340
When is our little angel

981
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,820
gonna grow wings

982
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,020
and fly out of this house?

983
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,580
I'm not leaving.

984
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,060
Dad, I haven't had enough of

985
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,260
the wontons you make.

986
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:19,540
Here.

987
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,060
Yan didn't make it back today.

988
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,220
I'll cook something tomorrow

989
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,620
and bring it to her workplace.

990
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:26,740
Don't.

991
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:28,420
She doesn't

992
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,660
like being in our house

993
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,860
nor being disturbed

994
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:31,580
by us.

995
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,380
That's nonsense.

996
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,300
When did Yan say

997
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,260
she doesn't want to go home?

998
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:36,500
That's the truth.

999
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,300
She doesn't like crowds.

1000
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:40,380
Just don't bother her.

1001
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,340
The misfortune of childhood

1002
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,500
takes a lifetime

1003
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,380
to heal.

1004
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:56,180
I feel bad for Yan.

1005
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,420
Yan is a little aloof,

1006
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:00,740
but she knows

1007
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,180
who is good to her,

1008
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:02,820
right?

1009
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:06,300
Yan's father

1010
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:08,420
is good to Dingding.

1011
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:09,740
He is Dingding's uncle.

1012
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:11,060
They are also close.

1013
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:13,220
Let's not bring the feud
of the last generation

1014
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:14,500
to the young people.

1015
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,200
Okay?

1016
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,220
Why do you mention him

1017
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,700
all of a sudden?

1018
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:20,540
I will never

1019
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,020
forgive him.
