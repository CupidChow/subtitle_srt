1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,600

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,900
♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

3
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,100
♫  I put out mountain fires  ♫

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:22,100
♫  and catch the sunset  ♫

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,500
♫  I leave the rhythms of life in my wake  ♫

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:35,500
♫  Happiness whispers in my ears  ♫

7
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,400
♫  Chasing the passion for the future  ♫

8
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,500
♫  Like a dream maker  ♫

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,700
♫  Reading the universe and stars  ♫

10
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,600
♫  My existence in the river of time  ♫

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,500
♫  With the body temperature of a moment  ♫

12
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:02,200
♫  I'm trying to be the extension of light  ♫

13
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:08,900
♫  If the world grants me a frustrating opening  ♫

14
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:15,600
♫  I'll chase back time like a dark horse  ♫

15
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:22,300
♫  Even though I know the truth, I won't be afraid  ♫

16
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:28,400
 I won't miss the moon because of mediocrity  ♫

17
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,000
♫  I won't lose the light  ♫

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,300

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,300
Do you feel all right?

21
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,900
Thanks.

22
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,800
The same segments.

23
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,200
Yes.

24
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:20,000
Segments are the same, but they're in a mess.

25
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,000
It's been so many years.

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,200
You should try to let it go.

27
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,300
I thought I could.

28
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:37,244
This time in Fengqi, all the things came back.

29
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,600
Yan's mother and her family.

30
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,100
I can't forget them.

31
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:56,200
Perhaps, to find that kid is the only way to heal your pain.

32
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,100
I've spent 20 years looking for that kid.

33
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,000
You're right.

34
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,300
It's the only way.

35
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,500
I'll keep on.

36
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,500
I won't give up.

37
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,800

38
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,010

39
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,400

40
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,200

41
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,700
 Hello, I'm Luo Yuan.

42
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,600
 I'm a dance teacher at the Special Education School.

43
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,200
 Do you remember me?

44
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,280

45
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,400

46
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,400
Hi, do you have my parcel?

47
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,300
Yes. Wait, please. I'll bring it.

48
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,100
 Thank you for saving me.

49
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,000
Here you are.

50
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,500
- Xiong Fei, these are all yours. 
 - Okay.

51
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,700
- See you. 
 - Thanks.

52
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,620

53
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,900
 I've been transferred to Linjiang Central Hospital.

54
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,800
 I have an urgent parcel.

55
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,200
 Could you deliver it to the hospital?

56
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,500

57
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,860

58
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,100

59
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,300
 Miss Luo, I'm not working in your area anymore.

60
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,600
 If it's urgent, tell me the order number.

61
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,000
 I'll ask my colleague to help you.

62
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,700
 Why did you change your working area?

63
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,800
Come on, Yuan Yuan.

64
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,300
It's time for lunch.

65
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,200
What's wrong?

66
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,000
 You complained against Xiong Fei?

67
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,900
No, I didn't.

68
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,800
 His working area has changed.

69
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,400
Working area changes are very normal for couriers.

70
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,600
Come on, have some porridge.

71
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,800
Yuan Yuan, I promised you.

72
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,100
I wouldn't complain against him.

73
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,000
I kept my word.

74
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,200
By the way, I'm too busy to waste time on such things.

75
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,400
I know Xiong Fei saved you.

76
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,700
You're grateful to him and to the rescue team.

77
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:55,800
I promised you that I'd go to the rescue team.

78
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,300
 When?

79
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,800
Come on, when you finish your lunch.

80
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,800
That's great.

81
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,500
I'll go now.

82
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,000
Finish it.

83
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,100
See you.

84
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,400
May I know why Xiong Fei's working area has been changed?

85
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,900
 Xiong Fei?

86
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,600
He's a member of the rescue team.

87
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,300
He often goes on assignments, reducing work efficiency.

88
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:37,700
Therefore, our manager assigned him a smaller area to balance it.

89
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,800
Okay, thanks.

90
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:54,680

91
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,000
Our captain is in a meeting.

92
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,800
Take a seat and wait for him.

93
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,800
Great, thanks.

94
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,400

95
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:00,200
I would say we lack equipment.

96
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,400
Taking Guoya as an example.

97
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,200
Fortunately, that lawyer had an off-roader,

98
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,000
and his driving skill was great.

99
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,600
Yan was sent back in time.

100
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,800
Otherwise, it'd be hard to foresee.

101
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,700
Just imagine, if we had a helicopter, could things be easier?

102
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,000
Helicopter?

103
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,400
Are you daydreaming?

104
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,200
Why?

105
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,200
Do you think you're named Falcon, and you can really fly?

106
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,700
If I had a helicopter, I could fly to the sky.

107
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,000
Stop dreaming.

108
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,600
If we can ensure that the consumables such as carabiners and rope

109
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,600
to be replenished in time, that would be great.

110
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,400
You're too short-sighted.

111
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,300
Listen. That's enough.

112
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,400
In the Fengxi rescue,

113
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:47,000
we do have lots of losses in terms of equipment.

114
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,600
But Director Liu has promised

115
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,300
that the Emergency Management Office will support our equipment.

116
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,800
Our training and missions will not be affected.

117
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,300
Captain!

118
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,300
Captain,

119
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:05,200
a family member of the person we saved,

120
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,400
Mr. Luo, is waiting for you downstairs.

121
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,500
Mr. Luo.

122
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,200
Fine.

123
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,000
Let's go on.

124
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,800
Though we don't have a helicopter, an off-roader would work too.

125
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,900
 That's good.

126
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,800
Captain Qingshan, you saved my sister.

127
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,500
It represents my gratitude.

128
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,700
Please take it.

129
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,200
Luo Ben.

130
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,600
We appreciate your kindness, but we can't take your money.

131
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,600
If you have any legal concerns,

132
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,100
I can sign a gift agreement with you.

133
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,800
- That's very simple. 
 - I didn't mean that.

134
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:53,000
Mr. Luo, what we do is public welfare rescue.

135
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,400
I understand.

136
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,800
Actually, before I came, I had gotten to know your team,

137
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,400
but I think to do rescue work, you can't depend only on passion.

138
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,400
Think about it.

139
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,600
Meal fees of all members, travel fees,

140
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,600
including all your equipment.

141
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,100
You need money for those.

142
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,800
Yes.

143
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,200
This is the challenge we're facing.

144
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,800
Since you have met this challenge, you should try to solve it.

145
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,700
To be honest, if things go on like this,

146
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,500
it would be harmful to the team's development.

147
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,000
Luo Ben.

148
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,600
If we set this precedent, the nature of this rescue would have changed.

149
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,400
What's more, you are a family member of whom we saved.

150
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:47,400
As for the money, we won't take it.

151
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,800
Have you considered your future plan?

152
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,600
The future.

153
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:01,300
If we don't have a better measure, we will have to keep doing this.

154
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,200
All right.

155
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,500
If you change your mind, come to me.

156
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,100
Okay.

157
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,700
Mr. Luo!

158
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,500
Come on, Doubao.

159
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,000
Mr. Luo.

160
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,800
- Do you remember me? 
 - You're...

161
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,600
Falcon.

162
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,800
That's what makes you a lawyer. What a good memory!

163
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,200
Why do you come to me?

164
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,400
I know why you came.

165
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,300
You're here to thank us.

166
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,400
It's not decent to talk about money.

167
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,000
You could have a better way of expressing gratitude.

168
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,700
- What would you suggest? 
 - Think about it.

169
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,800
You're so talented.

170
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,900
You're a lawyer. You drive very well.

171
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,400
In our team, we lack a person like you.

172
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,500
Think about it. Join us.

173
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,300
If you need some legal assistance and need my help,

174
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,600
contact me whenever you want.

175
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:09,000
About joining the team, I don't have a plan yet.

176
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,400
Just take your time. Think it over.

177
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,400
We'll wait for you.

178
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,700
Okay.

179
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,300
- See you later. 
 - All right.

180
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,200
See you!

181
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,100
Doubao, have you seen it?

182
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,200
Look at him. He's very talented.

183
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,400
Just in several days, he'll become our team member.

184
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,400
Sorry, I was busy with team issues.

185
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,100

186
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,200
Xiaojie, I'm sorry.

187
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,000
I didn't take good care of Yan.

188
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I don't need your care.

189
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,600
Let alone your apology.

190
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,400
Can't we just let go of the past?

191
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,800
Your mother would not be happy to see us like this now.

192
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,000
She'd be more unwilling to let me see that newspaper.

193
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,600
 Why?

194
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,300
 What do you mean?

195
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,600

196
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,100
 You told me when you saw my mom, she was already dead.

197
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,300
 - You liar. 
 - Yan...

198
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,700
 - Why didn't you save mom first? 
 - I did.

199
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,300
 And why didn't she survive?

200
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,500
 Why did the newspaper say you saved the boy first?

201
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:21,100
 I lost my mother, but you're here, taking it for granted to be a hero.

202
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,600
 Why are you silent?

203
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,400
 Because you're guilty.

204
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,700
 Because you led her to her death.

205
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,700
 I won't forgive you for my life.

206
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,600
I owe your mother

207
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,700
and I owe you as well.

208
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,400
I'm a doctor,

209
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,300
and also a member of the international medical rescue team.

210
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,000
Professionally speaking, I understand you.

211
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,400
Emotionally speaking,

212
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,500
I can't forgive you.

213
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,400
I remember I went to you with that newspaper.

214
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:22,200
I cried, screamed, and asked you how my mother died.

215
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,600
You were just like this,

216
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,400
keeping silent and refusing to talk.

217
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,700
It's been so many years,

218
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,800
you're still the same.

219
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,600
You don't have the courage to tell me the truth.

220
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,900

221
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,600
Xiaojie,

222
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,192
there are some things I can't tell Yan.

223
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,800
I often ask myself if this is the right thing to do.

224
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,700
What else can I do?

225
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,700
That's the way it is.

226
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,600
Just let her blame me.

227
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,700
Here he is.

228
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,522
Our hero is back.

229
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,400
Let us see. Is your body still complete?

230
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,200
Don't touch me.

231
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,800
Fine, take off your sunglasses.

232
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,900
We're good buddies. Stop pretending.

233
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,200
Now you treat me as your buddy?

234
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,600
We agreed to go to Fengxi together, to share happiness and hardships.

235
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,500
But you guys left me alone.

236
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,000
So the chance of being a hero is left to the person who really needs it.

237
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,100
Well, you're right.

238
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,500
When I just arrived at Fengqi, I did something amazing and incredible.

239
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,600
What did you do?

240
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,800
I met a man with a psychiatric disorder.

241
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,400
He was begging for money.

242
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,800
Everybody said he was a psycho.

243
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:19,200
But I thought it was a typical post-disaster stress psychological disorder.

244
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,100
Immediately, I looked for a psychologist for him.

245
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:26,200
There was a woman who was also a little out of her mind.

246
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,000
When the aftershock occurred, she went inside the rubble to find a computer.

247
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,200
- What's wrong with her? 
 - That's it. She was killing herself.

248
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,600
So I went in immediately to bring her out and I lectured her.

249
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,200
Is your life or computer more valuable?

250
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,500
It makes sense, right?

251
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,100
You saved a beauty.

252
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,400
Did that beauty decide to marry you in return?

253
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,700
That's why later she kept dating me.

254
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,300
But it didn't work. I'm not interested.

255
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,400
Stop bragging.

256
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,800
Take her out to meet us someday.

257
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,900
We want to see her, right?

258
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,000
- That's right. 
 - Let us see her.

259
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,600
- She looks okay. 
 - Okay?

260
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,400
But just...

261
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,370
Ding Dingding, why are you here?

262
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:07,400
Zhou Mingming, tell me.

263
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,000
Who kept dating you?

264
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,600
Keep dating you?

265
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,800
Am I wrong?

266
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,000
When we came back from Fengqi, you sat on my legs all the way.

267
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,400
Have you forgotten it?

268
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,200
- All the way? 
 - Is there any story?

269
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,500
You're right, I haven't forgotten it.

270
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,800
I sat on your legs.

271
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,100
Don't beat me. Not on my face.

272
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,000
What do you mean?

273
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,044
Mr. Ming.

274
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,370
Mr. Ming, wait.

275
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:50,890
Mr. Ming.

276
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:52,200
Wait a minute, please.

277
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,000
Zhou Mingming!

278
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,520
Li Aiqi? What a shock!

279
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,590
Is my mom here?

280
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,790
She's looking for you.

281
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,220
Your nose?

282
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,550
I accidentally bumped it.

283
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,780
How careless!

284
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,820
When Mrs. Fang sees you, she'll scold you.

285
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:13,080
I have to deal with it quickly.

286
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,000
Mom, you're looking for me?

287
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,510
You didn't go to have tea with the actors?

288
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:25,520
Nonsense! I'm too busy with work.

289
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,220
Why do you look so tired?

290
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,571
Where did you go?

291
00:22:29,571 --> 00:22:31,650
Nowhere. I went to have coffee.

292
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:34,060
And feeling tired after coffee?

293
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,890
Nobody believes that.

294
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,930
What about the business plan?

295
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:39,131
It's done.

296
00:22:39,131 --> 00:22:41,240
It's done. I was going to send it to you.

297
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,350
Send it to me then.

298
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,930
Okay. Wait a minute.

299
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,980
Why is he in such a hurry?

300
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,164
What is he doing?

301
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,380

302
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,480
Thank you so much for making the plan in advance.

303
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,960
Otherwise, if my mom catches me this time, I'm sure I'd be doomed.

304
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,500
I can't help you accomplish the task every time.

305
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,628
As long as you're here, I can accomplish it.

306
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:17,420
- I'll go to work. 
 - Okay.

307
00:23:25,371 --> 00:23:28,306
Ding Dingding. She beat me too hard.

308
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,030

309
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,328
Dad. Mom. I'm back.

310
00:23:43,328 --> 00:23:45,310
You're back, my girl.

311
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:51,010
Dingding, come here.

312
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:52,640
Come and talk with me.

313
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,060
Why so serious?

314
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,740
Honey, you're not very good at school, that's okay.

315
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:03,690
You like drawing comics and want to be a cartoonist, that's okay, too.

316
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:09,900
But an artwork must stand the test of aesthetics and values. Right?

317
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:13,170
Dad, what do you want to say?

318
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:15,440
Today the mechanic came to repair the air-conditioner.

319
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,830
I asked him to repair the one in your room too.

320
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:20,594
You entered my room?

321
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:23,980
Didn't you promise to respect my privacy?

322
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,920
We've always respected your privacy.

323
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:32,120
But we never thought you were painting that kind of content.

324
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,960
Mom, don't say it like that if you don't know.

325
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,260
What I created is the hottest subject.

326
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,260
What do you mean by the hottest subject?

327
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,260
Your statement doesn't make sense.

328
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:44,500
Artwork can't rely on grandstanding.

329
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:48,960
A good artwork must have the correct value orientation. Understood?

330
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,690
Can you please not interfere with my art creation?

331
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:56,100
We didn't interfere with your creation.

332
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,830
We're guiding and educating you.

333
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:02,680
Mom, I've grown up.

334
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,730
What you said, I've been listening to it for more than 20 years.

335
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:07,890
I know what I'm doing.

336
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:11,030
If you keep on like this, I won't be able to stay at home.

337
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:15,282
Dingding. What did you say?

338
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:22,110
I said if you keep on interfering with my creation without respecting my privacy,

339
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:24,350
I'll leave home.

340
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,598
Are you serious?

341
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:29,250
Yes, I am.

342
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:31,130
Okay.

343
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:36,080
Since this is your attitude, your father and I will respect your choice.

344
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:42,160
- What? 
 - Pack the luggage by yourself.

345
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:01,184
Honey, is it too much that we push her like this?

346
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:03,780
Just look how lazy and slack she is.

347
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:07,776
If you don't push her, how can she live on her own in the future?

348
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:24,200
I've been looked down on like this, there's no reason to keep fooling around.

349
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,890
Hi, this is the housing agency. Right?

350
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:37,070
I want to rent a house.

351
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:39,090
Please.

352
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:43,800
Your agency is very efficient. I made the call just now.

353
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,430
We have reliable listings. You can come whenever you want.

354
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:50,000
This community has a very high greening rate and perfect supporting facilities.

355
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,090
There are metro stations and supermarkets nearby.

356
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:53,650
It's convenient to live here.

357
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:56,750
It's quiet around. The neighbors are well-educated.

358
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:59,780
It's perfect for artists like you.

359
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:09,480
How much is the rent? You just said it.

360
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,850
Say it again?

361
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:13,590
How are the patients admitted from Fengxi?

362
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,370
If things go well, they'll leave this week.

363
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:17,940
Great. In the disaster area, you did a lot of work.

364
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,910
You won glory for the hospital and you've played a good exemplary role.

365
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:23,270
That's my duty.

366
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:25,270
You made a good impression with your superiors.

367
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:28,190
The advanced individual award will probably be yours.

368
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:31,480
Thanks for your guidance. I just don't want to embarrass you.

369
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:01,690
 Brother, the advanced individual award they just mentioned.

370
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:04,886
 I'm wondering if Dr. Zhan will get it.

371
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:08,910
It's their business. It has nothing to do with us.

372
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,930
When will Dr. Cai come?

373
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:13,450
Aren't you a patient of Dr. Zhan?

374
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:14,990
Why do you ask about Dr. Cai?

375
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:17,400
Dr. Cai is an influencer now.

376
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,590
I'm leaving the hospital. I want to take a photo with him.

377
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:25,154
It's a pity that it was not him that performed the operation for me.

378
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:29,410
 Dr. Zhan is much better than that Dr. Cai.

379
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,170
 Why is everybody praising him?

380
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:33,206
 It's not fair.

381
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,628
Aren't you doing things with great love?

382
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:42,580
Dr. Cai, may I take a photo with you?

383
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,880
I...

384
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:48,366
Okay, come on.

385
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,480
It's okay.

386
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:59,610
Miss Luo, your indicators are basically close to normal.

387
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:02,478
Next week, you can be discharged.

388
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:15,650
By the way, Dr. Zhan used to be in charge of my sister.

389
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:17,942
Isn't she here today?

390
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,260
Dr. Zhan is on leave.

391
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,200
This is our dean.

392
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:25,790
Dean, when will Dr. Zhan come back?

393
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:28,230
I need to see her.

394
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:31,130
If you have any requirements, just ask other doctors.

395
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:32,880
They'll help you.

396
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,740
That's not what I mean.

397
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:40,230
In this earthquake, my sister could survive because of Dr. Zhan.

398
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:43,300
Despite the life risk, the rescue team and her

399
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,980
entered the rubble together to successfully save my sister.

400
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:50,990
So before I leave the hospital, I'd like to thank her personally.

401
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:54,080
Okay. Let's do that.

402
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,410
Finally, someone put in a good word for our Zhan Yan.

403
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:11,920
Recently, everybody praises Dr. Cai.

404
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,780
I'm getting tired of hearing it.

405
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:16,310
That's because Dr. Cai is very fond of publicity.

406
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:18,450
He regards himself as a superstar.

407
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:20,060
What does he want?

408
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,650
To enter the entertainment industry?

409
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,520
Don't say that.

410
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,070
Zhan Yan doesn't like to show off.

411
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:30,154
If she wanted it, she could do the same thing.

412
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:55,020
I was informed just now that Fangqin Group was embroiled in a lawsuit in a guarantee case.

413
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,850
The lawyers they signed don't have any good plans.

414
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:59,370
Mr. Fang is not satisfied.

415
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:02,310
That's why he wants to replace them.

416
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,300
 Okay.

417
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:06,110
 Try to figure it out right away. Send me the relevant documents.

418
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:09,080
I'm sorting it out. I'll send them to you.

419
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:10,910
Good.

420
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,450
Mr. Luo.

421
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:20,920
 Dr. Zhan, could you please open the door?

422
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,450
 I'm locked on the roof.

423
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:24,450
Why are you there?

424
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:27,930
 About this... Could I explain to you later?

425
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:49,300
What's this?

426
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,608
Poison, want it?

427
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:54,510
I'll take it since it's from you.

428
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:56,010
Cheers.

429
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,820
I'm going to change my clothes.

430
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,980
Help yourself after taking it.

431
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,890
- Any clothes for me? 
 - A hospital gown, yes.

432
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,370
Any size.

433
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:11,390
That's not attractive.

434
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,220
I'm all wet.

435
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,488
Do you have a hair dryer?

436
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:26,580
I'm going to get changed.

437
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,410
Put it on the table after using it.

438
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:30,026
Thanks.

439
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:03,964
Dr. Zhan,

440
00:33:03,964 --> 00:33:09,440
this time, anyway, thank you for coming to open the door for me.

441
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,716
It seems that I owe you again.

442
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:15,300
It was not just for you.

443
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,440
I was supposed to be working.

444
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,680
Dr. Zhan,

445
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:33,040
at ordinary times, besides work, do you have any other hobbies?

446
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:35,790
Aren't you leaving?

447
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,650
Don't get me wrong.

448
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:39,920
Actually, I just want to thank you.

449
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,070
I want to do what you like.

450
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:45,040
It's not necessary. Close the door when you leave.

451
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,670
Thanks.

452
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,320
Fine.

453
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:53,190
See you.

454
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,776
Don't work too late.

455
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,580

456
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,140
Good morning.

457
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:19,040
Yan, who unplugged it yesterday?

458
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,570
What happened?

459
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:23,260
This morning when I came to work, I found it was already unplugged.

460
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:28,256
These fish almost died.

461
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,684
Sis, are you busy?

462
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,220
 I'm preparing for an operation.

463
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,560
I'll make it short then.

464
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,330
I rented a nice house, come and have fun after work.

465
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:50,120
Welcome to my sweet home.

466
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:53,180
You rented a house?

467
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:55,020
 I have to fight for my honor.

468
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,460
They look down on me.

469
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,570
I have no dignity at home.

470
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:00,740
I've made the decision. I won't go back home often.

471
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,750
I'll make the two middle-aged people regret it.

472
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,490
 Sis, just come after work.

473
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:06,470
Let me see if I'm free.

474
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:12,570

475
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:34,640
Yuan, I've caught a cold, I don't want to infect you.

476
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,080
So I won't go there today.

477
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,750
I've prepared food for you and dessert.

478
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:41,010
Have the food by yourself.

479
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:53,842
 Are you busy?

480
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,680
 I am.

481
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:03,970
 I have a parcel that's stranded in your express station.

482
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:06,994
 It will be returned if I don't collect it.

483
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:09,370
 But it's very important to me.

484
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:11,894
 Could you please collect it for me?

485
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,700
 Are you still in the hospital?

486
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,170
 Yeah.

487
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:21,120
 I got it. The order number and pickup code.

488
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,780
 Send them to me.

489
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:27,220
 Thank you.

490
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,170

491
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:50,970
Miss Luo, you look much better.

492
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:53,320
Here's your parcel.

493
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:00,720
 Thank you for bringing it to me.

494
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,240
 Could you please open it?

495
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,640
Okay.

496
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,910
Here you are.

497
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:31,714
 It's for you.

498
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:39,262
 It's a gift for you.

499
00:38:39,262 --> 00:38:42,630
But... I can't take it.

500
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:51,180
 Thanks for saving me.

501
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,604
That's what I should do.

502
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,850
 Showing gratitude is also what I should do.

503
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:06,334
 If you don't accept my gratitude, I'll not feel at ease.

504
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:24,026
 Is it ugly?

505
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:28,574
It's nice.

506
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,450
 I don't know your preference.

507
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:40,370
 So I bought you something useful.

508
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:42,620
 You work in the rescue team to guard others' safety.

509
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:45,740
 Little White will guard you when you're working.

510
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:48,460
Little White?

511
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,960
 This.

512
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:56,002
 I just gave it a name.

513
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,720
The operation is over?

514
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,740
Did everything go well?

515
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:34,492
Yes.

516
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:40,200
By the way, Cong Zhou made an appointment with some alumni for a gathering tonight.

517
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,970
He asked me to invite you.

518
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:45,100
You're too tired. Take the chance to relax.

519
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,900
When?

520
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:49,500

521
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:54,560
 Sis, you know what?

522
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,860
 My parents kicked me out and went on a trip.

523
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,890
 Now you are my only family.

524
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:00,750
 You have to come tonight.

525
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:04,194
 Please comfort my wounded heart.

526
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:09,530
Understood. I'll tell him.

527
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:35,110
 How can there be parents like you who just leave?

528
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:38,236
 You left your only daughter alone.

529
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:53,830
 Isn't it beautiful?

530
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,610

531
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,160
Help me.

532
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,340
Anybody there?

533
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,992
My home's on fire, just run!

534
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,350
How slow it is!

535
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:31,550
Don't take the lift.

536
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,688
Just run!

537
00:42:55,060 --> 00:43:05,030

538
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:14,224
♫  At first, there was no sadness in the world  ♫

539
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:20,844
♫  Until luck came and crossed the stage  ♫

540
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:29,196
♫  At first, souls were confused and wandered  ♫

541
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:36,160
♫  Until people hugged each other  ♫

542
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:44,152
♫  I've been on the road  ♫

543
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:52,180
♫  Trying to connect laughter and tears  ♫

544
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:59,128
♫  I suddenly have faith  ♫

545
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:06,680
♫  I can walk by millions of shining household lights  ♫

546
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:15,560
♫  I hope I can admire flowers in the afterglow  ♫

547
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:21,720
♫  Shed tears and hope that you are well  ♫

548
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:30,500
♫  The good times I'm pursuing belong to the light  ♫

549
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:38,100
♫  It can light up the wounds that follow  ♫

550
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:41,840
♫  Catching the floating stars  ♫

551
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:45,660
♫  Watching as the memories flash by  ♫

552
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:49,220
♫  Traveling through market scenes  ♫

553
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:52,980
♫  With a fiery gaze  ♫

554
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:56,720
♫  I can't fly  ♫

555
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:00,380
♫  But I can look up  ♫

556
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:08,248
♫  I'm chasing the light on the road  ♫
