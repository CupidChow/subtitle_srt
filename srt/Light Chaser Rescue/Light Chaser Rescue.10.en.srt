Who is there?

17
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,250
It's me. Me.

18
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,480
Zhou Mingming.

19
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,170
Why are you still up at this hour?

20
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:57,250
What are you doing?

21
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,440
Are you going to sneak out?

22
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,440
No way I would do that.

23
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,770
I only wanted to make
a phone call to my mother.

24
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:02,690
I didn't want to disturb everybody else.

25
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,690
Finish your call.

26
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,890
And then go back to your tent.

27
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,560
Don't even think about sneaking out.

28
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,410
Sure. I got it.

29
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:09,480
I'll go back right after the call.

30
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:24,690
Hello, Mom.

31
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:25,840
Mingming.

32
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,760
How come you're calling me back so late?

33
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:30,000
I wasn't allowed
to use my phone in class,

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,970
so I switched it

35
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,090
into flight mode.

36
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,410
Where are you?

37
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,600
I'm at the university.

38
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,930
Aiqi didn't tell you?

39
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,690
She did,

40
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,530
but I'm just curious.

41
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,040
Why do you want

42
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,440
to study business administration
all of a sudden?

43
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,530
I want to share your burden,

44
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:47,970
Mom.

45
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,000
Did you just go to some other place

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,370
to squander money?

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,160
How's that possible?

48
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,560
Your son's better than that.

49
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,160
I tell you what.

50
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,600
The professor here is strict.

51
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,930
I love professors to be strict.

52
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,760
What's your

53
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,000
professor's name?

54
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,600
Professor Zhang Weilin.

55
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,720
The deputy dean of school
of business administration.

56
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,460
(Zhang Weilin Deputy Dean
of School of Business Administration)

57
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,210
Son,

58
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,880
I don't know how to express myself.

59
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm so happy for you.

60
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,440
You are a big boy now.

61
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:22,410
Mom,

62
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,720
I gotta go.

63
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,040
Professor Zhang

64
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,810
assigned a lot of homework.

65
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:26,810
I need to finish my homework.

66
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,160
Sure, sure.

67
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,410
Go, go.

68
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:30,370
Mom, bye.

69
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,410
Bye.

70
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,530
What are you doing?

71
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:38,160
Eavesdropping on me?

72
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,880
Keep it down. Stop shouting.

73
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,280
What are you doing here

74
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,130
in the middle of the night?

75
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,250
I'm going out for some midnight kebab.

76
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,410
Don't let Xiong Fei know.

77
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:47,490
I will let him know.

78
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,000
Come on.

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,160
Don't be a jerk.

80
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,160
I won't if you treat me to some kebab.

81
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,650
You, a silver-spoon guy,
ask me to treat you to kebab?

82
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,810
Are you serious?

83
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,650
Yes, I'm very serious.

84
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:03,410
Will you or will you not?

85
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:04,530
I'll yell if you refuse.

86
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,000
I swear I will.

87
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:11,600
Go on, then.

88
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:13,840
I will yell as well.

89
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,650
About what?

90
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,410
Someone lied to the team.

91
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,970
He joined the rescue training

92
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,280
without the permission of his family,

93
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,170
and says he's studying
business administration

94
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,520
in the university.

95
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:25,960
My treat.

96
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,290
My treat, then. Are you happy?

97
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,130
Well, you should have said it earlier.

98
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:31,370
Let's go.

99
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,170
Just you wait.

100
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:33,810
Ding Dingding…

101
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,370
Hurry up.

102
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,440
You were eavesdropping.

103
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,170
Will you go to the test tomorrow?

104
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:02,850
I don't think

105
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,320
the team members like me.

106
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,640
Well, I know Fan wants you
to take the test.

107
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,290
You want me to go back?

108
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,560
I look forward to your result.

109
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,930
Then I'm afraid I'll let you down.

110
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,440
I may score high points.

111
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:22,250
OK.

112
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,290
We'll see about that.

113
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:26,930
See you tomorrow.

114
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,320
See you tomorrow.

115
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:43,690
Hello, Yuxiao.

116
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,200
Yan, here's the thing.

117
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,050
When I got back to the hospital,

118
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,520
I was told that Mr. Fan is ill.

119
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,000
Don't worry.

120
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,730
I have arranged

121
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:52,520
an intensive care ward.

122
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,290
You just look after him

123
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,320
these days.

124
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,880
But tomorrow,

125
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,400
I will be at the rescue team

126
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,960
for the final test.

127
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,610
I know that you are close

128
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,490
to Mr. Fan.

129
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,690
I'm afraid you'll be distracted

130
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,170
if you're not around him.

131
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:11,760
How about this?

132
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,730
I will go to the rescue team

133
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,320
on your behalf.

134
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:18,050
OK.

135
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,170
Thank you.

136
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,400
It's fine. No big deal.

137
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:23,850
Don't stay up too late.

138
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:25,050
Bye.

139
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,440
What's up?

140
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,940
(WeChat Steps Ranking No. 1
Sleepy Ding 18,290)

141
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:55,730
It's…

142
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,730
Ding Dingding.

143
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:08,560
Ding Dingding.

144
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,960
Are you in there?

145
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:15,730
We'll unzip your tent.

146
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,370
What's the rush?

147
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:38,440
I didn't finish my food.

148
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,000
Yes, it is my treat,

149
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,130
but we shouldn't waste the food.

150
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:40,880
With every minute passing by,

151
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,320
the risk gets higher.

152
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,200
You're so chicken-hearted.

153
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:45,850
Oh, you are fearless.

154
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:46,610
Why didn't you keep eating?

155
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:47,610
Why did you follow me back?

156
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,050
I thought it'd be dangerous

157
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,290
for you to walk alone in the night.

158
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,880
You were afraid that you'd
get caught by Xiong Fei.

159
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:53,880
Afraid?

160
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,080
I am afraid

161
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,170
of nothing.

162
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:00,490
What?

163
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:03,130
Can you hear

164
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,290
some strange sounds?

165
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,520
Grow up, will you?

166
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,200
I-I think it's fun.

167
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,810
There is something ahead of us.

168
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,450
Stop taking me for a fool.

169
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,370
I'm not. I'm serious.

170
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:40,920
Well,

171
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,040
keep up your acting.

172
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,000
Be careful.

173
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,920
It may be a snake.

174
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:53,400
If it is,

175
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,850
the more you move,
the more likely you'll be attacked.

176
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:56,970
What do we do?

177
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,730
Stay put.

178
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,760
Be careful.

179
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,490
Take it easy.

180
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,880
Back up a little.

181
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:17,400
Easy. Easy.

182
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:23,760
What is it?

183
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,920
I-I think it's a big rabbit.

184
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,570
A big rabbit?

185
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:27,640
Are you sure?

186
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:28,850
A rabbit?

187
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,490
Yes, yes. A rabbit, yes.

188
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:31,000
Really?

189
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,090
Yes, a rabbit. A rabbit.

190
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,090
Is it gone? Is it gone?

191
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,570
I-I-I think so.

192
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:52,250
Uh…

193
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,000
I can't believe

194
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,730
we ran into a rabbit.

195
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:56,640
It was spooky.

196
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,520
Yeah.

197
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,040
I can't believe

198
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,920
a rabbit can grow into that size.

199
00:09:59,130 --> 00:09:59,880
Yeah.

200
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,130
Annoying.

201
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:04,920
It's very late.

202
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,090
Let's just go.

203
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,000
What if

204
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,490
we run into real danger?

205
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,400
OK.

206
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,450
Wait, you go first.

207
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:14,090

Your smile doesn't seem right.

Work email.

225
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:21,370
You?

226
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,570
What are you doing?

227
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,490
It's late. Still watching dramas?

228
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:32,400
Go to sleep.

229
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,250
Go.

230
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,370
Now.

231
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,520
Hurry up.

232
00:11:58,490 --> 00:11:59,970
We're back at last.

233
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,090
You keep the secret for me.

234
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:02,970
Especially how

235
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:03,640
I got spooked by a rabbit.

236
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,280
You keep my secret.

237
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,280
I don't snitch.

238
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,160
God will punish the snitch.

239
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,000
Shush.

240
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,370
I think I ate too much.

241
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:20,610
Oh, no.

242
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:38,420
(Be Strict with Yourself,
Be Nice to Others)

243
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:40,520
You're like a pro.

244
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,880
It looks like

245
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,680
you wrote a lot
of letters of autocriticism before.

246
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:44,680
You're good, too.

247
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,520
You have written a long essay.

248
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,210
411 words.

249
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:49,800
412 words.

250
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,640
413 words. 414 words.

251
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,160
Enough?

252
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:52,800
Not quite enough.

253
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,970
We'll learn from each other,

254
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:57,520
okay?

255
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,250
If we exchange the apples,

256
00:12:59,280 --> 00:12:59,970
each of us

257
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:00,680
still has only one apple.

258
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,850
But if we exchange ideas,

259
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,370
we'll share two ideas.

260
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,280
What do you think?

261
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:05,970
Fine.

262
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:13,610
Ding Dingding,

263
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:15,160
how dare you frame me up?

264
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,210
You proposed to have some kebabs.

265
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,370
And here you wrote,

266
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,520
"I didn't resist his luring."

267
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,610
Who treated me to the kabab?

268
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:23,760
Who paid for it?

269
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,570
Well,

270
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,450
who proposed it?

271
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:26,090
Who led the way?

272
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,760
Are you seriously arguing
with a woman?

273
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,490
Really?

274
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:30,570
Yes, I am serious.

275
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,210
I'm at most an accomplice,

276
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:33,450
but you make me the mastermind.

277
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,400
I paid for the meal,

278
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,800
and I have to take main responsibility?

279
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,640
No way.

280
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:37,970
You fix it.

281
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:38,400
Quickly.

282
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,330
No.

283
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,250
Fix it now.

284
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:40,680
No.

285
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:41,970
I'll fix mine.

286
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:43,570
Give it to me.

287
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:44,760
No, you are not allowed.

288
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,370
Give it to me.

289
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:45,920
You can't.

290
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,490
Give it to me now.

291
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:47,570
Then it'll

292
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:48,640
be my fault. Give it to me.

293
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,280
Give it to me.

294
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,330
Be the bigger man, will you?

295
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:54,330
What are you, a dog?

296
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:02,920
Bad timing, huh?

297
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:05,000
N-No.

298
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:06,250
What are you doing?

299
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,760
Writing our letters of autocriticism.

300
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,130
You need to hug while you write?

301
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,850
What time is it?

302
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,090
Will you go to bed or not?

303
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,680
We've finished.

304
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,250
If it happens again,

305
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,040
you two

306
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,800
will be kicked out of the team.

307
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,570
Got it?

308
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:28,680
Now, go to bed.

309
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,370
How are the preparations going?

310
00:14:58,730 --> 00:14:59,730
Captain, we're good.

311
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:01,250
Captain.

312
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,680
Hi, Captain.

313
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:03,400
Luo Ben.

314
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:05,730
How do you feel?

315
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,210
You're used

316
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,490
to high-intensive training, right?

317
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:09,680
Yes, I am.

318
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,090
Good.

319
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,130
Mr. Luo can get used to us,

320
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,520
but I'm not sure if you guys

321
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,490
can get used to him.

322
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,250
What do you mean, Dr. Cai?

323
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,800
Mr. Qingshan.

324
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,400
To be honest,

325
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,730
I feel kind of nervous

326
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,370
about being Mr. Luo's examiner.

327
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,370
Some team member

328
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,370
told me that you had
a conflict with the coach,

329
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,640
and you nearly quit.

330
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,800
Mr. Luo.

331
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,090
I hope you won't walk away

332
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,210
because you don't

333
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,450
accept the criticisms again.

334
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,000
Dr. Cai, don't worry.

335
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,850
As long as it's a fair test,

336
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:44,570
I'll acknowledge my mistakes

337
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,490
and accept your criticisms.

338
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,640
That's the spirit.

339
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,520
By the way,

340
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:50,800
a strong mind

341
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,880
is also important

342
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:53,610
for a qualified

343
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:55,090
rescuer.

344
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,130
I hope you'll pass the test.

345
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,920
I'll try not

346
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,490
to let you down, Dr. Cai.

347
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:01,570
OK.

348
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:02,000
Now,

349
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
get ready for the test.

350
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:04,370
OK.

351
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:28,250
Coach Xiong Fei is not here today,

352
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,330
so I will be

353
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,450
supervising the test.

354
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:32,400
I hope you

355
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,610
brace yourselves

356
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,570
for the test

357
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:36,920
and aim for the best result.

358
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:38,570
Can you do that?

359
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:39,640
Yes!

360
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,450
Good.

361
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,760
Task description.

362
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,800
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake broke out.

363
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,640
The rescue team heads
to the stricken areas

364
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:49,210
and searches for
signs of life immediately.

365
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,490
The rescuers are to

366
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:52,920
find the survivors

367
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,130
in the shortest time possible

368
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,130
without any support of gear.

369
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:56,160
Yes, sir!

370
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:04,800
Anyone?

371
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,760
Anyone?

372
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:10,880
Anyone?

373
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,160
Is anyone here?

374
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,570
Is anyone here?

375
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:19,010
Anyone?

376
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:20,610
Anyone?

377
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,960
Please make a sound.

378
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:39,640
Anyone?

379
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,480
Anyone?

380
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,530
Anyone here?

381
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:42,530
Anyone here?

382
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:46,570
An aftershock.

383
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,010
Someone's here. Help me.

384
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:02,850
Quickly.

385
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:07,780
(Light Chaser Rescue)

386
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,810
For Earthquake Search,

387
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,330
group 1's results are:

388
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,050
Luo Ben,

389
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,010
9 points.

390
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:17,680
Zhou Mingming,

391
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,770
6 points.

392
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,330
Ding Dingding, Chu Weisheng, Liu Zhen,

393
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:24,570
0 point.

394
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,720
Captain, please give your comments.

395
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:33,400
Let me see.

396
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,010
Before that,

397
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,130
I'd like to ask Luo Ben.

398
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:40,880
When you were given the task,

399
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:43,050
why didn't you

400
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:43,850
enter the scene at once?

401
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,880
Because there are usually aftershocks

402
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,130
after the first quake.

403
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,440
First, we must make sure

404
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,010
the stability of the ruin

405
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,400
so that we won't

406
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,680
put ourselves in danger.

407
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:57,160
Zhou Mingming,

408
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,090
you knew there would be aftershocks,

409
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:01,010
but you still went for the rescue.

410
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,200
Why?

411
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:03,770
Sir,

412
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,130
do you really want the truth?

413
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,770
You tell me.

414
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,640
The truth is,

415
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,960
now that I'm here,

416
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,290
I don't want to be a coward.

417
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:23,680
Your reason

418
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:25,850
does surprise me.

419
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,200
You knew there

420
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,400
would be aftershocks,

421
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:30,370
it's sensible

422
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:31,920
that you don't venture into the ruins.

423
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,810
However, seeing you

424
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,010
did manage to rescue the survivors

425
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:36,480
before the collapse,

426
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,130
I consider

427
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:38,530
you pass the test.

428
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,290
He just got lucky.

429
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,010
Where's your luck?

430
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:48,960
Ding Dingding,

431
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:50,680
Chu Weisheng, Liu Zhen.

432
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,680
You

433
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:53,090
comment on

434
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,200
your performances.

435
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:56,440
Sir,

436
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,130
we executed

437
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,370
our task strictly

438
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,200
following the coach's instructions.

439
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,810
That's why I have a question.

440
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,090
How come we discovered

441
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:04,330
and rescued the target,

442
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,770
but we got zero points?

443
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,480
I bet you all

444
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,880
have the same question.

445
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,160
Everyone,

446
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,960
what we are doing here

447
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,920
is to emphasize

448
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:22,330
on a key point

449
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:23,640
through the on-site test,

450
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,240
which is self-protection.

451
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,640
It is very crucial.

452
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,570
I hope you all keep in mind

453
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:33,160
that as a rescuer,

454
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:35,720
we must keep ourselves safe

455
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,480
before we help

456
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,440
and save others.

457
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,440
So,

458
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:41,050
rescue is not the top priority

459
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,880
when you are in the task zone,

460
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,880
but to observe and decide

461
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,640
if you are in a safe environment.

462
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,770
Ding Dingding,

463
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:52,850
although you and your teammates
learned the search skills,

464
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:55,160
and you performed the standard process,

465
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,770
however, you overlooked
your personal safety.

466
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,480
By doing so, you can't save anyone,

467
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,400
and you would even

468
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:01,920
put yourselves in danger.

469
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,050
Thus, zero point for you.

470
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:06,160
Do you understand now?

471
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,050
Understood.

472
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:09,050
Sir.

473
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:10,920
One more request.

474
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,440
You have a lot of questions.

475
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,240
Speak.

476
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,570
Coach didn't teach us
about self-protection.

477
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:19,370
So it's a lesson

478
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:20,810
learned in the form of a test.

479
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,850
Our group

480
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:23,330
took the lead,

481
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,440
and sacrificed ourselves

482
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,610
for others.

483
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,720
I think we deserve
at least some credit.

484
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,090
Can you give us another chance?

485
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:38,640
About what Ding Dingding said,

486
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,960
I believe everybody

487
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,570
has their own answer,

488
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:45,960
but my answer is,

489
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,290
you only live once.

490
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:51,050
Got it.

491
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:52,680
Dapeng,

492
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:53,810
carry on.

493

494
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,090
Task description.

495
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,370
There's a serious car accident

496
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:32,920
on the highway ahead,

497
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,570
and it has caused 15 casualties.

498
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,880
four of them are severely injured.

499
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:40,090
The rescue team is ordered

500
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:40,920
to the rescue.

501
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,680
Team members

502
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,160
are to perform first-aid on the wounded

503
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:47,440
to buy time for paramedics.

504

Liu Guanghui, Li Ming.

516
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:08,770
Action!

517
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:09,850
Yes, sir!

518
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:35,770
Here.

519
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,400
It's…

520
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,050
I got it.

521
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:46,920
How do you feel?

522
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,130
Where are your injuries?

523
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,570
My left calf is swollen and in pain.

524
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:53,850
I can't move my left leg.

525
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,960
Bind his leg up.

526
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,460
(Light Chaser Rescue
(Intermediate) Grade Chart)

527
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,920
It's a dummy.

528
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,440
We can't ask him.

529
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,200
What do we do?

530
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,240
It's only words on the rescue manual,

531
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,200
but in real life,

532
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,640
we'll make our judgments

533
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,530
based on our experience.

534
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,960
He's injured on the head.

535
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,130
It looks like a scalp laceration.

536
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:28,880
Or even worse,

537
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,200
a craniocerebral injury.

538
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,370
We need to be thoughtful.

539
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:34,610
We'll assume the worst

540
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:35,440
when we treat the case.

541
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:35,880
OK.

542
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,860
(Light Chaser Rescue

543
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:09,480
Miss Luo.

544
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,200
Be careful.

545
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,440
He's a testy one.

546
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,920
He only allows the one
he's familiar with to touch him.

547
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,570
What's up with you?

548
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:28,850
You're pretty easygoing today.

549
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,240
You don't need to go to work?

550
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,160
Shift change?

551
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:00,880
I know that sign.

552
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,680
It's the substitution sign in basketball.

553
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:13,810
I'll make signs, you'll guess.

554
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:26,240
Dog?

555
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:33,770
What?

556
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,400
Something's crawling?

557
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,850
Wings?

558
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,570
Crawling?

559
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,130
Angel?

560
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:42,530
I don't know.

561
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:47,370
Bear (Xiong).

562
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:48,290
Fly (Fei).

563
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,810
I now announce

564
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,680
the results of Light Chaser Rescue

565
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,810
stimulative car accident rescue.

566
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,480
Only one group failed.

567
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:55,720
Group 1 failed.

568
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:57,130
Luo Ben

569
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:58,440
and Chen Xing.

570
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:01,330
Which part did we do wrong?

571
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,880
You were to rescue

572
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,810
a heavily wounded victim.

573
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,720
Before the rescue,

574
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:07,960
you must ask the wounded
about their condition

575
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:09,570
to make sure

576
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,480
that he's still conscious.

577
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:13,610
Am I hearing you correctly?

578
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,680
It was a dummy.

579
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:17,090
Would it answer our question?

580
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:18,680
Right.

581
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,680
It would.

582
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,570
You just ask the question,

583
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:24,200
and it will answer.

584
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:26,920
Every heavily wounded victim

585
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,160
had a speaker with them.

586
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,610
Everything you say

587
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,610
would be transmitted

588
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:35,850
to my earphones through the device.

589
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,240
I heard

590
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,480
every other group ask questions.

591
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:40,960
Sadly,

592
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,370
I didn't hear you ask any questions.

593
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:46,160
Dr. Cai,

594
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,570
there was only a dummy.

595
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,850
I didn't see any device.

596
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,060
(Minor injury)

597
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,380
(Minor injury)

598
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:44,050
It's only words on the rescue manual,

599
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,610
but in real life,

600
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,880
we'll make our judgments

601
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,570
based on our experience.

602
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,090
It's…

603
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:51,640
It's what

604
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,680
Luo Ben told me.

605
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,880
I can hear everything

606
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,640
you said loud and clear.

607
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,850
Sadly,

608
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,240
I waited so long,

609
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,810
but you never asked.

610
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:04,240
So I had

611
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:06,640
to fail you on this one.

612
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,200
Dr. Cai,

613
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:11,200
this is personal, right?

614
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:17,810
Well, I can't help it if you feel that way.

615
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,400
All I can do is mark you

616
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,850
according to the standard.

617
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,960
I warned you before the test

618
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:24,960
that a strong mind

619
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,050
is important to a rescuer.

620
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:28,200
Well,

621
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:29,850
I got my emergency paramedic certificate

622
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:31,370
long ago.

623
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:32,530
I don't need your

624
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:33,880
marking to prove

625
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,610
my ability.

626
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:47,880
Now,

627
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,240
we'll issue the certificate of completion

628
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,720
to those who passed the test.

629
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,050
Zhou Mingming.

630
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:56,680
Present.

631
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,680
Chu Weisheng.

632
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,440
Present.

633
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:00,330
Liu Zhen.

634
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,570
Present.

635
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,330
Wang Dongqiang.

636
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:03,810
Present.

637
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,530
Liu Guanghui.

638
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,200
Present.

639
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,240
Tian Yong'an.

640
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:07,880
Present.

641
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:09,640
Shang Shaozhong.

642
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:10,400
Present.

643
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:15,570
Don't be discouraged

644
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:16,640
if you didn't get the certificate.

645
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:19,200
Not all members

646
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:21,720
are needed on the front line.

647
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,610
The rear work

648
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:24,570
is equally important.

649
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,290
Your support is much needed.

650
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:33,850
I can draw pictures
and write stories.

651
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,290
Are you still hiring?

652
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,130
Sure.

653
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,440
You can do propaganda work.

654
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,240
Great.

655
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,480
I'm in the propaganda department, right?

656
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,160
Mr. Luo can work

657
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,130
as our legal adviser.

658
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,240
I announce

659
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,130
that this entrant training project

660
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:55,330
is over.

661
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:56,400
You are dismissed.

662
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,090
Mr. Qingshan.

663
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:06,850
Hey, let me see yours.

664
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,720
I've completed my task.

665
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,440
I didn't expect

666
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,850
you to be

667
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:14,850
the examiner.

668
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:16,240
Where did you get the uniform?

669
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,440
I was the examiner

670
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,530
of the paramedic test

671
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:22,920
for the international rescue team.

672
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,810
No wonder

673
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,530
Yan delegated the task to you.

674
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,680
I see she trusts

675
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:30,090
your expertise very much.

676
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,850
An entrant like Luo Ben

677
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:34,720
is a special case.

678
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:35,720
The fact

679
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:37,050
that he was eliminated

680
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:37,880
at an early stage

681
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,050
can help him grow, I think.

682
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:41,880
You don't

683
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,130
want a self-conceited

684
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,010
member on the team, do you?

685
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:50,160
Mr. Qingshan.

686
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,370
I'll be off

687
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,570
if that's all.

688
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:54,810
Sure. Thank you.

689
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:55,720
Bye.

690
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:09,680
Did you keep any pets before?

691
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:12,770
You have all the necessities.

692
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:16,330
You got these

693
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:17,370
just for Bun-bun?

694
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:22,480
Falcon asked me to look after him,

695
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:24,130
but I have no experience at all.

696
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,850
It's so thoughtful of you.

697
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,570
Guys, I'm off.

698
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,090
OK. Yeah.

699
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:48,680
See you next time.

700
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,370
Mingming, bye.

701
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:57,680
Luo Ben.

702
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,240
I can tell

703
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:04,050
that the training project
means a lot to you.

704
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,920
Or you wouldn't have acted like that.

705
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:07,400
I'm okay.

706
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,880
I don't really

707
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,400
mind the certificate.

708
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:14,050
I only hope

709
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:15,450
that it was a fair test.

710
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:17,800
Good for you.

711
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,050
You have a unique character.

712
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:20,240
I like you.

713
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:22,050
Hey, we can be friends.

714
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,320
Nice knowing you.

715
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:27,570
See you next time.

716
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:41,130
The test is over.

717
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,930
You can go back with your brother.

718
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:45,720
He didn't know you came?

719
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:47,280
Yuan.

720
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,610
Brother.

721
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,490
I'm here to feed Bun-bun.

722
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:04,610
Are you really here to see Bun-bun?

723
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,840
I'm here to see Xiong Fei.

724
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,570
Can't I come to see my friend?

725
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,800
You have shown

726
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,680
him more care than

727
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,840
you do for a normal friend.

728
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:22,450
I know that he saved your life,

729
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:23,680
and I'm grateful for him, too.

730
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:25,130
But you cannot

731
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,050
get too close to him.

732
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,930
I promised Mom and Dad

733
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:28,970
that I'd take good care of you.

734
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:30,610
I can't allow anything
to go wrong in your life.

735
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,800
This isn't what you said in Fengxi.

736
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,640
You said

737
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,610
that once I was out there,

738
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:40,930
you'd let me

739
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:43,360
do whatever I want to do.

740
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:45,360
Yuan.

741
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:47,490
You liar.

742
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:48,360
Yuan, I…

743
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:50,760
Yuan.

744
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,490
Yuan!

745
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,450
Yuan.

746
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:43,280
Get in the car.

747
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,570
I'm sorry.

748
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:50,200
Please accept my apology,

749
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:51,240
okay?

750
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:59,410
Will you continue to control my life?

751
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,320
Let's get in the car.

752
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,360
Come on.

753
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:10,410
All right.

754
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:13,760
If you want to go to the rescue team,
just go.

755
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:15,320
I won't control your life anymore.

756
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:16,320
Is that okay?

757
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:21,680
Promise?

758
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,050
Just get in the car.

759
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,360
Come on.

760
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:33,280
You'll write down what you said.

761
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:36,720
OK, OK.

762
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:39,530
I'll do whatever you say.

763
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:40,720
Happy?

764
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:43,720
All right.

765
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:44,930
Cheer up.

766
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:46,930
Get in the car.

767
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:50,240
Come on.

778
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:55,890
Xiong Fei,

779
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,200
you need to push

780
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:58,930
the following training of the entrants.

781
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:01,240
You shall

782
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,760
make different training programs

783
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,610
for the entrants based
on their characteristics.

784
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:05,570
That's how

785
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:06,890
the training yields

786
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:08,090
the best possible outcomes.

787
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,360
- I need to take this.
- OK.

788
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:16,680
Yan.

789
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:23,530
What?

790
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:28,740
(Linjiang Central Hospital)

791
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,200
You're ill.

792
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,570
Why didn't you tell me?

793
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:51,360
No questions.

794
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,240
I bet Yan told you.

795
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:55,490
If she hadn't told me,

796
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:56,890
you would have continued
to keep it from me.

797
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:00,450
How long has it been?

798
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,890
A bit more than a year.

799
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:09,800
How many missions

800
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,050
did you take on in the past year?

801
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,800
You even went to Fengxi.

802
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,890
Don't be irresponsible for your health.

803
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:17,240
Hey, don't judge me.

804
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,010
Irresponsible?

805
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:20,640
I'm very aware

806
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,160
how ill I am.

807
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,360
It's no big deal.

808
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:24,930
No big deal?

809
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:26,410
You're now a patient.

810
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:27,930
You stay in the hospital
until you get well.

811
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:29,200
You don't do any stuff,

812
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:29,970
and don't worry about any stuff.

813
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,410
I… I don't have to argue with you.

814
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:32,970
I'm getting well, aren't I?

815
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,610
I'll stay in the hospital

816
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:35,720
for a few days,

817
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:37,360
and then I'll return to the team,

818
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:37,970
okay?

819
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:41,530
Who gives you the permission?

820
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:45,610
What do you mean?

821
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:47,410
There's a lot of work that I need

822
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:47,840
to attend to back in the team.

823
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,800
Dapeng has taken
over your responsibility.

824
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:50,760
Who is it again?

825
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,010
Dapeng?

826
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:52,490
Yeah.

827
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:54,240
You don't know

828
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,050
about his bad temper?

829
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,280
You put him in charge of training?

830
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:56,890
He will fight

831
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:58,200
every single one of them.

832
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,570
Gear maintenance.

833
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:01,130
He's too forgetful for it.

834
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,200
It's my order.

835
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:06,610
You…

836
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:10,090
You think I'm useless, right?

837
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:11,130
You want

838
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,760
to kick me out, huh?

839
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,240
Yeah, so?

840
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:19,930
What am I going to do about it?

841
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:23,280
Buddy.

842
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:25,200
Pal.

843
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:25,680
No.

844
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,610
My big brother.

845
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,640
P-Please.

846
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,760
I don't mind even if

847
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,410
you put me in charge of the warehouse.

848
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,360
You know

849
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:35,490
that the rescue team

850
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:36,890
is all I have.

851
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:38,840
Please. Please.

852
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:40,720
We'll make a deal.

853
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,320
What?

854
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,320
No training for you.

855
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:45,090
No rescue mission for you.

856
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:46,280
Can you do that?

857
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,720
I promise I will.

858
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:52,490
And if I ever catch you

859
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:53,360
breaking the deal?

860
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:54,160
