16
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,470
Just get to the point.

17
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:55,440
Ding Dingding.

18
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,130
How much did Mingmei Media pay you?

19
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,080
I will pay you double.

20
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,530
How much?

21
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,000
Ding Dingding.

22
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,410
We met again.

23
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,880
I never expected that.

24
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,650
You are still that straightforward.

25
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:31,600
All right.

26
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,210
Since you're so straightforward,

27
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,720
I'll just get to the point.

28
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:39,280
I know you left Mingmei Media.

29
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:43,160
I'm going to buy out
the rights to Light Chaser Rescue

30
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,760
for double the price.

31
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,320
A smart person doesn't dwell
on past actions.

32
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,250
I haven't forgotten that

33
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,840
you forced me to jump off the building.

34
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,090
To be honest,

35
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,000
that time, you did that by yourself,

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,040
and it had nothing to do with me.

37
00:02:59,130 --> 00:02:59,760
What's more,

38
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,210
I later transferred you

39
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,840
100,000 yuan.

40
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,720
Did you forget?

41
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,090
Alright.

42
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,560
Let's stop talking about the past.

43
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,490
Shall we

44
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,760
disregard previous enmity

45
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,090
and start a new journey together?

46
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:16,840
Mr. Ma.

47
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,760
Let me go.

48
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:19,970
I cannot afford to

49
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,250
accompany you on your journey.

50
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,440
I know

51
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,760
you're still haunted

52
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,250
by what happened before.

53
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:30,930
Well.

54
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,280
This time

55
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,210
you can make any condition.

56
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:35,720
I will ask Mr. Luo

57
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,490
to write them into the contract.

58
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,280
Mr. Luo is your friend.

59
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,720
You should believe him.

60
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,280
Okay.

61
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,410
I, Ma Baoming, solemnly promise that

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,810
as long as you

63
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,370
are willing to sign a contract
with our company,

64
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,040
we will not only

65
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,160
not interfere with your creation,

66
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,440
but also spend a lot of money

67
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,600
to make you

68
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,760
a comic big shot

69
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,210
not second to KK.

70
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,210
What do you think?

71
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,280
Mr. Ma, listen.

72
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:12,690
In fact,

73
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,810
quite a few companies

74
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,280
have come to me now.

75
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,410
Well.

76
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:18,560
I'll go back

77
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,970
and think about it carefully.

78
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,370
And I will let you know

79
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,850
once I make up my mind, okay?

80
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,490
KK

81
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,690
is your idol.

82
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,250
You should cherish this opportunity.

83
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:28,560
Don't.

84
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,850
Ex-idol.

85
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,850
I am not anyone's fan now.

86
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:32,730
I am leaving.

87
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:36,850
Ding Dingding.

88
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,000
Cool.

(Midas Touch Comics)

90
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,000
This...

91
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,000
Zhan Yan.

92
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,610
Zhan Yan, come out.

93
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,520
Make it clear

94
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,640
how did my mom die.

95
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,490
Zhan Yan.

96
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:01,850
Come out, Zhan Yan.

97
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,320
- Zhan Yan.
- Where are you?

98
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:04,560
Zhao Donglei is making trouble again.

99
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,520
Don't disturb the order.

100
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,690
So what?

101
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:07,490
Leave me alone.

102
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:07,810
Get out.

103
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:08,130
Get out.

104
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:08,640
Leave me alone.

105
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,050
Get out.

106
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:09,880
Let me go.

107
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:10,370
Let me go.

108
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:10,690
Get out.

109
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:11,320
Let me go.

110
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,130
Let me go.

111
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,000
What's going on?

112
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,690
Piss off.

113
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:15,730
Here you are.

114
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:16,930
Everyone.

115
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,250
Look.

116
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,250
You made a fake will for my mother

117
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:23,690
while she was delirious.

118
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:24,760
What's your explanation?

119
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,610
Why do you say that will is fake?

120
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,880
When making the will,

121
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,130
Mrs. Qin was conscious.

122
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,130
There is a video

123
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,370
to prove this.

124
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:34,880
On the contrary,

125
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,050
you never came

126
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,130
when your mother was hospitalized.

127
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,370
After she entered ICU,

128
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,200
you sneaked in

129
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,080
under the guise of a visit,

130
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,170
forcibly took her hand

131
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,960
and put her fingerprint on the will.

132
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,690
Am I right?

133
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:53,690
What's wrong with him?

134
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:55,000
He committed high treason.

135
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,290
He needs to be taught a lesson.

136
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,730
If you don't leave,

137
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,930
I'll call the police immediately.

138
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,730
What a bad upbringing.

139
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:04,810
Why did you go?

140
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,320
Don't leave.

141
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,960
Come back.

What are you doing?

150
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,490
Did you collude with the lawyer
to change the will

151
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,690
and give my mom's money

152
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:14,960
to your dad's rescue team?

153

Luo Ben, it's you again.

157
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,640
Why are you everywhere?

158
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,880
Don't mess around, Zhao Donglei.

159
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,250
I'm going to kill you both today.

160
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,520
Don't mess around.

161
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:34,610
Freeze.

What are you doing?

163
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:35,730
Go with us.

164
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:36,730
Let me go.

165
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,130
Let me go.

166
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:38,850
Let's go.

167
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:39,610
You!

168
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,250
I won't let you two go.

169
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,610
Bear this in mind.

170
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,130
Are you okay?

171
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:53,250
It's over.

We all know that

174
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,760
there was a knife attack

175
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,640
(Linjiang Central Hospital)
by a patient's family

00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,370
at the entrance
of the hospital last night.

177
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,760
Fortunately,

178
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,290
Dr. Zhan Yan is fine.

179
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,170
But

180
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,200
this incident

181
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,520
sounded alarm bells for us.

182
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,560
Our hospital

183
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,560
will strengthen security in the future.

184
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:17,880
Take care

185
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,080
of your own safety.

186
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,760
President.

187
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,170
I have something to say.

188
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,690
As far as I know,

189
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:30,850
it was because Dr. Zhan

190
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:31,850
helped the patient in the ICU

191
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:32,520
make a will,

192
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:33,850
which caused the patient's family

193
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:34,730
to be extremely dissatisfied,

194
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,400
so he sought revenge against her.

195
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,280
Regarding this matter,

196
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,570
I prefer the hospital

197
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:41,330
to issue a policy

198
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,450
to let other doctors know

199
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,040
how to deal with similar incidents

200
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,610
in the future.

201
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,760
Yes.

202
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,570
I think a doctor's job

203
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,730
is to cure the sickness
to save the patient.

204
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,280
How can we interfere

205
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,570
with the patients' private affairs?

206
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,210
According to you,

207
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,680
should we be indifferent

208
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,970
to the dying wishes

209
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,490
of the patients?

210
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,280
You shouldn't have

211
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,970
dealt with this on your own.

212
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,610
Is that lawyer

213
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:08,640
your boyfriend?

214
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:09,610
You cannot

215
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,090
make a will for a patient

216
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,090
through this special relationship.

217
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,570
It is normal for her family

218
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:15,610
to suspect you.

219
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,400
I have no guilty conscience at all.

220
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,640
There is a video recorded on site.

221
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:24,370
Xu Zirui was also present.

222
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,000
Yes.

223
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,130
Listen.

224
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,040
Zhan Yan.

225
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,920
We all believe that
you have no selfishness.

226
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:32,610
I also admire your selfless spirit

227
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:33,920
of helping others.

228
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,730
But you have to know

229
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:37,280
what the hospital is.

230
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,610
I reminded you long ago that

231
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,130
as doctors,

232
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:43,570
we should not

233
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:44,680
get too close to the patients

234
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,130
except to cure the sickness
and save the patient.

235
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,880
If all doctors

236
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,730
follow your example,

237
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,090
how will we manage in the future?

238
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,920
You have to think about the safety

239
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,570
of all the doctors in the hospital.

240
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,850
What else do you have to say?

241
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,640
I have something to say.

242
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:08,040
Zhan Yan, the doctor in charge,

243
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,760
is primarily responsible
for the patient's

244
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,570
private discharge from the hospital.

245
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,640
After the patient came back,

246
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:15,210
Zhan Yan intervened in

247
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,280
her family affairs,

248
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,610
causing strong dissatisfaction
among the family.

249
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,370
Her family made trouble
in the hospital,

250
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,160
and even had

251
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,680
a vicious knife attack,

252
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,090
seriously disrupting

253
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:30,520
the normal work of the hospital.

254
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,090
Zhan Yan.

255
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,680
All your work will be suspended

256
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,610
from tomorrow.

257
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,450
Wait for the results
of the hospital's investigation.

258
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,090
That's all for today.

259
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,660
(International Journal
of Laboratory Medicine)

260
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,000
Don't take it seriously.

261
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,490
Just give yourself a break

262
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,520
and some rest.

263
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:53,640
I'm fine.
Don't try to make me feel better.

264
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:55,210
Zhan Yan.

265
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:56,520
I am just suspended,

266
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,370
not fired.

267
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,250
What are you doing?

268
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,160
Dr. Cai went too far.

269
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,090
He embarrassed you

270
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,040
in front of so many people.

271
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,610
Business is business.

272
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:04,210
It's not his fault.

273
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,090
It's just hate from love.

274
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,680
- He's taking the chance to retaliate.
- Ruoxi.

275
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:13,490
Get to work.

276
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,520
I hope this will be over

277
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,280
as soon as possible

278
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,400
and you can come back sooner.

279

(Outpatient)

280
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:38,130
When do you get off work today?

281
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,250
After the surgery.

282
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:41,330
What about you?

283
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,920
I also have to work overtime.

284
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,880
OK, I'll call you

285
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,880
after the surgery.

286
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:46,850
Okay.

287
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,800
What do you want to eat for dinner?

288
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,400
I am not eating.

289
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,160
Why?

290
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,330
I'm suspended.

291
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,520
You are right.

292
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,210
Now the whole hospital knows that

293
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:07,730
I interfered with
the patient's family affairs.

294
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:08,920
But I am the one to blame.

295
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,450
My method is flawed.

296
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,680
Actually I think it's pretty good.

297
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,450
How can you

298
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,640
have time to eat well

299
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,250
if you're not suspended?

300
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:21,040
Let's go.

301
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,970
I will treat you to a big meal.

302
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,040
Happy cooperation.

303
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:38,880
What's this?

304
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,210
Just take a look.

305
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,370
So nice.

306
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,250
Lucky for you.

307
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,090
How is it, Mr. Ma?

308
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:55,640
Am I sincere?

309
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,730
Great.

310
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,400
You can have a collector's edition

311
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,000
of this cave theme

312
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,970
at the reader meeting.

313
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,760
Reader meeting?

314
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,280
Right.

315
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:05,880
We are planning to arrange

316
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,000
a reader meeting

317
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,610
to promote Light Chaser Rescue offline.

318
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:10,210
This is

319
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:12,040
your first public appearance.

320
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,880
It can surely promote
the sale of the comic book.

321
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:16,800
Am I going to be popular?

322
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,210
Of course.

323
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,760
After this reader meeting,

324
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,490
you'll be a rising star

325
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,970
of the comic book industry.

326

327
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,520
will be there

328
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,450
to see your elegant demeanour.

329
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,330
How is it?

330
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,610
Are you excited?

331
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:35,920
Mr. Ma.

332
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:37,280
Happy cooperation.

333
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,130
That's right.

334
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,040

You are about to meet your readers.

Of course.

You were cultivated by me.

341

Of course I am coming.

to change Zhou Mengmeng's image,

00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:26,490
See you there.

351
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:27,400
Bye.

352
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:30,090
By the way,

353
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:30,920
how is

354
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,680
the customer appreciation meeting

355
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,450
arranged?

356
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:33,250
All arranged.

357
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,160
Next Tuesday.

358
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:34,640
Okay.

359
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:37,400
Next Tuesday?

360
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,020
(Law Positive Law Firm)

361
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,640
Take a seat.

362
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,970
I heard that

363
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,370
the rumors in the law firm

364
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:01,570
have affected

365
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:02,760
everyone's enthusiasm recently.

366
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,570
I'm glad you know.

367
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,370
Come back quickly

368
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:07,920
and help me settle their minds.

369
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,210
If it goes on like this,

370
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,880
my law firm will no longer
be able to operate.

371
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,130
I can only find another place

372
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:13,040
to spend the rest of my life.

373
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:15,760
It's not that serious.

374
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:21,850
How about this?

375
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,130
Everyone has been working hard lately.

376
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,040
Let's have dinner tonight.

377
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,130
My treat.

378
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,640
Great.

379
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:29,090
We'll need a big meal.

380
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:29,970
Okay.

381
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:44,090
I forgot to

382
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,210
tell you one thing.

383
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,330
What?

384
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,090
There are other people

385
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,280
eating with us

386
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,370
tonight.

387
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:54,850
Who?

388
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,610
My

389
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:58,970
colleagues.

390
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,090
Colleagues?

391
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,160
All colleagues of the law firm.

392
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:09,210
Are you going to sell me?

393
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,450
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

394
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,280
Why?

395
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,490
Do I need to report

396
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,610
before I take my girlfriend
to see my colleagues?

397
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,040
Alright.

398
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:23,130
I'm telling you the truth.

399
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:26,130
I want you to help me.

400
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:29,040
Lately I've been so busy

401
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,490
training and doing rescues

402
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,280
that I've been estranged
from my colleagues.

403
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,970
I just want to find a reason

404
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:35,970
to make up for it.

405
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,490
I think if I take you there,

406
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:39,760
the atmosphere will be very lively.

407
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,880
Are you so confident in me?

408
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,880
Of course.

409
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:52,250
You're pretty enough.

410
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,920
Focus on driving.

411
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:57,760
You are back.

412
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,280
Aunt, a glass of wine for me.

413
00:16:59,330 --> 00:16:59,760
Okay.

414
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,970
Mom, I am back.

415
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:02,760
I see.

416
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,040
Li Aiqi.

417
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:07,570
Why didn't you tell me before you came?

418
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,520
I asked her to come.

419
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,440
I went to look for you
when I got off work,

420
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,200
but you weren't there.

421
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,400
I thought you left first.

422
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:16,610
Both of you have been
too busy with work

423
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:18,240
during this time.

424
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,570
Especially Aiqi,

425
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,010
who has been very busy.

426
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,200
Hard work for you.

427
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,850
Ma'am, don't say that.

428
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,240
It's my duty.

429
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,880
Don't call me that at home.

430
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,810
Call me aunt.

431
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:28,720
I have long regarded you

432
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,130
as my family.

433
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:32,290
Don't take it seriously.

434
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,640
My mom told everyone that.

435
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:39,770
By the way, Mom,

436
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:40,880
could the appreciation meeting

437
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,720
be rescheduled?

438
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,530
I have something to do that day.

439
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:43,160
What is more important than

440
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,680
the appreciation meeting?

441
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,200
A meeting for a new book

442
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,400
by a good friend of mine.

443
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,290
Sorry,

444
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,010
I didn't know you have something to do
on Tuesday.

445
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,130
But I have

446
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,530
notified the clients.

447
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:55,200
If we temporarily change the time,

448
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:56,770
I'm afraid the customers will mind.

449
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,240
The meeting

450
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,610
starts at ten o'clock in the morning.

451
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,240
I will stagger the time.

452
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,010
The appreciation meeting
is in the afternoon.

453
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:05,850
I'll go over there

454
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,010
as soon as it's over, okay?

455
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,440
The time cannot be changed.

456
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:14,960
Mingming.

457
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,850
You have to take the company
a top priority.

458
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,130
The appreciation meeting
is very important.

459
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:20,960
It's about the future of the company

460
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,200
and if we can keep them.

461
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:24,010
Integrity and punctuality

462
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,370
are also by which clients measure you.

463
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,010
Since Aiqi is here,

464
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,610
let's have dinner together.

465
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:37,160
I've had dinner.

466
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,610
Let's eat together.

467
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,050
It's almost seven o'clock.

468
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:00,050
Mr. Luo has never been late before.

469
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,880
Something's wrong.

470
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:03,440
Is there a traffic jam?

471
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:04,850
Mr. Gao.

472
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:05,770
Could this be

473
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,240
a farewell dinner?

474
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,090
Don't talk nonsense.

475
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,610
There is still a minute left.

476
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,480
No worries.

477
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:12,880
Here comes Mr. Luo.

478
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,330
Something's up.

479
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,240
Luckily I wasn't late.

480
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,240
Today I will

481
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,330
officially introduce

482
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:29,370
my girlfriend to you.

483
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,440
Zhan Yan.

484
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,640
Welcome.

485
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:35,610
Take a seat.

486
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:36,400
Hello, everyone.

487
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:37,050
Take a seat.

488
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:37,770
Luo Ben.

489
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:39,200
You are in love.

490
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,400
What?

491
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,130
Do you want me to be single

492
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:43,160
for the rest of my life?

493
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:45,920
All right.

494
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,530
Now that everyone's here,

495
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:49,010
let's get started.

496
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,570
Okay.

497
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:50,200
Here.

498
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,290
Don't drink wine.

499
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:53,200
Drink some water.

500
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,370
What do you want to eat?

501
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,530
I will order them for you.

502
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,440
No need.

503
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,440
It's okay.

504
00:19:58,610 --> 00:19:58,920
Never mind.

505
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,160
It's great, Mr. Luo.

506
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:02,530
What do you want to eat?

507
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:04,130
We thought you had
no intention of working

508
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:05,370
and were leaving us.

509
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,680
Now it looks like

510
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:07,960
you're in love

511
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,770
and can't get out of it.

512
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:11,770
By the way,

513
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,090
what does Zhan Yan do?

514
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,050
I am a doctor at the central hospital.

515
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,330
- Cool.
- Angel in white.

516
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:19,920
We may trouble you in the future

517
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,290
when we go to the hospital.

518
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:22,400
You'd better not.

519
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,200
Who would always go to the hospital?

520
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,010
Right.

521
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,290
Better not.

522
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,330
Come on. Cheers.

523
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:31,570
Cheers.

524
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:32,610
Welcome, Dr. Zhan.

525
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:33,460
Okay.

526
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,130
Welcome.

527
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,370
Dr. Zhan doesn't have wine.

528
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:36,330
She drinks water.

529
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,330
You protect her so well.

530
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:40,200
Don't you know me?

531
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:41,770
I'm worried that

532
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:43,440
you will suffer when you get married.

533
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,770
I feel like I got the biggest bargain

534
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:46,570
in the world.

535
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,400
Here.

536
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,400
Cheers.

537
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,130
Together.

538
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:54,440
Cheers.

539
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:56,440
Cheers.

540
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:57,370
Cheers.

541
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:18,290
I really welcome your decision

542
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:20,480
to stay in Law Positive.

543
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:24,400
I thought

544
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,960
you would object to my charity work.

545
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,880
I support public welfare

546
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,050
and respect those volunteers.

547
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,720
However, public welfare rescue

548
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:36,200
needs to be done in person,

549
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,920
and it takes a lot of time

550
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,720
and energy.

551
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:40,200
We are not allowed to do so

552
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,090
as lawyers.

553
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:42,850
It's not easy for you

554
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:43,610
to get to where you are today.

555
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:46,050
I feel sorry for you.

556
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:51,720
Every choice in life

557
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:53,770
requires sacrifices

558
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,240
and trade-offs.

559
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,160
My choice to do rescues

560
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,680
may affect my working hours,

561
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,160
but it will also

562
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,330
give me a lot at the same time.

563
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,010
I know

564
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:06,530
what the meaning of giving is,

565
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:09,010
and what is

566
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,130
faith.

567
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,530
You think clearer than me,

568
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,130
and do things more decisively than me.

569
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,720
I am getting old

570
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:20,130
and have too many worries.

571
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:22,610
You also have

572
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,160
your pursuits and responsibilities.

573
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,850
For example,

574
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:27,810
build a first-class law firm.

575
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,290
And

576
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:32,720
move forward with everyone.

577
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:37,640
Thank you.

578
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,090
Gao was angry at that time.

579
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:43,720
What are you talking about?

580
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,130
Let me tell you.

581
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:46,810
He was a hothead

582
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:47,810
when he first came.

583
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,090
He dared to take cases

584
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:49,680
that others dared not.

585
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,440
He even dared to rob my cases.

586
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:53,200
Did he succeed?

587
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:55,130
I let him make it.

588
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,200
If he did it,

589
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,200
and did it well,

590
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,200
that's his ability.

591
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,880
Dr. Zhan, I don't know

592
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,880
what to say now.

593
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,530
You know?

594
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,880
Looks like I am right.

595
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,880
He did get it.

596
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,640
And he did a good job.

597
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:08,880
I wanted to ask...

598
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:09,810
Anything?

599
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:10,810
I wanted to ask you.

600
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:11,370
Drink alone.

601
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:12,770
What's so good

602
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:13,850
about Mr. Luo?

603
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:15,240
Now I see.

604
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,720
Birds of the same kind...

605
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,050
live together.

606
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,200
What a perfect match.

607
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,050
Drink alone.

608
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:21,640
Here.

609
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,530
To Dr. Zhan.

610
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,050
Okay.

611
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:24,570
Welcome.

612
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,570
Gao.

613
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,920
Are you speaking ill about me?

614
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,050
Those spoke ill about you

615
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:35,960
were all rejected

616
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,720
by Dr. Zhan.

617
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,530
All that remains are

618
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,290
envy, jealousy and love.

619
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:40,770
Indeed.

620
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,850
If you are jealous,

621
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,160
it's easy to be solved.

622
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,050
There are many beautiful female

623
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,050
doctors and nurses

624
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:48,810
in Dr. Zhan's hospital.

625
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,770
I'm taking it seriously.

626
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:50,530
Dr. Zhan.

627
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,160
No, angel in white.

628
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,480
My happiness

629
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:55,200
is up to you.

630
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,290
With Mr. Gao's abilities,

631
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:58,370
do you still need
to be introduced a girlfriend?

632
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,720
You can ask Luo Ben about that.

633
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,090
When we get busy at work,

634
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,810
we only know clients

635
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:03,440
and witnesses,

636
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,090
no potential

637
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:05,090
romantic lovers at all.

638
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:07,010
That's right.

639
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,480
So

640
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,680
my social circle is very simple.

641
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:16,010
Mr. Gao, what's your favorite type?

642
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:18,050
Maybe the same style as Dr. Zhan?

643
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,610
What are you thinking about?

644
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,610
No!

645
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,370
She's limited. One of a kind.

646
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,570
Want an imitation version?

647
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:25,850
Well, you'd better

648
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:26,960
introduce me another one.

649
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,810
I am also looking for

650
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:29,090
my one-of-a-kind.

651
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,370
For this,

652
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:32,130
I wanna propose a toast to Dr. Zhan.

653
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:32,530
Okay.

654
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:33,290
No way.

655
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:34,090
All together.

656
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:34,770
Dr. Zhan

657
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:36,130
is going to do surgery.

658
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:37,290
It's a life-and-death matter.

659
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,370
I will drink for her.

660
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,090
No need.

661
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:41,720
He's just a guardian.

662
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,920
Mrs. Rao, please.

663
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:55,810
Mr. Ming.

664
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,370
Here comes the prototype designer

665
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,480
you asked me to find.

666
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,480
Hello, Mr. Ming.

667
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,160
Hello.

668
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:01,050
Please take a seat.

669
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:10,770
Mrs. Rao, right?

670
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,530
I want to customize

671
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:13,720
the prototype of this set of characters.

672
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:17,570
Okay.

673
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,090
But you have to wait for a month.

674
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:20,770
I want it next Tuesday.

675
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,090
I'm afraid I can't make it.

676
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:23,770
By next week

677
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:25,240
I can only do two at most.

678
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:29,290
Yuan, listen.

679
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:30,330
This meeting

680
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,770
is very important to me.

681
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:33,370
You have to

682
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,130
pick the most shining dress

683
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:35,530
for me.

684
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,610
What style do you want?

685
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,330
Don't care about the style.

686
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,570
I'd like it to be breathtaking.

687
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,810
This…

688
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:45,810
It's like a marriage proposal scene.

689
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,370
The color doesn't seem to suit me.

690
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,480
Stop making fun of me.

691
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,770
Choose one for me.

692
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,640
What about this?

693
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,160
When will Xiong Fei

694
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:07,770
propose to you?

695
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,720
This one seems pretty good.

696
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:15,370
Let me check the price.

697
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,290
It doesn't matter
if he doesn't propose,

698
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:19,090
I can propose.

699
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:20,440

Hello, everyone. I'm Ding Dingding.

I think everyone present

759

760
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,440
about how Ms. Ding Dingding

761
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,530
came up with

762
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:24,400
the theme of Light Chaser Rescue,

763
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,050
right?

764
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,370
Yes.

765
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,160
Let me ask you

766
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,130
a question first.

767
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:31,400
Do you like my comic?

768
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,640
Yes!

769
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,240
Thank you.

770
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:35,640
I will talk to you

771
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,810
about the story.

772
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,290
I created this comic

773
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:41,050
based on my real experience.

774
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,850
During Fengxi Earthquake,

775
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,200
I was in the stricken area.

776
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,530
I got to know

777
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:47,130
Light Chaser Rescue.

778
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,480
I never thought about

779
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,010
what I could

780
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:51,850
contribute to this world

781
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,570
before.

782
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:56,290
But

783
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:58,610
they made me realize that

784
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:00,440
my existence also has

785
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,440
a little meaning.

786
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:08,850
And I met a very special person.

787
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,400
He wanted to be helpful,

788
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,570
but regrettably,
he was also chicken-hearted.

789
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:16,130
He had

790
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:17,720
all those disaster relief
supplies delivered

791
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,290
to the stricken areas,

792
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:21,130
but he fainted

793
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:22,570
at the sight of blood.

794
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,130
When someone fell into the water,

795
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,330
he jumped into the river

796
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:27,570
without hesitation.

797
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:30,610
Sometimes, he would make me so angry.

798
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:33,370
But sometimes,

799
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,880
I would be moved by
his sense of justice.

800
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:38,680
Is he Zhou Mengmeng?

801
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:40,370
Did Zhou Mengmeng
tell you how he felt about you?

802
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,200
Did he confess to you?

803
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,880
Would you be together?

804
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,720
Will you be together?

805
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:49,480
Will you?

806

807

00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:40,610
No.

874
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:44,010
You have to teach Zhou Mingming anyway.

875
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:45,640
Wouldn't it be a good idea
to teach a few more people?

876
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,530
I said no.

877
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:53,050
Dr. Zhan.

878
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:54,800
You are good at diving,

879
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,010
know your teammates,

880
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,490
and are always ready to help others.

881
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:58,610
You have participated

882
00:36:58,610 --> 00:36:59,890
in several rescues

883
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:01,610
and cooperated very well with them.

884
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,360
You are the best candidate.

885
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:09,320
Do you think

886
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,840
Qingshan asked me to come to you?

887
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:12,970
Otherwise?

888
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:17,280
Qingshan has something to do

889
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:18,240
and is out of the team.

890
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:19,720
This time,

891
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:22,760
I sincerely ask you

892
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:24,490
as a regular team member

893
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:26,160
and your boyfriend.

894
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:32,800
Dr. Zhan has great love.

895
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,970
How could you

896
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,800
miss this opportunity?

897
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,320
When is Mr. Luo

898
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,720
talking so sweet like this?

899
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,530
I knew you would agree.

900
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:56,010
The diving usually

901
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:57,570
involved in rescue

902
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:58,970
is called scuba diving.

903
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:01,090
In theory, scuba diving

904
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:02,090
doesn't require

905
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:03,320
much swimming skills

906
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,320
because it's based on

907
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,410
equipment.

908
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:07,760
But for today's first class,

909
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,530
I still want to

910
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:10,490
define it as swimming.

911
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:12,720
(Please wear a swimming cap)
Because as soon as you are in the water,

912
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,280
the first thing

913
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,280
you need to do

914
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:17,760
is to overcome your fear of water.

915
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:19,800
So

916
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:21,450
I hope you can treat water

917
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:22,570
as a good friend.

918
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:24,450
Don't always think about

919
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,570
how to conquer it and overcome it,

920
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:30,010
but how to use it.

921
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,280
- Well said.
- Bravo.

922
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:33,970
Chen Xing.

923
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:34,800
Here!

924
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,640
Can you swim?

925
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,200
Yes, coach!

926
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,800
Show us then.

927
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:41,050
No problem.

928
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,360
Wukong.

929
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:42,890
Here.

930
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:43,640
Protect him.

931
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,570
Sure.

932
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:46,760
Get down.

933
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,570
Escort.

934
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:53,720
I am also here

935
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:54,930
to protect you.

936
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:57,020
(I want to be brave enough
to get into the water.)

937
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:57,450
Come on.

938
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:58,180
(Post)

939
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:00,840
Go protect him.

940
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,050
You come here without training.

941
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,130
What do you want?

942
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,450
I dare not get into the water.

943
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:18,200
Are you looking for Zhou Mingming?

944
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:20,530
No.

945
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:24,890
I don't know what
he's been up to lately.

946
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:25,760
He seems to be busy.

947
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:27,410
He missed training

948
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:28,280
several times.

949
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:31,280
Isn't he just

950
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,680
a rich kid doing nothing?

951
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,800
How could he be busy?

952
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:35,890
Sounds like this guy

953
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:37,360
really doesn't deserve to be liked.

954
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:41,160
I don't like him.

955
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,680
Then why are you here?

956
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:46,090
And

957
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,200
you didn't seem to say that

958
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,800
at the reader meeting.

959
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:50,970
Okay.

960
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,760
I used to like him.

961
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,130
But not any longer.

962
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:03,450
Gather!

963
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,970
He doesn't look like a good guy.

964
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:15,450
Does he only

965
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:16,890
serve as a defense attorney
for bad guys?

966
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,450
He's the senior partner
of their law firm.

967
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:21,410
Forget it.

968
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,610
Wait.

969
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:27,090
After a second look,

970
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:29,320
he looks elitist.

971
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,130
Well.

972
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,570
Arrange for us

973
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:35,280
a date sometime.

974
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:41,760
Look.

975
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:43,720
I will be off

976
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,160
next week.

977
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:45,800
Right?

978
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,130
Is that Luo Ben?

979
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:57,130
He is eating with

980
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:57,970
other women.

981
00:40:58,090 --> 00:40:59,680
Hush, it's his assistant.

982
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,360
I know her.

983
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,050
I have read this case.

984
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,970
You have no chance to win.

985
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,530
But Gao Junchi

986
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:07,490
asked me to win this case.

987
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,320
He attached great importance
to this client.

988
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,360
This case

989
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,640
is very controversial.

990
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:12,640
Winning

991
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:14,570
is not necessarily
a good thing for the client.

992
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,530
Losing can help you win people's hearts.

993
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:17,680
But I may not be able to

994
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,680
convince Gao Junchi to accept the loss.

995
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:22,200
You don't have to convince Gao Junchi.

996
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:24,640
Talk to your client.

997
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:29,800
I see.

998
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,840
You always have a clear mind.

999
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,760
You always see things

1000
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,050
more profoundly than others.

1001
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,410
I really admire you.

1002
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:39,530
You have already

1003
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:40,530
left my group.

1004
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:41,320
You don't have to

1005
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,800
flatter me anymore.

1006
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,720
Is it so difficult for you

1007
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,360
to communicate with Gao Junchi now?

1008
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,680
You come to me

1009
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:52,090
with such a simple case.

1010
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,680
Forget it.

1011
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,090
I thought following him

1012
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:56,530
would bring me closer to my goal.

1013
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:57,240
It didn't occur to me that

1014
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,090
he just wanted me

1015
00:41:58,090 --> 00:41:59,320
to be a mere PR.

1016
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:01,680
Maybe I really chose the wrong one.

1017
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:03,450
There is no right or wrong with choices.

1018
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,450
Each path can lead you to develop,

1019
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,200
depending on how you go.

1020
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,240
I believe you can make it.

1021
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,490
Do you trust me that much?

1022
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,050
Hello, sir.

1023
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:15,160
This is your wine.

1024
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:18,890
We didn't order wine.

1025
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,760
This is given to you

1026
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,720
by the lady over there.

1027
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,320
Please tell the lady

1028
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,450
that I thank her

1029
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,970
for the wine.

1030
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:34,840
Okay.

1031
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:38,010
Just a wine?

1032
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:40,320
What else?

1033
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:42,360
Claim sovereignty.

1034
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:43,530
You have to let her know that

1035
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,840
Luo Ben has a girlfriend.

1036
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,010
She should simply

1037
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:47,530
give up.

1038
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,010
Right?

1039
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,280
Let's eat

1040
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:53,680
while it's hot.

1041
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,360
Assistants

1042
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,530
are the biggest potential danger.

1043
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:02,930
You

1044
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:05,050
have to be careful.

1045
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:07,410
Understand?

1046
00:43:30,673 --> 00:43:35,103
