00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,990

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,850
♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

3
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,120
♫  I put out mountain fires  ♫

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,250
♫  and catch the sunset  ♫

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,450
♫  I leave the rhythms of life in my wake  ♫

6
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:35,620
♫  Happiness whispers in my ears  ♫

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,370
♫  Chasing the passion for the future  ♫

8
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:43,520
♫  Like a dream maker  ♫

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,470
♫  Reading the universe and stars  ♫

10
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,620
♫  My existence in the river of time  ♫

11
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,470
♫  With the body temperature of a moment  ♫

12
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:02,170
♫  I'm trying to be the extension of light  ♫

13
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:08,870
♫  If the world grants me a frustrating opening  ♫

14
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:15,520
♫  I'll chase back time like a dark horse  ♫

15
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:22,250
♫  Even though I know the truth, I won't be afraid  ♫

16
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:28,500
 I won't miss the moon because of mediocrity  ♫

17
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,770
♫  I won't lose the light  ♫

18
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:36,020

19
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,080

20
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,790
Who's that?

21
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,900
It's me. Zhou Mingming.

22
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,400
Why didn't you go to bed?

23
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,090
What are you doing?

24
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:00,230
- Are you trying to sneak out? 
 - Of course not!

25
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,760
I just want to call my mom, without waking up my roommates.

26
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,100
Then go ahead! And go to bed quickly.

27
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,660
Don't even try to sneak out.

28
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,500
I know. I'll come back soon.

29
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,130
Hello, Mom.

30
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,860
Mingming, what took you so long to call me?

31
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,890
I was not allowed to use my phone in class.

32
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:32,680
So I turned it to airplane mode.

33
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,650
- Where are you now? 
 - I'm at school.

34
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,820
Didn't Aiqi tell you?

35
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,150
Yes, she did.

36
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:45,930
I'm just curious why you suddenly want to learn business administration.

37
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,000
I want to lend you a hand, Mom.

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,790
 You are not doing it for fun, are you?

39
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,450
Of course not! Your son is mature enough.

40
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:56,490
You know what. The professors here are really strict.

41
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,720
It's good to be strict.

42
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,790
Who is your professor?

43
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:06,610
Professor Zhang Weilin. Vice President of the School of Management.

44
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,680

45
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:18,260
Son, I don't know what to say.

46
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,390
I'm so happy for you. You have grown up.

47
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,700
Mom, I have to go.

48
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,800
Prof. Zhang gave us a lot of assignments today. I have to finish my homework.

49
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,550
Okay. Go ahead.

50
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,770
Bye, Mom!

51
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,300
 Bye.

52
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,250
Why are you eavesdropping on me in the middle of the night?

53
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,230
Keep your voice down.

54
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,020
What are you doing here?

55
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,340
I'm going out for a late-night snack.

56
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,120
- Don't tell Xiong Fei. 
 - Yes, I will.

57
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:52,920
Oh, god. Do you have any humanity?

58
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,050
I won't tell him if you offer me a treat.

59
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:00,800
A rich man asks a poor girl to offer a treat. Is that funny?

60
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,540
Of course, it's funny.

61
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,400
Treat me or not? I'll shout if you refuse.

62
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,890
I mean it.

63
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,100
Do it.

64
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,730
I will do the same.

65
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,260
What are you going to say?

66
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,300
Look. Someone has lied to the team.

67
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:21,160
He didn't get his permission from his parents to take part in rescue training.

68
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,110
He even lied to his mom that he was attending classes at school.

69
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,660
You win. I'll treat you.

70
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,680
That's a good boy.

71
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,360
Let's go.

72
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,040
You'll see, Ding Dingding.

73
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,940
Hurry up.

74
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,010
You did eavesdrop on my phone call.

75
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:01,060
Are you going to the test tomorrow?

76
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,010
I don't seem to get much of a welcome from the team.

77
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:07,530
But I'm sure Fan is looking forward to it.

78
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,780
So do you want me to go back?

79
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,450
I'm looking forward to your grades.

80
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,740
I'm afraid I will let you down.

81
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,530
Maybe I'll get high grades.

82
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,180
All right. Let's see if that miracle will happen.

83
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,050
- See you tomorrow. 
 - See you.

84
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,780
Hello, Yuxiao.

85
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,550
Yan, here's the thing.

86
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,040
I didn't hear that Uncle Fan was sick until I got back to the hospital today.

87
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,630
Don't worry.

88
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:53,210
I've got him in the ICU.

89
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:57,390
You just need to take care of Uncle Fan for the next two days.

90
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:02,750
But I'm going back to the team tomorrow for my final assessment.

91
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,980
I know you and Uncle Fan are very close.

92
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,200
I'm afraid you have no mind to do anything else,

93
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,720
if you don't accompany him at this time.

94
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,120
 How about this?

95
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,210
I'll go to the rescue team instead of you tomorrow.

96
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,050
Okay.

97
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,990
That would be very kind of you.

98
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,020
Don't mention it.

99
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,360
Rest early.

100
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,840
Bye.

101
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,230
What's wrong?

102
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,090

103
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,720
That's weird.

104
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,970
- Ding dingding. 
 - Ding dingding.

105
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,850
Are you in there?

106
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,620
We'll withdraw the curtains.

107
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:39,960
Why are you in such a hurry? You can't waste my treat like that.

108
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,160
The later, the more dangerous.

109
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,840
Such a coward.

110
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,840
You're not a coward. Continue your eating, and don't come with me.

111
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,060
I'm afraid that it wouldn't be safe for you to walk alone at night.

112
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,070
What you are afraid of is being caught by Xiong Fei.

113
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:57,060
Afraid? I even don't know how to spell this word!

114
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,280
What's wrong?

115
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:05,080
Did you hear anything strange?

116
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,410
Are you a seven-year-old boy?

117
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,990
I thought it was funny.

118
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:37,000
Wait. There is indeed something strange.

119
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,720
Don't fool me.

120
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,260
I didn't. It's true.

121
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,770
Lie. Keep lying.

122
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,790
Don't move.

123
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,490
Maybe it's a snake.

124
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,960
If it's a snake, the more you move, the more it attacks you.

125
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,750
What should we do now?

126
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,520
Don't move.

127
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,550
Be careful.

128
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:12,770
Take it slow. Come back a little.

129
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,290
Slow down.

130
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,600
What's that?

131
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,540
Well, it looks like a big rabbit. A big rabbit?

132
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,740
Are you sure? A rabbit?

133
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,360
Yes, it's a rabbit. A rabbit.

134
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,980
- Really? 
 - A rabbit. I'm sure.

135
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,080
- Is it gone? 
 - I... I think so.

136
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,590
Well.

137
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:55,620
Why is there a rabbit in the middle of the night?

138
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,810
It's too scary.

139
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:58,920
Yeah. How can a rabbit get that big?

140
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,050
That's right. So annoying.

141
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:06,090
It's getting late. Let's go.

142
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:08,600
Just in case there's real danger.

143
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,360
Okay. Walk slowly. You go first.

144
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,980
Okay.

145
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:35,120
♫  Everyone has his own story  ♫

146
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:41,880
♫  We are all chasing a better life  ♫

147
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:46,960
♫  Time slows down as you pass by  ♫

148
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:51,680
♫  I'm longing to see you again  ♫

149
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,360
 Oh, it's so cute!

150
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,240
 It's Falcon's dog, named Doubao.

151
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,420
 The name is cute, too! I want to see it tomorrow.

152
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,060
 The test is tomorrow.

153
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,190
 Good luck to your brother.

154
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:17,160
 What are you looking at with such a weird smile?

155
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,710
Business E-mail.

156
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,560
What about you?

157
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,360
What are you doing there?

158
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,680
Stop watching the TV series.

159
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,690
Go to sleep. Now!

160
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,160
Go!

161
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,210
Hurry up!

162
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,760
Finally, we come back.

163
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,880
Keep today a secret, especially that I was scared by a rabbit.

164
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,570
It's you who should keep your mouth shut. I'm not a big mouth.

165
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,750
Anyway, only pigs will give this away.

166
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,860
I think I've eaten too much.

167
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,500
Oh, no.

168
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,960

169
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,810
Quite skilled, huh?

170
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:43,770
Looks like you are familiar with writing pledges.

171
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:46,270
You're not bad, having written so many words.

172
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:50,400
411. 412. 413. 414.

173
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,850
- 414. 
 - Enough?

174
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,490
No.

175
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,010
Let's refer to each other's content. Okay?

176
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,540
If we exchange apples, each of us still has one apple.

177
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,540
But if we exchange ideas, each of us can get two ideas.

178
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,270
What do you think?

179
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,760
Fine.

180
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,600
Ding Dingding, you can't frame me like this.

181
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,300
You're the one who made the proposal.

182
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,960
How could you write that you were tempted by me.

183
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,700
Who offered the treat? And who paid the money?

184
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,160
Why don't you mention who came up with the idea and who led the way?

185
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,350
Is it meaningful to keep quibbling with me?

186
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,660
Yes, it is.

187
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,440
Thank god. My crime is heavily aggravated in your writing.

188
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,790
I paid the money and I have to take responsibility.

189
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,130
Why?

190
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,460
Correct it quickly. Now!

191
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,420
No, I won't change it.

192
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,040
- Say it again? 
 - I said no.

193
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,960
Then I will change mine.

194
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,660
- Give me. 
 - No, you can't.

195
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,860
- Give it to me. 
 - No. Stop.

196
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,480
- Give me. Give me. 
 - It would be my fault if you change it.

197
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,570
- Give me. 
 - Why are you so mean?

198
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,920
What are you? A dog?

199
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:03,310
I guess I got here at a bad time.

200
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,490
No. Not at all.

201
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,540
What are you doing?

202
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,650
Writing the pledge.

203
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,720
By hugging each other?

204
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,040
What time is it? Are you going to sleep or not?

205
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,070
We're done. We're done.

206
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:25,640
If it happens again, you two will both be expelled.

207
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,360
Understand?

208
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,170
Now go to sleep!

209
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,560
How's the preparation going?

210
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,620
Quite well, Captain.

211
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,840
Captain.

212
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,970
- Captain. 
 - Luo Ben.

213
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:08,680
Are you getting used to the intense training?

214
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,470
Yes, I have.

215
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,480
Good.

216
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,020
Mr. Luo can get used to it.

217
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:17,180
But I don't know if the members can get used to Mr. Luo.

218
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:20,640
There are some overtones in your words, Dr. Cai.

219
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,990
Captain Qingshan.

220
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:26,690
To be honest, I'm a little nervous about being Mr. Luo's assessment officer today.

221
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:31,860
I heard from the team members that you got into a fight with the coach yesterday and almost quit.

222
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,090
Mr. Luo,

223
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:38,000
you can't just walk away when being criticized like you did yesterday.

224
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,990
Don't worry, Dr. Cai.

225
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:43,440
As long as you are fair,

226
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,560
if it's my problem, I will take the criticism modestly.

227
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,860
That's right.

228
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,610
I want to tell you one more thing.

229
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:52,170
As a qualified rescuer,

230
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:55,580
mental endurance capacity is also crucial.

231
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,520
Good luck.

232
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,980
I'll definitely live up to your expectations.

233
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:01,960
- Okay. 
 - Good.

234
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,590
The test shall begin.

235
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,060
Okay.

236
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,140
Today, Commander Xiong Fei is not here.

237
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:31,220
I'll take the place of presiding over today's assessment.

238
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:35,500
I hope everyone can cheer up to be in the best condition

239
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,610
and come out with the best results.

240
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:39,760
- Can you do that? 
  - Yes, sir.

241
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,840
Good. Task description.

242
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,190
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck a certain area.

243
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:49,730
The rescue team rushed to the scene to search for lives.

244
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:55,180
Members are required to find survivors without any equipment in the shortest time.

245
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,650
 Yes, sir.

246
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,290
Hello?

247
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:09,350
Hello?

248
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:11,270
Is anybody there?

249
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:14,050
- Hello? 
 - Is anybody there?

250
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:21,200
- Hello? 
 - Hello?

251
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,350
Is anybody there?

252
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,530
- Hello? 
 - Hello?

253
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:43,920
Is anybody there?

254
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,360
It's an aftershock.

255
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,700
There's somebody here. Help.

256
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,640
Quickly.

257
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:07,920

258
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,900
Seismic search module.

259
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,220
The first group scores.

260
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,740
Luo Ben. Nine points.

261
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,570
Zhou Mingming. Six points.

262
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:22,820
Ding dingding. Chu Weisheng. Liu Zhen.

263
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,360
Zero points.

264
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,510
The captain will give comments.

265
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,090
Let me see it.

266
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,800
Before my comments,

267
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,520
I want to ask Luo Ben.

268
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:44,670
Why didn't you enter the scene the moment you got the assignment?

269
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:47,370
Because after an earthquake, there are usually aftershocks.

270
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:50,330
We must first make sure that the structure of the damaged area is stable,

271
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:53,290
so as not to put ourselves in a dangerous situation.

272
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,350
Zhou Mingming. Knowing there would be aftershocks,

273
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,300
you still carried out the rescue.

274
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,990
Why?

275
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,360
Yes, captain.

276
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,820
Do you want to hear the truth or lie?

277
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,560
Truth.

278
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:20,930
The truth is since I'm here, I don't want to be a coward.

279
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:27,040
I'm surprised to hear that.

280
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,590
Since you know there will be aftershocks,

281
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:32,910
you should not venture in.

282
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:36,400
But you did get people out before the cave-in.

283
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,020
So, I'll let you pass.

284
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:43,680
Lucky dog.

285
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,600
Can't you be lucky?

286
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,850
Ding Dingding, Chu Weisheng, and Liu Zhen.

287
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:54,770
You guys make some comments on your performance today.

288
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,330
Commander,

289
00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:00,620
we carried out the task in strict accordance with the operating procedures taught by our commanders.

290
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:06,300
So I don't understand why we got zero points even though we found and rescued the target.

291
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:14,270
I think you all have this question in mind.

292
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:16,150
Dear members,

293
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,150
through the on-site assessment,

294
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:24,110
today's session is to emphasize a core aspect to you all.

295
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,430
That's self-protection.

296
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:28,230
It is very important and critical.

297
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:31,060
You must keep that in mind.

298
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,450
As a rescuer,

299
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:38,510
we must protect ourselves before helping and rescuing others.

300
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:42,740
So when you get to the mission site, the first thing is not to save people,

301
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:48,070
but to observe and determine in time whether your environment is safe or not.

302
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:53,360
Ding Dingding and your group members have mastered the searching skills.

303
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,950
The operation process is also very standard.

304
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,960
But you neglected your own safety.

305
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,770
In this way, you can't save anyone,

306
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:01,810
and you will also put yourself in danger.

307
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:04,340
So you have no scores.

308
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,950
Do you understand?

309
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,540
 Understood!

310
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,040
Captain, I have one more request.

311
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,030
You have a lot of requests. Say it.

312
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,560
Our instructor did not tell us anything about self-protection.

313
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,900
The aim of today's test is to train us.

314
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:26,220
Our group sacrificed ourselves to help another group win.

315
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,810
Our efforts should be recognized.

316
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:31,580
So I request to retake the test.

317
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,230
For Ding Dingding's request,

318
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:44,160
I think we all have our own answers in mind.

319
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,950
And my answer is you only live once.

320
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,940
Copy that.

321
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,500
Peng. Continue.

322
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,000

323
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,200
Task description.

324
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,400
There is a serious accident on the highway.

325
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,700
15 people are injured.

326
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,500
4 of them are in serious condition.

327
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,500
The rescue team is ordered to get to the scene.

328
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:45,200
Team members are required to carry out first-aid treatment for the wounded

329
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,700
to get more time for medical treatment.

330
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,800
You should work in pairs.

331
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,200
The first group. Luo Ben, Chen Xing.

332
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,500
The second group. Ding Dingding, Zhou Mingming.

333
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,800
The third group. Chu Weisheng, Liu Zhen.

334
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,900
The fourth group. Zhao Minghua, Wang Dongqiang.

335
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:05,800
The fifth group. Liu Guanghui, Li Ming.

336
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,900
Execute.

337
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,400
Yes, sir!

338
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,300
Here.

339
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,200
What's this?

340
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,000
I understand.

341
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,200
How are you feeling?

342
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,800
Are you injured?

343
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,800
My left calf is distended and painful.

344
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,600
I can't move it.

345
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,700
Fix it with a bandage.

346
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,400
It's a dummy. We can't ask about the injuries.

347
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,100
What should we do?

348
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,200
The rescue manual is rigid. The reality is unpredictable.

349
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,600
We should rely more on our experience to make decisions.

350
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,000
The wounds are on the head.

351
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
It looks like a laceration to the scalp,

352
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,700
but in severe cases, it could be accompanied by craniocerebral injury.

353
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,300
We should try to be considerate, and treat the injured on a worst-case basis.

354
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,700
Okay.

355
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,000
Ms. Luo.

356
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,400
Be careful.

357
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,900
It has a bad temper. It won't let any strangers touch it.

358
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,500
What's wrong today?

359
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,600
When do you become so obedient?

360
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,000
You are not going to work today?

361
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,900
On-shift?

362
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,900
I know that gesture.

363
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,600
The same gesture is used for the substitution of basketball players.

364
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,500
 You guess what I want to say.

365
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,800
Dog?

366
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
What?

367
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,800
What is crawling?

368
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,600
Wings?

369
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,100
Crawllng?

370
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,800
Angel?

371
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,400
I don't know.

372
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,400
 Bear. (The same pronunciation as Xiong)

373
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,100
 Fly. (The same pronunciation as Fei)

374
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,600
In this simulation examination of a highway traffic accident for the Light Chaser Rescue Team,

375
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,200
only one group does not reach the standard.

376
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
That is group one. Luo Ben and Chen Xing.

377
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,600
May I ask which part is not qualified?

378
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,300
Your group is dealing with the seriously injured.

379
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:08,500
Before rescue, you must inquire about the wounded

380
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:12,300
to determine if he's conscious or not.

381
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,200
Are you serious?

382
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,600
That's a dummy.

383
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,500
Could he give me any answer?

384
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,700
That's right.

385
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,300
Of course, he will.

386
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:24,600
As long as you inquire, he will answer.

387
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:29,800
Next to each of the seriously injured was a voice intercom.

388
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:36,500
Every word you said was transmitted through this device into my headphones.

389
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,900
I've heard the inquiry from nearly every group.

390
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:44,000
It's a pity that I didn't hear from you.

391
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,900
Dr. Cai.

392
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:50,500
There was only a dummy at the scene without any device.

393
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,200
The rescue manual is rigid.

394
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,400
The reality is unpredictable.

395
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,500
It all depends on individual experience and judgment.

396
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,900
It...

397
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,400
It is what Luo Ben told me just now.

398
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,800
I could hear every word you said.

399
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:03,000
Unfortunately, I waited for a long time but didn't hear your inquiry.

400
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,400
So I can't let you pass.

401
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,900
Dr. Cai.

402
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,100
You must be taking this personally.

403
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,800
I can't help it if you feel that way.

404
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,200
I will only grade strictly according to the assessment criteria.

405
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,300
I warned you before the test.

406
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:27,300
A qualified rescue team member should have a strong mind.

407
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,800
I'm sorry.

408
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,400
I've already got my EMT certification.

409
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:35,100
I don't need your grades to prove my ability.

410
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:53,300
Next, the certificate will be issued to the qualified personnel.

411
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,900
- Zhou Mingming. 
 - Yes.

412
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,600
- Chu Weisheng. 
 - Yes.

413
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,200
- Liu Zhen. 
 - Yes.

414
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,200
- Wang Dongqiang. 
 - Yes.

415
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,100
- Liu Guanghui. 
 - Yes.

416
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,400
- Tian Yong'an. 
 - Yes.

417
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,100
- Shang Shaozhong. 
 - Yes.

418
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:17,500
If you didn't get the certificate, don't be discouraged.

419
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:22,400
To do charity relief, we don't always have to go to the front line.

420
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:28,000
The logistics are also important, which need your full support.

421
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,800
I can draw and write stories.

422
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,000
Are you still short of people?

423
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,300
Of course.

424
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:42,200
Please help us do publicity.

425
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,400
That's great. Then I'm one of the PR Department.

426
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,900
Mr. Luo could be our legal counsel.

427
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:55,600
I declare an end to this new recruit training program.

428
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,400
Dismiss.

429
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,500
- Uncle Qingshan. 
  - Let me see yours.

430
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,400
I've finished my job today.

431
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,000
I didn't expect you to be the examiner today.

432
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,900
Your suit is...

433
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:22,800
I once served as an examiner for the International Rescue Team.

434
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,600
I see.

435
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,100
Since Yan asked you to do this job for her,

436
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:30,800
she is absolutely assured of your professional ability.

437
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,800
After all, few rookies are like Luo Ben.

438
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,300
Today, I knocked him out in the early stages.

439
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,700
I think this can benefit him.

440
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:45,900
You also don't want a headstrong member on your team. Right?

441
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,300
Uncle Qingshan, I'm leaving if there's nothing else.

442
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,000
Thanks for your hard work. Goodbye.

443
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,500
Goodbye.

444
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,400
Have you ever had a pet before?

445
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,600
You're so well-prepared.

446
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,200
Did you specially prepare these for Doubao?

447
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,600
Falcon asked me to take care of it.

448
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,400
But I don't have much experience.

449
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,700
You are so considerate.

450
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,000
- Hey guys, I have to go. 
 - Okay.

451
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,600
- See you next time. 
 - Bye, Mingming.

452
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,600
Luo Ben.

453
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,400
I can see that you really care about this training.

454
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,300
Otherwise, you wouldn't be like this.

455
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,000
I'm fine.

456
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,100
Actually, it doesn't matter to me whether I get the certificate or not.

457
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:16,200
I just want to be treated fairly.

458
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,400
Cool. You're a man of character.

459
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,600
I like it.

460
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,700
Let's be friends.

461
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,800
Nice to meet you.

462
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,600
See you next time.

463
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,300
The test is over.

464
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,700
You can go back with your brother.

465
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,400
He doesn't know you're here?

466
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,000
Yuan Yuan.

467
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,300
 Ben, I brought some food here for Doubao.

468
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,400
Are you really here for Doubao?

469
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,900
 I'm here for my friend, Xiong Fei.

470
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,500
 What's wrong with that?

471
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,000
Your care for him is too much for a friend.

472
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,800
I know he saved your life. I'm grateful to him, too.

473
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,600
But you can't get too close to him.

474
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,800
I promised Mom and Dad to take good care of you.

475
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,300
I can't let you make any mistakes.

476
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,700
 That's not what you said in Fengxi.

477
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:41,400
 You said that as soon as I got out of there you would promise me everything,

478
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,400
 and I could do whatever I want.

479
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,300
Yuan Yuan.

480
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,400
 You lied.

481
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,000
Yuan Yuan, I...

482
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,400
Yuan Yuan!

483
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,200
Yuan Yuan!

484
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,400
Yuan Yuan.

485
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,200
Get in the car.

486
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,000
It's my fault.

487
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,800
I apologize. Okay?

488
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,100
 Then you can't limit me anymore.

489
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,700
Get in the car, okay?

490
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,300
Let's go.

491
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,100
Fine.

492
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,000
If you want to go to the team, then go.

493
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,100
I won't limit you. Okay?

494
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,300
 Is that a promise?

495
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,800
Get in the car first.

496
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,300
Let's go.

497
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,900
 Write down what you said.

498
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,200
All right.

499
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,400
I'll do whatever you want. Okay?

500
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Now. Stop crying.

501
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,600
Get in the car. Okay?

502
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,100
Let's go.

503
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,500
Here.

504
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:51,300
 ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

505
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,900
 ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

506
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:21,510

507
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:29,580

508
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,800

509
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,800

510
00:39:55,300 --> 00:40:00,200
Xiong Fei, the follow-up training plan for new members should be hurried.

511
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:04,800
For different members, we should make corresponding training programs.

512
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,600
Only in this way can we achieve the best results in the shortest time.

513
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,600
- Excuse me. 
 - Okay.

514
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,600
Yan.

515
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,100
What?

516
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:28,900

517
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,800
You're ill. Why didn't you tell me?

518
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,600
I know it.

519
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,700
It must be Yan who told you.

520
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:58,000
If it wasn't her, did you want to hide it from me forever?

521
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,100
How long?

522
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,500
Just a little over a year.

523
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,500
How many assignments have you participated during this time?

524
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,000
You even went to Fengqi.

525
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,900
Don't be irresponsible with yourself.

526
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,500
Don't exaggerate it.

527
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,300
What do you mean by irresponsible?

528
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:22,000
I know my body quite well.

529
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,400
It's not a big deal.

530
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,100
How can you say it's not a big deal. You're ill after all.

531
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,000
You should take good care of your body.

532
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,100
Don't do anything, and don't think about anything.

533
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:33,200
I... I don't want to argue with you. I am resting now.

534
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:37,300
I'll just rest here for a few days, and then I'll be back.

535
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,800
Okay?

536
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,400
Who said you could go back to the team?

537
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,300
What do you mean?

538
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,700
I got a lot of work to do with the team.

539
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,900
Your work was taken over by Peng.

540
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:53,000
- By whom? Peng? 
 - Yes.

541
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,200
Don't you know his bad temper?

542
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,500
For training, he may fight with members in a few days.

543
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,100
For equipment maintenance, he may miss this and that.

544
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,000
I've settled my mind.

545
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,500
You old boy.

546
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,200
Do you think I'm useless now?

547
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,200
So you're going to kick me out of the way, is that it?

548
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,400
- Yes. 
 -  So what?

549
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,600
No what.

550
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,800
Brother.

551
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,200
My dear brother. No. My dearest brother.

552
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,600
I... I beg you.

553
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,600
I'll be satisfied if only I can manage the warehouse.

554
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,400
You know me.

555
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,700
Except for the rescue team, I have nothing to do.

556
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,900
I beg you. Please.

557
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:41,600
- Then I have one condition. 
 - What is it?

558
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,000
You can't participate in any training, as well as rescue activities.

559
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Can you promise that?

560
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,500
I promise.

561
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,200
If I find out you broke your promise...

562
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,100
Then I'll become Doubao.

563
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,500
You're like Doubao indeed.

564
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:22,000

565
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:32,000
♫  At first, there was no sadness in the world  ♫

566
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:39,300
♫ Until luck came and crossed the stage  ♫

567
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:46,900
♫  At first, souls were confused and wandered  ♫

568
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:54,100
♫  Until people hugged each other  ♫

569
00:43:54,100 --> 00:44:02,100
♫  I've been on the road  ♫

570
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:09,900
♫  Trying to connect laughter and tears  ♫

571
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:17,300
♫  I suddenly have faith  ♫

572
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:24,600
♫  I can walk by millions of shining household lights  ♫

573
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:33,400
♫  I hope I can admire flowers in the afterglow  ♫

574
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:39,600
♫  Shed tears and hope that you are well  ♫

575
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:48,300
♫  The good times I'm pursuing belong to the light  ♫

576
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:55,900
♫  It can light up the wounds that follow  ♫

577
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:59,700
♫  Catching the floating stars  ♫

578
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:03,500
♫  Watching as the memories flash by  ♫

579
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:07,200
♫  Traveling through market scenes  ♫

580
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,900
♫  With a fiery gaze  ♫

581
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:14,600
♫  I can't fly  ♫

582
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:18,300
♫  But I can look up  ♫

583
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:25,700
♫  I'm always on the road chasing the light  ♫
