00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,200

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,800
♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,100
♫  I put out mountain fires  ♫

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,700
♫  and catch the sunset  ♫

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,400
♫  I leave the rhythms of life in my wake  ♫

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:36,800
♫  Happiness whispers in my ears  ♫

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,400
♫  Chasing the passion for the future  ♫

8
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,400
♫  Like a dream maker  ♫

9
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:48,700
♫  Reading the universe and stars  ♫

10
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,600
♫  My existence in the river of time  ♫

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,600
♫  With the body temperature of a moment  ♫

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:02,200
♫  I'm trying to be the extension of light  ♫

13
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:08,900
♫  If the world grants me a frustrating opening  ♫

14
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:15,600
♫  I'll chase back time like a dark horse  ♫

15
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:22,200
♫  Even though I know the truth, I won't be afraid  ♫

16
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,300
♫  I won't miss the moon because of mediocrity  ♫

17
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,700
♫  I won't lose the light  ♫

18
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,900

19
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,400

20
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,100
Save her... Hurry... Zhan Yan!

21
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,700
 Dr. Zhan!

22
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,600
 Zhan Yan!

23
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,200
 Zhan Yan!

24
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,100
 Zhan Yan!

25
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,000
 Are you here?

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,200
Xiong Fei!

27
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,100
We found her!

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,600
Captain Xiong Fei, we can't go any further!

29
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,800
The storm is coming!

30
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,800
Don't you fear death?

31
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,200
Yes, we do.

32
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,100
We all fear it.

33
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,500
But our teammates are still waiting for us.

34
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,700
We're family.

35
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:53,200
Would you leave if your family members were here?

36
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,500
Accompanying us is not your duty.

37
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,700
You can go back first.

38
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,900
Let's go.

39
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,400

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,200
Wait for me!

41
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,900
I'll risk my life for you.

42
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,800
Without me, you will definitely be gone for far too long.

43
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,200
Follow me, buddies.

44
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,100
Thank you.

45
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,000
Come with me!

46
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,200
Be careful!

47
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,400
Are you okay?

48
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,200
- Go ahead. 
 - Okay.

49
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,900
- Is the cord ready? 
 - Soon!

50
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,100
The snowstorm is so heavy!

51
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,600
It's so dangerous to move on.

52
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,700
We'd better dodge for a while.

53
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,700
If we don't find her now, she'll be in great peril.

54
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,700
Uncle Laudun, bring them to a safe place first.

55
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,300
I will.

56
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,800
- Luo Ben. 
 - Hang in there, Zhan Yan!

57
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,400
Take care, Luo Ben.

58
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,400
Is it ready?

59
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,600
- Luo Ben, the cord is ready. 
 - Okay.

60
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,600
Be cautious, Luo Ben!

61
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,500
Zhan Yan! Zhan Yan!

62
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,000
Wake up!

63
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,400
I'm Luo Ben!

64
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,600
I'll bring you out!

65
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,000
Come on.

66
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,400
How do you feel now?

67
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,600
- Luo Ben... 
 - I'm here.

68
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,600
Am I daydreaming?

69
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,600
No, you're not.

70
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,800
It's me.

71
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,900
Luo Ben is here.

72
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,600
Hold on!

73
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,280
Come on.

74
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,700
Have some hot water first.

75
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,400
Take it easy.

76
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,200
How are you now?

77
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,600
Do you feel better?

78
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,700
I thought I wouldn't be able to see you again.

79
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,300
No way.

80
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,600
I'll bring you out at once.

81
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,100
Captain Qingshan...

82
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,800
He's waiting for you at home!

83
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,400
Zhan Yan!

84
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,200
Zhan Yan, don't sleep!

85
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,700
Zhan Yan! Wake up!

86
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,300
Zhan Yan!

87
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,600
Do you know?

88
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:25,300
I've called you several times since you left.

89
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,900
But you didn't answer my calls.

90
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,400
I wanted to tell you that...

91
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,800
that I've always cared about what happened in the past.

92
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:41,300
But in fact, what I care about most is you, Zhan Yan.

93
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,200
I can't lose you.

94
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,500
Hang in there.

95
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,300
I'm now bringing you home.

96
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,000
Just hold on.

97
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,500
Watch out!

98
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,700
How are you?

99
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,800
Are you okay?

100
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,700
Come on!

101
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,200
Keep it up!

102
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,100
Keep it up!

103
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,200
She's almost there!

104
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,300
Slow down.

105
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,000
Be careful!

106
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,600
Are you okay?

107
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,200
- Yes... 
 - Fine, let's go.

108
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,100
 Luo Ben!

109
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,100
 Are you okay?

110
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,200
 Yes, I'm fine!

111
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,400
 We're pulling you up!

112
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,000
Okay.

113
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm ready!

114
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,000
Danger! Backward!

115
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,200
- How is she? 
 - Be at ease.

116
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,800
The operation was a success.

117
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,000
Get some rest first. She'll come out soon.

118
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Thank you, doctor!

119
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,200
It's so great!

120
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:10,800
I've just heard from the team that Dapeng is now in the hospital.

121
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,200
Take it easy. He'll be fine.

122
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,900
Thank you.

123
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,200
Let's go back first.

124
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,700
Zhan Yan, it'll be okay.

125
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,400
They've gone to save him.

126
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,400
He'll be fine.

127
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,400
You have to save your strength now.

128
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,200
I'll deal with your wound later.

129
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,100
Otherwise, you'll suffer from frostbite.

130
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
- Luo Ben!  
 - Luo Ben!

131
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,500
Luo Ben!

132
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,400
- Luo Ben! 
 - Luo Ben!

133
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,300
Luo Ben! Can you hear me?

134
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,000
Luo Ben!

135
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,400
He should be under the ice.

136
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,500
Xiong Fei, it's useless. We can't break it.

137
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,900
I have to bring him back!

138
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,700
Calm down, Xiong Fei!

139
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,500
- Xiong Fei! 
 - How do you know if you don't try?

140
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,100
There must be another way!

141
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,700
Xiong Fei! Do you think I don't want to save him?

142
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,600
But the ice layer is too thick! We can't break it up!

143
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,600
Xiong Fei!

144
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,400
Step aside!

145
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:15,100
Xiong Fei! As he's in danger, you should make a decision yourself!

146
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:11,640

147
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,800
Xiong Fei, have you found them?

148
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,200
Yes.

149
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,700
Both Dapeng and Zhan Yan are safe now.

150
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,600
Great! You've worked hard.

151
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,200
Xiong Fei, be cautious on the way back.

152
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,300
 Captain...

153
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,900
 Luo Ben...

154
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,700
What's going on?

155
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:49,500
He's saved Zhan Yan but he's still there.

156
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,200
You...

157
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,200
 He's in a deeper place.

158
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,800
The cave is frozen.

159
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,800
It's all my fault.

160
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,000
I didn't protect them.

161
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,300
Xiong Fei, it's not the time for self-examination.

162
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,860
As Luo Ben is in the ice crack,

163
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,100
 you need to think of a way.

164
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,600
Dad.

165
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,000
Yan.

166
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,100
Listen to Xiong Fei.

167
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,000
Crying is useless now.

168
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,400
Just tell me his chance of survival.

169
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,200
Yan.

170
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,600
The chances of surviving falling into an ice crevasse are really low,

171
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,600
but it's not impossible to survive.

172
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,100
 Judging from the time of the fall just now,

173
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,700
 I should be below the snow line.

174
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,000
 Most likely connected to a subsurface stream.

175
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,300
 As long as there is a way, there is hope to get out.

176
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,400
He is down there.

177
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,800
There must be a way to bring him back.

178
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,200
I don't think this is very likely.

179
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,900
Because the ice crack has been completely blocked.

180
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,700
This time he really fell into the gate of hell.

181
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,500
Impossible.

182
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,000
There must be another way.

183
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Even if you can save him,

184
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,600
it'll be hard for him to survive.

185
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,000
He sacrificed himself to save another,

186
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,700
and from so high.

187
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:17,500
One for another. It should be an honor.

188
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,800
I won't leave him here.

189
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,600
Even if he's dead,

190
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,700
we'll bring him back.

191
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,200
 Yan.

192
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,700
 A UK mountaineer met with a mishap in the Andes.

193
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,000
 He fell into an ice crack, too.

194
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,400
 But he didn't give up.

195
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,600
 He stayed there for 168 hours

196
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,300
 and he hung on for 168 hours.

197
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,200
 He was finally able to climb out of the ice crack and get back to the camp.

198
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,200
 Of course.

199
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,200
 It's a miracle of mankind.

200
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,100
Yan, do you have any news?

201
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,490
Dad, what are those tiny curves on the map?

202
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,100
Let me see.

203
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,200
They should be rivers.

204
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,000
Rivers?

205
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,600
 Yes.

206
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,600
 As the snows melts,

207
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,400
they'll converge into rivers, becoming the fountainheads of big rivers.

208
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,900
Yan, there should be subsurface streams under ice cracks.

209
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,800
What are you thinking of, Dad?

210
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,800
We're finding other ways above the crack,

211
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,200
hoping that he could climb up from there.

212
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,500
But is it possible that he would choose to go down?

213
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,400
Down?

214
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,800
As long as he finds a subsurface stream and follows the direction of the stream, he can walk out of the snow mountain?

215
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,500
Yes!

216
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,200
There is still hope.

217
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,500
Sister Ruan,

218
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,600
do you think they can find Luo Ben by using her way?

219
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,400
It's theoretically feasible.

220
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:57,000
If the manpower can be increased tomorrow, the probability should be even greater.

221
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,400
Yuan, why are you here?

222
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,800
 Luo Ben and Xiong Fei didn't type back so I had no other choice.

223
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,200
 How are they now?

224
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:35,100
Luo Ben fell into an ice crack while saving someone.

225
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,800
We can't reach him now.

226
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,600
 What happened? How could he fall there?

227
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,000
 - He...  
 - Calm down, Yuan. Listen to me.

228
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,800
We're all looking for him.

229
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,800
No news is good news.

230
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,600
Trust me! He'll be fine.

231
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,200
Come on...

232
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,000
President Wang, Find a local guide, the more villagers the better.

233
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,200
Search every river within three kilometers of the crack and go upstream.

234
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,200
Notify us immediately if there are any clues.

235
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,700
Okay.

236
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,680
We will also immediately carry out the search with drones.

237
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,000
- Yes! 
 - Yes.

238
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,800
 Luo Ben, hang in there.

239
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,800
 You can't give up.

240
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,500
 You will leave here.

241
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,200
 Zhan Yan is still waiting for you.

242
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,800
 You must survive

243
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,300
 and get out of here alive.

244
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:18,800
 Let's start from here.

245
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,300
Take care of your safety!

246
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,800
Don't act recklessly. Okay?

247
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,000
Thank you so much.

248
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,500
Are you ready?

249
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,200
 Yes.

250
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:38,200
Everyone should pay extra attention to safety when searching at night.

251
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,200
Stay with your guide.

252
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,700
Don't act alone. Comb every part!

253
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,000
Call us if there's any update!

254
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,700
 Okay!

255
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,500
Let's go!

256
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,700
Take a break first.

257
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,800
I will go with the guide to explore the way ahead.

258
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,100
I'll go with you.

259
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,600
Me, too!

260
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,900
Everyone search up and down the mountain.

261
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:56,700
It's been a whole night and there's still no news from him.

262
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,900
His chance of survival is very slim.

263
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:05,500
If we give up now, he'll lose all his hope.

264
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,200
The water along the river is frozen.

265
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,200
Even if we find all the exits along the river,

266
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,800
maybe we can only find his body.

267
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,600
But how do you know if you don't look for him?

268
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,700
Everyone must accept their fate.

269
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:26,700
I never accept or believe in fate.

270
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,600

It's our team logo!

I've read this book. It sells well.

323
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,960
My girlfriend drew it.

Really? She's so great.

325
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,560
Has it been published? Let me see.

326
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,480
Give me one!

327
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,480
Am I handsome in your comic?

00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,020
Let me have a look!

00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,400
When the time comes, should I specially draw you a series?

337
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,764
- Tell her "yes". 
 - Yes.

338
00:37:56,764 --> 00:37:58,500
So cute!

339
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:05,540
Although I left the rescue team because I made a mistake, as you can see, she has inherited her daddy's job.

340
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,320
Don't show off.

341
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,320
Brother Peng, behave well and come back early.

342
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,720
Otherwise, I'll draw you into a villain.

343
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,960
Okay, I'm really afraid of you.

344
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,340
Producer Zhou, your film is on fire.

345
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,920
Can my daughter join your next film?

346
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,908
Easily said. No problem!

347
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,840
You can become a superstar now!

348
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,960
She's shy!

349
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,812
Really bashful.

350
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,000
How are the newcomers?

351
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,320
Just so-so.

352
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,452
Far worse than us.

353
00:38:34,452 --> 00:38:37,580
- Always bragging. 
 - Don't be kidding.

354
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,300
- Captain. 
 - Captain.

355
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,424
Everyone is here.

356
00:38:53,424 --> 00:38:55,648
Yan will come back soon.

357
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,200
