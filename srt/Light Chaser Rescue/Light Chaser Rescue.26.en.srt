All right.

21
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:17,840
Bye.

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,490
Eating sweets can make you feel better.

23
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,760
I think it's especially suitable

24
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,280
for us after the catastrophe.

25
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,370
I didn't expect you

26
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,840
to do this.

27
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,530
Would you like to learn?

28
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:44,320
Let me teach you.

29
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:45,280
Sure.

30
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,130
Here.

31
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:49,320
Take it.

32
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:52,600
Look.

33
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,090
Poke it in.

34
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,000
Then slowly squeeze

35
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,090
the cream in.

36
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,370
You know what?

37
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,840
The final appearance

38
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,280
of each puff

39
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,280
has a certain randomness.

40
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,600
The effect of the final expansion

41
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,250
will vary

42
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,930
depending on the amount of air

43
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:14,720
and moisture absorbed each time
it is wrapped.

44
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,650
Are you saying that no matter
how many times you practice,

45
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,490
you won't end up making them

46
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,440
exactly the same?

47
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,210
Almost like that.

48
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:32,280
I don't like this feeling

49
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,490
of uncertainty.

50
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:39,970
Why?

51
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,440
Every time you go out on a mission,

52
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,320
I don't know what will happen to you.

53
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,760
I don't like this.

54
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,600
You finally admit that

55
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,160
you are worried about me.

56
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,440
You have saved me twice.

57
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,490
If there is a third time,

58
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:06,930
let me save you.

59
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,720
Eat it.

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,970
Can't you think positively?

62
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,610

to eat here.

I've been tortured by you for a day.

00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,760
It's good to have something to eat.

85
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:03,560
Thank you.

86
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,050

00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,610
the current training intensity?

88
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:07,290
No problem.

89
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,640
Take your time.

90
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:15,400
It tastes good.

91
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,640
Look.

92
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,000
There are vegetables and rice.

93
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,880
It's the taste of home.

94
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,250
I just want to make it easy and simple.

95
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,690
But nutrition is enough.

96
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:28,930
You know what?

97
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,130
Zhan Yan and I

98
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,130
were trapped in the basement

99
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:32,440
last time.

100
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:33,880
At that time,

101
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,080
I thought we were going to die.

102
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,810
She said that

103
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,610
what she wanted to eat most

104
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,200
was vegetable rice.

105
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,960
I tried to make it for her.

106
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,000
But obviously

107
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,080
that wasn't the taste she wanted.

108
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,320
Now I understand that

109
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,960
only you can make

110
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,640
the taste of the vegetable rice

111
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,610
in her mind.

112
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,490
She said that she wanted
to eat vegetable rice

113
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,880
just because she missed you.

114
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,050
Hello.

115
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,050
You don't work overtime at night,
do you?

116
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,520
Let's have dinner together.

117
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,080
I have something to do in a while.

118
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,320
Maybe later.

119
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,370
I will be waiting for you.

120
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:23,940
(Tomb of My Dear Wife Zhu Xiaojie)

121
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:09,760
Here.

122
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:14,640
Please.

123
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,400
Did you go to see your mother?

124
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,040
Did you see the flowers from me?

125
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,850
Did you throw the flowers away?

126
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,040
No.

127
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,450
But why did you

128
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:45,880
suddenly want to see her?

129
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,680
I went to thank her.

130
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:52,520
I thanked her

131
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,040
for bringing you into this world,

132
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,520
to me.

133
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,210
Happy birthday.

134
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,680
Zhan Yan, your birthday

135
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,490
will be our exclusive festival
in the future,

136
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,370
okay?

137
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,090
Are you sure?

138
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,040
I have a bad temper.

139
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:35,730
Are you going to put up with me?

140
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,920
Who but myself can do it?

141
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:46,920
Take a look.

142
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,490
Why vegetable rice again?

143
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,920
See how different

144
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,370
this one is today.

145
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,570
It looks good.

146
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,370
Take a try.

147
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:05,850
Last time

148
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,370
we both thought

149
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,970
we had little hope of surviving.

150
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,400
So

151
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,880
we shared our deepest secrets

152
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,160
with each other.

153
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,490
I believe that at that moment

154
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:18,730
we were both telling our inner thoughts.

155
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:19,970
At that time,

156
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:21,640
you said that you wanted
to eat vegetable rice,

157
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,160
but it was actually because

158
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,040
it carried the family affection

159
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:27,040
that you couldn't give up, right?

160
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:31,490
Zhan Yan, you have always

161
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:33,520
cared about your family.

162
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,610
You carry it in the vegetable rice,

163
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,370
right?

164
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,000
Zhan Yan.

165
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:43,920
Zhan Yan.

166
00:12:58,370 --> 00:12:59,610
You two teamed up to deceive me,

167
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,450
didn't you?

168
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,160
Yan.

169
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,130
Today is your birthday.

170
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:06,570
I just want to make you

171
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,640
your favorite vegetable rice.

172
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,000
This is my idea.

173
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,090
Don't blame your dad.

174
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,880
Do you think it's a good idea?

175
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,450
Can you stop being self-righteous

176
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,850
in front of me?

177
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:21,640
Zhan Yan.

178
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:26,570
Zhan Yan.

179
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,000
Zhan Yan.

180
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,400
Zhan Yan.

181
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,880
Enough.

182
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:36,520
No matter

183
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:37,330
what kind of conflict
there is between you,

184
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,490
after so many years,

185
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:39,610
it should be resolved.

186
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,090
This is my private matter.

187
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:41,850
Don't cross the line.

188
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,640
I don't want you to be sad.

189
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,610
Think about it yourself.

190
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,330
You have had a hard time on your own

191
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,040
for so many years.

192
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,040
He's no better than you.

193
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,090
Why can't you

194
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,970
have a good chat?

195
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:57,450
Are you two going to be

196
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,800
at a deadlock forever?

197
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,160
Can you leave it alone?

198
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,090
Zhan Yan. Zhan Yan!

199
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:14,880
Sorry.

200
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:17,490
I wanted to help you.

201
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,660
(Welcome home)

202
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,160
(I was rash today.)

203
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,570
(Sorry.)

204
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,280
(But I still insist)

205
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:02,850
(not to ignore and refuse
family affection)

206
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,040
(in our limited life.)

207
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,530
PDA all day long.

208
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:23,850
I can't stand it anymore.

209
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,810
He just left.

210
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,050
Luo Ben.

211
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,610
I had a bad attitude that day.

212
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:44,530
Don't take it seriously.

213
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:47,440
I am just worried about you.

214
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,160
Then forget about it.

215
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:53,240
Okay.

216
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:02,440
Mom.

217
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:03,370
Why did you

218
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,200
bring all my stuff back?

219
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:06,010
You need to be rebuilt.

220
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:06,810
Didn't you ask me to

221
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,610
fend for myself?

222
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,290
Persuade her.

223
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,770
You are in big trouble this time.

224
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:15,130
Your mother didn't sleep all night

225
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:16,400
because of you.

226
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,480
All right.

227
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:21,770
Mom, stop.

228
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,680
I swear that from today

229
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,160
I will never waste

230
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,290
national rescue resources again.

231
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:26,960
Okay?

232
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:27,850
Dingding.

233
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,160
Whatever you say is useless.

234
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,160
Your mother and I

235
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,680
will never let you live alone again.

236
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,200
I never said I am alone.

237
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,920
Why does this kid

238
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:44,240
look so familiar?

239
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,240
Isn't this

240
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:46,330
the boy

241
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,770
who rescued Dingding?

242
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:49,290
It's him.

243
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,880
He desperately tried to save Dingding.

244
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,290
He should be nice to her.

245
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:01,920
We will make chicken soup wontons
at home on weekends.

246
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:03,400
Invite him to join us.

247
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:21,400
Wait.

248
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:22,920
Are you going to a meeting?

249
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,330
You don't understand.

250
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,050
First impressions are important.

251
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,130
All right?

252
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,010
Okay.

253
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:34,570
How is it?

254
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,880
But

255
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,090
it's just a meal.

256
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,480
It seems that you are going to
propose a marriage.

257
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,610
Is there any difference?

258
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,090
Take one for me.

259
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:51,960
I'm not nervous.

260
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:53,130
I am just tired of driving.

261
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,400
- Okay, I see.
- You know?

262
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,440
Actually I'm not nervous at all.

263
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:56,570
You are not nervous.

264
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,240
It's true.

265
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,200
Mr. Ding, Mrs. Ding.

266
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,400
Nice to meet you.
Those are my gifts for you.

267
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,480
Zhou, no need for that.

268
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,720
I heard that both of you

269
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:23,920
are university professors.

270
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:24,960
Tacky eight-piece suits

271
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,290
don't match your status.

272
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,610
Both my parents teach science.

273
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:33,130
Zhou, we love

274
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,810
your presents.

275
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:35,850
Yes, we do.

276
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,370
I'm glad you like them.

277
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:40,330
Zhou.

278
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,010
Which university did you graduate from?

279
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,010
Linjiang Institute of Technology.

280
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,480
Linjiang Institute of Technology.

281
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,290
A junior college.

282
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,160
It doesn't matter
where heroes come from.

283
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,680
Where do you work?

284
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,050
Mingmei Media.

285
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,640
Entertainment circle.

286
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:04,370
Also cultural circle.

287
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:06,720
What works

288
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,440
did your company make?

289
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,960
We mainly focus on

290
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,330
romantic literary dramas.

291
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,440
Idol dramas?

292
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:14,530
This can enrich young people's

293
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,880
spare time.

294
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:17,920
Right.

295
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,530
But Zhou,

296
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,720
your company should produce

297
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,090
more works of positive energy
in the future.

298
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:25,370
Have you asked enough?

299
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,530
We are hungry.

300
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,880
Right, no worries.

301
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:29,290
We're going to cook right away.

302
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:30,570
Zhou.

303
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,370
The inner cave of the Beauty Cave

304
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,050
you went to this time is undeveloped

305
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,440
and retains many original landforms.

306
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:38,160
I am very interested in these.

307
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:38,920
I'll talk to you

308
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:39,880
about the underground rock formations

309
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:41,530
in a moment.

310
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,160
Okay, let's go to cook.

311
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:43,530
Okay.

312
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:44,570
Hurry up.

313
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,370
Zhou, make yourself at home.

314
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,290
Okay.

315
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:57,680
What are you doing?

316
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:58,920
Your dad is going to talk to me
about rock formations I don't understand.

317
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:00,330
I have to make some research.

318
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,880
Just tell him the truth.

319
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:02,850
No way.

320
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,680
Hush.

321
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,640
Although Dingding

322
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,330
doesn't study well,

323
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,770
her vision for choosing a boyfriend

324
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:20,480
is really good.

325
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:21,640
Zhou

326
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:24,090
is as good as Luo Ben.

327
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,160
Mr. Ding.

328
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:29,090
Can Zhou compare to Luo Ben?

329
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,720
Luo Ben is a top student.

330
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,920
Can Dingding compare to Zhan Yan?

331
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,960
That's true.

332
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,570
Zhou's parents

333
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,480
can bring up a child

334
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,130
who is keen on public welfare,

335
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,010
which shows that
they're highly educated.

336
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:48,610
You'd better not

337
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,240
find a quarrel in a straw.

338
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:51,720
Don't scare him away.

339
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,440
I see.

340
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:55,200
Cook now.

341
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,400
A rock layer is a mechanical concept

342
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,480
that includes strength…

343
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:01,240
Stop it.

344
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,330
...and relative stability.

345
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,960
Are you working?

346
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,090
Aren't you hungry?

347
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,570
Chicken soup wontons are ready.

348
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,400
Come and eat.

349
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:09,160
Thank you, Mrs. Ding.

350
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:09,610
Come on.

351
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:14,880
Mr. Ding.

352
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,610
Mr. Ding, let me.

353
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,130
Okay.

354
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:18,200
Take a seat.

355
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:22,440
Hurry up and eat.

356
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,920
Try my wontons.

357
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,400
Number one in the world.

358
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,610
I have to take a try then.

359
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,400
Take your time. It's hot.

360
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:32,330
Thank you, Mrs. Ding.

361
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,680
Zhou.

362
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:36,480
The news said that

363
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:37,810
the bottom of the cave

364
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,530
was connected to the karst topography.

365
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:41,480
This kind of landform

366
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:42,570
is rare in the country.

367
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:44,130
Is that karst topography

368
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,290
a collapse type

369
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,850
or an erosion type?

370
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,530
It should be…

371
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:54,370
Mr. Ding.

372
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,770
In fact, we were divided into two teams

373
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,850
to rescue.

374
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,640
I was mainly responsible for the cave.

375
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,400
I didn't see

376
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:00,850
what the karst topography is like.

377
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:02,850
Let's eat.

378
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:03,810
Yes, take a try.

379
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,920
What about the cave?

380
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:10,050
The cave…

381
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:10,610
Dad.

382
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:12,370
He was focused on
saving me at that time.

383
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,880
How could he notice that?

384
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,240
It makes sense.

385
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,090
Let's eat.

386
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,130
- Try this.
- Okay.

387
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:20,680
In fact,

388
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,130
it is thanks to you that

389
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,240
Dingding could come back safely.

390
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,330
You are good at diving.

391
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,610
But Dingding

392
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,610
is a landlubber.

393
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,810
You worked hard
to save Dingding, didn't you?

394
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:32,880
In fact,

395
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:34,330
I learned diving rescue

396
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,640
from Dingding's cousin.

397
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:38,200
I'm not that good

398
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:39,010
and am still at the primary level.

399
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,720
But I thought at the time that

400
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:41,610
Dingding was still inside,

401
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,960
so I had to get her out.

402
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:43,640
Good.

403
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:44,440
Zhou.

404
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,240
Did you learn

405
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:46,400
from Yan?

406
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:47,010
Yes.

407
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:48,960
I want to train a professional
diving rescue team

408
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,610
for the team.

409
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:51,720
Although I am not

410
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:53,090
as good as Dr. Zhan yet,

411
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,770
I will try my best.

412
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,720
Dingding, see?

413
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:57,680
You have to study hard

414
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:59,050
from Zhou in the future.

415
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,160
Why are you talking about me again?

416
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:02,680
Let's eat.

417
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,850
Zhou has goals.

418
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:06,880
And your cousin

419
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:08,090
is teaching him.

420
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,200
Zhou will definitely

421
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:11,290
have great achievements in the future.

422
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,130
You should communicate with them
about this

423
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:14,960
frequently in the future.

424
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:17,160
Never take it one step at a time.

425
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:18,480
I see.

426
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:20,160
Thank you, Mrs. Ding.

427
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:20,680
I can help myself.

428
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:21,640

429
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:25,330
Zhou.

430
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:27,050
Dingding

431
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,200
seems to be careless.

432
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,010
She mainly inherited

433
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:32,060
the recessive genes

434
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,370
from me and her father.

435
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,570
However, when it comes
to the next generation,

436
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,160
the dominant gene

437
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:38,570
may appear.

438
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,480
What I want to say

439
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:43,090
is that

440
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,960
when you two are dating,

441
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,050
you should give her

442
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,810
enough patience.

443
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,640
Mrs. Ding.

444
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:50,960
I think Dingding is fine

445
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:52,570
no matter what.

446
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:56,160
Okay.

447
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:58,240

- Great. Eat.

was a complete misunderstanding.

00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:22,290
all the rescue projects

523
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,610
of Juwu Light Chaser Rescue Team

524
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,050
are clearly priced.

525
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,680
But we didn't authorize

526
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:29,960
the Juwu Rescue Team at all.

527
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:31,880
Apparently

528
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,480
someone falsely used
the name of Light Chaser.

529
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,130
What a jerk.

530
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:38,530
It took us

531
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,130
so many years of hard work

532
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,640
to get to where we are now.

533
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:42,920
The impact of this incident

534
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:44,530
is particularly bad.

535
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:47,160
Now everyone is beginning to resist

536
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:48,200
our rescue team

537
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:49,640
and even the public welfare
establishments.

538
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,570
We can

539
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,440
expose

540
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:53,440
the impostors

541
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,400
and posters.

542
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:55,130
Yes.

543
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:57,050
They have to pay.

544
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,290
They have to be

545
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,010
driven to the dead end.

546
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,010
If we don't play tough,

547
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,130
they would do the same again.

548
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:08,050
Luo Ben, why don't you say anything?

549
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,610
Aren't you a lawyer? Sue them.

550
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:11,570
Prove our innocence.

551
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:15,610
Luo Ben.

552
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:18,010
We really need to resolve this matter

553
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,010
through legal means.

554
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,880
What's your advice?

555
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,090
Captain, listen.

556
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,960
As you said,

557
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,090
the Juwu Rescue Team

558
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,840
wasn't authorized.

559
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,270
They're not a Light Chaser team.

560
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:33,680
If we sue them for the illegal use of
the name of Light Chaser,

561
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,200
it is not difficult

562
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:36,370
to win the case.

563
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:38,330
But I fear that

564
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,130
we will win the case

565
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:43,400
but lose the will of the people.

566
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:45,810
Think about it.

567
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:47,090
Now the Internet

568
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,680
is full of negative news

569
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:50,640
about the Light Chaser Rescue Team.

570
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:52,330
Ordinary people have no way

571
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,960
of knowing what the truth is.

572
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:55,810
In this case,

573
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,810
the fake news on the Internet

574
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,920
will be amplified

575
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,610
and fermented infinitely.

576
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:05,090
Right.

577
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,920
Over the years since
Light Chaser was established,

578
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,290
no matter how difficult it is,

579
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,530
I have never been afraid.

580
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:12,810
But this time

581
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,770
I am really worried.

582
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:17,010
Public welfare

583
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,680
has a long way to go.

584
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:20,640
Once credibility is destroyed,

585
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:22,570
it will be difficult to rebuild it.

586
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,400
This is probably the biggest crisis

587
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,810
we've faced since our team was founded.

588
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,900
(Light Chaser Rescue Team Collecting Wealth
under the Name of Public Welfare)

589
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:53,480
Yuan.

590
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:57,610
I have to go back to the rescue team.

591
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,440
Go ahead.

592
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,680
If I go,

593
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:09,610
the business may be more affected.

594
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,330
Never mind.

595
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:14,160
Even if we can't sell wontons,

596
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:15,640
we can do something else.

597
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:21,050
Thank you, Yuan.

598
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:26,880
Hold on.

599
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,010
When did you buy this?

600
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,880
Go back to the rescue team.

601
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:02,400
No.

602
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:04,770
Something happened to the team.

603
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,920
I'm just going to see...

604
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:12,720
I know you are eager to rescue.

605
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:17,160
You quit the rescue team for me.

606
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:23,850
I want to run the food truck
business well

607
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:25,920
and take better care of you.

608
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,050
But I don't want you

609
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,480
to be like this.

610
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:35,770
Am I so useless

611
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,680
in your eyes,

612
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,160
and need someone to take care of me
all the time?

613
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:43,050
I didn't mean that.

614
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,480
I love you.

615
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:52,530
I hope you can do

616
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,960
what you want.

617
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:58,160
I will take care of myself

618
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,130
and also support you.

619
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:03,810
I don't want to be your burden.

620
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,370
Go back to the team.

621
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:09,130
Stand with them.

622
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:27,620
(The Light Chaser I know is not like this.
They are a group of people with justice.)

623
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,810
Erdong, Si.

624
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,770
Organize more people

625
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,130
to the account that posted the message

626
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:38,640
to encircle and suppress it.

627
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:39,330
Whatever they say,

628
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,880
we will confront them.

629
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,570
Will this work?

630
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:46,810
Why not?

631
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,640
I don't believe that

632
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:49,090
I can't handle them.

633
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:50,530
Si.

634
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,810
They spoke again, hurry up.

635
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:56,530
Zhou Mingming, go back.

636
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,770
You've been out for so long.

637
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,160
You have a lot to deal with
in the company.

638
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,530
Does my girlfriend care about my career?

639
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,960
I'm afraid your mother
will be looking for you.

640
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:08,570
Making money matters.

641
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:10,850
But justifying justice is more important.

642
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:15,890
You deserve to be

643
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:17,890
an entrepreneur in the new era.

644
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:19,610
Good for you.

645
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,640
Of course.

646
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:26,690
Hush.

647
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:27,530
My mom.

648
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,360
Hello, Mom.

649
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:36,640
I have something to do.

650
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:37,930
I see.

651
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:38,640
I've got Aiqi

652
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,160
working on that publicity project.

653
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:41,200
Don't worry.

654
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,570
Yes.

655
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,320
Blood test indicators for Bed No. 32.

656
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:46,050
Bed No. 32, right?

657
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,930
Yes, there is still a problem.

658
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:49,320
Just keep watching for a few more days.

659
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,200
Okay.

660
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:51,760
(Light Chaser Rescue makes a fortune
for public welfare.)

661
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,890
(I doubt it.)

662
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,570
(The Light Chaser Rescue Team I know)

663
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:55,890
(is made up of real ordinary heroes.)

664
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,130
(They don't charge anything.)

665
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,240
(I saw with my own eyes that)

666
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:58,970
(they rejected)

667
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:00,530
(the money from the families
of the rescued.)

668

(If Qingshan wants to make money,)

669

(does he need to do charity work?)

670
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:08,200
(But he definitely took a lot of money.)

671
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,530
(I strongly recommend
relevant departments)

672
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,530

(You know so well.)

00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:15,530
(Did you see it with your own eyes?)

677
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,640
(I am really)

678
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,760
(speechless.)

- Captain.
- Captain.

00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,720
Are you guys so lackluster

694
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:18,970
in training?

695
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:20,720
Captain.

696
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,890
We're out of work now.

697
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:24,490
Shall we practice?

698
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,840
Captain, will the rescue team disband?

699
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,240
Each of you filled out a form

700
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:40,760
when you joined the team.

701
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,640
There is a question on it,

702
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:46,010
why are you joining the rescue team?

703
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,970
Do you still remember why?

704
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,010
To make donations to charity.

705
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:53,680
To realize the value of life.

706
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,930
To help others.

707
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,970
To make life more meaningful.

708
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:00,320
We also have to ask ourselves

709
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,800
if we encounter difficulties,

710
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:05,200
failures and setbacks,

711
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:07,680
or even misunderstandings and insults,

712
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,760
should we still do public welfare?

713
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,930
We're doing the right thing,

714
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,840
no matter what others say.

715
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:19,130
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

716
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,450
We will continue to do charity work.

717
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:21,760
Well said.

718
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:22,760
Leave the others alone, keep doing it.

719
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:25,090
No matter what happens,

720
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,280
the rescue team will never be disbanded.

721
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:29,450
Even if I am the only one left,

722
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,280
I will continue to

723
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:34,410
do charity relief.

724
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:37,570
I won't go either.

725
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,450
We believe

726
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:39,930
things will come to light.

727
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:40,930
Of course.

728
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:42,010
I am in.

729
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,360
I will hold on till the end.

730
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,410
Captain.

731
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:47,930
Xiong Fei.

732
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:51,160
This is Xiong Fei,

733
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,840
our team's former rope master.

734
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,240
I ask to return.

735
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,200
Xiong Fei.

736
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,530
Since you have already

737
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,160
left the rescue team,

738
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:22,450
why did you choose to return?

739
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,130
I quit at the time

740
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,640
to solve my life

741
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,090
and work problems.

742
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:32,320
I admit that my return to the team now

743
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:33,610
is out of selfishness.

744
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:37,130
After I quit the team,

745
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,800
I found that besides life,

746
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:41,760
people still have the desire to pursue

747
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:43,930
and be a good person.

748
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:47,090
This is my greatest selfishness

749
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:48,450
in doing charity relief.

750
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:53,490
- Xiong Fei.
- Well said.

751
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,720
Return to the team!

752
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:57,530
Yes, sir.

753
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:05,610
Today, coach Xiong Fei

754
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:08,640
will teach everyone rope skills.

755
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:09,570
Great.

756
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,450
Yes!

757
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:28,740
(Light Chaser Rescue Team Collecting Wealth
under the Name of Public Welfare)

758
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:33,800
Mom.

759
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,570
I didn't approve of your participation

760
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,450
in the rescue team at first.

761
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:44,970
On the one hand, it is for your safety,

762
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:46,090
and on the other hand, it is to avoid

763
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,840
unnecessary disputes.

764
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,490
Now what?

765
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:51,320
It happened.

766
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:53,640
These reports are not true.

767
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:55,200
The team hired a lawyer

768
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,050
to sue them.

769
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,490
Whether it's true or not,

770
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,840
public opinion has spread.

771
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:00,680
We are a cultural media company.

772
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,800
We focus on the company's image

773
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:03,010
and reputation.

774
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:04,490
Now the company

775
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,130
is in an eventful time,

776
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,010
and a new project

777
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,130
has just begun to take shape.

778
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,280
At this juncture,

779
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:10,280
there can't be

780
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:12,130
any more negative news.

781
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:12,680
Mom.

782
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:14,280
It is not shameful to do public welfare,

783
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:15,840
and it won't discredit the company.

784
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,200
How come you still don't understand?

785
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,840
It's not up to you.

786
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:21,050
Get out of the rescue team.

787
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:21,720
Mom.

788
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,360
I will work hard for the company.

789
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:24,890
But I can't quit at this time.

790
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,200
I have to go through thick and thin
together with my teammates.

791
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,240
Decide it on your own.

792
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:41,610
So what are you going to do?

793
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,130
What?

794
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,970
You know what I'm talking about.

795
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:49,010
I thought you didn't care.

796
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:51,800
I don't care about him,

797
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:53,490
but I do care about the team

798
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,930
and public welfare.

799
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:57,090
I can't just watch the rescue team

800
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,490
get smeared like that.

801
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,760
We have discussed.

802
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:05,090
We are ready to sue them

803
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,160
through legal process.

804
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:07,530
I am going

805
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,930
to Juwu tomorrow

806
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:11,090
to check the basic situation.

807
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:14,800
So you are ready.

808
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:16,570
But you just didn't tell me.

809
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:19,680
With lessons drawn from my mistakes,

810
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,280
I dare not cross the line.

811
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,610
Public hearing?

812
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:28,570
Yes.

813
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,490
Only by expanding its influence

814
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,970
can the pressure brought
about by public opinion

815
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,610
be relieved.

816
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:40,200
Luo Ben.

817
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,530
Are you 100% sure?

818
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,050
Once heard in public,

819
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:47,970
as a defense attorney,

820
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,970
each of your arguments

821
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,200
have to stand up to scrutiny

822
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:52,360
and verification.

823
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:55,010
Even tiny mistakes

824
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,240
will be magnified several times

825
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:57,840
in the spotlight.

826
00:41:58,490 --> 00:41:59,570
If

827
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,530
the lawsuit is lost,

828
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,360
not only will there be an impact
on the law firm,

829
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:06,610
I am afraid that
it will be difficult for you

830
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,050
to turn around in the industry
in the future.

831
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,090
You are taking a risk.

832
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,640
Luo Ben.

833
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,840
Think about it twice.

834
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,090
I've made up my mind.

835
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:28,720
If you feel this

836
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:30,320
might affect the law firm,

837
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:32,490
I can resign.

838
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:44,200
Luo Ben.

839
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:49,840
Prepare yourself well.

840
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,800
