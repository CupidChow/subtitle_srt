Sir, Ma'am.

Please prepare for the worst.

I…

25
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,920
I'm sure he's alive.

26
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,330
He must be alive.

27
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:03,690
You haven't seen him, have you?

00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,530
Please keep looking!

32
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:08,170
Get up, please.

33
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:09,430
He's alive!

00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,040
We'll do our best.

35
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:12,560
I understand

36
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,210
how you feel.

37
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,210
But they're already

38
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,930
100 meters deep.

39
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,760
There's no chance of survival.

40
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:19,650
But you gotta…

41
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,840
You gotta

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,280
let me see his body!

43
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,490
Sir, Ma'am,

44
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,250
please calm down.

45
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:26,560
No matter how difficult it is,

46
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,600
the rescue team

47
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,410
will find his body.

48
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,720
I promise you.

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,280
No. 1, No 2.

50
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,930
Continue the descent.

51
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,810
Be careful. Be careful.

52
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:44,930
- Move.
- Move.

53
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,600
The wall is getting wet and slippery.

54
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:58,810
Xiong Fei,

55
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,000
beware of your footsteps.

56
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:01,650
Yes.

57
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,810
Xiong Fei!

58
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,250
Xiong Fei!

59
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,320
Director Liu, look.

60
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,440
No. 1, No. 1.

61
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,530
What's going on?

62
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,810
No. 2's cordage is mispositioned.

63
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:32,930
Adjusting.

64
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,760
Xiong Fei, easy.

65
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,720
Your hand. Give me your hand.

66
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:36,930
You must be safe.

67
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,000
Safety comes first.

68
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:38,280
Quickly.

69
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,210
Easy.

70
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,880
I'll add an anchor point.

71
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,040
No. 2 adjusted.

72
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,370
Safe.

73
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:48,490
Copy.

74
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,130
Be careful, captain.

75
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:52,880
OK.

76
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,250
They're 200 meters deep.

77
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,090
Director Liu,

78
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:02,040
they have added
quite some anchor points

79
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,210
along the 200-meter descent.

80
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,490
They are sapped.

81
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:05,370
I suggest

82
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:06,410
a change of group.

83
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,650
No. 1, No. 2.

84
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,000
Report.

85
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:14,930
No. 1 reporting.

86
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,810
The descent continues.

87
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,090
The pit wall is wet and slippery.

88
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,410
No solid foothold.

89
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,440
It is a strenuous descent.

90
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,080
Director Liu,

91
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:27,690
to be on the safe side,

92
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,050
they must ascend immediately.

93
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,050
No. 1, No. 2.

94
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,320
To be safe,

95
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:38,200
you are to discontinue the descent.

96
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,400
Ascend. Ascend immediately.

97
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,850
No. 1 copy.

98
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,250
No. 2 copy.

99
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:05,690
Are you okay?

100
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,850
I'm fine. Just a scratch.

101
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:09,760
Here.

102
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:11,850
Director.

103
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,130
Captain.

104
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,640
Sir, Ma'am.

105
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,760
About your son,

106
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:22,810
we have…

107
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,560
That's enough. No more rescue.

108
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,050
The pit is so deep.

109
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:27,520
He must…

110
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:28,610
Must have been gone.

111
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,960
We'll treat it

112
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,880
like he's properly buried.

113
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,930
The rescuers

114
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,400
can't get injured anymore.

115
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:42,640
Sir, Ma'am.

116
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,320
Don't worry.

117
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,810
We'll work out

118
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,320
another rescue plan.

119
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,050
Please go and get some rest.

120
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,130
Go.

121
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:52,080
OK?

122
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,200
Wait a minute.

123
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:54,930
Captain.

124
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,490
Tomorrow morning,

125
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,640
we'll descend again.

126
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,440
We promise you
that we'll get your son out.

127
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,130
Thank you.

128
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,130
OK.

129
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,290
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

130
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,440
Just go home.

131
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:09,930
Go home.

132
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,080
You saw that.

133
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,170
Due to the high difficulty,

134
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:22,610
the family chose to give up.

135
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,130
But we'll have to descend again

136
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,960
to find the dead body.

137
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,640
That's how we respect his life

138
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,640
and comfort his family.

139
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,130
Xiong Fei and I

140
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,760
were 200 meters deep.

141
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,130
We set anchor points

142
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,560
at all safe positions.

143
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,610
The second descent

144
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,690
will be more efficient.

145
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:46,850
Captain,

146
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,200
Dapeng and I

147
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,200
will go down there tomorrow.

148
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,440
No.

149
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,170
It'll still be me and Xiong Fei.

150
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:54,440
We have learned

151
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:55,690
the situation in the pit.

152
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:56,560
I agree.

153
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,560
We'll rest.

154
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,170
Tomorrow morning,

155
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:01,440
the second descent.

156
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,320
Yes, sir.

157
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,960
(Luo Ben)
(How's everything going?)

158
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:57,420
(Happiness)

159
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:03,580
(Sign language notes)

160
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:08,100
(I want to enter your world.
Love is our common language.)

161
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,000
- Take a look at this.
- OK.

162
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:23,520
Xiong Fei.

163
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:25,880
Over there.

164
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:26,680
OK.

165
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,090
No. 1 reporting. No. 1 reporting.

166
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,330
Victim spotted.

167
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,370
What, Captain?

168
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,450
It's the frozen soil.

169
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,450
The soil layer here is unstable.

170
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:53,400
We must speed up.

171
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,040
OK.

172
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,400
Here.

173
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,370
No vital signs.

174
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,210
Xiong Fei.

175
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,730
Bag the body.

176
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,520
OK.

Request for ascent.

179
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,250
Affirmative.

Xiong Fei.

181
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,370
We'll ascend.

182
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:55,160
OK.

183
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:03,800
Xiong Fei, watch out!

184
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:15,850
No. 1.

185
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,090
Paging No. 1.

187
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,160
Paging No. 2.

188
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:24,400
No. 2, how are things
looking down there?

189
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,250
C-Captain.

190
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,490
Captain!

191
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:55,850
Captain!

192
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:08,330
Captain, hang in there.

193
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,520
Xiong Fei. Xiong Fei.

194
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,970
Can you hear me?

195
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:21,330
Captain.

196
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:22,920
Do you copy?

197
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,610
Do you copy?

198
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,130
Something must have happened.

199
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,090
They are not responding.

200
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,920
Luo Ben, Dapeng.

201
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:35,970
Get ready for the descent.

202
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,490
Yes, sir.

203
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,210
Captain.

204
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,610
How are you, captain?

205
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,520
How are you?

206
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,040
Captain.

207
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,040
Quickly, check him up.

208
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,370
It's the frozen layer.

209
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,250
They're suffering from hypothermia.

210
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,280
Dapeng.

211
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:24,450
Put the dry clothes

212
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:25,160
on them.

213
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:25,730
OK.

214
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,250
Relieve them of hypothermia.

215
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:29,610
Xiong Fei,

216
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,280
what happened?

217
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,450
The frozen soil fell.

218
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:33,640
Captain pushed me away.

219
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,850
But he got smashed.

220
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:37,610
Quickly.

221
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:40,610
Put it on Xiong Fei.

222
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:42,130
Come on.

223
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,090
Come on.

224
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,610
Take them away.

225
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:49,920
Go.

226
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:50,570
Go.

227
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,090
Hang in there, captain.

228
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:56,730
Zhan Yan.

229
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,000
Don't overstrain yourself

230
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:59,280
in Fengxi.

231
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,570
Also, don't forget about us.

232
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,040
Please come back and see us
whenever you can.

233
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:03,920
Relax.

234
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:04,610
You don't need to tell her this.

235
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,760
She will come back.

236
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,920
But not for you, though.

237
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:08,160
For her boyfriend.

238
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,040
Shut up.

239
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,160
All right, go back in.

240
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,130
We'll stay in touch.

241
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,370
Zhan Yan,

242
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,490
safe travels.

243
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:17,970
Take care of yourself.

244
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:19,370
Bye-bye.

245
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,000
Zhan Yan, bye-bye.

246
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:27,640
Zhan Yan,

247
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:31,040
Captain had an accident.

248
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,330
He's still in a coma.

249
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,640
We're on the way to the hospital.

250
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,680
Zhan Yan, can you hear me?
Zhan Yan?

251
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,800
Sorry, Doctor.

252
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,520
My father is in an emergency.

253
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:48,730
I have to go now.

254
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,280
OK, all right.
We'll wait for you in Fengxi.

255
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,000
Thank you.

256
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,570
Quickly. Quickly. Keep up.

257
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,370
What's up?

258
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,580
(Emergency)

259
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:02,490
Make way!

260
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:03,760
Make way! Make way!

261
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:04,760
Out of the way!

262
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:07,520
Make way! Make way!

263
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,250
Get out of the way!

264
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,540
(Linjiang Central Hospital)

265
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,400
This way! This way!

266
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,000
Hurry!

267
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,160
Ruoxi, arrange the examination!

268
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,130
Zirui, get my uniform!

269
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:18,640
OK.

270
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:21,610
Hurry! Hurry!

271
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:25,340
(Radiology Department)

272
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,800
He's awake.

273
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:37,800
Not a major problem.

274
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,250
From the X-ray films,

275
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:40,680
his injury isn't serious.

276
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,250
Scapular fracture.

277
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,250
It's an old wound.

278
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,330
He had a fracture before.

279
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:47,970
However,

280
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,560
we found

281
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,360
a tumor at his gastric cardia.

282
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,000
The tumor is still in place.

283
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
No change of lymph gland found.

284
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,920
We suggest an endoscopy
as soon as possible.

285
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,880
We'll take some tissue for biopsy,

286
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,120
and identify the nature of the tumor.

287
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,680
But of course,

288
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,880
we'll have our conclusion

289
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,330
after the tissue test result.

290
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,050
Why are you all here with me?

291
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,720
It's no big deal.

292
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,610
Keep it quiet, please.

293
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:24,480
Captain,

294
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:25,370
we didn't

295
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,010
tell many people.

296
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:27,400
Only a few of us know.

297
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,480
You all have work

298
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:30,440
to do.

299
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:32,850
You all have your duties.

300
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:34,440
The doctors and nurses here

301
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,610
will take care of me.

302
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,920
Just go.

303
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:39,680
I'll keep your company here.

304
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,010
I will

305
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,440
get some hot water.

306
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:53,850
I'll be here, too.

307
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,160
Xiong Fei,

308
00:17:58,850 --> 00:17:59,920
it was your wedding

309
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:01,640
yesterday.

310
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,440
The mission

311
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,810
makes your wedding

312
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,810
meaningful and memorable.

313
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,640
Captain has a gastric tumor?

314
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,680
I bet he doesn't know himself.

315
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:21,920
He lives on his own,

316
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,720
and he doesn't eat regularly

317
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,570
and healthily.

318
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:26,880
See?

319
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,370
Now he's ill.

320
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:32,680
I will perform

321
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,400
a thorough examination on him.

322
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,680
Zhan Yan,

323
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:38,880
when you do,

324
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,290
be nice.

325
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,610
Don't treat him like your enemy.

326
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,810
As a doctor, you should know

327
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,530
that the patient's emotions

328
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:47,610
are closely connected

329
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,010
to the formation of the tumor.

330
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,880
Captain may

331
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:51,640
be reticent in normal times.

332
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:52,720
He doesn't say much

333
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:53,720
because he keeps

334
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:55,400
everything to himself.

335
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:57,240
He wouldn't like to share his feelings.

336
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,440
This is the real sickness,
and it's hard to cure.

337
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:07,810
I know that my words

338
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,850
may upset you,

339
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:10,810
but I'm still going to say it.

340
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,200
Zhan Yan.

341
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:15,090
Reconcile with Captain.

342
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,440
You're the only one

343
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:20,530
he has got now.

344
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:21,330
What if

345
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,960
there's any accident?

346
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,130
You'll regret it.

347
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,010
You'll never forgive yourself

348
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:30,920
for the rest of your life.

(Linjiang Central Hospital)

351
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,530
I'm sorry that I concerned you.

352
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:07,680
I'm okay.

00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:10,480
Seriously.

354
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,160
I'm sorry, Yuan,

355
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,160
for leaving you behind
on the wedding day

356
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,240
and making you worried about me.

357
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:34,920
Let's go.

358
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,130
Go.

359
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:42,380
(Linjiang Central Hospital)

360
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,290
No wonder you left so early.

361
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,050
You told Luo Yuan

362
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:45,880
that Xiong Fei

363
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:46,680
got injured.

364
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:47,960
She must have been so worried.

365
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,090
Yuan is a good friend of mine.

366
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,920
I can't lie to her.

367
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,090
But Captain,

368
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,200
he always seems invincible

369
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:55,920
in my eyes.

370
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:56,640
I think we show

371
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:57,920
too little care for him.

372
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:00,400
Yeah.

373
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:02,850
Captain is only a few years
younger than my mom.

374
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:04,720
I guess I should

375
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,090
show more care for her.

376
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:08,550
I will never

377
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,610
fight my parents again.

378
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,130
Dingding,

379
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,920
my mother's birthday is coming.

380
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:15,330
How about you come with me?

381
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:19,920
I think it'll be a great opportunity.

382
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:21,050
You'll see

383
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:22,770
how I nail my future mother-in-law.

384
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,290
You didn't have

385
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,570
a complete wedding.

386
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,850
But my promise to you

387
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:42,370
is complete.

388
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:01,370
I love you, Yuan.

389
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:07,960
I have never been

390
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:09,530
so happy before.

391
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,960
I never thought a sweet girl

392
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,090
like you would fall

393
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,090
in love with me,

394
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:22,850
or marry me.

395
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,330
It is the great happiness in my life

396
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:32,810
to marry you.

397
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:02,010
I learned a little

398
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,130
about the conflict

399
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:05,960
between Zhan Yan and Captain.

400
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:07,850
Now that Captain's ill,

401
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,480
do you have

402
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,160
a suggestion

403
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:12,240
that can ease the tension

404
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:14,010
between them?

405
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,570
Over the years,

406
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,610
her friends like us

407
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,200
have tried many ways.

408
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,570
But no one can clear the air

409
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,680
for them but themselves.

410
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:25,090
Especially Qingshan.

411
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,290
There's something

412
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,960
that has to be said by him.

413
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:29,720
Captain really wants

414
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:31,770
a good relationship with Zhan Yan.

415
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,400
He will say

416
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,010
what he needs to say.

417
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:43,500
(Laboratory)

418
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:48,400
Do we have a result?

419
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:49,770
Yes.

420
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:52,130
Thank you.

421
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,960
How is it?

422
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:12,960
Mr. Zhan, you rest well.

423
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:13,810
I'm off.

424
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:14,920
Thanks.

425
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:15,480
Bye-bye.

426
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,570
How is it looking?

427
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,680
Not good.

428
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:32,720
It's spreading.

429
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,240
Mr. Zhan lives a healthy life.

430
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:35,400
How come…

431
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,090
It's a chronic disease.

432
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,770
He doesn't really
take good care of himself.

433
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,920
If it wasn't for the examination,

434
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:43,530
we would still have no clue.

435
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,050
What did Zhan Yan say?

436
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,880
She said nothing.

437
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,610
But I can tell

438
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,480
that she's having a hard time.

439
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:53,160
She's unbelievable.

440
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,680
Her dad is so ill.

441
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,960
She may not even

442
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:57,810
have another chance
to reconcile with his dad.

443
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:59,090
What is it that she cannot let go of?

444
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,160
Keep it down.

445
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,010
Don't let Captain hear us.

446
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:04,240
Captain cannot

447
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:06,440
take any more hits.

448
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:07,960
I got it.

449
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:12,440
All right. I'm going in.

450
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:13,920
Remember,

451
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:16,530
don't tell anyone about it.

452
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,330
Trust me, I won't.

453
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:20,610
Just go.

454
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,290
Go.

455
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:40,440
Captain.

456
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,160
How do you feel?

457
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,240
Luo Ben,

458
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,810
there's a test result, right?

459
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,960
What does it say?

460
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,160
I'd like to see it.

461
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:55,200
The test result?

462
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:56,480
Zhan Yan took it.

463
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,640
You're fine. Don't worry.

464
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:58,570
I saw it.

465
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,850
The tumor is benign.

466
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,330
You know how to read that?

467
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,770
Zhan Yan told me.

468
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,610
She said you'd be fine
once it's removed.

469
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,530
She asked me to tell you

470
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:13,240
to not worry.

471
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:15,240
It's no big deal.

472
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:17,640
It's your words, right?

473
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,610
You see me through.

474
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,480
Yes, my words.

475
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,240
But

476
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,680
you're okay.

477
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:30,090
Just get the rumor removed.

478
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:32,480
You trust me, don't you?

479
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,050
Don't be nervous.

480
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:34,960
Relax.

481
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:37,440
Be nice to your stomach.

482
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,160
Luo Ben, you go do your thing.

483
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:40,680
I…

484
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:43,050
I'm okay.

485
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,610
I want some sleep.

486
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,400
OK.

487
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:48,330
Well, Captain.

488
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:48,770
If you need anything,

489
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,920
just give me a call.

490
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:54,370
Just sleep.

491
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:55,610
I'm off.

492
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,130
What are you doing out here?

493
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:32,680
Go back to your bed.

494
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:35,850
I want a word with you.

495
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:37,480
After you get well, okay?

496
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,850
I want a word with you now.

497
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,090
Let's go then.

498
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:45,640
Easy.

499
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:52,090
I know.

500
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:55,200
Know what?

501
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:59,440
It's cancer.

502
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,960
And it's spreading.

503
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:04,200
Who told you this?

504
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:05,920
It doesn't matter.

505
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,960
Yan,

506
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:11,010
there's something that I want
to say to you,

507
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,720
or else I'll never be able
to say it again.

508
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:17,200
I don't care

509
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:18,770
who told you this,

510
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:21,160
but I now officially inform you

511
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:24,010
that the tumor is benign.

512
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:24,880
All you need to do

513
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:27,240
is wait for your indicators
to meet requirements

514
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,010
and then have the operation.

515
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:30,130
You don't need to comfort me.

516
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,480
I'm prepared for it.

517
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:33,090
Just hear me out first.

518
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,200
Go on, then.

519
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:42,330
I know I'm not a good father,

520
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,130
nor was I a good husband.

521
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,160
I failed to safeguard my own family.

522
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,400
During the earthquake,

523
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,810
your mother

524
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,570
was buried in the hotel.

525
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,530
There was a family of three

526
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,370
which wasn't far away from her.

527
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,440
They were closer

528
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:04,880
to me,

529
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:06,960
and easier to rescue.

530
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:07,920
I know this.

531
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:09,160
I have heard this story

532
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,810
many times over many years.

533
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,200
What you have heard

534
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:13,880
is not the truth.

535
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:16,400
I saved your mother first.

536
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,130
What did you say?

537
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:26,570
You were young.

538
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:28,400
After the earthquake,

539
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:29,770
I handed you

540
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,130
to a survivor,

541
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:33,200
and I immediately went back
to save your mother.

542
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,610
Xiaojie, I can see you.

543
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,920
Don't move!

544
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:46,010
Xiaojie! Xiaojie!

545
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,290
Xiaojie, don't move!

546
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,330
Yan is safe now.

547
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,290
Don't worry.

548
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,370
Are you okay?

549
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,610
I'm coming for you.

550
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,000
Xiaojie.

551
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:52,960
Is anyone out there?

552
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:54,130
Help!

553
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,570
Anyone? Help us!

554
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,570
Help!

555
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,440
Save our child.

556
00:29:58,570 --> 00:29:59,680
Help! Save our child, please!

557
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,680
I had to save your mother,

558
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:04,160
so I ignored

559
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,770
the couple cold-heartedly.

560
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:09,640
I tried to get your mother out first.

561
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:13,850
That was the truth.

562
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:19,720
The newspaper said

563
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,880
you saved the child first,

564
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,290
and then an aftershock

565
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:26,850
took the lives of the couple

566
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,160
and my mother.

567
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:30,880
Didn't you say

568
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,920
that when you saw my mother,

569
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,200
she was dead?

570
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,090
You liar!

571
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:35,570
Why didn't she survive?

572
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:36,720
Why does the newspaper

573
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,880
say that you saved the boy first?

574
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,770
What the reporter said

575
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,640
wasn't necessarily the whole truth.

576
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:48,090
I have nothing to lose now.

577
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,440
Why would I lie to you anymore?

578
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,680
At the time, I had no

579
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,570
knowledge about
emergency rescue at all.

580
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:55,120
All I wanted was

581
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:56,720
to get your mother out.

582
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:59,330
And I also wanted to help that family.

583
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,160
I damaged the structure,

584
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:06,010
and caused a second collapse.

585
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:13,770
Xiaojie!

586
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,960
So are you saying

587
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:18,570
that you chose to save my mother

588
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,770
instead of the couple?

589
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,090
Yes.

590
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:36,200
The newspaper

591
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:38,530
portrayed me as a hero.

592
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:41,720
I had people's

593
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,810
respect and admiration.

594
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:49,370
But I don't deserve any of that.

595
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,440
I don't!

596
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:56,570
I always wanted you

597
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,160
to know the truth.

598
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,810
But every time,

599
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,480
I'd get cold feet.

600
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:07,290
Why?

601
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,640
Why couldn't you tell me?

602
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:11,330
We have such a similar personality.

603
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,130
I would rather

604
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:15,290
be a heroic father of yours

605
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:16,960
than become

606
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:18,480
your psychological burden

607
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:19,680
after you were told

608
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,440
the truth.

609
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:29,160
But I didn't expect

610
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:32,240
that you read the newspaper.

611
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:35,640
From that day on,

612
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:38,130
you and I
estranged from one another.

613
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:42,160
People see me as a hero,

614
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:44,290
a good father,

615
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,850
the captain of Light Chaser Rescue.

616
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:51,660
But every day, I live

617
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,400
in remorse and agony.

618
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,330
If I had

619
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,010
stayed put

620
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:59,850
and waited for the rescue team,

621
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,570
everything would have

622
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,370
turned out differently.

623
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,850
So you founded

624
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,240
Light Chaser Rescue

625
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,050
to make amends?

626
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:24,090
It can never be amended.

627
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:27,130
I don't care

628
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,130
if I'm a hero

629
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:29,610
or a sinner anymore.

630
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:32,200
Yan,

631
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,850
I only hope you can forgive me.

632
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:40,640
So that when I see your mother,

633
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:42,530
she won't blame me.

634
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:48,280
Zhan Yan.

635
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:49,160
Sir.

636
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,800
Your father's operation,

637
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:51,760
I have instructed Dr. Liu

638
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:52,800
to perform it.

639
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:53,930
Don't worry.

640
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,930
Thank you, sir.

641
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,610
Zhan Yan, cheer up.

642
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,450
Yan.

643
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:24,280
Don't worry.

644
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:26,280
You will be fine.

645
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:28,490
I will be here waiting for you.

646
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:35,050
Captain, don't worry.

647
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:35,530
Captain,

648
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,160
we'll keep you company.

649
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:36,970
Stay strong.

650
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:40,090
Zhan Yan.

651
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:50,640
Stay strong, Captain.

652
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,720
Stay strong, Captain.

653
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:08,300
(Zhan Qingshan In Operation)

654
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,360
Keep waiting. Be patient.

655
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,280
When I performed

656
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:01,130
an operation,

657
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,530
time would go so fast.

658
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,010
A 5-hour operation

659
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:08,450
felt like an everyday chore.

660
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:10,940
(Zhan Qingshan In Operation)

661
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,160
It is the first time

662
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,010
for me to realize

663
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:15,320
that time out here can be
painfully slow.

664
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,890
Empathy is a rare kind

665
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:20,050
of human emotion,

666
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,800

are especially important.

(In-patient)

The doctor said

672
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,930
the operation was a success.

673
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:49,760
I need to recuperate in peace.

674

Don't come visit me all the time.

675
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:52,840
OK?

676
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:01,610
I see Dr. Zhan is here in person.

677
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:04,760
You're getting well fast.

678
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:05,970
The dose for you

679

can be reduced from today on.

If everything goes well,

you'll be out of the hospital
next week.

Next week?

683

Shouldn't a severe case

684
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:18,320
like me stay

685
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:19,680
in the hospital longer?

686
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,010
There will be me alone at home.

687

Whereas here,

688
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:25,200
I'll just ring the bell

689

to call the doctors

690
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,840
or nurses.

OK.

afflicted with

some fetal disease

Captain,

699
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,320
I'll come clean.

700
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,890
Please don't be mad.

701
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:56,720
What?

702
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,570
Here's the thing.

703
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:02,090
Shen Ruoxi and I

704
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,720
put on a show.

705
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:09,260
(Cardia – benign tumor
Further examination suggested)

706
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,410
Are you going to cheat him?

707
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:11,360
I don't like the idea.

708
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,530
This is our only option.

709
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:14,680
But Zhan Yan

710
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,720
won't let me get away with it.

711
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:17,680
You're her best friend.

712
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,010
Don't you want to take the opportunity

713
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,970
to fix their relationship?

714
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:22,010
Of course, I do.

715
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:22,410
But it's…

716
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:24,280
No but.

717
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:25,800
Shen Ruoxi,

718
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,640
after the operation is done,

719
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,610
Zhan Yan will go to Fengxi,

720
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,840
and there won't be another chance.

721
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:37,200
Tell me.

722
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:39,090
What should I do?

723
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:52,720
And you know the rest.

724
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:54,760
We intentionally

725
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:57,800
mentioned your disease,

726
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:59,490
and tricked you into thinking

727
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,840
that you had an incurable disease.

728
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,010
I admit that I play

729
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:07,840
a little mind trick on you, sir.

730
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:10,320
Luo Ben, this is so dirty.

731
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:11,200
Yeah.

732
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:12,930
I'm apologizing, aren't I?

733
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,890
You managed to cheat me.

734
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,130
So you had the conversation with me

735
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:17,930
because you thought

736
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:20,240
you had an uncurable disease,
didn't you?

737
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,640
Here's the test result.

738
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,010
Look for yourself.

739
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,610
Thankfully, I'm not a coward,

740
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,610
or you could've

741
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,930
scared me to death.

742
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:44,610
Look what you did!

743
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,140
It's her birthday.

744
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,760
I'll need to give her
a birthday present, right?

745
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:55,760
My future mother-in-law is so rich,

746
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:56,570
what should I buy?

747
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,050
She needs nothing.

748
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:00,160
What do I do?

749
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,010
Cosmetics?

750
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,320
How about cosmetics?

751
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:06,490
No.

752
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,090
Clothes?

753
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,640
I can't give her clothes, can I?

754
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,160
I don't know what her style is.

755
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,840
Oral solution?

756
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,800
T-This?

757
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:20,450
Seriously?

758
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,980
(Time to Stay
Women's pursuit of a lifetime)

759
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:28,530
Time to stay,

760
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,930
women's pursuit of a lifetime?

761
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:33,840
I like the idea.

762
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,090
Only 1,998?

763
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:39,800
Too expensive.

764
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:43,930
No, it's too expensive, Yuan.

765
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:51,050
All right, this is it, then.

766
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,800
In the name of love. Let's go.

767
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,620
(Fuermei Oral Solution)

768
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:02,130
What are you looking at?

769
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,970
You startled me.

770
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,130
I'm here to apologize to you,

771
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,970
aren't I?

772
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:09,490
And to be fair,

773
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,160
it was Luo Ben's idea.

774
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,970
Why do you trust him so much?

775
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:16,360
You even conspired with him

776
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:18,090
against your friend.

777
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,490
Conspire?

778
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,680
It's true love.

779
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,530
Think about it.

780
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,010
If it hadn't been for his idea

781
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:25,050
that gave Mr. Zhan a push,

782
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:25,800
you wouldn't have

783
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:27,280
forgiven him.

784
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:28,360
Also,

785
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:30,570
Luo Ben really cares about you.

786
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,160
You were about
to leave him for Fengxi,

787
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,760
but he still worked

788
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:36,240
to fix the relationship
between you and your dad.

789
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:37,570
He's a good man,

790
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,570
and you should hold on to him.

791
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:41,800
Seriously.

792
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,930
Don't go to Fengxi.

793
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,280
You two

794
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:46,450
are in a key stage

795
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:47,760
of your relationship.

796
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:49,800
A step forward, you'll be complete.

797
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:52,280
A step backward, you'll be over.

798
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:57,240
I mean,

799
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,010
there will be other projects,

800
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,680
but there won't
be another Luo Ben.

801
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:01,930
You don't want

802
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:03,360
to miss out on him.

803
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:04,450
Make a guess.

804
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:05,410
If the president knows

805
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:08,240
that you cheated the patient,

806
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,130
what punishment will you get?

807
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:13,840
I'll accept any punishment

808
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,200
for the sake of your happiness.

809
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:19,840
All right, all right.

810
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,800
Did you renew the medicine
for Bed No. 4?

811
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:24,050
I'm going to.

812
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:26,010
Just think about it.

813
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:27,640
You don't want

814
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:29,410
to regret losing him someday.

815
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:30,450
I'm off.

816
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,130
