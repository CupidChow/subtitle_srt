1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,850
♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

3
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,220
♫  I put out mountain fires  ♫

4
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:22,150
♫  and catch the sunset  ♫

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,550
♫  I leave the rhythms of life in my wake  ♫

6
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:35,620
♫  Happiness whispers in my ears  ♫

7
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,470
♫  Chasing the passion for the future  ♫

8
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:43,520
♫  Like a dream maker  ♫

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,470
♫  Reading the universe and stars  ♫

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,620
♫  My existence in the river of time  ♫

11
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,570
♫  With the body temperature of a moment  ♫

12
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:02,170
♫  I'm trying to be the extension of light  ♫

13
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:08,870
♫  If the world grants me a frustrating opening  ♫

14
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:15,520
♫  I'll chase back time like a dark horse  ♫

15
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:22,250
♫  Even though I know the truth, I won't be afraid  ♫

16
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:28,200
♫  I won't miss the moon because of mediocrity  ♫

17
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,770
♫  I won't lose the light  ♫

18
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,920

19
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,980

20
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,020
Look. You're good at this.

21
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:54,760
Mr. Gao, waiting for Shen Ruoxi?

22
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,339
Good luck.

23
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:23,679
Shen Rouxi, can't you hurry up?

24
00:02:23,679 --> 00:02:27,099
Why do you wear such high shoes for team-building activities?

25
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:33,260
You're right. Huh?

26
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:38,600
But I think you should also reflect on yourself.

27
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,020
A business watch for a casual outfit.

28
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,480
You can look at it eight times a minute

29
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,860
just in case others don’t know that it is an expensive one.

30
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,640
You are one to talk. Why are you attacking me personally?

31
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,599
If you walk in this way, we're going to be the last ones.

32
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:59,559
Anyway, there is already a number one.

33
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:01,920
Why can't we be happy?

34
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,300
I'm just going to take this as a trip.

35
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,579
You help yourself.

36
00:03:07,579 --> 00:03:10,299
Rest. Rest in place.

37
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:19,279
In fact, at first, I had nothing but admiration for Luo Ben.

38
00:03:19,279 --> 00:03:21,380
But when I left him,

39
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,119
I found that I kind of relied on him,

40
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,860
especially the tacit agreement

41
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:28,359
and habits we developed together,

42
00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:31,200
which were irreplaceable by others.

43
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,199
But your presence makes me a little jealous.

44
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,379
An outstanding woman likes my boyfriend.

45
00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:41,779
It means Luo Ben is really a good person,

46
00:03:41,779 --> 00:03:43,519
and also means that I have good taste.

47
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,160
Dr. Zhan is very generous.

48
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,180
No wonder Luo Ben likes you.

49
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,800
Ariel is straightforward, too.

50
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,580
After all, we are all adults.

51
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,140
We put everything out in the open

52
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,760
and just go for what we want.

53
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,319
Fine. Good luck.

54
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,019
Luo Ben.

55
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,279
You two are having so much fun on the way.

56
00:04:08,279 --> 00:04:09,599
What were you talking about?

57
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,580
Did Ariel say anything bad about me?

58
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,760
Yes, I did.

59
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,880
I wonder if Dr. Zhan would mind it.

60
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,440
Of course not.

61
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,619
Every word Ariel said was in your favor.

62
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,700
That's right!

63
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,520
After all, we've been partners for so many years.

64
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,819
We have our tacit understanding.

65
00:04:25,819 --> 00:04:27,980
Why are you here alone?

66
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,459
He walks slowly. I'm waiting for him.

67
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:33,299
Then we'll go first.

68
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:35,479
Go ahead.

69
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:46,100
Wait for me at the Tree of Love.

70
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,140
See you.

71
00:05:03,499 --> 00:05:04,900
Are you okay?

72
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,240
I feel pain in my chest when breathing.

73
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,780
Give me a moment.

74
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,880
I'll wait for you.

75
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,180
I'm fine. I don't go out very often.

76
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,440
I'd like to take a walk and enjoy myself.

77
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,839
All right, then. I'm going to go.

78
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:09,860
- What's wrong with you? 
 - Accidental injury.

79
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:12,199
Accidental injury?

80
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:13,780
Let me see it.

81
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,339
Good for you.

82
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,680
- Here. 
 - You can't blame me for this.

83
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,660
You're so stupid. Of course, I can blame you.

84
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:26,359
Are you capable of this?

85
00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:30,099
Wait! Don't rush me.

86
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:34,599
You got a lot of things here.

87
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:37,100
I prepared these things for you.

88
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,599
- Hold it. 
 - That hurt!

89
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:46,240
I know. Just a moment.

90
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,780
Come here.

91
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,379
Don't move.

92
00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:55,680
Look!

93
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,560
A mosquito. Look!

94
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,800
It's true.

95
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,299
I see it. Get away.

96
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,279
Listen.

97
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:07,540
Don't think I bandage you because I want to help you.

98
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,680
I just hate hearing you moan and haw.

99
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,540
Just a small cut from a leaf. Look at you!

100
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,960
How can you think this way?

101
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,359
Such a wound cannot be taken lightly. What if the leaf is poisonous?

102
00:07:18,359 --> 00:07:21,979
- What if I get tetanus? 
 - Yeah. Yeah. You're right about everything.

103
00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:23,780
You're not careful at all.

104
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,560
You couldn't be more right.

105
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,059
Don't move.

106
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:33,760
There's no one behind us. I'm afraid we really are the last.

107
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,019
Well, thanks to you.

108
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:40,359
It's you who delayed me at the beginning.

109
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:41,600
I'm done. Are we going or not?

110
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,219
Help me.

111
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,980
Help you? It hurts.

112
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,100
So annoying.

113
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,259
Wait for me!

114
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,820
- Such a stumbling block. 
 - Wait for me!

115
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,259
So annoying.

116
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:23,459
 Luo Ben, where are you?

117
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:25,259
 I'm lost.

118
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,179
Where are you?

119
00:08:28,179 --> 00:08:30,180
Where is Zhan Yan?

120
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:34,039
I walked slowly, so Dr. Zhan went first.

121
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:36,499
I don't know where I am now.

122
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,880
Ariel, show me your surroundings.

123
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,040
Okay.

124
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,759
Stay where you are. I'll come to find you.

125
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:58,340
Okay.

126
00:09:03,099 --> 00:09:05,239
My wound won't get infected, will it?

127
00:09:05,239 --> 00:09:07,580
No. It's not a big deal.

128
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:19,359
I just saw a guy over there. It looks like Luo Ben.

129
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,300
Am I wrong?

130
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,180
That's not our route. It can't be him.

131
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,819
You're right.

132
00:09:25,819 --> 00:09:27,599
Luo Ben is faster than us.

133
00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:29,940
He must be ahead of us.

134
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,640
How long will it take to get there?

135
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,380
We've finished about two-thirds of the way.

136
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:42,940
I feel like I've spent the first half of my life walking this route.

137
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:46,100
Then your life is rough enough.

138
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:51,100
It's mainly because I met someone unreliable.

139
00:09:52,499 --> 00:09:55,820
Then you should keep your eyes open.

140
00:09:57,739 --> 00:09:59,539
Oh my goodness.

141
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,600
What?

142
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,300
Let's take a rest.

143
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,200
Whose is this?

144
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,320
So uncivilized.

145
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,899
Wastes water and even litters.

146
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,059
Ariel, are you okay?

147
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,080
Ariel.

148
00:11:13,219 --> 00:11:14,539
Ariel.

149
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:16,259
 I'm here!

150
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,439
Ariel.

151
00:11:26,939 --> 00:11:29,880
Neither of them answered the phone?

152
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,719
Zhan Yan.

153
00:11:36,719 --> 00:11:38,439
I finally see you.

154
00:11:38,439 --> 00:11:40,179
Are you waiting for us?

155
00:11:40,179 --> 00:11:41,520
Have you seen Luo Ben?

156
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,160
Luo Ben is not here?

157
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,880
Shen Ruoxi, that man you saw just now,

158
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,119
was he really Luo Ben?

159
00:11:47,119 --> 00:11:48,240
I'm not sure.

160
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,999
I just saw a figure walking down the path over there.

161
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,339
Let's not wait here.

162
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:58,100
We should join the others at the Tree of Love.

163
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,279
The route was designed by Luo Ben. He knows it better than anyone.

164
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,260
- Let's go and wait for him there. 
 - Okay.

165
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,320
Let's go.

166
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,919
Wait.

167
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,619
Come here.

168
00:12:27,619 --> 00:12:28,759
We arrived.

169
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:30,460
Finally.

170
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,440
Finally, you've arrived.

171
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,679
What took you so long to get here?

172
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:38,620
-  Get up there and take a photo. 
 - That's right.

173
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,780
I don't want to.

174
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:42,680
Why not? We should remember this day we spent together.

175
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,079
- That's right. 
 - Go.

176
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,020
- Take a photo over there. 
 - I won't. Listen. Don't mess with me.

177
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,760
Who came first?

178
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,119
Mr. He, we, groups two and four, were both first.

179
00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:54,340
Two groups.

180
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,040
Good. Both will be rewarded.

181
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:00,199
Mr. He is so generous.

182
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:02,540
Where's Luo Ben?

183
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,419
I haven't seen him.

184
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,979
Weren't you together?

185
00:13:06,979 --> 00:13:11,199
Ah! Ariel, the lawyer, is not here, either.

186
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:14,939
Zhan Yan, maybe I can help you search for Mr. Luo.

187
00:13:14,939 --> 00:13:17,660
- Let's... 
 - That's okay. I can go myself.

188
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,860
Don't go by yourself.

189
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,799
You young guys go with Dr. Zhan to find Luo Ben.

190
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:23,639
No need.

191
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:25,260
They are coming.

192
00:13:29,139 --> 00:13:31,080
- What happened? 
 - Let's go.

193
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,339
Let's go and see.

194
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,940
Slowly.

195
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,019
Be careful.

196
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:41,059
Where did you fall?

197
00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:42,660
Don't worry.

198
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,059
Is it serious? Are you okay?

199
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:50,320
- We're fine. Don't worry. 
 - Good.

200
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,039
- Does any part else hurt? 
 - No.

201
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,959
Let's go.

202
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:56,179
Slowly. Be careful.

203
00:14:21,259 --> 00:14:23,700
Scheme. It was absolutely a scheme.

204
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,920
In my opinion, she just went the wrong way on purpose.

205
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,810
and then asked Luo Ben to save her.

206
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,839
I don't think so. She did fall down.

207
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,200
Luckily it was just a scratch.

208
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,040
What if something really serious happened?

209
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,680
I've seen a lot of love stories, and learned a lot of schemes.

210
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,940
On the first day, she talked with Luo Ben all the time.

211
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,920
On the second day, she pretended to be lost,

212
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,340
and told Luo Ben that there was a bottle of water where I got lost. Bah.

213
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:52,659
As far as I can see, the bottle was set by herself so that Luo Ben could find her.

214
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:56,820
Maybe the fall was also well-designed.

215
00:14:57,439 --> 00:15:01,819
If so, Ariel is such an insidious woman.

216
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:04,460
Zhan Yan, you should be careful.

217
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:07,879
That's right, Zhan Yan. You should take it seriously.

218
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:09,699
She's a very scrupulous person.

219
00:15:09,699 --> 00:15:13,259
You can't be so innocent. You should stop her.

220
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,519
If that's the case and Luo Ben can only see her, then I'm blind.

221
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:24,059
Pay attention! You should listen to us.

222
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:27,220
This is a war. A war of love.

223
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,619
If you stand still, you will lose.

224
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,779
I'll tell Gao Junchi to deal with her.

225
00:15:42,219 --> 00:15:47,979
It's not a big deal. We just took a photo under the Tree of Love.

226
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:56,480
What is the worst mistake in this case?

227
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,979
The rescue team that arrived earlier searched the scene

228
00:16:00,979 --> 00:16:04,120
and found no victims or trapped people.

229
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,219
However, they did not mark clearly the search results,

230
00:16:08,219 --> 00:16:13,859
causing subsequent teams to enter the scene and search again,

231
00:16:13,859 --> 00:16:16,719
which wasted valuable rescue time and effort.

232
00:16:16,719 --> 00:16:18,600
In the second case,

233
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,620
after entering the scene,

234
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,339
the rescue team did not detect harmful gases,

235
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:26,900
resulting in the follow-up team members

236
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,960
inhaling a large number of toxic gases,

237
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,260
seriously endangering the health and life safety of the team members,

238
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:37,019
not to mention completing the rescue mission.

239
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:53,700
Yuan Yuan, are you reading or fantasizing about romance?

240
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:06,319
 Tomorrow my brother will meet with Xiong Fei's parents.

241
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,340
Meeting?

242
00:17:08,999 --> 00:17:11,980
Will they talk about the marriage?

243
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:16,200
Oh, god. You're talking about getting married.

244
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:17,839
No wonder!

245
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,779
No wonder I saw your brother writing something to Xiong Fei.

246
00:17:20,779 --> 00:17:23,259
Maybe they were talking about this.

247
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,160
Parents of both sides will meet soon.

248
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,660
But for me? Zhou Mingming's mother hasn't accepted me yet,

249
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,720
not to mention meet each other's parents.

250
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,940
Why am I so miserable?

251
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:42,320
Rest assured. I'm not going to await my doom and do nothing.

252
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,340
If she doesn't accept me, I can find a way to make her accept me.

253
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:49,820
Not only so, I will let her approve of me, respect me,

254
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,299
and think highly of me.

255
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:55,080
Damn it!

256
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,579
Keep working!

257
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,860
Thank you.

258
00:18:07,199 --> 00:18:08,880
Thank you.

259
00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:14,379
You lost your parents when you were kids.

260
00:18:14,379 --> 00:18:16,359
And you've looked out for each other since then.

261
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:18,019
It's not easy.

262
00:18:18,019 --> 00:18:20,839
You are really great.

263
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:22,799
I'm flattered.

264
00:18:23,639 --> 00:18:30,239
I believe the wedding day can be well decided by you.

265
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,760
I had someone check it out.

266
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,359
The sixth day of the next lunar month is a good day.

267
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:37,760
The sixth day.

268
00:18:38,879 --> 00:18:42,379
Time might be a little tight,

269
00:18:42,379 --> 00:18:46,380
but that doesn't matter as there is nothing special to prepare.

270
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:06,620
This house is my gift for their wedding.

271
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:11,879
No. We can't take it.

272
00:19:11,879 --> 00:19:13,639
Yes.

273
00:19:13,639 --> 00:19:16,440
It's too expensive. We can't take it.

274
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,660
How can the new couple live in your house?

275
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,380
That's true.

276
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:24,499
I want to solve the housing problem by myself.

277
00:19:24,499 --> 00:19:27,539
I want to rent a house first, and buy a new one after saving enough money.

278
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:32,180
Yuan Yuan, I promise I will work hard and give you a perfect home.

279
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:39,540
In fact, after the wedding, we are a family.

280
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:45,560
I wish for the new couple to live comfortably and happily.

281
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:51,880
 Ben, after the wedding, we'll live in our own home.

282
00:19:53,639 --> 00:19:55,220
Yuan Yuan.

283
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,499
 Since Mom and Dad passed away,

284
00:19:58,499 --> 00:20:02,859
 you've been going out to work every day to support our family.

285
00:20:02,859 --> 00:20:07,459
 I was often alone at home with no one to talk with.

286
00:20:08,219 --> 00:20:10,979
 But things are different now.

287
00:20:10,979 --> 00:20:14,320
 I finally have my mom and dad again,

288
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,779
 and also a sister.

289
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,459
 I want to live with them.

290
00:20:24,459 --> 00:20:26,680
 This is my wish.

291
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:30,160
 Please say yes.

292
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:44,619
Yuan Yuan said she likes the family atmosphere.

293
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:51,319
She wants to live with Uncle and Auntie.

294
00:20:54,660 --> 00:21:00,159
Yuan Yuan, as long as you're happy, I respect your opinion.

295
00:21:18,879 --> 00:21:22,579
Yuan Yuan, drink a glass of milk.

296
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,819
You are picking your wedding dress.

297
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:36,299
In such a hurry?

298
00:21:39,699 --> 00:21:42,040
Look! It's so beautiful, isn't it?

299
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,000
isn't it?

300
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,939
 Ben, I don't want to leave you.

301
00:21:49,739 --> 00:21:51,919
Liar.

302
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:06,039
Here. Take it.

303
00:22:08,339 --> 00:22:11,880
Yuan Yuan, listen to me.

304
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,860
You want to live with the Xiong family.

305
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,420
I have no opinion about it.

306
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:19,819
But you should also take the house.

307
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,320
It can give you a sense of safety.

308
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:25,259
Imagine.

309
00:22:25,259 --> 00:22:28,839
If you are in a bad mood and want to stay alone,

310
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:31,699
or you meet something unhappy

311
00:22:31,699 --> 00:22:33,620
and don't want to talk with anyone,

312
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:36,239
you can just stay in this house.

313
00:22:36,239 --> 00:22:39,140
It is your safest haven.

314
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,059
Just take it as I say.

315
00:22:47,639 --> 00:22:49,539
Good girl.

316
00:23:09,459 --> 00:23:11,060
Available?

317
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,760
What's the matter?

318
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,280
I want to go back to your group.

319
00:23:20,539 --> 00:23:21,639
Why?

320
00:23:21,639 --> 00:23:23,800
You know about my situation over there.

321
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,179
You just got a promotion to senior partner. I think you need more hands.

322
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:29,480
Recruiting is not the best choice.

323
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,480
I can help you.

324
00:23:32,699 --> 00:23:35,259
But in the future, I'm still going to take legal aid cases.

325
00:23:35,259 --> 00:23:38,760
It won't do you much good for promotion in the firm.

326
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:43,759
I've figured it out. You're right. Legal aid cases have their value.

327
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,299
My rescue missions may delay the process of business cases.

328
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:51,579
That's the reason why you need me.

329
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:00,299
Gao Junchi has agreed to let you go?

330
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:03,799
If you accept me, I'll talk to him.

331
00:24:05,399 --> 00:24:08,159
Be prepared for the new job.

332
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,599
Okay.

333
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:22,779
Honey, aren't you taking me to school to see Zhuangzhuang?

334
00:24:22,779 --> 00:24:25,499
Why did you bring me to the hospital?

335
00:24:25,499 --> 00:24:26,800
You're feeling sick, right?

336
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,740
Let's get some medicine first so that Zhuangzhuang won't be worried.

337
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:33,299
You're right. Then you go.

338
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:36,320
Wait for me right here. Don't go anywhere.

339
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,399
Go. Just go.

340
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:58,320

341
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,520
Honey!

342
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,580
Zhuangzhuang. Honey, come here.

343
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,779
What's wrong?

344
00:25:10,779 --> 00:25:12,400
Our Zhuangzhuang. Zhuangzhuang is here.

345
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,280
I told you not to wander around.

346
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,380
Look! Zhuangzhuang.

347
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,599
Didn't you say he was at school?

348
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:21,820
Why is he a doctor here?

349
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,479
- Zhuangzhuang. 
 - Lanzhi, let's go.

350
00:25:24,479 --> 00:25:26,079
Let's go to another hospital.

351
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:28,299
No, I won't go. My son's here.

352
00:25:28,299 --> 00:25:29,919
Let's go. Let's go to another hospital.

353
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,739
No. I don't.

354
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:33,539
I want to see my son. My son is here.

355
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:34,980
I won't go to any other hospitals.

356
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,119
He's not Zhuangzhuang. Don't break it.

357
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,619
He's not Zhuangzhuang. Let's go.

358
00:25:38,619 --> 00:25:39,619
- I want to see my son. 
 - Just go.

359
00:25:39,619 --> 00:25:41,639
- Madam. 
 - Let's go.

360
00:25:41,639 --> 00:25:43,240
Is there anything I can help you with?

361
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,599
Girls, you two must be Zhuangzhuang's colleagues.

362
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:49,019
You can take me to see him.

363
00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:51,550
Who is Zhuangzhuang, Madam?

364
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,499
Director Cai.

365
00:25:54,499 --> 00:25:57,219
I'm his mother. I'm his mother.

366
00:25:57,219 --> 00:25:58,819
I think you got the wrong person.

367
00:25:58,819 --> 00:26:02,060
Director Cai's parents have already passed away.

368
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,800
Girls, don't worry. I'm sorry for this.

369
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,880
Let's go. Go.

370
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,420
- I won't go. 
 - Let's go.

371
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:13,559
Sir, I assume you're here to see a doctor.

372
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:17,279
- Let me take you to the clinic. 
 - No, thank you. Thank you.

373
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,140
- Let's go. 
 - No.

374
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,960
- I want to see my son. 
 - Lanzhi.

375
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,760
Zhangzhuang is at school.

376
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,240
- Zhangzhuang is at school. 
 - My son is here.

377
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,039
- He's at school. 
 - Let me see him.

378
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,960
- At school. 
 - I want to see my son.

379
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,280
I've checked all the wards and departments.

380
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,080
Very good.

381
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,720
Dr. Zhan.

382
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:43,059
Sorry, Dean. I've just finished my work.

383
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:44,679
That's okay.

384
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:48,480
I asked you to come here because I want to tell you good news.

385
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,139
The International Medical Union has a medical laboratory grant program in Fengxi.

386
00:26:54,139 --> 00:26:57,619
Next week, Professor Coben will represent the union to come to China and

387
00:26:57,619 --> 00:27:00,919
choose an assistant who will participate in the program throughout.

388
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:02,679
That's great.

389
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:05,479
Professor Coben is the well-known oncologist, right?

390
00:27:05,479 --> 00:27:06,800
Yes, he is.

391
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:11,000
This program is strongly supported internationally.

392
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,939
It will be of great help to both your career and your academics.

393
00:27:14,939 --> 00:27:19,240
The selection includes an operation and a defense.

394
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,860
You guys get ready for this.

395
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:26,739
Dean, how long will the program last?

396
00:27:26,739 --> 00:27:29,320
Three years. It's a rare opportunity.

397
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:34,720
No matter who is chosen, it's a credit to our hospital.

398
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,140
Take advantage of it.

399
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,399
Yes, we will.

400
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,900
We will.

401
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:46,699

402
00:27:46,699 --> 00:27:48,239
Zhan Yan.

403
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:52,080
You didn't seem really interested just now.

404
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,599
Is it because of Mr. Luo?

405
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:56,099
Of course not.

406
00:27:56,099 --> 00:27:58,720
Such a great opportunity.

407
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,800
He'd definitely support my career.

408
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,299
Good.

409
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:08,140
Looks like your target won't be changed by anyone.

410
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,520
It's a good thing.

411
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,799
If you're not in, there's no point for me to compete alone.

412
00:28:14,699 --> 00:28:16,359
Don't forget.

413
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:20,610
My thesis was about Coben.

414
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,040
Of course, I remember it.

415
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:27,560
At that time, I helped you review the literature.

416
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:33,520
But you've just been appointed as deputy director.

417
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:38,380
Are you willing to give up everything here and go to Fengxi?

418
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:41,340
Don't forget.

419
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:45,499
Though my thesis is not about this,

420
00:28:45,499 --> 00:28:48,040
I know as much as you do.

421
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:52,320
This program is bound to involve the front end of cancer treatment.

422
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,639
Very few people in the world have access to it.

423
00:28:54,639 --> 00:28:56,900
I'll definitely go for it.

424
00:28:57,539 --> 00:28:59,800
I'll wait and see.

425
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,199
Okay.

426
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,199
Three years? Are you mad?

427
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,000
What's wrong?

428
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,660
Long-distance relationships are the most unstable relationships in the world.

429
00:29:20,639 --> 00:29:24,039
Traffic is developed now. We can see each other whenever we want.

430
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:25,660
You are so naive.

431
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:28,359
Couples passionately in love can't be too close.

432
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:30,499
You two are so busy. You don't have time to run around.

433
00:29:30,499 --> 00:29:34,180
We're all adults without any separation anxiety.

434
00:29:38,199 --> 00:29:40,560
Then it's over.

435
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:45,519
The result of being separated is insecurity about relationships.

436
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:47,100
You may start arguing.

437
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,679
And at last, others will step in.

438
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:54,039
You can't give others such an opportunity, especially Ariel.

439
00:29:55,839 --> 00:30:00,859
Even if I don't go and stay here, I can't be by his side every day.

440
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:03,839
If other people can really step into our relationship,

441
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:07,140
it just means that we were not right for each other.

442
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,399
You are so...

443
00:30:09,399 --> 00:30:13,580
Then have you told Luo Ben?

444
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,060
It hasn't been decided yet.

445
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:20,320
If it is decided, it will be too late.

446
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,699
I think the sooner you tell him, the better.

447
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:38,639
Please enjoy your meal.

448
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,199
Such a grand deal.

449
00:30:44,199 --> 00:30:45,620
Don't you like it?

450
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:48,500
Of course, I love what you prepared.

451
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,779
It's just...

452
00:30:50,779 --> 00:30:55,439
Why do I feel so uneasy?

453
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:01,010
Luo Ben.

454
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:09,860
Today...

455
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:18,860
It's about work.

456
00:31:19,439 --> 00:31:21,320
Won't you reply to it?

457
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,460
It's Ariel reporting work progress. It's nothing.

458
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:27,259
Doesn't she work for Mr. Gao? Why does she report to you?

459
00:31:27,259 --> 00:31:28,800
She came back to my group.

460
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,660
You agreed?

461
00:31:31,499 --> 00:31:33,679
Yes.

462
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:37,439
She was on my team in the past. And she works well with me.

463
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:39,340
It's a good thing.

464
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,700
What were you trying to say?

465
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:07,380
Then I'll enjoy the meal.

466
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:27,680

467
00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:58,359
Zhan Yan and Cai Yuxiao are the best doctors in our hospital.

468
00:32:58,359 --> 00:33:01,000
They are both eager to join your program.

469
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,280
It's very difficult to choose between these two.

470
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,779
- They are both excellent. 
 - It's very difficult to choose between these two.

471
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:09,359
They are both excellent.

472
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:13,480
Yuan Yuan, I think every dress suits you well.

473
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,399
Just try more. Take your time.

474
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:17,199
I'll wait for you.

475
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,060
You want me to try on this one?

476
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,360
Okay. I'll try it.

477
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,280
It looks good.

478
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,599
Ms. Luo, please follow me.

479
00:33:52,199 --> 00:33:53,860
Hello. Who is it?

480
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:56,620
I'm Zhou Mingming's mom.

481
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,779
Dong...

482
00:33:59,779 --> 00:34:02,620
 Hello. Mrs. Dong.

483
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,520
I want to see you.

484
00:34:08,439 --> 00:34:10,800
You're so beautiful.

485
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,679
Even I want to marry you.

486
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,780
I'm jealous of Xiong Fei.

487
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:18,219
Let me help you with your dress.

488
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:24,019
Listen. Just now, Zhou Mingming's mom called me, saying she wants to see me.

489
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,859
She was in a hurry.

490
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:32,460
Is she trying to buy me off to break up with her son?

491
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:36,600
Anyway, I won't say yes if she offers me half a million yuan.

492
00:34:37,339 --> 00:34:39,540
If it is five million,

493
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,399
then I'll buy a house next to yours.

494
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,860
So I can go to see you every day. Right?

495
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,780
But five million...

496
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:54,099
Spending the break-up fee on a house seems a little shallow.

497
00:34:54,099 --> 00:34:56,639
I'm not a shallow person.

498
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,640
Yuan Yuan.

499
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,719
What if she offers me 50 million?

500
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:08,640
This is too much for me.

501
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,880
I'll definitely be bought off by 50 million.

502
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:16,860
I'm afraid that if I agree with her unconsciously, will Mingming hate me?

503
00:35:21,639 --> 00:35:23,339
How do I look?

504
00:35:33,299 --> 00:35:34,640
Try another one?

505
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,670

506
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:39,499
Welcome.

507
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,199
Yuan Yuan.

508
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:25,360
You two are not suitable, not to mention marry each other.

509
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:30,219
I didn't think that far.

510
00:36:30,219 --> 00:36:33,319
Did Mingming say he wanted to marry me?

511
00:36:34,379 --> 00:36:37,119
It's good you don't have such thoughts.

512
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:39,459
Our Mingming is busy with his career.

513
00:36:39,459 --> 00:36:41,799
You can't influence him.

514
00:36:42,419 --> 00:36:44,539
Don't worry. I'm busy, too.

515
00:36:44,539 --> 00:36:46,639
I have no time to influence him.

516
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:51,719
Instead, you can tell him that it's better to stop judging my work.

517
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:57,340
Mingming needs someone who can help him in his work and career.

518
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,440
Obviously, you're not such a person.

519
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,700
Auntie,

520
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:07,440
you sound so much like Assistant Li.

521
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,740
It's now the 21st century.

522
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:12,620
The relationship between young people is not as complicated as you think.

523
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,660
Happiness is all it takes.

524
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:17,079
You don't understand.

525
00:37:17,779 --> 00:37:21,660
Anyway, you and Mingming are not from the same world.

526
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,219
I'm telling you not just as a mother,

527
00:37:24,219 --> 00:37:27,620
but as a woman,

528
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:31,260
that you two will come to a no good end.

529
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:38,280
I think you should go back and ask Mingming for his opinion on this.

530
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,419
Love is a business of two.

531
00:37:41,419 --> 00:37:44,179
I can't make the decision on my own.

532
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:45,840
And to tell you the truth.

533
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,280
I think Mingming likes me very much.

534
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,420
He may not agree with you.

535
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,360
You're so unreasonable.

536
00:38:00,059 --> 00:38:03,799
Haven't you forgotten anything?

537
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:07,740
Why didn't she offer me some money?

538
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,779
No biggie. Problem solved.

539
00:38:10,779 --> 00:38:12,099
Let's go.

540
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,070
Go.

541
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:18,690

542
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:25,020
Dr. Zhan and Dr. Cai are excellent young doctors in our hospital.

543
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:28,959
Professor Coben, what do you think of them?

544
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:33,400
Based on their professional skills, it's hard to pick one.

545
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,030
It's very hard to pick one.

546
00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:40,960
It's a pity that you only have one quota.

547
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,520
I've seen their resumes.

548
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,470
Cai has won many trophies.

549
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:53,980
But you know, I'm looking for somebody who can concentrate and is hard-working.

550
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:57,100
I'm looking for somebody who can concentrate and is hard-working.

551
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,840
Hello.

552
00:39:11,759 --> 00:39:13,260
What?

553
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,739
You knew she was mentally ill.

554
00:39:14,739 --> 00:39:16,259
Why didn't you keep your eye on her?

555
00:39:16,259 --> 00:39:18,300
I went out for medicine. She asked me to tie her up.

556
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,680
But I didn't. I didn't think that she would run away.

557
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,999
Just listen to her. Now she is lost!

558
00:39:22,999 --> 00:39:26,199
This is a crucial time for my career. You shouldn't mess with me.

559
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:27,680
Mess with you?

560
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,000
Your mother is missing. You're still thinking about your career.

561
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,160
Do you have any conscience?

562
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,020
- I... 
 - I made myself clear today.

563
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:38,060
She's your mother.

564
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:42,180
Even if she's old and has lost her mind, you can't tie her up.

565
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:46,640
Even if you are promoted to director, we won't trouble you.

566
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,819
Okay. Dad, don't criticize me at this moment, with so many people watching.

567
00:39:50,819 --> 00:39:52,539
Just think about where my mom would go.

568
00:39:52,539 --> 00:39:55,260
Last time, she came to the hospital by herself. Was she in the hospital?

569
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,940
How about this?

570
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:59,700
You search outside. I'll search inside, okay?

571
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:03,960
Miss, have you seen my wife?

572
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,520
We met once in the hospital.

573
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,479
It's my mom.

574
00:40:09,479 --> 00:40:11,720
- Checked around the hospital? 
 - Yes.

575
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,419
But I can't find her.

576
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:17,059
I'll call the rescue team.

577
00:40:17,059 --> 00:40:18,780
Let them help us.

578
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,339
Okay.

579
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:24,090

580
00:40:24,099 --> 00:40:28,120
- Hello. Have you seen the person in this photo? 
 -  No.

581
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,440
Have you seen her?

582
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,999
Okay. Thanks.

583
00:40:30,999 --> 00:40:32,840
- Have you seen this woman? 
 - No.

584
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,139
- Have you found her? 
 - No.

585
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,920
Mom.

586
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:49,059
Where are you?

587
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,279
Watch yourself.

588
00:41:09,279 --> 00:41:10,920
Sorry.

589
00:41:13,699 --> 00:41:15,219
Mom!

590
00:41:22,779 --> 00:41:25,079
 We've found Dr. Cai's mom.

591
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:34,530

592
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,980
Zirui.

593
00:41:48,699 --> 00:41:51,940
- Dr. Cai hasn't arrived yet? 
 - No.

594
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,159
I'm sorry, Prof. Coben. Shall we call the next one?

595
00:41:57,159 --> 00:41:59,820
Shall we call the next one?

596
00:42:02,379 --> 00:42:04,520
- Next one. 
 - Okay.

597
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,979
Zhan Yan, it's your turn.

598
00:42:31,179 --> 00:42:33,079
Lanzhi.

599
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:36,220
Lanzhi.

600
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:39,719
Lanzhi.

601
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:43,140
Lanzhi.

602
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,940
You're awake.

603
00:42:48,539 --> 00:42:50,539
Lanzhi.

604
00:42:50,539 --> 00:42:52,319
Zhuangzhuang.

605
00:42:53,799 --> 00:42:55,460
Zhuangzhuang.

606
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,399
Zhuangzhuang.

607
00:42:58,399 --> 00:43:01,039
Was school let out?

608
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:03,600
You haven't been home for three years.

609
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,000
Come home with me.

610
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:09,119
Okay, I will. Come home.

611
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,440
Mom.

612
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,059
I'm Zhuangzhuang.

613
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:29,030

614
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:39,310
♫  At first, there was no sadness in the world  ♫

615
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:47,060
♫  Until luck came and crossed the stage  ♫

616
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:54,630
♫  At first, souls were confused and wandered  ♫

617
00:43:56,260 --> 00:44:01,910

618
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:09,880
♫  I've been on the road  ♫

619
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:17,830
♫  Trying to connect laughter and tears  ♫

620
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:25,180
♫  I suddenly have faith  ♫

621
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:32,380
♫  I can walk by millions of shining household lights  ♫

00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:41,210

♫  The good times I'm pursuing belong to the light  ♫

625
00:44:56,230 --> 00:45:03,810
♫  It can light up the wounds that follow  ♫
