The trial of China's first

17
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:44,890
civil non-profit rescue case,

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,890
the Light Chaser Rescue pressing charges

19
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,770
against Juwu Light Chaser Rescue,

20
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,560
will be held in public next Monday.

21
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:50,720
The court proceedings

22
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,840
(Where will China's civil rescue go?)
will be broadcast live.

23
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:54,770
It went serious now.

24
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:56,410
Yeah, I didn't expect this.

25
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,700
(Case of Light Chaser Rescue protecting
its reputation to be heard in public)

26
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,600
How are the preparations going?

27
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,250
Are you confident?

28
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,600
I'll speak with facts.

29
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,930
We can't lose this time.

30
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,690
That's why I need your help.

31
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,440
What can I do?

32
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,280
The current revelations

33
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,000
about Captain Qingshan online

34
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,560
are doubts about

35
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,320
him quitting his job

36
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,720
and becoming

37
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:46,970
a full-time civil rescuer.

38
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,600
They think Captain Qingshan is

39
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,560
making money off public service.

40
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,720
Therefore,

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,560
it would really help our case

42
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,410
if we could prove

43
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,000
Captain Qingshan's

44
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,320
financial status.

45
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,650
Do you want me to testify for him?

46
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,160
You're the perfect one to do it.

47
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:07,930
I'm not doing it.

48
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,930
Zhan Yan.

49
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,690
I have no obligation to do it.

50
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:15,560
Zhan Yan.

51
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,600
He's your father.

52
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,160
Are you gonna

53
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,210
watch him get slandered

54
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,600
and do nothing?

55
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,490
He doesn't need
to make money off anything.

56
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,440
If he does,

57
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,490
he wouldn't have
engaged in public service.

58
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,560
He's got a dozen

59
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,280
gold-plated rescue certificates.

60
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,130
Any one of them

61
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,760
can give him a pretty good life.

62
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:14,700
(Linjiang People's Court)

63
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,840
I will make the following statements

64
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,160
about Captain Qingshan

65
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,810
and the Juwu Light Chaser Rescue

66
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:23,610
illegally making money

67
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:26,560
under the banner

68
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,960
of the Light Chaser Rescue.

69
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,930
The so-called
Juwu Light Chaser Rescue Team

70
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:32,930
used the logo and clothing

71
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,130
of the Light Chaser Rescue

72
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:36,640
without the brand license,

73
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:39,370
and received donations

74
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,000
from the society

75
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,760
in the name of Light Chaser Rescue,

76
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,290
and even openly marked the price

77
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,050
of public service,

78
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,520
(Linjiang People's Court)
which seriously tarnished

79
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:50,320
the long-established brand image

80
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,050
of Light Chaser Rescue

81
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,200
and affected the image

82
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,000
of China's public service.

83
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:57,930
Based on these facts,

84
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,130
as the plaintiff,

85
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,320
we have three requirements.

86
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,200
Firstly,

87
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:05,200
the Juwu rescue team must apologize

88
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,730
to the Light Chaser Rescue
through media.

89
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:09,440
Secondly,

90
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,960
the Juwu rescue team is not allowed

91
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,640
to use the logo
of the Light Chaser Rescue

92
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,560
without authorization.

93
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,130
Thirdly,

94
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,520
the Juwu rescue team

95
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,050
must compensate for

96
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,250
all the losses caused.

97
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,730
Thanks to the court

98
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,130
and the chief judge

99
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:25,880
for allowing

100
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,520
the case of public service

101
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,440
to be heard in public.

102
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:31,400
In fact,

103
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,560
I've finished my defense

104
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,170
as counsel

105
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,490
for the prosecution,

106
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,440
but,

107
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,560
I would like to ask for
the court's permission

108
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,880
to officially introduce

109
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,560
the Light Chaser Rescue Team

110
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,290
to all of you

111
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,200
and to the audience

112
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,370
watching the live broadcast of the trial

113
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,640
for the sake of the image
of China's public service,

114
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,440
so that everyone can truly understand

115
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,810
this group of light chasers.

116
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:00,460
(Judge, Chief Judge, People's Juror, Clerk)

117
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,200
Agreed.

118
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,250
The Light Chaser Rescue is

119
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,250
an officially registered

120
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,810
humanitarian professional rescue team.

121
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,370
The pictures show

122
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,170
the scene of their rescue operations

123
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,290
in Fengxi, Lanling, and other places

124
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,000
where large-scale disasters took place.

125
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,130
This is Falcon.

126
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:34,400
He was the head
of the training department

127
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:36,000
of the Light Chaser Rescue

128
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,520
and an experienced leader

129
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,610
of the rope team.

130
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,490
After joining the Light Chaser Rescue,

131
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,290
he devoted all of his life

132
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,560
(Live broadcast of the trial)
to non-profit rescue.

133
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,640
He had been doing non-profit rescues

134
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,520
before his death.

135
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,490
After his death,

136
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,200
he donated all his savings

137
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,080
to public service.

138
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,050
This is a new member

139
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,400
of our team.

140
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,290
His name is Zhou Mingming.

141
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,050
It's you.

142
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,760
There was a time when he couldn't find

143
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,200
his purpose in life.

144
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,400
He joined the rescue team

145
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,400
on a whim.

146
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,960
But now,

147
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,520
(Light Chaser Rescue)

148
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,520
he is a major member

149
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,610
of our water rescue team.

150
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,810
His mother

151
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,760
tried to persuade him
to donate some money,

152
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,730
instead of doing it himself,

153
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,000
out of concern for his safety.

154
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,440
His friends

155
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,320
wouldn't shake his hand

156
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,520
because he'd just

157
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,880
recovered a body

158
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,200
and they didn't want bad luck.

159
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,370
But even so,

160
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:41,850
Zhou Mingming

161
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,960
still stuck to his choice.

162
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,000
He said rescuing lives

163
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,560
helped him realize

164
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,170
the meaning of life.

165
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,170
Actually,

166
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:58,080
there are many members
like Falcon and Zhou Mingming.

167
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,170
in the Light Chaser Rescue.

168
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,400
Just by knowing

169
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,250
who they are,

170
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,810
you'll know who we are

171
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,930
as a team.

172
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,400
There are bumps

173
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,490
along the way of public service,

174
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:12,810
but,

175
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,050
we will never forget why we started.

176
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,760
As the incident of

177
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,880
Juwu Light Chaser Rescue simmers,

178
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,170
there is a voice of doubt

179
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,320
in online public opinion.

180
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:31,930
Why did Mr. Qingshan,

181
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,880
the founder

182
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,440
and captain

183
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,490
of the Light Chaser Rescue Team,

184
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,370
give up his well-paid career

185
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,090
(Live broadcast of the trial)
as a doctor

186
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:43,160
and devote himself to public service?

187
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,450
Is he trying to

188
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,570
make money

189
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,160
in the name of public service?

190
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,640
Is that Zhan Yan's father?

191
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:00,760
Don't talk.

192
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,260
(Live broadcast of the trial)

193
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,610
I would say yes.

194
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,920
In my opinion,

195
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,370
Mr. Qingshan is indeed

196
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,850
a rich person.

197
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,090
Rich? What does it mean?

198
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:24,160
Why did he say that?

199
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:24,920
I don't know.

200
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,040
What does that mean?

201
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:26,520
Yeah.

202
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:32,490
This is the Medical practitioner's
Qualification Certificate.

203
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,740
(Chinese Ministry of Health
Linjiang Health Bureau)

204
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:43,280
Qingshan

205
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,640
used to be a professional surgeon,

206
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,680
and once a foreign-funded hospital

207
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,850
wanted to hire Qingshan

208
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,280
as the chief of surgery.

209
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,760
The offer is 800,000 a year.

210
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:57,000
800,000?

211
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:00,370
This is

212
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,400
a helicopter winch certificate.

213
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,000
Eighty percent of rescue missions

214
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:07,520
involving helicopters

215
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,640
rely on winches.

216
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm trying to say

217
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:12,610
Qingshan can make an annual salary

218
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,680
of 1 to 1.5 million yuan

219
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,330
with this certificate alone.

220
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,970
That much?

221
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,450
(Vocational Qualification Certificate)

222
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,330
There's also the emergency
rescue certificate,

223
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,970
the mountain rescue certificate,

224
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:28,400
the diver certificate,

225
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:29,610
and the safety officer certificate.

226
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,610
He has many more certificates like this,

227
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,210
and these certificates

228
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,130
value a lot.

229
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:37,880
That's why I said

230
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:39,730
Mr. Qingshan

231
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,280
is a rich man.

232
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,730
Keep quiet.

233
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,490
You might have noticed

234
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,130
that most of the certificates

235
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,800
are about lifesaving.

236
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:16,970
Qingshan devoted

237
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:18,130
all his life

238
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,920
to save lives,

239
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:20,760
and every

240
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,160
certificate here

241
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:24,000
represents that he has

242
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,400
the required skills and abilities.

243
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:27,970
Qingshan worked hard

244
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,800
to become

245
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,280
a skilled rescuer.

246
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:33,730
He made it,

247
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,640
but even with

248
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,040
so many certificates,

249
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,000
he is still

250
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,370
as poor as a church.

251
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,370
Please play the next photo.

252
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,280
This is where Qingshan lives,

253
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,280
a dormitory in the outward bound base

254
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:53,640
of the Light Chaser Rescue.

255
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,680
There are only

256
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,130
a few pieces of furniture.

257
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,090
Qingshan gets

258
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,400
3,000 yuan a month

259
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,160
from the national public welfare grant.

260
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,610
He doesn't have any savings.

261
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:04,210
These are the finances

262
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,520
of Mr. Qingshan,

263
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:09,400
a member of the Communist Party of China,

264
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,920
and the captain

265
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,370
of the Light Chaser Rescue.

266
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,000
The rescuers

267
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:26,090
like Qingshan and Falcon

268
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,850
are from

269
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,210
all walks of life,

270
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,970
and most of them are

271
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,450
the best in their industry.

272
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,680
People like them

273
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:37,880
don't have to join the rescue team

274
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,610
to make money,

275
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,040
and they don't have to

276
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,400
risk their lives to save people

277
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,800
to be famous.

278
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,730
The defendant's fraudulent use

279
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,000
of Light Chaser Rescue's name

280
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,520
was a simple infringement case,

281
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,850
but why is it

282
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,640
heard in public?

283
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,040
Because the defendant's behavior

284
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:56,800
hurt not only

285
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,000
the Light Chaser Rescue,

286
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:00,640
it also hurt

287
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,570
the credibility

288
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,730
of China's civil rescue

289
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:06,000
that is limping along.

290
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:07,330
It hurt the feelings

291
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:09,680
of millions of people who
devote themselves to public service!

292
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,520
I hope this public trial

293
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,520
will give China's public service

294
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,250
a fair

295
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,680
and just verdict!

296
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,450
Well said!

297
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:51,540
(Linjiang People's Court)

298
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:54,490
Luo Ben, you're amazing.

299
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:55,040
You don't know

300
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,000
how many friends we turned to

301
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:56,640
and how hard we tried.

302
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,000
We almost broke our keyboards,

303
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,730
but what you said just beat it all.

304
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,280
You put it so well.

305
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,130
It was touching.

306
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:03,040
I feel like

307
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,130
I should give you a hug.

308
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,210
I don't think

309
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:06,280
that's necessary.

310
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,800
In fact,

311
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,450
we should thank Zhan Yan for this time.

312
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:11,760
She reminded me

313
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,850
to use the captain's certificates

314
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:14,250
to prove his innocence.

315
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,610
I see. You have a helpful girlfriend.

316
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:18,520
You can also

317
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:19,400
be my inept adviser.

318
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,210
We hope this public trial can...

319
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:24,000
Captain!

320
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:25,920
Let more people know...

321
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,880
Captain!

322
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,730
Captain!

323
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,450
Should I invite him

324
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:45,210
to celebrate with us

325
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,400
tonight?

326
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,730
Give him some time alone.

327
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:49,800
Why?

328
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,490
I think he doesn't

329
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:54,730
want to be bothered now.

330
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:38,850
Yan.

331
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:43,680
I resigned from the hospital today

332
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,040
to do rescue work full-time.

333
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,210
We'll have

334
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,640
less pocket money from now on.

335
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,210
I'm here to see you today

336
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:13,730
because I'm happy.

337
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,760
(Dear Wife Zhu Xiaojie)
Yan also showed up

338
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,920
at the trial,

339
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,570
and she provided the attorney

340
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,880
with crucial evidence.

341
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:23,880
I haven't told you yet.

342
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,160
The attorney

343
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,040
is Yan's boyfriend.

344
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,040
He's the reason we won this case today.

345
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:32,250
You must be happy

346
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:33,640
to hear that, right?

347
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:40,450
I founded the Light Chaser Rescue

348
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,920
to make amends.

349
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,250
It has been more than a decade.

350
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:48,160
We've helped a lot of people

351
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:49,570
and saved a lot of lives.

352
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,490
I want this team

353
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:52,680
to get better

354
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,680
and keep going,

355
00:16:58,370 --> 00:16:59,680
but somehow...

356
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:03,090
Xiaojie.

357
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:05,280
I just feel

358
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:07,130
empty inside all the time.

359
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,570
No matter how many people I save,

360
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:15,370
I can't make up for the mistakes I did.

361
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,400
Luo Ben.

362
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,960
(Law Positive Law Firm)
Congratulations on your success.

363
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:27,570
Well done, Attorney Luo.

364
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,720
I watched the trial today

365
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,090
and I was moved.

366
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:35,010
We're just

367
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,240
normal people.

368
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,640
We can't participate in

369
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:38,440
rescue operations personally,

370
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,400
but we will

371
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:41,400
support you

372
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,530
to take cases about non-profit rescue

373
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,530
and to participate in rescue operations.

374
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:46,640
As for senior partners,

375
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:47,810
I've thought it over.

376
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,440
As long as you are
still in Law Positive,

377
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,640
you deserve to be made a senior partner.

378
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,160
Thank you, He.

379
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,570
Congratulations, Attorney Luo.

380
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,960
Congratulations, Attorney Luo.

381
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:00,920
Thank you, guys.

382
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,400
Luo Ben.

383
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:04,570
Maybe we should

384
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,850
meet the ladies at the hospital sometime

385
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,050
to talk about

386
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:07,880
the meaning of rescue.

387
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:10,850
I don't think you

388
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,530
want to learn about rescue.

389
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,770
You just want to
hang out with them, right?

390
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,440
Here comes our captain.

391
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,240
The fish is pretty big.

392
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,330
That's why the good
always prevails the evil.

393
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,370
(For the Light Chaser Rescue)
Yeah!

394
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,440
That's right.

395
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,440
How is it possible?

396
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:04,880
Our department

397
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,480
is busy every day.

398
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,440
Do you think we have time
to hang out with you?

399
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,880
We're not just playing.

400
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,440
We're serious.

401
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,570
We have a lot of high-quality

402
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,610
single male lawyers in the firm.

403
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:17,570
Aren't there also

404
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,240
many single young women in your hospital?

405
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,720
Do you think I have time to organize it?

406
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,440
You don't often attend

407
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:27,880
this kind of group event, do you?

408
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:30,960
Who said that?

409
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,850
You're resisting.

410
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,680
I just don't want you

411
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:36,570
to waste my time

412
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,200
and waste my colleagues' time.

413
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:39,770
Not everyone

414
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,680
is as otherworldly as

415
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:42,290
my girlfriend.

416
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,640
I don't care what you do.

417
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:45,720
I'm not going anyway.

418
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,130
Then what are you gonna do alone?

419
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:47,810
Catch up on sleep.

420
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:51,130
Fine.

421
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,330
I'm not going if you're not going.

422
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,680
I'll catch up on sleep with you.

423
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:00,960
Who said I'm not free?

424
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:02,370
I'm free this weekend.

425
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:03,530
Besides,

426
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,920
I can change my shift.

427
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,570
Don't get too excited.

428
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:08,920
I'm not going.

429
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,090
Of course you don't care,

430
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,640
I'm still trying to find a boyfriend.

431
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,200
An.

432
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,680
Do you want a lawyer
to be your boyfriend?

433
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,160
Of course I do.

434
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:18,090
What about you, Xiaolu?

435
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,770
I'll keep up with Zhan Yan.

436
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,570
What's good about lawyers?

437
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,370
Doctors are more reliable.

438
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,440
Ruoxi, count me in.

439
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:26,160
I'm going, too.

440
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,160
Me, too.

441
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:28,850
Listen.

442
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,240
That's what people want.

443
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:32,770
Luo Ben is

444
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,200
a nice guy.

445
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,370
He cares about his girlfriend's

446
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,850
friends.

447
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:40,010
Since you're so interested in this,

448
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,850
maybe you should organize it.

449
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,050
Don't count me in.

450
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,610
We should go as a family.

451
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:55,160
This weekend?

452
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,240
I know I can count on you, man.

453
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,850
I'll take care of the rest.

454
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:04,290
Rest assured.

455
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:16,160
Shen Ruoxi.

456
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,610
Ruoxi.

457
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,920
I haven't had this today.

458
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,090
It looks delicious.

459
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:23,370
Yeah.

460
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,010
It's in my bag...

461
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,570
They're waiting for us.

462
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,010
- Yuan.
- Yuan.

463
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,130
Xiong Fei brought you wontons.

464
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:31,010
Come on.

465
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:32,010
Eat while they're still warm.

466
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,200
I'm starving.

467
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:34,290
Thank you.

468
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,090
Thank you, Yuan.

469
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,400
Here.

470
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:35,880
Here.

471
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:37,010
There are wontons for everybody.

472
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,610
It's nice to be young.

473
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:40,530
Yeah.

474
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:43,090
What do you mean?

475
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,370
Do you think I'm too old?

476
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,200
How come?

477
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:48,160
I'm talking about Xiong Fei and Luo Yuan.

478
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:49,440
What are you thinking?

479
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,960
Don't give me that crap.

480
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:52,720
I know what you're thinking.

481
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,570
- I...
- Sister-in-law.

482
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,680
You're right.

483
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:57,440
Dapeng is naughty.

484
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,160
Just eat.

485
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,400
Mind your own business.

486
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:03,090
Yuan.

487
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:05,240
Don't you need to work today?

488
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,400
Today is School Safety Day.

489
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:09,160
We just gave a lecture on safety.

490
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,200
That's what you wear at school?

491
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:19,920
Don't we look good?

492
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:24,850
You look good.

493
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,290
It's just

494
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:28,960
a little corny.

495
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:30,610
Isn't that a little too folksy?

496
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,640
Why do you care?

497
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:33,480
They're both wearing blue.

498
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:34,680
They're in love

499
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:36,050
and they can wear whatever they want.

500
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:36,810
You and Yan

501
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,880
can dress the same if you have the guts.

502
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:39,880
She would never dress like that.

503
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,440
Dapeng.

504
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,920
Maybe we should also dress the same.

505
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:48,200
An old married couple
doesn't dress the same.

506
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,400
Besides,

507
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,960
the rescue suit is great.

508
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,400
Honey.

509
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:53,530
How about I get a suit for you?

510
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,850
I want that kind of clothes.

511
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,640
Just get me what I want.

512
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:00,290
Yuan, you should bring some wontons

513
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,880
to the captain and Ruan.

Hold on.

563

Give me your bag first.

564
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:28,680
Couple dresses?

565
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,440
Yeah.

566
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,720
How silly.

567
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,720
Not silly at all.

568
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,370
We've never dressed the same

569
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:38,680
since we've been together.

570
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:39,290
Put it on

571
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:42,720
Childish.

572
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,880
That's not childish.

573
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,090
I specifically chose

574
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,440

575
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:52,880
How great it looks.

576
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,090
All right, let's go. Don't be late.

Let me help you.

583
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,480
Okay.

584
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:34,530
Okay.

585
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:38,920
I think it's done.

586
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:40,640

588
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:44,370

589
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,290
Okay.

590
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,810
Make it firm.

591
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,090
No problem.

592
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:51,090
Let's take one more.

593
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,290
I think it's enough.

594
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,440
Don't be annoying.

595
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,880
We should take more photos.

596
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:57,920
Is that necessary?

597
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,810
It's messy here.

598
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:00,810
It can't be helped.

599

Who did this?

600
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,570
Well, I'll say something.

601
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,880

a social event

608
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:24,090
so that

609
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,130
we can get to

610

614
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:45,960
I can't do this.

615

Zhan Yan, come over.

616
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:51,680
Give me a hand.

617
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:53,960
Look.

618
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,400
Zhan Yan and Mr. Luo

619
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:56,370
are dressing the same.

620
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:57,720
Hold it for me.

621
00:30:58,530 --> 00:30:59,290
Do you have cash?

622
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:00,160
I envy them.

623
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:02,400
Should we also buy some couple clothes?

624
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:05,610
Childish.

625
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,640
She is pretty.

626
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,010
Don't move. Sit down first.

627
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,200
Have some water.

628
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:20,330
Come on.

629
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,480
How about we hang it here?

630
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:34,720
Okay.

631
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:35,530

632
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,530
Where is Shen Ruoxi?

633
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:39,610
Shen Ruoxi?

634
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:41,570
That's Shen Ruoxi.

635
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:44,570
Not bad.

636
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,770
She's prettier than her picture.

637
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,240
I'm glad you like her. Go ahead.

638
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,400
Do it yourself.

639
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:55,720
Okay?

640
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:56,960
I can't.

641
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,160
But they need me over there

642
00:31:58,330 --> 00:31:59,640
in the dining area.

643
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:00,480
All right, just go.

644
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:01,530
I'm going to the dining area then.

645
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:01,920
Go ahead.

646
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:02,640

647
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,290
Mr. Gao, do you have a minute?

648
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,480
Can you help me with the tent?

649
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:08,090
I'm busy.

650
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,090
You should ask someone else for help.

651
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,290
Mr. Gao.

652
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,130
Just help me with it, please.

653
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:12,440
Sorry, I don't have time.

654
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:13,160
Go to someone else.

655
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:15,160
Mr. Gao.

656
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:16,200
Please help me.

657
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:17,640
I can't set it up.

658
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:19,610
Fine.

659
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,640
Mr. Gao.

660
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:29,160
We have the same tents.

661
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:31,530
What a coincidence, right?

662
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,770
There are a lot of tents

663
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,640
that look the same.

664
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:36,160
It's normal that we got the same tents.

665
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:38,920
In fact, Zhan Yan

666
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,400
told me a lot about you.

667
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:41,770
Mr. Gao.

668
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:42,440
All right.

669
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:44,810
The main part is done.

670
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,960
You can do the rest yourself.

671
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,050
Mr. Gao,

672
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,440
I'm Xu Zirui.

673
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:56,570
The girl you're interested in

674
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,920
is seeing someone now.

675
00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:58,850
Find someone else.

676
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,200
Shen Ruoxi

677
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:06,370
will be mine.

678
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,400
Good luck.

679
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,920
Zhan Yan! Zhan Yan!

680
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,720
Gao Junchi said
he is going to pursue me.

681
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:20,010
That's fast.

682
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:22,880
That doesn't sound like Gao's style.

683
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,240
What do you mean, Luo Ben?

684
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,200
I'm afraid Gao Junchi

685
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:28,850
might mistake someone else for you.

686
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:31,240
But if he saw

687
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,440
the photo you gave him,

688
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,920
he would definitely make a mistake.

689
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:35,130
Well...

690
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:36,400
Why

691
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:38,330
don't you believe me?

692
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,370
Fine, I'll ask Gao Junchi

693
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:41,480
to tell you himself.

694
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,440
Why do I have

695
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:49,850
a bad feeling about this?

696
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:58,920
Hello, my name is Gao Junchi.

697
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,050
G-a-o-j-u-n-c-h-i.

698
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:02,090
Hello.

699
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:03,400
I assume

700
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:04,290
Luo Ben and Zhan Yan have

701
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,610
told you about me.

702
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,050
I really admire

703
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:07,920
nurses.

704
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:08,680
I think it's

705
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:10,200
a noble profession.

706
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:12,610
Nurses are sweet and caring.

707
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,490
I wanted to

708
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,160
come to you earlier,

709
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,200
but your

710
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:19,240
chubby colleague stopped me.

711
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:20,720
It's okay.

712
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:21,800
Well...

713
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,010
Shen Ruoxi.

714
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:26,530
Maybe you should give me your number

715
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,570
so that we can keep in touch
and learn from each other.

716
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,720
Well, Mr. Gao,

717
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:32,930
in the first place,

718
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:35,010
I'm not a nurse. I'm a doctor.

719
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:37,320
Secondly,

720
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:38,970
I'm not Shen Ruoxi.

721
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:40,280
She is.

722
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:44,360
Gao Junchi!

723
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:49,320
Shen Ruoxi?

724
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:55,970
No, wait...

725
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:58,280
What's going on?

726
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,680
One, two, three, four.

727
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,450
One, two, three, four.

728
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:04,490
One, two, three, four.

729
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,490
Here. It's done.

730
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,010
Thank you.

731
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:22,490
You're welcome. Be careful, it's hot!

732
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:22,760
Okay.

733
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:26,840
Luo Ben.

734
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,360
I have a problem with the contract.

735
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:30,760
Can you check it out for me?

736
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:31,970
Is it in such a hurry?

737
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,320
I need to send it to the client tonight.

738
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,530
Please.

739
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:38,360
Go ahead.

740
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,720
All right.

741
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:42,970
Zhan Yan, watch this for me.

742
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,050
Let's go.

743
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,320
It's too much for me. You guys go on.

744
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:53,930
Go on.

745
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:55,640
Come on, let's continue.

746
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:03,640
See.

747
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:05,160
There are some problems

748
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,530
with these clauses.

749
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:08,890
Aren't you tired to bend over like that?

750
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:09,840
Sit down.

751
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,610
I'll revise it for you.

752
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,090
Why am I so unlucky?

753
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:35,970
I told you

754
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:37,970
not to retouch your photos too much.

755
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,530
Why are you alone?

756
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,490
Where is Luo Ben?

757
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:46,160
Then everybody...

758
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,360
Why do they get so close?

759
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:49,280
Aren't you gonna do something?

760
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:50,720
Do what?

761
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:52,200
They are talking about work.

762
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:54,200
He's reading a contract
for his colleague.

763
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,760
Reading a contract?

764
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:57,890
She has so many colleagues. Why does she
have to ask Luo Ben for help?

765
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,200
Why doesn't she go to Gao Junchi?

766
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,360
They were partners before.

767
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,280
Zhan Yan, listen,

768
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:08,760
don't let your guard down.

769
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:11,050
I don't think it's that easy
about Ai Rui'er.

770
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:18,800
Come on, one, two, three.

771
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,530
One, two, three.

772
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,640
Drink slowly.

773
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,280
Where are you going?

774
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:27,930
This is no fun. I'll go to sleep.

775
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,320
Come on, one, two, three!

776
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:44,610
Alright.

777
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:46,240
There should be no problem now.

778
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:48,200
I owe you a big one.

779
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,200
You're welcome.

780
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,320
It's kind of cold here.

781
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,570
I'm gonna get some clothes.

782
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:15,840
Here.

783
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:28,840
Is it better now?

784
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:30,450
Do you still feel cold?

785
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:42,610
All right.

786
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:44,320
I'm done. I'm tired.

787
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,800
I'm leaving.

788
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:46,840
Just stay a little longer.

789
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:49,280
Thanks.

790
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:50,200
Come on.

791
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,320
Let's play the palm game.

792
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:00,410
You...

793
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:02,530
What are you doing in my tent?

794
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,680
Sorry.

795
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:04,680
I didn't do it on purpose.

796
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,760
It was an accident.

797
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:06,890
How can you get into my tent?

798
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:07,970
Sorry! Sorry!

799
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:08,800
Go away!

800
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:09,570
Go on! Continue!

801
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,970
It was a mistake!

802
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:12,090
I went into the wrong tent.

803
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,050
That one!

804
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,800
Not that tent! There!

805
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:15,840
Did you go into the wrong tent?

806
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:26,530
Okay, I'll tell you

807
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,410
about today's schedule.

808
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:29,360
We'll go on a hike

809
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:31,200
in the mountains today.

810
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:33,360
The destination is the Lover Tree.

811
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:35,410
We'll go in pairs.

812
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:36,840
You can take some photos

813
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:39,130
when you get there,

814
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,240
and share them

815
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:41,970
in the group chat.

816
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:42,930
It's said

817
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:45,720
that the couples

818
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:46,490
who make a wish

819
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,240
under the tree

820
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:49,840
will get married.

821
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,320
What's more,

822
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:54,890
Mr. He said

823
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,050
that the first team

824
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,280
to reach the Lover Tree

825
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:58,090
will get

826
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,490
a seven-day vacation on an island.

827
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:04,760
Let's get active.

828
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:05,680
We're going

829
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:06,890
to draw lots.

830
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:08,090
- Okay.
- Okay.

831
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:08,890
Before that,

832
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:10,130
let me tell you the rules.

833
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,450
After you get the note,

834
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,130
you can't make exchanges.

835
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,760
The two people who get the same number

836
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:15,640
will be a team.

837
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,530
Are we clear?

838
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,090
Yes.

839
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,160
Okay. Let's do it.

840
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:20,410
Here. No hurry.

841
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:23,200
One for each. Come on.

842
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,160
When you get the note,

843
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,450
you can't change it.

844
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,200
Let's switch.

845
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:33,890
- Take a look.
- Let's switch.

846
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:34,680
See who you're with.

847
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:35,640
Okay, I don't care.

848
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,930
Number five. Who is number five?

849
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:43,130
Who is number five?

850
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:51,410
Who is number five?

851
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:55,490
Should we take a break?

852
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,010
I'm on your team anyway.

853
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,200
We don't need to win.

854
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:02,010
I'm just taking a walk here

855
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,720
to get some fresh air.

856
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:05,840
Okay.

857
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:08,280
Luo Ben.

858
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,490
Ai Rui'er has joined Gao's group now,

859
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:13,760
but

860
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,610
she still came to you
to talk about cases.

861
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:18,320
That's not good.

862
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,280
I should be wary of it.

863
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,680
It won't look good

864
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,840
if Gao finds out.

865
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,970
Gao is not the one
you should be worried about first.

866
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:28,970
I think

867
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:30,050
you should

868
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,610
care about Dr. Zhan's feelings.

869
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,010
You're quite observant.

870
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:38,050
Don't worry.

871
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,090
Zhan Yan

872
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:40,930
won't get jealous that easily.

873
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,640
Okay, I guess I worry too much.

874
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,890
Thank you anyway.

875
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:46,490
All right.

876
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:48,680
As the organizer of the event,

877
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:50,760
you don't need to take care of me.

878
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:52,130
Go and take care of other people.

879
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:54,970
I'll talk to these little girls.

880
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:55,610
I'm not tired.

881
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:56,970
Go ahead.

882
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:58,490
You guys talk. I'm gonna go.

883
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,010
Okay.

884
00:41:59,160 --> 00:41:59,720
I'll leave you to them.

885
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,240
All right.

886
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,930
Don't you want to win?

887
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,760
I'm too old.

888
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:05,760
Well,

889
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:06,800
what do you think of the boys
in our firm?

890
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:08,280
Aren't they good?

891
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,320
You and Luo Ben have only
known each other for a short time.

892
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:17,280
I'm kind of surprised

893
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:18,530
you're together.

894
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:19,720
Why?

895
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,360
Luo Ben

896
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:24,530
is a considerate man.

897
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:26,090
He would take care of everyone

898
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,930
in group activities,

899
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,050
but it's hard to

900
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:30,970
get through to him.

901
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,680
How long did you work together?

902
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,050
Four years.

903
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,800
I did pretty well in my internship.

904
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,050
I had the right
to choose whom to work with.

905
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,240
Luo Ben's team

906
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:42,640
is the most inexperienced team,

907
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,490
but I chose him anyway.

908
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:46,930
So you chose Luo Ben.

909
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:48,490
He has

910
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,010
an unyielding spirit,

911
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,090
and I also like challenges.

912
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,640
But I heard you chose Attorney Gao

913
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:58,760
some time ago.

914
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:03,160
Well,

915
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,800
we might make mistakes

916
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:06,930
when we have choices to make.

917
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:08,010
The important thing is

918
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,410
how we correct our mistakes

919
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:10,840
when we realize them.

920
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:13,970
