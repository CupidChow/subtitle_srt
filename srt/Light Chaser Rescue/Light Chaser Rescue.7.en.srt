Hello, you're...

35
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:49,410
Hello.

36
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,760
I'm your neighbor,

37
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,760
Luo Yuan.

38
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,650
I can't speak.

39
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,720
But I can hear you.

40
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,370
My brother likes quietness
and is easily irritated.

41
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,320
Please be tolerant of him.

42
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,810
So you're Mr. Luo's sister.

43
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,040
Do you know my brother?

44
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,930
I've known him early.

45
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,090
In Fengxi,

46
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,760
I donated blood to you indirectly.

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,930
Thanks.

48
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,530
Thanks.

00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:16,210
Thanks?

50
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:17,840
You're welcome.

51
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,130
Rest assured.

52
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,720
For the sake of our special bond,

53
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,760
I'll be tolerant of your brother.

54

I need your help.

62

Miss Ding,

63
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:25,940
can we start now?

64
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,140
Please make it quick.

65
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,140
I'm a little busy usually.

66
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,380
Many presses have
made appointments with me.

67
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,580
I can only give you three minutes.

68
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,500
I only need two minutes.

69
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,260
Well,

70
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,260
do you sincerely want to work with me?

71
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:40,900
Of course.

72
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,140
As far as I know,

73
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:43,940
the copyright of your comic,

74
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:44,620
Light Chaser Rescue,

75
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,940
wasn't bought out by the platform.

76
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,620
My company offers to pay 500,000 yuan

77
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,260
to buy out the full copyright proxy
of your comic.

78
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,380
We'll split the subsequent income 50-50.

79
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,940
Do you have any disagreements?

80
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,780
I... I'm not

81
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,620
a very casual person.

82
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:03,460
I don't care

83
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,580
what kind of person you are.

84
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,460
Just answer me,

85
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,940
yes or no?

86
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,380
No, I don't think so.

87
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,020
I'll send you the contract right now.

88
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,380
You...

89
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,780
No rush.

90
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,140
I'm not a rookie, right?

91
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,900
I'm quite experienced in this.

92
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,020
I need to consult with

93
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,940
my lawyers first.

94
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,020
If they say yes,

95
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,380
I'll sign the contract.

96
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:26,820
OK.

97
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,260
Reply to me within three days.

98
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,260
Bye.

99
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,820
OK. Bye-bye.

100
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,580
Hello.

101
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,700
May I help you?

102
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,900
As the old saying goes,

103
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,140
a near neighbor is better
than a distant cousin;

104
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,620
a man living across the hall
is even better than a near neighbor.

105
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,380
Mr. Luo, thanks for

106
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,900
putting out the fire for me earlier.

107
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,700
I sincerely invite you over for dinner.

108
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,540

109
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:12,500
(Thanks for putting out the fire for me.
Please come over for dinner.)

110
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,220
No.

111
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:14,820
Thanks.

112
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,220
Mr. Luo, the thing is,

113
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,580
there are some

114
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,940
legal questions

115
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,780
that I want to

116
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,140
consult you.

117
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,140
Concerning legal matters,

118
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,060
you can go to see me at the law firm.

119
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,020
Close the door, Yuan.

120
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,940
Yan, I know

121
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,140
you'll come to celebrate with me.

122
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:30,700
Ben,

123
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:31,700
I want to go.

124
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,340
- I don't know what to do with you.
- I don't know what to do with you.

125
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,340
Hey.

126
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:39,900
Hey.

127
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:40,940
Yuan.

128
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:42,700
Come on.

129
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,020
No hurry.

130
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:47,900
I have a big announcement to make.

131
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,700
I, Ding Dingding,

132
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,140
have officially set foot on the road

133
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,460
leading to a comic master.

134
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,260
Yuan,

135
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,220
if my infatuated fans

136
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,140
bother you in the future,

137
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,700
I wish you and your brother
would pardon them.

138
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:58,940
Dingding,

139
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,380
I still have a feeling

140
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,580
that something is wrong.

141
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,820
No, Yan, you think too much.

142
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,940
They sent me the contract.

143
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,140
500,000 yuan.

144
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:10,900
Have some food.

145
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:38,220
(What are you doing?)

146
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,740
Mr. Luo.

147
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,460
Yuan drinks a glass of milk every day.

148
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,460
I brought it to her.

149
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,340
Yuan.

150
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,940
I'll drink it.

151
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,940
Go back.

152
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:01,940
Yuan,

153
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,580
you just recovered.

154
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,420
You can't drink alcohol,

155
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,180
you know

156
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,460
And also,

157
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,340
those are the steak, roast chicken

158
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,940
and prawns on your dinner invitation,

159
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:15,940
right?

160
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,220
Well, Mr. Luo,

161
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,660
I'm

162
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,300
just beginning to make a name.

163
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,300
I haven't got the money yet.

164
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,940
And the instant noodles

165
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,940
are beef-flavored, chicken-flavored

166
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,580
and seafood-flavored.

167
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,540
They taste almost the same.

168
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,580
You want me to make some for you?

169
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,100
No, thanks.

170
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,860
Luo Yuan can't eat those either.

171
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:05,860
Yuan,

172
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,860
I really envy you.

173
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,820
Your brother is so kind to you

174
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,860
that we can even share some benefits.

175
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:11,940
Right, Yan?

176
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,660
It looks good.

177
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,340
It may taste better.

178
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,660
I didn't expect Mr. Luo

179
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,340
to be so outstanding in all aspects.

180
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,060
I have many other sides

181
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,340
that may

182
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,540
impress you.

183
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:32,860
Dingding,

184
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,460
aren't you going to

185
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,340
sign a contract?

186
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,340
Mr. Luo is here now.

187
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,940
He should also be

188
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:40,940
outstanding in

189
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,300
seeking benefits

190
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,220
for other people,

191
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,340
right?

192
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,940
May I, Mr. Luo?

193
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:54,460
Bring it to me.

194
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,700
OK.

195
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,740
Yan, he only listens to you.

196
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,460
You know what, in the morning,

197
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,340
he treated me in a businesslike manner,

198
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:06,940
and asked me

199
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,340
to go to the law firm to consult him.

200
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,660
I'm helping you

201
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,660
for your sister's sake.

202
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,300
To match such fine food,

203
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:20,940
I think

204
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,460
I should use my secret weapon

205
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,820
to add to the atmosphere.

206
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,100
Yuan, give me a hand.

207
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,980
What's she doing?

208
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:39,740
How do you like it?

209
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,340
Such inferior lights

210
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,860
will easily create short circuits.

211
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,460
Mr. Luo,

212
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,580
please focus. Thanks.

213
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,660
I'm reading it.

214
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,100
As a

215
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,980
formal copyright contract,

216
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,580
there's basically no problem.

217
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,540
Subsequent distribution
and profit allocation

218
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,460
are also reasonable.

219
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,940
But according to this clause,

220
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,060
the characters

221
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,060
and storyline of the comic

222
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,660
must be confirmed

223
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,580
in writing by Party A.

224
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,660
In case of disagreements,

225
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,180
Party A's opinion shall prevail.

226
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,100
And this one,

227
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,300
Party B is obliged to

228
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,420
modify the comic

229
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,660
according to Party A's requirements

230
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,660
until Party A is satisfied.

231
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,060
I don't think

232
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,180
either clause is fair.

233
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:25,940
What's wrong?

234
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,940
If Party A's requirement

235
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,820
is against your original intention,

236
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,100
your creative work

237
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,580
will probably be restricted.

238
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,820
I think,

239
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,460
if they're willing to pay so much money

240
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,820
for the copyright of my comic,

241
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,060
they should have recognized me.

242
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,060
And we have the common goal

243
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,820
to make good comics, right?

244
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,580
If they have different opinions,

245
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,460
I'll modify my work.

246
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,220
And this one,

247
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,220
7-1,

248
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,700
the specific work mode of Party B

249
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,980
after taking the post

250
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,180
shall be decided by Party A.

251
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,820
This clause is obscure.

252
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,700
You'd better

253
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,700
negotiate a

254
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,180
work mode in advance,

255
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,060
and write it into the contract.

256
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,940
But I'm just a comic book author.

257
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,060
What work mode can I have?

258
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,100
My only work is to draw comics, right?

259
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,740
Besides these,

260
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,700
are there any other problems?

261
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:11,700
No.

262
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,060
Dingding,

263
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:17,860
I suggest

264
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,060
you take his advice,

265
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,060
or you may

266
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,420
regret it in the future.

267
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,460
Nobody will help you.

268
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,060
Yan, don't worry.

269
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,100
You always think too much.

270
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,820
It's such a good chance.

271
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,980
If I don't seize it,

272
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:29,980
what if they find another author?

273
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,100
Right?

274
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,860
I'll contact them later.

275
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,860
If I sign early, I'll get paid early.

276
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,700
Why is the electricity off
in your community?

277
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,580
I told you there was a problem

278
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,460
with the lights.

279
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,060
The breaker tripped.

280
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:53,820
Dingding,

281
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,700
where's your electric panel?

282
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:56,580
Well,

283
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,460
I just moved in.

284
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,860
I'm not very clear about the layout.

285
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,460
All right.

286
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,820
You stay here.

287
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,980
I know where it is.

288
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:06,820
I'll go.

289
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,660
Where's my phone?

290
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,060
Would anyone turn on a torch?

291
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:18,700
What are you doing?

292
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,060
What's wrong?

293
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,180
Your phone is over there.

294
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,580
OK, the power is back.

295
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:54,980
Mr. Fang.

296
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:55,940
Mr. Luo.

297
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,540
I'm coming to see your son.

298
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:58,740
Thanks.

299
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,300
Come, he just fell asleep.

300
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,820
Let's talk over there.

301
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,340
OK.

302
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,180
Actually, before the guarantee case,

303
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,420
I once thought

304
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,580
if you won

305
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,220
the case,

306
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,740
I would give you our annual

307
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,340
legal service contract.

308
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,340
But now I've

309
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,580
changed my mind.

310
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,340
With your

311
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,220
work ability and

312
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,420
social responsibility,

313
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,300
even if you lose the case,

314
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,860
I'll still hire you as

315
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,100
our legal counsel.

316
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,700
Because I

317
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:34,580
trust you.

318
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,580
Mr. Fang, you scared me.

319
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,580
I thought I might have failed you

320
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,700
in some aspects.

321
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,980
You're the lifesaver

322
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,940
of my wife and child.

323
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,340
Take the contract

324
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,060
as my

325
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,700
appreciation to you.

326
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,420
We'll talk about the details

327
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,220
some other day at my company.

328
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,460
OK. Thanks, Mr. Fang.

329
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,460
I won't bother you, then.

330
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,820
Thanks for your flower.

331
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:01,860
This is Luo Ben.

332
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:03,940
Rescue center?

333
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,460
Dr. Zhan.

334
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,220
OK. I get it.

335
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,220
Dr. Zhan,

336
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,060
do you still remember Lele,

337
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,540
the boy who was saved

338
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,340
from the earthquake?

339
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:19,580
What's wrong?

340
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,300
After Lele

341
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,740
was sent to the orphanage,

342
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,980
he began to suffer from anorexia,
weakness of limbs,

343
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,660
and inability to walk.

344
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,420
Is there any way

345
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,220
you can help him?

346
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,460
Without check-ups,

347
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,660
I can't make a diagnosis.

348
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,820
Transfer him here.

349
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,060
Then,

350
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,340
what about the ward?

351
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,820
I'll take care of that.

352
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,580
(Luo Ben)

353
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,980
(Zhan Yan)

354
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,020
Zhan Yan didn't answer your call.

355
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,140
You're disappointed, right?

356
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,020
Nonsense.

357
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,220
I have a business
to talk about with Dr. Zhan.

358
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,460
I know.

359
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:23,420
You have a love business

360
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,220
to talk about with her.

361
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,940
Since when have you learned to tease me?

362
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,860
I tell you what,

363
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,460
don't rush to

364
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,660
sell your big brother.

365
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:33,700
Really.

366
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,620
Brother, you like Zhan Yan.

367
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,980
We've all seen that.

368
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,100
Glib-tongued.

369
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,780
What did you mean by all?

370
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,460
Dingding said,

371
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,740
there are three things

372
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,260
in the world that cannot be hidden,

373
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,140
poverty,

374
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,220
cough,

375
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,540
and

376
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:54,980
love.

377
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,740
Go to bed.

378
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,300
Seriously.

379
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,740
Don't drink too much water at night.

380
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:47,900
Dr. Zhan.

381
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,020
Dr. Zhan.

382
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,660
I have to go to work.
Let's talk after work.

383
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,940
Would you get in the car first?

384
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:55,660
I called a taxi.

385
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,700
I want to talk with you about Lele.

386
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,460
Show some respect.

387
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,380
Let's go.

388
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,460
Each patient has

389
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,300
different conditions.

390
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,460
So Lele's treatment

391
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,740
may be a very difficult

392
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,940
and long process.

393
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,100
Are you ready?

394
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,740
No matter at what cost,

395
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,620
I must cure Lele.

396
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,460
You really care about Lele.

397
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,260
After all, I saved him.

398
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,420
I should be responsible for him
to the end.

399
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,900
I can't let him down

400
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,020
after giving him hope.

401
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,100
Really?

402
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,540
What?

403
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,660
Do you even doubt this?

404
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,020
After all, you have a strong sense

405
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,180
of purpose in doing everything.

406
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,700
Why did you say that?

407
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,940
You went to Fengxi
to take part in the relief work

408
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,940
in order to save your sister;

409
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,460
you saved Fang Zhihong's son,

410
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,940
to get a contract.

411
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,500
But what do you help Lele for?

412
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,860
It turns out that

413
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,820
in your mind,

414
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,020
I am a mercenary man.

415
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,780
I just don't want

416
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,820
a child to be hurt.

417
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:17,540
Come on.

418
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,780
(Linjiang Central Hospital)
Let's build blocks, OK?

419
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,100
Look.

420
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,500
Look at this.

421
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,820
What's the color?

422
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,580
At present,

423
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,820
the combination of medication

424
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,180
and psychotherapy

425
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,540
is the most effective way

426
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,580
to treat PTSD.

427
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,540
How long it takes to cure him?

428
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,260
It's hard to say.

429
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,940
It may take months,

430
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,300
or years.

431
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,580
In some cases, the patients

432
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,300
can't even
get rid of it in over 10 years.

433
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,780
If you say so,

434
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,020
does he have to
take medicine all the time?

435
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,380
According to his current condition,

436
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,980
medicine is necessary.

437
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,060
Thanks.

438
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,460
What are you going to do?

439
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:23,980
Take Lele away.

440
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,300
Why?

441
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,940
Don't you agree with
the expert's treatment?

442
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,300
Since the treatment here

443
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,100
is the same as that of

444
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:29,580
the orphanage,

445
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,340
Lele doesn't have to

446
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,380
stay here.

447
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,260
He can get professional attendants here.

448
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,460
Where are you taking him?

449
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,380
Lele needs company

450
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,260
instead of attendants.

451
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,020
Lele.

452
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,620
Come on.

453
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,940
We won't take the medicine again.

454
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,340
You're so opinionated.

455
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,940
He must take medicine now.

456
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,020
Taking so much medicine

457
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:55,980
will make

458
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,540
a healthy child ill.

459
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,300
If you accompany him,

460
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,620
do you have time?

461
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,060
What if you have to work?

462
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,260
Thanks for your concern.

463
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,700
I'll figure a way out.

464
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,580
Stop.

465
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,220
Let me take Lele to a place.

466
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,500
From earthquake-hit Fengxi

467
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,940
to the hospital after the earthquake,

468
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:34,700
Lele has been

469
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,020
through a lot of pain.

470
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,620
Mr. Luo was right.

471
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,100
When you're free,

472
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:40,860
spend more time with him

473
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,860
and make him happy.

474
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,300
Could Miss Ruan

475
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:46,940
handle the situation?

476
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,180
In rescue work,

477
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,820
all kinds of things

478
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,780
would happen.

479
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,500
New team members

480
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,940
often have stress reactions.

481
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,460
It's necessary to have a psychologist

482
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,300
on the team.

483
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,300
Miss Ruan is
very experienced in this field.

484
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,100
Why didn't you tell me earlier

485
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,380
that you had such resources?

486
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,780
We needn't have had to

487
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,020
take so much trouble.

488
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,860
Why did you have to

489
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,980
hide your resources?

490
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,540
There's no absolutely correct

491
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,940
and unique method

492
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,100
for psychotherapy.

493
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,740
You know well about

494
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,780
the work of the rescue team.

495
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,340
Are you acquainted
with the team members?

496
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,700
Does it have anything to do with you?

497
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,500
Have you joined the rescue team?

498
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,100
What's your problem?

499
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,460
Is there any problem with my problem?

500
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,820
I'm not your respondent.

501
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:33,860
We're just

502
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:34,860
simply working together.

503
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,260
We formed a partnership

504
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,340
to help Lele make a recovery.

505
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:38,820
You lawyers

506
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,940
do best in forming such partnerships.

507
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,300
Fine.

508
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,820
This is the contract of Fangqin Group.

509
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:00,540
Take a look.

510
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,620
I'll send it to them
as soon as possible.

511
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:03,620
Luo Ben?

512
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,780
Do you know how to

513
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,020
make someone happy?

514
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,540
Make who happy?

515
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,300
Don't get the wrong idea.

516
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,540
I'm talking about a kid,

517
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,060
the boy I saved in the quake-hit area

518
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,540
and sent to the orphanage,

519
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,180
Lele.

520
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,820
A child?

521
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,460
Children can easily be happy

522
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,820
as long as they have games to play

523
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:26,820
and tasty food to eat.

524
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,780
Forget it. You won't know the answer.

525
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,340
You're not married yet.

526
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,780
How do you know about kids?

527
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,300
You're wrong.

528
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,780
We don't have any personal experiences

529
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,460
about the cases we've handled,

530
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,860
but still,
they've been handled properly.

531
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:44,740
You're right.

532
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,740
What did you say just now?

533
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:48,820
The contract.

534
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,220
Have a look.

535
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,940
(Linjiang Central Hospital)

536
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:56,700
Dr. Cai,

537
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,300
do you work overtime today?

538
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:57,820
Yes.

539
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,580
You'll be off work soon?

540
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,380
By the way,

541
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,700
your patient of Bed 13,

542
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,780
when I make ward round later,

543
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,500
I'll take a look for you.

544
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,700
You can feel reassured at home.

545
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:12,580
Thanks.

546
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:13,820
You're welcome.

547
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:17,860
Cong Zhou and the other guys

548
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,020
will organize
an alumni gathering tomorrow.

549
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,020
Shall we go together?

550
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,460
I haven't finished my paper yet.

551
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,260
I know

552
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,780
you don't like these gatherings.

553
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,980
This time, we want to have a discussion

554
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,620
about the topics

555
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,940
of the General Surgery Seminar.

556
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,180
I also want to share my experience

557
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,180
last time with everyone.

558
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,340
Text me the gathering time.

559
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,020
OK.

560
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,780
I'll pick you up tomorrow morning.

561
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,980
(Luo Ben)

562
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,700
As doctors,

563
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,540
we'll unavoidably come into contact

564
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,540
with patients and their families.

565
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,460
Frankly speaking,

566
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,820
we know nothing about

567
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,380
their status and backgrounds.

568
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,540
From the professional
perspective of doctors,

569
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,540
I don't suggest
you get too close to them,

570
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,180
in case it'll be trouble.

571
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:13,060
(Outpatient)

572
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,740
Zhan Yan,

573
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,220
you haven't participated in

574
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,220
the alumni gatherings for a long time.

575
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,060
They must be surprised

576
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,180
to see you tomorrow.

577
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,300
You'd better not stir up trouble
and make me drink.

578
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,780
You do it every time.

579
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,020
You would be self-indulgent at parties

580
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,340
and make everyone drink a lot.

581
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,940
Because we hardly get together.

582
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,700
What would you like for dinner?

583
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:32,980
Dr. Zhan.

584
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,180
Why are you here?

585
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,820
(Linjiang Central Hospital)

586
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,060
Mr. Luo,

587
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,180
we're going to dinner.

588
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,540
Do you have anything urgent?

589
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,060
It's the same thing.

590
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,780
Dr. Zhan, if it's convenient,

591
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,940
I have to discuss it with you alone.

592
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:56,740
How about this?

593
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,860
We'll wait for you outside.

594
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,060
You go to dinner first.

595
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,060
I'm not hungry anyway.

596
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,540
I'll go home directly.

597
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,220
OK.

598
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,300
OK.

599
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,620
Go ahead.

600
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,300
Let's walk and talk.

601
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,980
I know you want to

602
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,340
win Zhan Yan back.

603
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,700
But if you're

604
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,300
timid and hesitant all the time,

605
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,500
someone may beat you to the draw.

606
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,020
Enough, you'd better be quiet.

607
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,020
I've worried for nothing.

608
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,300
Tomorrow, I want to

609
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,540
take Lele out

610
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,500
to see how other children

611
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,020
spend their time.

612
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,780
Maybe,

613
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:38,620
it can arouse

614
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,620
his nature

615
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,540
as a child.

616
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,860
Hopefully, in that environment,

617
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,820
he'll try to open himself.

618
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,060
Whatever you want to do,

619
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,300
you don't have to discuss with me.

620
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:54,980
Didn't you say that

621
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:55,860
we had formed

622
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,740
a partnership to help Lele

623
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,860
to make a recovery?

624
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,780
On behalf of Lele,

625
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,020
I invite you to

626
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,540
spend the weekend with us.

627
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,300
I have to work this weekend.

628
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,020
I'm busy.

629
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,780
That'll be a problem, then.

630
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,380
Look,

631
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,460
if I take care of Lele

632
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,260
all by myself,

633
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,020
I can't handle it.

634
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,340
But if I find another one to help,

635
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,300
I won't feel at ease.

636
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:18,700
You know,

637
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,700
Lele's condition

638
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,940
is special.

639
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:22,780
I need to find someone

640
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,060
that he trusts.

641
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,780
I think you're

642
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,860
a perfect choice.

643
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,580
Did you ask Miss Ruan's advice?

644
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:30,940
Yes.

645
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,020
She agrees that

646
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,580
to cure Lele,

647
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:34,540
we must help him to

648
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,700
get out of the emotions

649
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,700
resulting from the earthquake.

650
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,100
What do you think?

651
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:48,940
Are you OK?

652
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:50,540
Thanks.

653
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,020
So,

654
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,380
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

655
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,220
We'll see.

656
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,780
Mr. Luo.

657
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,100
Are you waiting for Dr. Zhan?

658
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:51,780
Me too.

659
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:02,540
Thanks.

660
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:05,540
Zhan Yan,

661
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,060
get in the car.

662
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:21,180
I really want to
go to the alumni gathering.

663
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,220
But I can't ignore Lele.

664
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,020
Could you write down the content for me?

665
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:32,820
OK.

666
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,620
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

667
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,780
I'll send your regards

668
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,100
to our schoolmates.

669
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,020
Thanks.

670
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,540
I'm so sorry.

671
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,260
I forgot to tell you

672
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,380
and let you come for nothing.

673
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,620
Don't say sorry to me.

674
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,060
Go ahead.

675
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,300
Let's go.

676
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,500
Did you see, Lele?

677
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,820
There are so many bubbles.

678
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,300
Look,

679
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,980
it floats so far away.

680
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:09,780
And there's such a big one.

681
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,300
Look, look at the one up there.

682
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,540
Luo Ben.

683
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,380
Is it fun, Lele?

684
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,860
The bubbles are so beautiful,

685
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,060
aren't they?

686
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:22,460
Here.

687
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:23,460
Have a try.

688
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,220
Give it a try.

689
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,340
Give it a try and you'll

690
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,820
be reluctant to let go of it.

691
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,780
Try.

692
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,260
Yeah.

693
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,260
Press here.

694
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:33,940
Get ready,

695
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,220
one, two, three,

696
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,980
shoot!

697
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,700
Look, the bubbles are beautiful,

698
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:41,740
aren't they?

699
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,300
Don't you think so?

700
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,540
There are red ones, purple ones,

701
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,820
blue ones, and yellow ones,

702
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:47,860
right?

703
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,020
Lele.

704
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:49,780
Try to smile.

705
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,300
Look here.

706
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,780
Lele, if you don't smile,

707
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,100
you won't look good in the photo.

708
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:57,620
Come on.

709
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,300
- One, two, three, yeah!
- Really!

710
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:00,460
Smile.

711
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,820
Smile more widely.

712
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:03,940
Later,

713
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,060
when I show you the photo,

714
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,220
don't complain.

715
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:06,860
Come on.

716
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:10,260
One, two, three, cheese.

717
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,300
You can't catch me.

718
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,220
Come on.

719
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,180
Keep running.

720
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:23,020
Now I'm at my wit's end.

721
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,300
The boy wouldn't

722
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,540
even try to smile.

723
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,940
It's exhausting to take care of kids.

724
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,740
That's your way

725
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,060
to make him happy?

726
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:33,700
Yes.

727
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,620
Do you have a better way?

728
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,500
Look,

729
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:48,100
from the disaster area to the hospital,

730
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,460
we've kinda gone through
thick and thin together.

731
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,540
I think you may

732
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,060
have misunderstood me.

733
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,340
It's time to change

734
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,780
your opinions about me.

735
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,500
You think too much.

736
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,540
There is no misunderstanding
between us.

737
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,220
He must be hungry. Where's the food?

738
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,820
Change starts now.

739
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,020
How do you like it?

740
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,220
Did you make it?

741
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,300
Or who else would?

742
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:28,540
Take it.

743
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:31,740
Lele,

744
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,780
let's have lunch.

745
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,980
Let's go, Lele.

746
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,740
It's our lunch time.

747
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,780
Look what does she

748
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,540
hold in her hands?

749
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,780
A box lunch made for you by me.

750
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,260
Look,

751
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,820
isn't it lovely?

752
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,620
What's wrong, Lele?

753
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,500
What's wrong?

754
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,500
Ben, the bear box lunch you made

755
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,540
doesn't look good.

756
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,780
Is it so bad that it makes you cry?

757
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,620
I miss Mom.

758
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,700
She made bear box lunch, too.

759
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,060
Mom.

760
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,140
All right.

761
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,580
It's OK. Lele.

762
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,460
Don't cry.

763
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,660
Mom.

764
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,780
All right. It's OK.

765
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:39,580
(Fangqin Group)

766
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:00,860
The contract

767
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:01,780
is signed.

768
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:02,820
I have a new job

769
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,580
for you.

770
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:04,980
With pleasure.

771
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,860
Do you know Yigu Venture Capital?

772
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,620
One of the world's

773
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,500
top ten venture capitals.

774
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,900
The development

775
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:18,780
of our group

776
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,140
has run into bottlenecks.

777
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,620
To expand the market,

778
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,460
we need new capital investment.

779
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,260
Yigu Venture Capital

780
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,460
is seeking investment opportunities

781
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,780
in the Chinese market.

782
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:30,900
I want to win over

783
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,340
their investment.

784
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,900
I'll leave the details of the negotiation

785
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,380
and the contract to you.

786
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,340
Is there any problem?

787
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,060
I'll concentrate all my efforts on it.

788
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,580
There's one more thing

789
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,260
I want to talk with you about.

790
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:44,980
I'm listening.

791
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,100
Our group

792
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,140
makes certain donation

793
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:52,060
to public charity every year.

794
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,580
I plan to allocate

795
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,620
40% of it to

796
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,740
Light Chaser Rescue
for their development.

797
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,740
What do you think?

798
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:06,580
Mr. Fang,

799
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:10,900
as far as I know,

800
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,660
Light Chaser Rescue

801
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,860
is a rescue team

802
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:14,620
of pure public nature.

803
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,660
The team members
raise all funds by themselves.

804
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,780
They won't accept

805
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,580
any form of cash donation.

806
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,740
I see.

807
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,220
Can we

808
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,140
do it

809
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,300
in another way?

810
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,420
Fangqin Group

811
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,220
will also recruit such a team

812
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,580
and invite the Light Chaser Rescue

813
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,180
to give them professional training.

814
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,660
We'll provide funds and equipment.

815
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,140
What do you think?

816
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:42,660
Good idea.

817
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:45,060
In this way, we can not only
do charity work,

818
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,500
but also build an

819
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,220
emergency rescue team

820
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,220
for the company.

821
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,060
Kill two birds with one stone.

822
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:50,660
Good.

823
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,300
If you agree,

824
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,420
make a plan

825
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,860
and talk about it with Captain Qingshan.

826
00:36:58,780 --> 00:36:59,660
Me?

827
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:00,620
Yes.

828
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,220
You're the one.

829
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:04,740
I plan to

830
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:07,060
let you manage the team.

831
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,660
In the future, no matter
the executives of the company,

832
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,300
or ordinary employees,

833
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,340
as long as they join the team,

834
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:13,780
they'll be your soldiers.

835
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,700
Mr. Fang, don't you think

836
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,140
you give too wide-ranging powers

837
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,580
to a legal counsel?

838
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,740
I believe in my judgment.

839
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,900
Trust is the best support.

840
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,860
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

841
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,260
Don't mention it.

842
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,220
Class, look. Who's here?

843
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,300
The school organized
an outing last weekend.

844
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,420
Pipi and some other

845
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,460
naughty kids

846
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,140
accidentally poked a hornet's nest

847
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,100
and got stung by hornets.

848
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,780
Pipi also broke

849
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:14,700
his leg carelessly.

850
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,740
The teacher called the ambulance

851
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,180
and dressed his wounds simply.

852
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,420
But nobody knew

853
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,740
anything about outdoor rescue.

854
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:21,820
The timing of treatment

855
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,580
for Pipi's wounds was almost delayed.

856
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,700
Mr. Fang plans to build a
company rescue team

857
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,860
and asked you to lead the team.

858
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:31,940
As a legal counsel,

859
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,260
isn't your working scope too broad?

860
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:36,860
To make a donation contract

861
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:37,900
and build a rescue team

862
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,300
is just a practical method

863
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,380
to perform the commission of Party A.

864
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,580
I think rescue has

865
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,660
stolen your soul.

866
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,180
Haven't I sold my soul

867
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,260
to money already?

868
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,700
Forget what others say.

869
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,900
Don't I know you?

870
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,460
The information of Yigu Venture Capital.

871
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,580
The more detailed, the better.

872
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,500
Send it to me as soon as possible.

873
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,220
Can I train with you?

874
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,860
If it's entrusted by Party A,

875
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,580
it's in my scope of work too.

876
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,740
I'll lead the team

877
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:11,860
instead of taking part in the training.

878
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,300
I'm going to work somewhere else.

879
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:15,900
Be careful while driving.

880
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:26,780
Luo Ben,

881
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,380
promoting emergency rescue knowledge

882
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:30,660
is one of the most important

883
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,100
tasks of the non-governmental

884
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,100
public welfare organizations like us.

885
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,180
There are more and more

886
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,060
major enterprises that

887
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:37,980
are building rescue teams.

888
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,380
We'd love to help them

889
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,780
in training and drills.

890
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,340
We just provide the funds and

891
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,780
equipment needed for training.

892
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:47,820
At the same time,

893
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,140
we hope to

894
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,260
train with the members

895
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,180
of your team.

896
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,380
We'll communicate
and learn from each other.

897
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:55,420
I see.

898
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,860
You're trying every means to

899
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,900
provide us with training support.

900
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:01,660
Win-win situation.

901
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,500
Thanks.

902
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:13,460
(Tips of Daily First Aid)

903
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,500
One of the accidents

904
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,500
easily happens to children

905
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,700
is choking.

906
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:24,660
Eating carelessly

907
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:25,820
or playing while eating

908
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:26,700
is easy to get food

909
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,660
stuck in the windpipe.

910
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,660
Once this happens,

911
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,260
we can perform the Heimlich maneuver,

912
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,740
turning residual gas in the lungs

913
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,420
into an airflow
to flush out the foreign matter.

914
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,940
Now we will

915
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:39,780
do you a demo.

916
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:40,620
Come.

917
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,300
First, the victim's feet

918
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,260
should be slightly apart.

919
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,900
The rescuer stands behind the victim,

920
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:48,980
assuming a bow stance.

921
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,500
Then curl one hand into a fist.

922
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,820
Attention, everyone.

923
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,100
Press your fist

924
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,820
against above

925
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:57,940
the victim's navel.

926
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,180
Grip the clenched fist

927
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,860
with the other hand,

928
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,180
and quickly exert force

929
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,420
backward and upward

930
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,580
to press against the abdomen.

931
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,620
Like this, look.

932
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,740
Backward and upward.

933
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,340
Backward and upward.

934
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,820
Keep doing that until

935
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:14,220
the victim spits out the foreign matter.

936
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:15,940
Come on.

937
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,180
Teachers can

938
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:18,420
practice now.

939
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,300
- Let me try.
- Come.

940
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:23,460
Look,

941
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,300
curl one hand into a fist.

942
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:25,780
Try,

943
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:26,820
if you're right-handed,

944
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,100
use your right hand.

945
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,460
Aim above the belly button.

946
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:30,900
OK. Let me try.

947
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,700
- Backward and upward.
- Yeah.

948
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,100
That's right. Very good.

949
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:35,780
Thanks.

950
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,700
Come on, Miss Luo.

951
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,300
Give it a try.

952
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:44,740
Curl one hand into a fist.

953
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:45,620
Do it like this.

954
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,940
Yeah, like this.

955
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,300
Then press your fist

956
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,220
against the place
above the victim's belly button.

957
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,180
Grip your fist with this hand.

958
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,580
And exert force backward and upward.

959
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:58,940
Never mind.

960
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:00,300
You just gave me a tickle.

961
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:02,300
Allow me.

962
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:07,740
Look,

963
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:08,900
clench your fist like this.

964
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,260
Yeah.

965
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:12,300
Aim the position
between your thumb and index finger

966
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,980
right above the belly button.

967
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:15,660
Grip your fist tightly.

968
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:17,460
Quickly exert force

969
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:19,780
backward and upward.

970
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:22,060
Yeah, backward and upward.

971
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:22,780
Come on, have a try.

972
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:25,660
Yes, try again.

973
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,260
Good.

974
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:28,860
Try again.

975
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:30,500
Backward and upward.

976
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,180
Very good.

977
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,420
You've basically mastered

978
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,460
the Heimlich maneuver now.

979
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:39,340
One last thing,

980
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:40,700
I have to emphasize,

981
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:41,780
all victims that have gone through

982
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:43,660
the Heimlich maneuver

983
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:44,780
must go to the hospital

984
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:46,100
to systematically check
whether their internal organs

985
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:46,940
are damaged.

986
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:47,980
Because the maneuver

987
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,340
has a great impact

988
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,260
on the victim's internal organs.

989
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:51,500
Let me ask you

990
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,420
another question.

991
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:56,700
What should you do if a fish bone

992
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:57,580
gets stuck in your throat?

993
00:42:57,890 --> 00:42:58,780
Eat a piece of apple.

994
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:00,740
Drink vinegar.

995
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,980
Sneeze or pick it out.

996
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:05,620
All wrong.

997
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,180
The correct answer is,

998
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,740
go to the hospital immediately.
