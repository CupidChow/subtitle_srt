00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,050

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,800
♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,100
♫  I put out mountain fires  ♫

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:22,000
♫  and catch the sunset  ♫

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,500
♫  I leave the rhythms of life in my wake  ♫

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:35,000
♫  Happiness whispers in my ears  ♫

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,400
♫  Chasing the passion for the future  ♫

8
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,500
♫  Like a dream maker  ♫

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,200
♫  Reading the universe and stars  ♫

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,600
♫  My existence in the river of time  ♫

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,600
♫  With the body temperature of a moment  ♫

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:02,300
♫  I'm trying to be the extension of light  ♫

13
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:09,000
♫  If the world grants me a frustrating opening  ♫

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,600
♫  I'll chase back time like a dark horse  ♫

15
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:22,300
♫  Even though I know the truth, I won't be afraid  ♫

16
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:28,400
♫  I won't miss the moon because of mediocrity  ♫

17
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,700
♫  I won't lose the light  ♫

18
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,000

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,900

20
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,000
 China's non-government public welfare rescue.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,800
 The first case: Chasing Light Rescue Team v. Ju Wu Light Chasing Rescue Team

22
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,800
 will be held next week publicly.

23
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,400
 The court trial will be broadcast for the public.

24
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,200
It's getting big.

25
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,000
Yeah, I didn't expect it.

26
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:03,500

27
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,300
How's your preparation for the case?

28
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,400
Are you ready?

29
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,400
The truth will win.

30
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,700
We can't lose this time.

31
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,000
So I need your help.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,100
How can I help?

33
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,600
Now the gossip about Captain Qingshan

34
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,900
is about him resigning and becoming a full-time public welfare person.

35
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,300
It's doubtful.

36
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,900
So netizens think that he is just using public welfare to enrich himself.

37
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,500
So, if we can show the captain's real personal financial situation,

38
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,600
I think it will be helpful.

39
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,200
Do you want me to testify for him?

40
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,000
You are the best one.

41
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,700
- No. 
 - Zhan Yan.

42
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,500
I have the right to refuse.

43
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,200
Zhan Yan.

44
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,200
He is your dad.

45
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,300
Can you see that he is being framed by others?

46
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,300
He doesn't need to make money.

47
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,600
If he wants money, then he doesn't need to work full-time in public welfare.

48
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,400
He has over ten rescue certificates, which are very valuable.

49
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,800
Any valuable certificate can help him enjoy a better life.

50
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,510
About Captain Qingshan and Juwu Chaser Light Rescue Team that appeared on the internet.

51
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:27,300
By the illegal use of the banner of the Light Chaser Rescue Team to make money,

52
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,000
I make the following statement.

53
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,600
The so-called Juwu Light Chaser Rescue Team did not receive any brand authorization.

54
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,700
but used Light Chaser Rescue's logo and uniform,

55
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,000
and received social donations under the name of Light Chaser Rescue.

56
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,600
It even clearly marked the price of public welfare actions

57
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,800
which has seriously tarnished the brand image established by Chase Light Chaser Rescue,

58
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,600
and damaged the image of China's charities.

59
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,500
Based on the above facts, as the plaintiff, our requests are as follows.

60
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:05,400
Firstly, Juwu Rescue publicly apologize

61
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,700
to Light Chaser Rescue in the media platform.

62
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:13,700
Secondly, Juwu Rescue shall not use any unauthorized brand logo

63
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,400
of Light Chaser Rescue.

64
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,800
Thirdly, Juwu Rescue compensates for all losses caused thereby.

65
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,200
Thanks to the court and thanks to the presiding judge,

66
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:30,500
for allowing this case about charity to be heard publicly.

67
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,200
In fact, as the plaintiff's attorney,

68
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,800
I've already finished my defense argument.

69
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,800
However, I'd like to ask for the approval of the court.

70
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,800
In order to show the image of China's charity,

71
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,700
I would like to extend my thanks to all of you here and to those viewers watching the live broadcast

72
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:52,500
to formally introduce the Light Chaser Rescue Team.

73
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,300
So everyone can know about these Light Chasers better.

74
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,000
Approve.

75
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,400
Light Chaser Rescue is an officially registered

76
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,800
and professional rescue team.

77
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,500
The photos show the rescue sites.

78
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:25,600
They've gone to disasters like Fengqi and Lanling.

79
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,600
He is Falcon.

80
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,900
He was the head of the training department of Light Chaser Rescue before he died.

81
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,800
 Also, he was the veteran captain of the rope team.

82
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,100
 After joining Light Chaser Rescue,

83
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:46,300
 he gave everything he owned and donated it to Light Chaser Rescue.

84
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:52,500
Before he died, he was doing non-profit rescue work.

85
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,300
After he passed away,

86
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:59,800
he donated all his saving to the non-profit rescue.

87
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,200
This is a new member of our rescue team.

88
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,400
He is Zhou Mingming.

89
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,800
It's you.

90
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,200
He once couldn't find the purpose of life.

91
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,100
Joining the rescue team was just a whim.

92
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:23,000
 But now, he is the backbone of water rescue.

93
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,200
 His mother was worried about his safety

94
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,800
 and tried to persuade him to donate money,

95
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,640
 and not do it himself.

96
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,600
 And his friends didn't want to shake hands with him.

97
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,700
 Because he retrieved a corpse from the water

98
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,800
 His friends thought that it was unlucky.

99
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:45,800
But Zhou Mingming still insists on his own choice.

100
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:52,800
He said that rescuing lives makes him feel the meaning of life.

101
00:07:54,200 --> 00:08:01,200
Actually, there are a lot of members in Light Chaser Rescue like Zhou Mingming and Falcon.

102
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,500
If everyone could get to know them,

103
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,100
you could learn about what kind of team we are.

104
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,000
On the road to charity, it's bound to be bumpy.

105
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,800
But we will never forget our original intention.

106
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,000
In the Juwu Light Chaser Rescue case,

107
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,200
among the spreading online opinions,

108
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,200
 many wonder why

109
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:36,400
 Light Chaser Rescue's founder and captain, Mr. Qingshan,

110
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:43,900
 he gave up his well-paid doctor job and become a public welfare person instead.

111
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:55,000
 Could it be that he wants to collect money under the banner of public welfare?

112
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,000
Zhan Yan's dad.

113
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,800
Shut up.

114
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:22,000
I want to say yes, Mr. Qingshan is indeed a very rich man in my opinion.

115
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 Rich? What does that mean?

116
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 - Why did he say that? 
 - I don't know.

117
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 What does it mean?

118
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,200
 Well.

119
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:33,400
This is a Professional Doctor Certificate.

120
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,800
Mr. Qingshan was a professional surgeon before.

121
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,900
And a foreign-invested hospital wanted to

122
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,900
hire Qingshan as the director,

123
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:55,100
and even offered 800 thousand yuan each year.

124
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,500
 800 thousand?

125
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,000
This is a helicopter winch license.

126
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,200
In rescue missions involving helicopters,

127
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,200
80 percent of them need to depend on a winch.

128
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,800
I'd like to say, only with these certificates,

129
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,200
Qingshan can get one million or 1.5 million each year.

130
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,900
 So much.

131
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,000
An Emergency Rescue Certificate,

132
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,600
Alpine Rescue Certificate, Divers Certificate, Safety Officer Certificate.

133
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,900
There are more certificates like these.

134
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,700
And these certificates are very valuable.

135
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:42,800
That's why I say Mr. Qingshan is a rich man.

136
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,100
Please be quiet.

137
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,300
Maybe you've noticed that

138
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:12,500
most of the certificates are related to rescue.

139
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:20,200
Qingshan has devoted all his energy to life rescue.

140
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:26,400
And each qualification certificate here represents technical requirements and abilities.

141
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:32,600
Mr. Qingshan studied hard to make himself a skilled rescue elite.

142
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,000
He did it.

143
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,200
But even though he has so many certificates,

144
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,000
he lives a simple and impoverished life.

145
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,200
Please show us the next picture.

146
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,500
This is Qingshan's home.

147
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,800
A room in the training base of Light Chaser Rescue.

148
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,300
Only several simple pieces of furniture.

149
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:00,300
What Qingshan receives are a national public welfare subsidy of more than 3,000 yuan per month.

150
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,200
He doesn't have any savings.

151
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,200
He is a member of the Communist Party of China,

152
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,200
founder and captain of Light Chaser Rescue,

153
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,900
this is Mr. Qingshan's financial status.

154
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,800
Like Qingshan, Falcon, and the members of Light Chaser Rescue,

155
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,800
all of them are from different occupations.

156
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,200
And most of them are elites in their careers.

157
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,100
Like them,

158
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,600
if they want to earn money,

159
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,000
they don't need to go to the rescue team.

160
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,900
If they want to get a reputation, they don't need to rescue others in disasters.

161
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,000
Juwu used an unauthorized brand name.

162
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,800
It was supposed to be a simple infringement case.

163
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,700
Why did we choose a public hearing?

164
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:59,400
Because Juwu damaged not only Light Chaser Rescue,

165
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,900
but also the public charity in China which grows with great effort,

166
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,200
the trust of public rescue.

167
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:10,400
Moreover, it hurt millions of people contributing to charity.

168
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:19,700
I hope this public hearing can offer an honest and fair judgment of China's charity.

169
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,300
Great!

170
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:51,000

171
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,600
Luo Ben, you were great.

172
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,400
You know how many friends we asked for help, and how many nasty comments we replied to.

173
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,200
But your speech is better than what we did.

174
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,400
It's so excellent. I'm so touched.

175
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,200
I think I need to hug you.

176
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,600
I don't think it's necessary.

177
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,600
Actually, we should thank Zhan Yan.

178
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,100
It was she who told me we could use those certificates to prove his innocence.

179
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,900
It turns out that there is a good wife.

180
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,300
You can also be my dog-headed strategist.

181
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,200
 We hope this public hearing...

182
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,200
Captain!

183
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,500
 ...can let more people know...

184
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,200
- Captain. 
 - Captain.

185
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,700
Captain!

186
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,200
How about inviting the captain to celebrate with us tonight?

187
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,100
Leave him alone for a while.

188
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,800
What's wrong?

189
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,800
I'm guessing he doesn't want to be disturbed now.

190
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,400
 Yan.

191
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,500
 Dad resigned from the hospital today.

192
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,600
 I'll work in rescue full-time.

193
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,500
 Later, I can't give you too much pocket money.

194
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,400
Today, I'm here to see you because I'm so happy.

195
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,600
In the public hearing, Yan was there.

196
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,400
And she offered key evidence.

197
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:27,200
I've not told you before, but this lawyer is her boyfriend.

198
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,600
Thanks to him, we could win today.

199
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,200
Are you happy about that?

200
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:43,600
At that time, I founded Light Chaser Rescue to atone for my sin.

201
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,000
It has been over ten years.

202
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,700
We helped a lot of people, and also saved a lot of people.

203
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:55,500
I hope our rescue team can be better, and can do more in the future.

204
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,600
 But I don't know why,

205
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:08,000
 Xiaojie, I feel so empty.

206
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,500
 No matter how many people I save,

207
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 I can't make amends for the past.

208
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,400
Luo Ben. Congratulations on your success.

209
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,700
 Lawyer Luo is amazing!

210
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,000
I saw today's hearing. I was moved.

211
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,100
And we are ordinary people, we can't join rescue by ourselves.

212
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,700
But we will support you.

213
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,600
Support your public rescue case.

214
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,400
And support your rescue work.

215
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,700
About the senior partner, I've considered it.

216
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:53,400
As long as you stay in Fazheng, you will always be a senior partner.

217
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,400
Thanks, Old He.

218
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,700
Congratulations, Partner Luo.

219
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,100
Congratulations, Mr. Luo.

220
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,700
Thanks, everyone.

221
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,500
Luo Ben, when will we invite the ladies from the hospital to talk about the meaning of rescue?

222
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:14,800
I don't think you want to learn about rescue, but have a date.

223
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,200
Come on!  The captain... the captain is here.

224
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,000
Such a big fish.

225
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,300
Evil does not subdue righteousness.

226
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,200
 Right!

227
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,000
 That's right.

228
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,100
How is it possible?

229
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,300
Our whole department is so busy. We don't have time to hang out with you.

230
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,600
I'm not kidding. I'm serious.

231
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,900
In my firm, there are a lot of single men, kind and well-educated.

232
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,000
And in your hospital, there are also a lot of single women. Right?

233
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,600
Do you think I have time to organize that?

234
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,600
Do you seldom join in social activities like that?

235
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,600
Who told you?

236
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,000
You're refusing.

237
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
What I refuse is that you waste my time, waste my colleagues' time.

238
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,600
Not all the people are like my girlfriend, always focusing on her work.

239
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,700
Okay, fine. I don't care about what you do, but I won't join it.

240
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,200
Then, what do you do alone?

241
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,800
Sleep.

242
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,800
Okay.

243
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,400
If you won't join, then I won't go.

244
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,500
I'll be with you.

245
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,100
Not free?

246
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,600
No, I'm free this weekend.

247
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,200
And I can ask for leave.

248
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,400
Don't be so excited. I won't go.

249
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,100
Of course, you don't care.

250
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,600
But I want to have a boyfriend.

251
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,800
An, do you want a date with a lawyer?

252
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,200
Yeah, I do.

253
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,100
- How about Xiaolu? 
 - I agree with Zhan Yan.

254
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,700
Is a lawyer so good?

255
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,100
I think a doctor is the best.

256
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,600
Ruoxi, I will join.

257
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,000
- And I. 
 - Me, too.

258
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,800
Just look, that's our answer.

259
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,800
Luo Ben, he is so nice.

260
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,200
He knows how to please your best friends.

261
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,900
Anyway, since you're so active, then you can organize it.

262
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,000
Don't count me in.

263
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,400
The whole team should join together.

264
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,800
This weekend?

265
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,200
Luo Ben, you're so reliable.

266
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,200
I'll arrange everything else.

267
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,100
Don't worry.

268
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,200
Shen Ruoxi.

269
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,300
Ruoxi.

270
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,200
I haven't tried it today.

271
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,200
- It looks delicious. 
 - Yes. We made...

272
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,100
They are waiting for us.

273
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,200
- Yuan Yuan. 
 - Yuan Yuan!

274
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,400
And Xiong prepared wonton for you.

275
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,200
Come on. Try it before it gets cold.

276
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,000
-  I'm starving. Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

277
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,600
Come on. For everyone.

278
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,700
It's nice to be young.

279
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,100
Yes.

280
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,800
What do you mean? You think I am too old, don't you?

281
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,400
How dare I?

282
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,300
I'm talking about Xiong Fei and Luo Yuan.

283
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,600
What are you thinking?

284
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,000
Stop pretending to be innocent.

285
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,900
I know what you're truly talking about.

286
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,800
- I... 
 - Sister-in-law, you're right.

287
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,000
Peng is thinking something bad about you.

288
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,200
Shut up. It has nothing to do with you.

289
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,800
Yuan Yuan, don't you have to work today?

290
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,800
Today is Security Education Day, so we just finished our lessons at school.

291
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,900
So you were giving lessons in these outfits?

292
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,800
 Just say I am beautiful or not.

293
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,200
Yes, you're beautiful.

294
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,800
But...

295
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,400
It's quite a cheezy choice.

296
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,300
It's kind of out of fashion.

297
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,900
- It's none of your business. 
 - Two blue people.

298
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,100
They're in love, so they can wear whatever they want.

299
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,000
Don't you wear things like that with my sister?

300
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,200
She won't accept this idea.

301
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,799
Old Peng, what about dressing up like them?

302
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:48,659
We are too old to wear them.

303
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:51,759
And the uniform is the best.

304
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:53,699
Sweetheart, I can get one for you.

305
00:22:53,699 --> 00:22:56,900
I asked for the couple shirts. What are you doing?

306
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,739
Yuan, can you send it to Captain and Ms. Ruan?

307
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:35,730
♫  I want to be a shining star  ♫

308
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:41,530
♫  I will give out my light  ♫

309
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:46,930
♫  and fly high up in the sky  ♫

310
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:52,730
♫  Dreams eventually become lighter  ♫

311
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:57,980
♫  For the sake of meeting you  ♫

312
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:01,830
♫  I'm willing to pour down my body  ♫

313
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:04,030

314
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:09,630
♫  Although everything can't go as planned  ♫

315
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:14,930
♫  I'm more stable than the wind and rain  ♫

316
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:19,930
♫  I am alone in this lively world  ♫

317
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:26,230
♫  Still, I light up the way for others  ♫

318
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:31,230
♫  I think I'm a star  ♫

319
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:38,330
♫  I only have eyes for you  ♫

320
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:06,030
♫  I want to be a shining star  ♫

321
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:12,030
♫  I will give out my light  ♫

322
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,679
When I met you for the first time,

323
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,180
I was in love with you.

324
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:28,580
♫  In order to meet you ♫

325
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:33,050
♫  I was willing to let my body pour down  ♫

326
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:38,839
I used to think this kind of romance wouldn't happen to me.

327
00:25:41,779 --> 00:25:45,140
So for a long time, I was escaping from you.

328
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:49,140
♫  I am alone in this lively world  ♫

329
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,299
But you changed me.

330
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,860
You made me a better person.

331
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:01,550
♫  I think I'm a star  ♫

332
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:08,960
♫  I only have eyes for you  ♫

333
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:22,660
Yuan Yuan...

334
00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:27,040
will you marry me?

335
00:26:30,825 --> 00:26:36,420
♫  When I see the crowd  ♫

336
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:41,940
♫  You became a star  ♫

337
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:47,650
♫  Like the shadow of a soaring dove  ♫

338
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:52,975
♫  Your sweet smile is like a dream to me  ♫

339
00:26:52,975 --> 00:26:57,950
♫  I am alone in this lively world  ♫

340
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:04,340
♫  Still, I light up the way for others  ♫

341
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:09,275
♫  I think I'm a star  ♫

342
00:27:09,275 --> 00:27:15,575
♫  I only have eyes for you  ♫

343
00:27:15,575 --> 00:27:20,550
♫  The world is getting brighter  ♫

344
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:26,840
♫  Within glistening teardrops there is my love for you  ♫

345
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:31,740
♫  Two free forms  ♫

346
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:39,140
♫  Embrace the world  ♫

347
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:43,159
 Congrats. Looking forward to good news.

348
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:45,220
 Bro, congratulations.

349
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:10,900
Here.

350
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:13,560
Let's go.

351
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,220
Wait a second.

352
00:28:15,699 --> 00:28:17,840
Take off your bag.

353
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,839
Couple shirts?

354
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:30,499
Yes.

355
00:28:31,259 --> 00:28:32,739
It looks stupid.

356
00:28:32,739 --> 00:28:35,879
How could it be stupid? Come here.

357
00:28:35,879 --> 00:28:40,220
Since we have been together, we have never tried the couple shirts. Put on.

358
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,679
- It's so childish. 
 - Not at all.

359
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:48,440
I especially chose this design. To keep a low profile.

360
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,839
Look. You look perfect.

361
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,559
- Fine. Let's go. It's late. 
 - Go.

362
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:22,399
Be careful when you carry stuff. Watch out.

363
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:25,159
 Wait. Wait a minute.

364
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,940
Come on. I'll help you.

365
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,039
Good.

366
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:35,480
Okay.

367
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,780
It's almost done.

368
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:43,560
 - Cheese. 
 - Here. Here.

369
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,620
 Come on.

370
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,140
 Great.

371
00:29:46,979 --> 00:29:48,660
Put it up tightly.

372
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,840
 Okay.

373
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,040
 One more photo.

374
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,159
 It is enough. You want too much.

375
00:29:55,159 --> 00:29:56,860
 Take more photos for memories.

376
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,179
 But it is enough.

377
00:29:58,179 --> 00:30:01,760
 It is a mess. I can't make it.

378
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,480
 What? How did get it tangled?

379
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,920
Everyone, please listen to me.

380
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,139
Today, it is...

381
00:30:09,139 --> 00:30:11,959
It is... boiling today.

382
00:30:11,959 --> 00:30:14,839
But it is a good sunny day.

383
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:19,340
Fazheng Law Firm and Linjiang Central Hospital

384
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:22,540
 hold this camping party together for what?

385
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:26,240
We hold this party to help everyone to get to know each other

386
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:31,299
and become good friends in a short time.

387
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,620
Fazheng...

388
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,779
Law Fi...

389
00:30:44,779 --> 00:30:46,719
Fine.

390
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,619
Zhan Yan, come here.

391
00:30:50,619 --> 00:30:52,639
I need your help.

392
00:30:53,299 --> 00:30:54,319
Look.

393
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:56,859
Zhan Yan and Mr. Luo. They're in couple shirts.

394
00:30:56,859 --> 00:30:58,379
Hold it.

395
00:30:58,379 --> 00:31:01,019
 - Do you have cash?  
 - I want to be like them.

396
00:31:01,019 --> 00:31:03,259
Should we buy couple shirts, too?

397
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,860
You're childish.

398
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,499
 You look so pretty.

399
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,260
 Don't move. You sit down first.

400
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,159
 Here's water.

401
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,280
 Come here.

402
00:31:27,259 --> 00:31:29,639
 What about hanging here?

403
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,500
 - Sure.  
 - Luo Ben.

404
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,780
Why didn't Shen Ruoxi come today?

405
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,460
Shen Ruoxi?

406
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,520
She is just over there.

407
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,220
Nice.

408
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:48,220
She looks much prettier than in the photo.

409
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:51,199
It's good if you like her. Go.

410
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:55,459
You need to make it by yourself first. Okay.

411
00:31:55,459 --> 00:31:57,419
But I can't make that.

412
00:31:57,419 --> 00:31:59,699
But I have to go to the kitchen area.

413
00:31:59,699 --> 00:32:01,539
- Well, see you. 
 - I'll come back to join you.

414
00:32:01,539 --> 00:32:03,080
- Go. 
 - Bye.

415
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:06,299
Mr. Gao, are you free? I need a hand to put up the tent.

416
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,140
I have something else. Others may help you.

417
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,240
Mr. Gao, please do me a favor.

418
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,499
I'm sorry. I'm not available now.

419
00:32:12,499 --> 00:32:13,919
You should ask someone else.

420
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:15,319
Mr. Gao!

421
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:18,259
Help me. Help me. I can't pitch a tent.

422
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,560
Really?

423
00:32:26,619 --> 00:32:31,699
Mr. Gao, our tents look the same. Do you think it is a kind of destiny?

424
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:34,820
There're so many tents looking the same as ours.

425
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,519
It's common to have the same tents.

426
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,920
Actually, Zhan Yan mentioned you to me many times. Mr. Gao.

427
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,599
It's done.

428
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:44,960
The main setup is done.

429
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,819
You can do the rest of it.

430
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,900
Mr. Gao.

431
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:55,499
I am Xu Zirui.

432
00:32:55,499 --> 00:32:58,020
The lady you've been looking at already has a boyfriend.

433
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,700
Change to someone else.

434
00:33:04,059 --> 00:33:07,420
I will never give up on Ruoxi.

435
00:33:09,699 --> 00:33:11,259
Good luck.

436
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:17,279
Zhan Yan! Zhan Yan!

437
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:18,979
Gao Junchi said he would go after me.

438
00:33:18,979 --> 00:33:21,260
A quick step.

439
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,239
But it's not like what Gao usually does.

440
00:33:23,239 --> 00:33:26,099
Luo Ben, what do you mean?

441
00:33:26,099 --> 00:33:29,800
I am afraid that Gao may have gotten the wrong person.

442
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:34,599
But if he sees the phone you gave her, he'd have made a mistake.

443
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:35,880
I...

444
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,359
What... You won't believe whatever I say.

445
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:42,320
Fine. I will bring him here, and he will tell you.

446
00:33:47,199 --> 00:33:50,700
Somehow, I have a bad feeling.

447
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,979
Hi, my name is Gao Junchi.

448
00:33:58,979 --> 00:34:01,000
It means steeds gallop.

449
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,840
Nice to meet you.

450
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,640
I think Luo Ben and Zhan Yan have talked about me to you.

451
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,200
I think highly of nurses.

452
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,459
I think nurses are really gorgeous.

453
00:34:10,459 --> 00:34:12,860
You are kind and can take good care of people.

454
00:34:13,439 --> 00:34:15,119
I've been thinking of coming to talk to you.

455
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:19,359
But your fat colleague needed my help so I couldn't come over.

456
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,079
But it is all right.

457
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:23,059
So... I...

458
00:34:23,059 --> 00:34:24,660
Shen Ruoxi,

459
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,580
may I have your contact?

460
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:29,220
We can communicate a lot and share our knowledge.

461
00:34:30,019 --> 00:34:34,279
Mr. Gao, to be honest, first of all, I am not a nurse.

462
00:34:34,279 --> 00:34:36,560
I am a doctor.

463
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,579
Secondly, I am not Shen Ruoxi.

464
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:41,339
She is.

465
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,119
Gao Junchi.

466
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:50,079
Shen... Shen Ruoxi?

467
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,020
Why? What?

468
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:58,639
What is going on?

469
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:04,539
 One, two, three, four.

470
00:35:17,579 --> 00:35:20,940
- Here, the barbecue is ready. 
 - Thank you.

471
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,540
- You're welcome. It's hot, be careful. 
 - Okay.

472
00:35:26,279 --> 00:35:29,399
Luo Ben, I have problems with the contract.

473
00:35:29,399 --> 00:35:31,019
Could you check it with me?

474
00:35:31,019 --> 00:35:33,620
- Is it an emergency? 
 - I have to send it to the client tonight.

475
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,280
Please.

476
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,819
Go.

477
00:35:40,019 --> 00:35:41,479
I'll help you.

478
00:35:41,479 --> 00:35:43,420
Zhan Yan, just cook it for a moment.

479
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,000
Let's go.

480
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:52,579
I need to take a break. You can go on.

481
00:35:52,579 --> 00:35:54,280
Go on. Have fun.

482
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,299
Come on, let's have fun.

483
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,899
Look here. These items are problematic.

484
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:10,499
You're tired if you keep standing. Take a seat.

485
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:14,560
I can rewrite the items.

486
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:34,640
I never even have good luck.

487
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,420
I told you not to photoshop your photo way too much.

488
00:36:39,579 --> 00:36:41,980
Why are you here alone? Where's Luo Ben?

489
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,519
 And everyone...

490
00:36:47,019 --> 00:36:49,419
Why do they sit close to each other? Shouldn't you stop them?

491
00:36:49,419 --> 00:36:52,379
Why do I need to do that? They're talking about business.

492
00:36:52,379 --> 00:36:54,259
He's revising the contract with his colleague.

493
00:36:54,259 --> 00:36:56,419
Revising contract?

494
00:36:56,419 --> 00:36:58,240
There are so many colleagues here.

495
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,659
Why didn't she ask Gao for help?

496
00:37:01,579 --> 00:37:04,819
They were partners.

497
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,939
Zhan Yan, listen to me. You must be very cautious of her.

498
00:37:08,939 --> 00:37:11,600
I think she has another purpose.

499
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:19,059
 Go. One, two, three.

500
00:37:19,059 --> 00:37:21,480
 One, two, three.

501
00:37:22,539 --> 00:37:24,399
Drink it slowly.

502
00:37:25,139 --> 00:37:26,439
What are you doing?

503
00:37:26,439 --> 00:37:28,580
It's so boring. I want to sleep.

504
00:37:34,539 --> 00:37:37,579
Come on. One, two, three.

505
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:46,960
Well. There's no mistake now.

506
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,659
You helped me a lot.

507
00:37:48,659 --> 00:37:50,359
It's nothing.

508
00:37:52,139 --> 00:37:54,179
It's cold here.

509
00:38:02,279 --> 00:38:04,420
I need to get some clothes.

510
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,199
Put it on.

511
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,499
 Do you feel better?

512
00:38:29,499 --> 00:38:31,000
 Still cold?

513
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,460
Well, stop.

514
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,479
I'm too tired. I'm done.

515
00:38:44,479 --> 00:38:45,759
I'm out.

516
00:38:45,759 --> 00:38:47,399
 Come on, don't leave.

517
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,339
- Thanks. 
  - Come here.

518
00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:53,179
 Let's play the game called Palm of the Hand.

519
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,860
What are you doing?

520
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,580
Why did you come into my tent?

521
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,939
Sorry. I am sorry.

522
00:39:03,939 --> 00:39:05,839
It wasn't on purpose. I made a mistake.

523
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:07,940
- How can you get into my tent? 
 - I am sorry. It's my fault.

524
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,659
- Get out. 
 - You go on playing.

525
00:39:09,659 --> 00:39:11,020
It... It's a misunderstanding.

526
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:13,640
- I made the wrong tent. 
  - Here, here is your tent.

527
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,759
Not that one. Here.

528
00:39:14,759 --> 00:39:16,699
He got into the wrong tent.

529
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,880
Well, listen.

530
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,460
According to today's schedule, we will go through the forest on foot.

531
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,519
Our destination is the Tree of Love.

532
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:35,960
Each team consists of two people.

533
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:39,099
When you arrive there, you can take photos,

534
00:39:39,099 --> 00:39:42,199
and share the photos with us in our Wechat group.

535
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:46,580
It is said that if a couple makes a wish under the Tree of Love,

536
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:50,399
they will be with each other forever.

537
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:57,340
And Mr. He has told me the first couple arriving at the Tree,

538
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:02,140
will get a seven-day island trip.

539
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,119
So let's fight for it.

540
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:06,939
Now, we will draw lots.

541
00:40:06,939 --> 00:40:08,040
Yes. Great.

542
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,240
Before we start, I have to make it clear that

543
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,200
we can't change the result since you get your slip of paper.

544
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,719
Two people who have the same number become one team.

545
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:17,280
- Do you understand? 
  - No problem.

546
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,819
Okay, let's get started.

547
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:22,060
Come on. Take it easy. Everyone will get one.

548
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:24,259
Everyone will get one. Please take it.

549
00:40:24,259 --> 00:40:27,019
You can't change it when you get your slip of paper.

550
00:40:31,539 --> 00:40:33,359
- Let's change it. 
 - Show it to me.

551
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,040
-  Change it. 
 - I don't care who my teammate is at all.

552
00:40:40,699 --> 00:40:42,080
No. Five. Who is No. Five?

553
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,780
Who is #5?

554
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:49,210
5.

555
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,260
Who is #5?

556
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,640
Shall we take a break?

557
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:59,460
Now that we are a team, I don't think we'll be the winner.

558
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:04,160
I feel like taking a walk for some fresh air.

559
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,399
Sure.

560
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,139
Luo Ben.

561
00:41:10,139 --> 00:41:12,840
Ariel has transferred to Gao's team.

562
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,819
But she is still used to discussing cases with you.

563
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:18,779
I don't think it is appropriate.

564
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:22,139
I should pay attention to it.

565
00:41:22,139 --> 00:41:26,139
If Gao knows it, it will make him feel he's not the leader.

566
00:41:26,139 --> 00:41:28,020
But the point is not about Gao,

567
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:32,020
I think, you should think about how Dr. Zhan feels about it.

568
00:41:34,139 --> 00:41:36,360
You are a good observer.

569
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,300
Don't worry.

570
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:41,540
Zhan Yan, she is generous and kind.

571
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,799
Okay, I was overthinking.

572
00:41:43,799 --> 00:41:45,840
But I should thank you.

573
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:49,340
Well. You organized this event.

574
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,919
You don't have to look after me.

575
00:41:50,919 --> 00:41:52,680
You should care more about others.

576
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,920
I want to talk with these young ladies.

577
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,860
I'm okay. Go. May I join you?

578
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:59,040
- Enjoy. See you later. 
 - Sure.

579
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,779
- I'm leaving. 
 - Okay.

580
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:03,580
Don't you want to be #1?

581
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,710
I'm too old to do it. How is it?

582
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:08,939
The boys of our law firm are nice, right?

583
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:16,379
You met Luo Ben just a few months ago.

584
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:18,980
I am shocked to see you both together.

585
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,379
Why?

586
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:24,919
Luo Ben, as he always does, treats others friendly

587
00:42:24,919 --> 00:42:28,240
and can take care of everyone in collective activities.

588
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,100
But if you want to get into his heart, it's hard.

589
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:33,039
How long have you been working together?

590
00:42:33,699 --> 00:42:35,600
Four years.

591
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,259
I did a good job in my internship.

592
00:42:38,259 --> 00:42:40,200
So I could choose whom I wanted to work with.

593
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,799
Luo Ben's team has the least working experience,

594
00:42:42,799 --> 00:42:44,940
but I still decided to join his team.

595
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,480
So you decided to be his member.

596
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:50,640
I can feel he's the man who will never give in,

597
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,840
and I like challenges.

598
00:42:54,759 --> 00:42:59,399
But I heard days ago, you joined Mr. Gao's team.

599
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:07,019
As a human being, you make mistakes sometimes when you have to make a choice.

600
00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:11,860
But what matters is to correct it after you realize your mistake.

601
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:14,420
Ms. Ariel, what do you actually want to say?

602
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:26,940

603
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:36,400
♫  At first, there was no sadness in the world  ♫

604
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:43,720
♫  Until luck came and crossed the stage  ♫

605
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:51,500
♫  At first, souls were confused and wandered  ♫

606
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:58,880
♫  Until people hugged each other  ♫

607
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:06,640
♫  I've been on the road  ♫

608
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:14,900
♫  Trying to connect laughter and tears  ♫

609
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:21,840
♫  I suddenly have faith  ♫

610
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:29,440
♫  I can walk by millions of shining household lights  ♫

611
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:38,180
♫  I hope I can admire flowers in the afterglow  ♫

612
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:44,420
♫  Shed tears and hope that you are well  ♫

613
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:53,200
♫  The good times I'm pursuing belong to the light  ♫

614
00:44:53,200 --> 00:45:00,780
♫  It can light up the wounds that follow  ♫

615
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:04,600
♫  Catching the floating stars  ♫

616
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:08,340
♫  Watching as the memories flash by  ♫

617
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:12,020
♫  Traveling through market scenes  ♫

618
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:15,780
♫  With a fiery gaze  ♫

619
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:19,500
♫  I can't fly  ♫

620
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:23,320
♫  But I can look up  ♫

621
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:30,940
♫  I'm always on the road chasing the light  ♫
