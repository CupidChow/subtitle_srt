1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,010

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,800
♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,180
♫  I put out mountain fires  ♫

4
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,100
♫  and catch the sunset  ♫

5
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:28,440
♫  I leave the rhythms of life in my wake  ♫

6
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:35,560
♫  Happiness whispers in my ears  ♫

7
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,420
♫  Chasing the passion for the future  ♫

8
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,560
♫  Like a dream maker  ♫

9
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,920
♫  Reading the universe and stars  ♫

10
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,580
♫  My existence in the river of time  ♫

11
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:55,500
♫  With the body temperature of a moment  ♫

12
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:02,320
♫  I'm trying to be the extension of light  ♫

13
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,900
♫  If the world grants me a frustrating opening  ♫

14
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:15,460
♫  I'll chase back time like a dark horse  ♫

15
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:22,320
♫  Even though I know the truth, I won't be afraid  ♫

16
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,360
 I won't miss the moon because of mediocrity  ♫

17
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,740
♫  I won't lose the light  ♫

18
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,980

19
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:39,040

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,980
You can go inside first.

21
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,760
I wouldn't have know he was seriously ill

22
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,040
without your call.

23
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,140
You've been with him every day.

24
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,720
Did you really not know anything that he had been ill for a year?

25
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,640
I was negligent.

26
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,180
Do you really care about others?

27
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,540
Please take good care of him...

28
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,500
I don't need your lecture.

29
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:32,540
He joined my parents' meeting and celebrated my birthday.

30
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,600
I think of him as my real dad.

31
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,940
- Yan... 
 - You're someone else's hero.

32
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,580
Find time to get a health checkup.

33
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:10,700

34
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,280
Why are you here?

35
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,080
A few extra hours. I need to send them all.

36
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,060
You're conscientious.

37
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,700
If you hadn't asked for leave so many times, you wouldn't have to work so hard.

38
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,940
Listen to me, Bro.

39
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,000
You're almost out of food now,

40
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,900
why do you insist on helping others?

41
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,160
Are you able to do that?

42
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:46,020
Voluntary rescue belongs to the rich who have spare time.

43
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,460
I don't think so.

44
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,680
Don't say I didn't warn you.  Recently, the boss plans to cancel the basic salary.

45
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,940
If so, we can only depend on commissions.

46
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,640
How much can you earn at that time?

47
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,640
Besides, as you always ask for leave,

48
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,200
he already has an opinion of you.

49
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,900
Think about it.

50
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,400
Thank you, Brother Hai. I see.

51
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:20,020
Did you even hear me?

52
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,760

53
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,440
 The kids all liked the rescue knowledge that you taught.

54
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,740
 Can we go to visit your training base?

55
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,060
 Are you going to marry me or not?

56
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,940
 How many times have I told you?

57
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,600
 Why do you care so much about that piece of paper?

58
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,960
 No!

59
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,560
 What are you doing?

60
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,640
 I'll leave here.

61
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,360
 Come back!

62
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,940
What are you yelling? Don't you sleep?

63
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,340
 Don't make trouble!

64
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,980
 You actually hit me?

65
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,360
 Stop crying!

66
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,320
Sleazy guy!

67
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,200
What's going on?

68
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,760
 What are you doing?

69
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,600
Who are you looking for?

70
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,960
Can you quarrel at a different time?

71
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,760
Look. Don't you know what time it is?

72
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,220
Can you let us sleep?

73
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,720
I haven't finished yet!

74
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,320
Can't you respect others? Open the door!

75
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,280
What are you doing?

76
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,600
You are a nuisance, you know?

77
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,900
This is my house and I can do what I want! If you don't leave, I'll call the police.

78
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,860
Trying to scare me?

79
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,600
Just in time. See!

80
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,040
Did you see that you didn't only affect me alone?

81
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,000
You want to call the police? Let me help you.

82
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,580
I suspect that you have committed serious domestic violence.

83
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,540
No... He didn't!

84
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,420
Please don't call the police.

85
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,400
We won't quarrel any more. I promise!

86
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,580
Keep on making trouble. Satisfied now?

87
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,960
Sorry about that.

88
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,180
See?

89
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,820
You can't be polite to this kind of guy.

90
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,220
Let's go.

91
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,940
 I won't go back tonight.

92
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,680
 Go to bed early.

93
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,780
This is the information you needed for all the negotiators at Yigu Ventures.

94
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,860
Thanks.

95
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,000
There are also people from Anming Pharmaceutical Factory who came to the office to negotiate legal counsel business.

96
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,720
The client wanted you to take the case.

97
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,440
But I don't know why Old He handed the case to Gao Junchi.

98
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,100
He doesn't want me to overwhelm the balance of the place.

99
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,520
Then it's not cheap for Gao Junchi.

100
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,380
There's a negotiation tomorrow morning.

101
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,500
We have to work all night.

102
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,920
You've worked hard these days.

103
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,460
Why don't you go back to rest first?

104
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,060
How can I abandon my teammate at a crucial moment?

105
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,460
Coffee?

106
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,420
Thank you.

107
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,000
 The kids all liked the rescue knowledge that you taught.

108
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,420
 Can we go to visit your training base?

109
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,260
 I've been so busy with work lately that I can't go to the team.

110
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,220
 You can contact someone else.

111
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,700
Good morning, Mr. Luo.

112
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,020
- Go ahead. 
  - The delegate of Yigu VC will arrive at the hotel in half an hour.

113
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,880
 Chairman Fang is already there waiting.

114
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,580
 I'll go to talk with him first.

115
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,840
 You've worked all night so don't drive.

116
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,680
 A taxi should already be there waiting for you.

117
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,320
I'll be right there.

118
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,740
- Sir, please wait. 
 - Okay.

119
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,860
Old Hu!

120
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,920
Old Hu! Old Hu!

121
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,660
- What's wrong with him? 
 - He fell from the top.

122
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,400
Sir!

123
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,920
Sir! Can you hear me? Sir!

124
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,340
-  Sir! 
 - Old Hu!

125
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,940
Sir!

126
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,280
Beware of his leg.

127
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,420
Old Hu!

128
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,080
Be careful. He may have injured his brain.

129
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,900
 The number you dialed cannot be connected at the moment.

130
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,440
 Please dial again later.

131
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,140
Ariel.

132
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,340
Have you clearly marked the key points in the contract?

133
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,320
Don't worry, I've double-checked it.

134
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,500
Okay.

135
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,920
Mr. Luo must attend this negotiation.

136
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,560
What time is it? What about the others?

137
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,500
I'll call him again.

138
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:45,860
- Nice to meet you, Mr. Morgan. 
 - Nice to meet you, too.

139
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,020

140
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:50,830

141
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:01,640

142
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,260
How is he, Dr. Zhan?

143
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,520
He...

144
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,380
Fortunately, he arrived here in time. Life saved.

145
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:27,660
It was the first time that I saved one's life.

146
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,320
I feel...

147
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,420
You've done well.

148
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,320
Thank you.

149
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,660
I have to meet a client.

150
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,140
See you.

151
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,000
Hold on.

152
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,520
Are you going to meet them in this way?

153
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,200
What's the matter?

154
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,320
Take it.

155
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,000
Cai Yuxiao's.

156
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,020
I'll tell him later.

157
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,700
No, thanks. I can solve it myself.

158
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,760
Aren't you in a hurry?

159
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,960
You want me to accept it.

160
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,480
Thanks.

161
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,160
Product quality and excellent service are our core competitiveness.

162
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:30,600
Our Fangqin Group has been steadily increasing its growth rate and market sales rate this year.

163
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,920
Mr. Morgan,

164
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,860
if Yigu can invest in us,

165
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,420
I can promise that

166
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:48,140
our average growth rate will exceed more than 20%.

167
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,860
If we can go into business together,

168
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:55,180
as for the interests, we can discuss it in detail in the contract.

169
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:03,720
Everyone knows that Yigu has strong capital strength.

170
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:10,900
This also means that we have very strict requirements and selection criteria for cooperative enterprises.

171
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,200
According to our understanding,

172
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:22,400
Fangqin Group has developed rapidly since its establishment, but in fact, your foundation is very shallow.

173
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,940
This worries me a bit.

174
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,380
 Luo Ben, where are you?

175
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,980
Luo Ben, you are finally here. Chairman Fang is anxious to death.

176
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,520
Understood.

177
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm not feeling very well and optimistic...

178
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,900
Why have you come so late?

179
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,500
I'm sorry to tell you that

180
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:14,080
I've heard or seen nothing which could touch me.

181
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,440
Mr. Morgan,

182
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,200
There are many well-known companies in the world that started from scratch.

183
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,800
The development momentum of our Fangqin Group in the past two years has been very good.

184
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,780
And China's market development potential is huge.

185
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:31,320
You can find our detailed data in the report.

186
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,280
I don't need big data.

187
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,980
Data is biased.

188
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,160
I rely on my own judgment

189
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,740
so we don't need to talk further.

190
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,700
Excuse me. Hold on a second.

191
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,820
Mr. Morgan.

192
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,440
This way, please.

193
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,860
Okay.

194
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,720
All the time, you know, it's complicated.

195
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,920
What's going on?

196
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,020
Attention, please. This is the fire alarm.

197
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:37,510
Please don't panic. Please follow me and evacuate.

198
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,320
This way, please.

199
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,880
- Are you okay? 
 - What's going on?

200
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,020
Fire alarm. We must leave here right now.

201
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,560
Okay.

202
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,200
Please leave here in order.

203
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,360
Follow up.

204
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,860
Hurry. Speed up.

205
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,400
This way, please.

206
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,920
Okay.

207
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,520
Follow me.

208
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,400
Please, Mr. Morgan.

209
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,660
This way.

210
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,380
He's here.

211
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,920
- Everything all right? 
 - Yeah.

212
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,260
I'm fine.

213
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,160
Mr. Morgan, are you okay?

214
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,700
I'm fine. You acted promptly.

215
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,940
When we sounded the alarm, I found your staff were all calm.

216
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,420
Have you practiced before?

217
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:49,060
Are the oxygen masks always prepared?

218
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:53,780
Fangqin is a group with a strong sense of crisis.

219
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:57,960
During our evolution, we not only guard against risks from the market

220
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,800
but also emphasize the prevention and rescue of disasters.

221
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,880
Every employee must receive rescue and self-rescue training.

222
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,980
To save themselves and others when disaster strikes.

223
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,400
In this way, the enterprise can develop more lastingly.

224
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,220
Is that right, Mr. Morgan?

225
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,020
Of course. Exactly.

226
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,200
Chairman, the cause of the accident has been identified

227
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,160
Someone was smoking in the lavatory, which caused the alarm to go off.

228
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,820
The alarm has now been lifted.  The delegates can now go upstairs.

229
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:31,180
I'm very sorry. I think the alarm should have been caused by me.

230
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,200
I was smoking at that time.

231
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,920
Anyhow, I'm grateful for it.

232
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,220
It shows me both you senior executives

233
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:42,300
and employees could retreat in order.

234
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:47,240
It seems they're all trained. Very nice.

235
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,160
I have reason to believe in a crisis-conscious enterprise;

236
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,920
every step it takes will be exceptionally robust and solid.

237
00:17:54,920 --> 00:18:01,060
Therefore, we are very sincere in discussing cooperation issues with Fangqin Group.

238
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:06,240
I believe when you walk into Fangqin and understand Fangqin,

239
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,220
everyone will have a newer and deeper understanding of us.

240
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,480
Come in, please.

241
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,760
Please.

242
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,480
Let's go.

243
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,700
It's so wonderful.

244
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:30,280
With your superb skills, no one can refuse you.

245
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,640
So you've planned everything today?

246
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,320
I came up with the idea after I entered the company.

247
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,740
How did you come up with the idea of the smoke alarm?

248
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,900
When I was investigating it,

249
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,060
I found that Yigu VC is equipped with its own emergency rescue team.

250
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:50,740
The Fangqin Group also established its own emergency rescue team.

251
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:55,500
On this point, the two companies coincide.

252
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,720
So how were you so sure that Mr. Morgan would set off the smoke alarm?

253
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,100
The materials you provide were important.

254
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,680
Mr. Morgan is addicted to tobacco.

255
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,120
He will take one every 20 minutes.

256
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,560
Then I asked Chen Xing to increase the sensitivity of the alarm.

257
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,420
So I found so many pieces of information and you used this one?

258
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,060
One useful piece of information is enough.

259
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,680
We must celebrate this evening.

260
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,700
I'll choose the restaurant and dishes.

261
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,840
Your job is to pay the bill.

262
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,180
No problem.

263
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,880
 Dean, let me report to you.

264
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,980
By the way, Yuxiao.

265
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,860
That tie you put in the office,

266
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,640
I borrowed it temporarily.

267
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,960
Okay. Just take it.

268
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:45,620
I know you won't mind it but I still need to buy you a new tie.

269
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:48,480
Never mind. It was a spare.

270
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,420
I'm exhausted.

271
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,460
I went to the mall nearby to buy some masks.

272
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,500
I'm exhausted from walking all that way.

273
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,460
What were you doing?

274
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,540
Picking up a tie.

275
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:12,060
Pick up a tie? Why? To whom?

276
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,800
Cai Yuxiao?

277
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,320
The story of the two of you begins?

278
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,740
Who confessed first?  Don't lie to me.

279
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,540
You've thought too much.

280
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:27,500
I give you my heart and my lungs.  Every time I fall in love, I will tell you every time.

281
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,100
But you two are still hiding it from me when it comes to giving away the tie.

282
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,500
There's nothing between me and him.

283
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,980
Just once I took his tie for an urgent need.

284
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,920
So I want to buy him a new one. That's all.

285
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,540
Urgent need?

286
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,740
Then the story is more twisted.

287
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,860
Give me some details!

288
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,660
Thanks. I'm going to work now.

289
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,920
Tell me something.

290
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,340
What happened between Cai Yuxiao and you?

291
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,680
You're so scared.

292
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,720
Li Aiqi,

293
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:12,120
you even sound more and more like my mother when you walk.

294
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,380
I'll take that as a complement.

295
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,060
What's going on?

296
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,640
Have you seen Ding Dingding's new update?

297
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:23,140
Update? Let me see.

298
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,540
This episode doubled the number of hits compared to the previous episode.

299
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:29,140
Readers think Ding Dingding's drawing style is humorous and poignant.

300
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,860
The characters are vivid and the storyline is funny.

301
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:35,600
Especially when the leading lady Ding Xiaoxiao taught Zhou Mengmeng a lesson.

302
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,320
It's gotten more than 1,000 comments.

303
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,160
Ding Dingding!

304
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,720
What's going on?

305
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,700
Can't you see? She's slandering me!

306
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:52,580
When I saw the names of Ding Xiaoxiao and Zhou Mengmeng, I already guessed that you two must know each other.

307
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:56,300
And the relationship is not normal.

308
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,820
I saved her life in Fengxi but I gained her ingratitude.

309
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:04,340
I think it doesn't matter if the manga is popular and the storyline is exaggerated.

310
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,720
I refuse!

311
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,560
I paid her to draw comics and she slandered me in the comics.

312
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,100
Am I crazy?

313
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,340
Change them all!

314
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,360
All?

315
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,000
It's impossible. At least the ones that are online can't be changed.

316
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,380
Let her change the latter.

317
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:21,780
In short, Zhou Mengmeng must be portrayed as a positive character.

318
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,240
What if she refuses?

319
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,020
I've been on her guard for a long time.

320
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:28,120
I've already added something to the contract.

321
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,880
She's responsible to change it according to party A's opinion

322
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:36,120
until party A is satisfied. And I'm party A.

323
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,800
I refuse!

324
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,000
It violates my original intention of creation.

325
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,600
 Besides, readers now like the characters of Ding Xiaoxiao and Zhou Mengmeng.

326
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,900
If I agree to change, won't all my work be ruined?

327
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,700
We've also considered it.

328
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,300
Our director means that we can maintain the former parts

329
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,800
 and change the later plots gradually.

330
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:01,800
Gradually break up the characters of Ding Xiaoxiao and Zhou Mengmeng.

331
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,300
It's easy for you to say!

332
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,700
Put your director on the phone!

333
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,600
It's inconvenient for him right now.

334
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,600
You can just tell me.

335
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,200
What a director!

336
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,010
Does he know cartoons?

337
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,100
Hello?

338
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,500
She's so rude!

339
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,700
Why don't you tell her yourself?

340
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,400
She doesn't know it was I who hired her.

341
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,400
It's complicated.

342
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,500
We're not only party A and party B but also teammates.

343
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,600
We can't turn nasty.

344
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,900
I see she doesn't care if she draws you like that.

345
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,400
She has a different brain and can't compare to a normal person.

346
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,600
Fine.

347
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,000
I have to persuade you that you can't hide it from her forever.

348
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,200
I see.

349
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,400
Your words are quite the same as my mom's.

350
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,000
I have to work now.

351
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,500
Hello. What can I do for you?

352
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,130
I want to find your director.

353
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,800
Which one?

354
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,600
Well...

355
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,700
Li Aiqi.

356
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,400
Secretary Li?

357
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,600
- Yes. 
 - Hold on.

358
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,200
- I'll call her here. 
 - Okay, thank you.

359
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,800
 Are all sizes available?

360
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,600
 Let me try this.

361
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,300
 Okay.

362
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,980
Ding Dingding!

363
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,600
Yes.

364
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,200
Come with me.

365
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,100
Is it a matter of changing the character of the story?

366
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,500
I need to talk to him face to face.

367
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,200
He's not here.

368
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,200
By the way, what should I call him?

369
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,400
You can call him Mr. Ming.

370
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,200
Mr. Ming?

371
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,700
I want to tell Mr. Ming that my comics must not be changed.

372
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,400
What does Mr. Ming mean? I've told you clearly about it.

373
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,600
If you don't agree, we can only follow the contract.

374
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,400
According to Clause 3 of Article 5 of the contract,

375
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,500
party B is under obligation to revise the cartoon until Party A is satisfied.

376
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,900
If you refuse to obey, then we can only terminate the contract.

377
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,600
I don't care!

378
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,200
Fine.

379
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,300
I'll contact the lawyer to terminate the contract.

380
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:17,100
You only need to refund our previous payment in one lump sum within the stipulated time.

381
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,800
Return?

382
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,600
Any problem?

383
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,100
I've already paid my rent...

384
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,300
If so...

385
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,100
According to the contract...

386
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,000
Secretary Li.

387
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:38,000
In fact, I'm a person whose creative thinking is very flexible.

388
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,900
As long as it's good for my work, I can accept other criticism modestly.

389
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,200
So?

390
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,000
Fine. I'll revise it as you requested!

391
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Great.

392
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,800
Enjoy our cooperation.

393
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,000
Yeah. Enjoy.

394
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,800
Take care.

395
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,900
 If I hadn't spent all my money, I'd have left sooner.

396
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,000
Take care. See you.

397
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,500
Bye-bye.

398
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,800
Solved?

399
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
No wonder my mom appreciates you so much.

400
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,200
You can solve everything. I owe you a meal.

401
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,900
How many meals have you owed?

402
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,800
- Well... 
 - Where's my bus pass?

403
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,800
Ding Dingding!

404
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,800
I forgot my bus pass.

405
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,300
Zhou Mingming?

406
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,500
Ding Dingding.

407
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,700
Miss Aiqi, here's your coffee.

408
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,400
Thank you.

409
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,600
I thought I saw someone familiar.

410
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,200
Why are you here?

411
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,300
I work here.

412
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,800
Do you need to work?

413
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,900
Are you looking for a place to hang out?

414
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,500
What's your job?

415
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,100
Just an errand boy.

416
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,800
That includes serving tea and water?

417
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,400
It seems you don't have a good life.

418
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,600
By the way, how is Director Ming?

419
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,100
Director Ming...

420
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,600
- You mean him. 
 - Is he particularly difficult?

421
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,800
I feel like he's a guy who doesn't know how to pretend all day.

422
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,000
What did you forget?

423
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,620
My bus pass. Right here. Let's chat later.

424
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:31,110

425
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,200
He left?

426
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,700
Zhou Mingming.

427
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
One more meal.

428
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,000
The wound of Bed 15 isn't recovering well.

429
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,400
Ask him to stay here longer.

430
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,600
Okay.

431
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,030
Let's go.

432
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,900
Yuxiao.

433
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,800
What's going on?

434
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,500
I'm returning this.

435
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,400
I told you you didn't have to.

436
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,900
Take it.

437
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,800
Fine. I'll keep it.

438
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,400
The color is beautiful.

439
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,600
Excuse me. Where's Dr. Zhan?

440
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,900
I can't contact her.

441
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,900
She's having a meeting now. What's up?

442
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,500
I...

443
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,000
Nothing.

444
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,800
- Mr. Luo. 
 - Dr. Cai.

445
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,500
Are you looking for Dr. Zhan?

446
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,200
It's the same if I find you.

447
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,800
What do you mean?

448
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,300
Zhan Yan lent me your tie for an urgent need.

449
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,500
I bought you a new one.

450
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,000
Thank you.

451
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
But no need.

452
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,400
I don't like owing others a favor.

453
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,000
You owe me nothing.

454
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,900
Dr. Zhan has already bought me a new one.

455
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,500
Keep it yourself.

456
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,900
Dr. Cai, I've been feeling a little unwell recently.

457
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:22,700
I always have chest tightness, can you help me take a look?

458
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,400
- Have you had an electrocardiogram? 
 - No.

459
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,800
I suggest you do an EKG first.

460
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,500
Come in.

461
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,600
Mr. Luo, why are you free today?

462
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,000
You don't need to bring me a gift.

463
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,200
A tie?

464
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,000
Take it if you like it.

465
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,200
It doesn't sound like my gift.

466
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,400
Besides, I've worn no tie since childhood.

467
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,000
Tell me. What do you like?

468
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,800
I'll buy it for you.

469
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,800
Sincerely buy it for me?

470
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,100
Buy me some wine.

471
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,800
Well...

472
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,400
You make me uncomfortable.

473
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,800
How is this possible?

474
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,400
How is it impossible?

475
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,000
I'm fine.

476
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,600
Please help me.

477
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,100
I...

478
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,100
I can't handle that.

479
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,700
Isn't that easy for you to do?

480
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,400
Fine.

481
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,600
Okay.

482
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,000
Wait for me. I'll be right back.

483
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,100
Thank you. Hurry up!

484
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,200
Dr. Cai, your coffee.

485
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,800
Thank you.

486
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,700
Congratulations.

487
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,200
For what?

488
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,000
I heard that Zhan Yan sent you a tie.

489
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,100
Is that right?

490
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:58,400
It means a lot when a girl sends a tie to a man.

491
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,970
I know you're still interested in her. Seize the chance.

492
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:04,200
Go ahead. You're not young.

493
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,300
Don't let me worry about you. Okay?

494
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,100
It's working hours.

495
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,600
Don't gossip.

496
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,400
Just pretend then.

497
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,300
You're my dude! My good buddy!

498
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:37,200
If Zhan Yan finds out, we both won't be able to eat and walk away.

499
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,200
Only Heaven and we know it.

500
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,400
She won't know it if you don't tell her.

501
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,600
Heaven knows...

502
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,400
Enough! Stop eating!

503
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,600
The last one!

504
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,700
So many "last ones"!

505
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,100
You've bought them so how can I waste them?

506
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,800
Your body can't stand it.

507
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,500
Who allowed you to eat it?

508
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:08,000
Oh, no.

509
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I told him I couldn't eat this greasy food but he insisted.

510
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,400
- Insisted? 
 - And he said, "Only Heaven and we know it.".

511
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,000
What did I tell you?

512
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,500
- Mr. Luo. 
 - Come on.

513
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,000
You bought it?

514
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,800
No... I...

515
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,600
Well, yes.

516
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,000
Don't you know what's going on with him now?

517
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,200
Don't you know he can't eat such greasy food now?

518
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,800
That's it! How dare you!

519
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,400
I won't buy it for him next time.

520
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:46,400
Well, Yan. Youngsters can make a mistake.

521
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,300
He will change.

522
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,100
How do you feel today?

523
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,800
Much better.

524
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,400
The doctor said I could be discharged tomorrow.

525
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,500
If so, you still need to pay attention to your diet.

526
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,200
You're right! I will!

527
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,900
Come on. You're quite busy. Work first.

528
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,000
You can leave me alone.

529
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,500
We...

530
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,800
Here you go.

531
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,700
It's for your own good.

532
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,400
My own good...

533
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,600
- No next time. 
 - Okay.

534
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,500
Still eating?

535
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,500
Okay. Stop, stop, stop!

536
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,600
Comrade Falcon.

537
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,800
I've seen people stabbed in the back

538
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:56,500
but I've never seen a stab in the chest like what you did.

539
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,400
Only Heaven and we know.

540
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,900
Shame on you.

541
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:06,000
Thank you for helping me!

542
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,400
I, Falcon, owe you a favor.

543
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,700
You should remember it.

544
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,900
Let's go out for a walk.

545
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,900
Does the doctor allow it?

546
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:17,800
No eating. And no walking?

547
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,800
Besides, I need to digest all these fried drumsticks.

548
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,200
100 steps after a meal can help you live to 99.

549
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,400
- Come on. 
 - Let's go.

550
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,900
Look at your.  Wherever you go, you're always tying knots.

551
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:40,800
Veterans' habit.

552
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,300
Look at this little rope.

553
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:47,400
It can be used to carry things, a pully rope... Depends on how you see it...

554
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,000
I can still get him.

555
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,000
Let me see.

556
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,600
Here you are.

557
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,600
Let's sit down.

558
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:03,500
I heard you failed?

559
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,200
That test... was an accident.

560
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Do you blame Dr. Cai?

561
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,400
He can't be blamed.

562
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,100
Do you feel it was unfair?

563
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:23,400
I do. It wasn't fair.

564
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,100
Actually, there is nothing fair or unfair.

565
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:30,000
It's a unified examination.

566
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
It wasn't aimed at you.

567
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
You need to think of the reason behind it.

568
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:44,700
Rescue workers must be prudent. Careful, careful, and more careful.

569
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,200
Do you know why?

570
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,600
What we confront are lives.

571
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,600
Take me for example.

572
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:56,400
I've practiced tying knots for 20 years but I still keep on practicing now.

573
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,800
Why?

574
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,800
I need to transform it into my muscle memory.

575
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,700
Engrave it in my mind.

576
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:08,000
Then I can succeed every time.

577
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,000
Understand?

578
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,800
Yes. I know what you mean.

579
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,800
Don't persuade me.

580
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,500
Your expression shows that you haven't.

581
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:25,100
You are still far from understanding. Like this.

582
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,200
Maybe not that far.

583
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,500
Your hand drill! I've told you so many times!

584
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:43,000
Pay attention to construction, angle and position!

585
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,700
Yes, sir! Understood!

586
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,800
And you!

587
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,800
Hold it steadily! Don't move!

588
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,400
I see. Move on.

589
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,400
Look at them!

590
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,000
 Yes, sir!

591
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,800
- Falcon! 
 - Falcon is back!

592
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,800
You are finally back.

593
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,100
- What do you mean? 
 - Captain.

594
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:16,200
Were you waiting for me to come back or wishing I wouldn't come back?

595
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,700
- See? 
 - Too exaggerating.

596
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,600
You've occupied my loud-speaker!

597
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,300
I'm here to help you watch them for fear of them getting bored.

598
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,000
As you're back, here you are.

599
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,800
Take it yourself.

600
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,400
Don't want to loaf. It belongs to you.

601
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,700
Just keep it. Why so many words?

602
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,300
Take it back, Falcon.

603
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:40,800
We can't live without your yells. We're not used to it!

604
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,100
 That's it!

605
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,400
Falcon,

606
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,000
everyone cares about you.

607
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,300
They came to ask me about you every day.

608
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,400
I was almost tired of answering them.

609
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,600
Don't worry, my bros!

610
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,700
I'm made of iron!

611
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,400
 Good!

612
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,400
My baby Doubao!

613
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,400
Come here, Doubao! I miss you so much!

614
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,200
Did Xiong Fei feed you well?

615
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,600
He's out this week.

616
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:12,000
We took turns looking after it.

617
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,600
That's it. He's been waiting for you every day.

618
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,400
Why are you looking at me?

619
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,600
- Go back to training. 
 - Okay. Back to training.

620
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,200
 Yes!

621
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,000
I'll bring it out to play.

622
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,200
Okay.

623
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,400
Doubao, let's go!

624
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:38,500
♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

625
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,800
♫  I put out mountain fires  ♫

626
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,700

630
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:07,200
♫  Like a dream maker  ♫

631
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:12,100
♫  Reading the universe and stars  ♫

632
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,500
♫  My existence in the river of time  ♫

633

646
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,300
Good boy. Let's go! Watch out.

647
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,800
Don't worry. It won't bite.

648
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,660
He's called Doubao.

649
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,600
Come over here.

650
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,400
Okay, bye!

651
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,400
Ms. Luo, are you looking for someone?

652
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:55,500
You're close to Doubao.

653
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,400
Come to play with it.

654
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
That's all.

655
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,500
Goodbye.

656
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:21,030

657
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:30,600

659
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:45,500

00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:52,800
♫  Until people hugged each other  ♫

661
00:43:52,800 --> 00:44:00,700
♫  I've been on the road  ♫

662
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:08,800
♫  Trying to connect laughter and tears  ♫

663
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:15,800
♫  I suddenly have faith  ♫

664
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:23,400
♫  I can walk by millions of shining household lights  ♫

665
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:31,200
♫  I hope I can admire flowers in the afterglow  ♫

666
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:38,400
♫  Shed tears and hope that you are well  ♫

667
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:47,100
♫  The good times I'm pursuing belong to the light  ♫

668
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:54,700
♫  It can light up the wounds that follow  ♫

669
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:58,500
♫  Catching the floating stars  ♫

670
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:02,300
♫  Watching as the memories flash by  ♫

671
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:06,000
♫  Traveling through market scenes  ♫

672
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,800
♫  With a fiery gaze  ♫

673
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,400
♫  I can't fly  ♫

674
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:17,100
♫  But I can look up  ♫

675
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:24,300
♫  I'm always on the road chasing the light  ♫
