Hello, Attorney Luo.

Hello, Mr. Fang.

26
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,130
Thank you for coming by.

my job is much easier.

So,

34
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,490
I came to you.

35
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:07,690
You're making fun of me, Mr. Fang.

I'm sure you are a busy man, too.

how can I help?

39
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:15,930

We had no orders lately,

rid of the freeloaders.

Who knows
how many people will be laid off?

Hope it will not happen to us.

The HR department
can't do anything about me,

00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:15,970
so they sent you.

65
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,530
I'm telling you,

66
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,880
there's no way I'm signing

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
the agreement.

68
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,810

00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,930
32 years old.

72
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,370
Two years ago,

73
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,610
you were hired through
community recommendation.

74
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:35,730
Well,

75
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,320
need I say more?

76
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,730
Don't get me wrong.

77
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,610
No one cares about your past.

78
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,400
Layoffs

79
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,200
are a normal market activity.

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,320
Indeed, you've done nothing wrong.

81
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,640
But you made no contribution, either.

82
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,320
You always kept to yourself

83
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:56,850
and were never a team player.

84
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,250
In the same conditions,

85
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,610
you are not competitive.

86
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,200
So please try to understand.

87
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,440
If you sign the agreement now,

88
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,050
you'll get a generous

89
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,400
compensation from the company.

how's it going?

99
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,050
Are the new recruits getting used

100
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,810
to the physical training?

101
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:28,880
Yeah, they are.

102
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,290
Much better than Luo Ben
and Mingming's group.

103
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,250
Young people now

104

Their overall fitness

106
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,250
improved a lot.

107

108
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,810
calm down.

109
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:41,730
Shut up!

110
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,050
Go get the factory manager here!

111
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,050
I want my name

112
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,320
crossed off the list!

113
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:46,130
Or else,

114
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47,640
I'll jump from here.

115
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:48,320
Okay, okay.

116
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:48,930
I'll die,

117
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,880
and I'll take her down with me!

118
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,130
Qiu Zhigang!

119
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:52,320
What are you doing?

120
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,320
Stop it!

121

Qiu Zhigang!

122
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,130

123
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,080
Don't do it!

124
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,000
Are you crazy?

125
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:57,560
Stop it now!

126
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,520
The building is too high.

127
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,960
I'm afraid we can't make it.

128
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,690
Call the police.

129
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:01,730

it's just a job.

133

It's not worth it.

134
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,760
Are you crazy?

135
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,690
What do you want?

136
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,320
Talk to the director.

137
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,050
One job's not worth it.

138
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,130
Hello, Chen Xing.

139
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:19,370
What?

140
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:21,730
Okay.

141
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,690
You guys start getting ready.

142
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,320
I'm on my way.

What's going on?

144
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,560
A jumper at the auto parts factory.

145
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,400
The factory's not far from here.

146
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,130
Go there quickly.

147
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,760
Okay.

148
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,810
I'll go help.

149
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:32,370
Okay.

150

You're committing a crime.

00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,000
Shut up!

153
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:41,640
Or I will

154
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,490
throw you out now.

155

One job's not worth it!

158
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,730

00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,050
Don't come any closer!

162
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:51,640
Don't move!

163
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,080
Keep away!

164
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,610
Or I'll hurt her!

165

(Qiu Zhigang)

166
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,000
Qiu Zhigang, right?

167
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:01,930
I know

168
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:03,490
getting laid off

169
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,200
is hard for you to accept.

170
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,640
Let her go.

171
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,200
Tell me what you want.

172
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,320
Let's talk it over.

173
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,050
You must agree to my terms first!

174
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,520
Or I'll throw her out now!

175

176
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:17,290
This job

177
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,690
is very important to you now.

178
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:19,690
But,

179
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:21,370
do you want to

180
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:22,370
commit another crime

181
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,610
because of a job?

182
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,170
Go!

183
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:31,520
You two establish the anchor.

184
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:32,520
You two prepare the rescue ropes.

185
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:33,290
Yes, sir!

186
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,140
(Linjiang Force Can Be Auto Parts)

187
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,640
Zhigang!

188
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:04,200
Zhigang!

189
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,640
Let it go!

190
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:06,640
It's not worth it.

191
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:07,730
Stop it.

192
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,050
It's no big deal.

193
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,050
Isn't she Luo Ben's colleague?

194
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:12,850
It's Ai Rui'er.

195
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,440
Xiong Fei, come on.

196
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,080
Come with me.

197
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,610
Walk and talk.

198
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:16,080
Okay.

199
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:18,640
Back up, please.

200
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:19,640
Back off.

201
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,960
Zhigang, don't do it.

202
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,690
We all want to help you.

203
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,400
But I don't think

204
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:26,610
you want to hurt a woman.

205
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,130
I'm a legal advisor.

206
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,000
I can talk to you on behalf of Mr. Fang.

207
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:31,490
How about this?

208
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,130
You let her go,

209
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:35,130
and I'll be your hostage.

210
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,170
Don't move!

211
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:37,640
Don't try to play tricks.

212
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:38,520
I promise

213
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,250
I won't do anything.

214
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,130
I just want to trade me for her.

215
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,920
Don't come any closer!

216
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,130
I told you

217
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,490
I won't resist.

218
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,490
Don't do that.

219
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:18,640
Look.

220
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:21,330
How about this?

221
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,090
Don't try to play tricks.

222
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:28,850
I won't.

223
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:36,640
This guy

224
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,800
has been in the factory for two years.

225
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,210
He's done his job fine,

226
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,040
but has a bad personality.

227
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:42,570
This way.

228
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:50,490
You three cooperate with me.

229
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,800
Find a chance to inform Luo Ben.

230
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,250
Okay.

231
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,000
Let her go.

232
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:56,800
Closer!

233
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:57,850
All right.

234
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:11,570
Look, that guy's

235
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,760
replaced the girl.

236
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:13,850
Yeah.

237
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,330
Ai Rui'er, you go out first.

238
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,160
Let me talk to him.

239
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,040
I'm sure

240
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,090
he wants to work things out, too.

241
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,370
Ai Rui'er, come on, let's go.

242
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,400
Calm down. Calm down.

243
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,040
Okay. Let's go. Come on.

244
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,270
Qiu Zhigang,

245
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:38,690
you already have two years of

246
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:39,870
work experience.

247
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,810
Even if you get laid off,

248
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,790
you can still find

249
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:44,810
a suitable job somewhere else

250
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:45,990
in the future.

251
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:46,870
But,

252
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,750
if you jump off now,

253
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,090
you won't even have a chance

254
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:51,030
to prove yourself.

255
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:52,990
You can trust me.

256
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,750
I'm a lawyer.

257
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,910
If you feel that

258
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,530
you've been treated unfairly,

259
00:10:58,530 --> 00:10:59,710
I can help you.

260
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,510
You are all in it together!

261
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,510
Why would you want to help me?

262
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,390
Your being laid off

263
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,230
is neither because of who you are

264
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,990
nor your ex-conviction.

265
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,270
If you feel aggrieved,

266
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,870
I'll introduce you to another lawyer.

267
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,090
There are always

268
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:17,230
legal ways

269
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,030
to stand up for yourself.

270
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,470
Instead of going to extremes

271
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,150
and acting like this.

272
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,870
Qiu Zhigang,

273
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,350
let me ask you.

274
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,110
Before you did this,

275
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,510
have you ever
thought about your parents?

276
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,390
I just read your resume.

277
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,510
Your parents

278
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,510
are both in their seventies.

279
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,110
If something happens to you,

280
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,390
who will support them

281
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,630
in the future?

282
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,810
You had served your time before,

283
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,270
which made them worried so much.

284
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,150
Can you bear to

285
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,650
break their

286
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:14,630
hearts again?

287
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,630
It's okay.

288
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,810
It looks like it's okay.

289
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:33,510
Yes.

290
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,710
Mom, Dad.

291
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,710
I'm sorry.

292
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,510
Qiu Zhigang,

293
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,750
trust me.

294
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,110
Come in now.

295
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,050
We'll do everything we can

296
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,750
to give you what you want.

297
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,230
Come in.

298
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,270
Will you help me?

299
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,510
Of course I will.

300
00:12:59,420 --> 00:12:59,990
Come on.

301
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,390
Qiu Zhigang!

302
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,510
Help me!

303
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,750
Help!

304
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:14,750
Qiu Zhigang!

305
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,510
Grab him!

306
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,030
Grab him!

307
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,870
Help me!

308
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:29,990
Hold on tight!

309
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,410
Help me! Help me!

310
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:34,450
I got you.

311
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:35,630
Hold on tight.

312
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,630
- Hold on tight and don't move!
- Help!

313
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:39,810
Hold on!

314
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:40,270
Help!

315
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,210
Xiong Fei, hurry up!

316
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,030
Help!

317
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,110
Hold on.

318
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,390
Hang on, Zhigang!

319
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,630
I can't hold on much longer.

320
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,990
I don't want to die!

321
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,790
Hold on just a little longer.

322
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,990
Hold on tight!

323
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,870
Help me!

324
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,790
Xiong Fei!

325
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,350
I can't hold on any longer!

326
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:44,910
Zhigang.

327
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,390
Are you okay?

328
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,590
Thank you. Thank you.

329
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,150
You...

330
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,350
Why did you do that?

331
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,790
Why are you so stupid?

332
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,750
Do you remember me?

333
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,810
Thank you.

334
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:03,630
Come with us.

335
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,110
Xiong Fei.

336
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,110
Xiong Fei, well done.

337
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:13,990
All clear.

338
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,060
(Fangqin Group)

339
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,390
Collect the ropes.

340
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:27,750
Luo Ben.

341
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,470
Are you okay?

342
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,270
I was so scared.

343
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,630
I'm fine.

344
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,390
I'll send you back.

345
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,570
Hi, Luo Ben.

346
00:16:58,570 --> 00:16:59,230
Hi, Shen Ruoxi.

347
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,570
I'm looking for Qiu Zhigang.

348
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,270
Up ahead, turn right. Room 7.

349
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,630
Thank you.

350
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:09,990
Zhan Yan.

351
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:12,990
Luo Ben is here.

352
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,510
He's visiting Qiu Zhigang.

353
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,790
Did you send the information

354
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,350
Xu Zirui asked for?

355
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:20,830
I'm on it.

356
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,070
But I thought

357
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,690
he'd come to see you later.

358
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:25,010
So don't go anywhere.

359
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,510
Stay close. I'm going.

360
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,790
Stay right here.

361
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,490
The company will pay you

362
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,190
worker's compensation.

363
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,270
If there are no problems,

364
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,710
you can sign it now.

365
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,550
Take a look.

366
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,410
This is the Employment Training Form

367
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:07,690
from the community.

368
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,350
Fill it out
and give it to the community,

369
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,710
they will help you.

370
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,190
Thank you. Thank you.

371
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:14,990
You have to

372
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,510
move forward.

373
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,970
Let the past

374
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,190
be the past.

375
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,790
You've made mistakes and regrets,

376
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,610
that's why you should cherish

377
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:24,910
your future more.

378
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,310
It's easier said than done.

379
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,590
How many people can do it?

380
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,510
Hey, sis.

381
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,730
When are you coming back?

382
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:43,830
Just closed.

383
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:44,950
About half an hour.

384
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:46,770
Then I'll wait for you to come back.

385
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:47,990
I need to talk to you.

386
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:50,510
Okay.

387
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,550
I have something

388
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,670
to tell you, too.

389
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,150
Okay. Bye.

390
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:01,350
Dad.

391
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,070
Here you are.

392
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:05,990
Hello.

393
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,190
Come on.

394
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,510
Wash your hands and eat.
We have a guest today.

395
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,250
Okay.

396
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,030
Go on.

397
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,070
Come on, sit down.

398
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,510
What's going on?

399
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,510
He's your sister's boyfriend.

400
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,910
Really?

401
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:39,750
Come on!

402
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,030
Come on, come on.

403
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:41,510
Come on.

404
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,070
Sit down.

405
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:43,850
Fei.

406
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,510
Let me introduce.

407
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,730
This is Su Zhan.

408
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,070
This is my brother, Xiong Fei.

409
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,070
Nice to meet you.

410
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,230
I've heard a lot about you.

411
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,610
Xiong Fei, you said

412
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:53,930
you have something to tell me.

413
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:54,790
What is it?

414
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,670
Nothing, nothing at all.

415
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,980
Come on. Cheers.

416
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,470
Come on.

417
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:04,750
To Mr. and Mrs. Xiong.

418
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,500
Thank you.

419
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,030
Thank you.

420
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,550
Thank you. Thank you.

421
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,540
(Out-patient)

422
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,070
Hello?

423
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,710
It's Ai Rui'er.

424
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,190
Can we meet?

425
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,750
I've broken up with Luo Ben.

426
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,210
I didn't expect

427
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,950
you're more direct than I thought.

428
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,150
That's right.

429
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,550
I did ask you

430
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,530
to meet me

431
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:43,030
because of Luo Ben.

432
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,910
You were there yesterday.

433
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,510
I want to hear your opinion.

434
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,990
About what?

435
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,950
About Luo Ben saving my life.

436
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,510
What do you think?

437
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,190
Since we've been partners,

438
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,770
everyone in the company thought

439
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,350
we'd be a perfect match.

440
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,230
And of course,

441
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,310
I also thought so myself.

442
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,230
Until you showed up.

443
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,250
So, you think

444
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,730
you two didn't get together

445
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:10,950
because of me?

446
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,310
In that landslide in Fengxi,

447
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,270
he risked his life to save you.

448
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,990
Other than Luo Yuan,

449
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,010
I've never seen

450
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:21,790
he cared so much about anyone.

451
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,990
But now I know,

452
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,350
he can care about me that much.

453
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,270
So this time,

454
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,830
I won't give him up again.

455
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,750
I'm afraid you've misunderstood.

456
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,270
If it were Shen Ruoxi,

457
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,830
he would've done the same.

458
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,310
No.

459
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,030
Quite the opposite.

460
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,150
I'm seeing things pretty clearly.

461
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,510
But you, on the other hand,

462
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,970
you're the one
who's still fooling yourself.

463
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:51,150
You and Luo Ben are no longer possible.

464
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,310
What happened
with Luo Ben and your father

465
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,290
is going to be a problem

466
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:55,830
you can never get over with.

467
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,150
Since you're tormenting each other,

468
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,830
you might as well just let go of it

469
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,310
and wish each other the best.

470
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,430
Did Luo Ben tell you that?

471
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,510
If it hadn't been for

472
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,230
your father's mistake,

473
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,690
Luo Ben's parents

474
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:09,190
wouldn't have died.

475
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,950
Neither would he have been
sent to the orphanage.

476
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,590
But fortunately,

477
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,030
he was adopted
by Luo Yuan's parents,

478
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,030
and they treated him like family.

479
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,150
But has it ever occurred to you that

480
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,070
if he had been adopted by someone else,

481
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,990
what kind of life
that seven-year-old boy

482
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,990
would've experienced?

483
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,250
Have you ever thought about it?

484
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,210
I don't care what happens

485
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:32,510
between you and him.

486
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,070
What happens between me and him

487
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,030
is none of your business.

488
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,910
If there's any possibility
between you two,

489
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,750
you wouldn't have come to meet me today.

490
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,910
If you broke up,

491
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,510
don't bother each other anymore.

492
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,510
Sir,

493
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,590
I want to join the
Frontier Assistance program.

494
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,510
You do?

495
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,270
This program is set up for

496
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,750
those young doctors

497
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,710
who have just graduated.

498
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,550
Of course

499
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,790
experienced doctors like you

500
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,590
are welcome to join the program.

501
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:19,590
But the hospital also needs you.

502
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,290
It's a doctor's duty

503
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:24,190
to heal the sick and save lives.

504
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,310
Actually, I've been
considering it for a while.

505
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,510
And it's

506
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,750
a good opportunity.

507
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,790
In fact, there are many excellent

508
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,230
doctors in the hospital.

509
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,010
Xiaolu, Zirui,

510
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:37,230
Cong Zhou, and the others

511
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,070
have already become

512
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,670
capable doctors.

513
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,530
It's time to put some pressure

514
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:44,350
on these young doctors,

515
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,990
and give them more

516
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,490
opportunities to mature

517
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:48,670
and improve.

518
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,970
Young doctors must have

519
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:53,930
a sense of responsibility
and a sense of mission,

520
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:55,950
and do more positive things.

521
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,470
You have my support.

522
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,790
Thank you, sir.

523
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,180
Please enjoy our wedding candies.

524
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,220
There are enough for everybody.

525
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:04,970
You're welcome. You're welcome.

526
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:05,940
Where's mine? Where's mine?

527
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,310
Come on.

528
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,290
- Give some to Cong.
- Of course.

529
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:08,830
Cong, please enjoy.

530
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,590
You're a very lucky man.

531
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:11,690
Thank you. Thank you.

532
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:12,260
Got to go.

533
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:12,770
Okay. Okay.

534
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:13,670
Congratulations!

535
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,350
Thank you. Thank you.

536
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,500
I'm so happy for you.

537
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,700
Thank you. Thank you.

538
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,230
Come on. Candies for everyone.

539
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,670
What's going on?

540
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:21,590
There are enough for everybody.

541
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,830
What's up, you guys?

542
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,070
You and Xiaolu?

543
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:26,970
You…

544
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:27,990
I didn't get your invitation.

545
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,230
How come you guys moved so fast?

546
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,230
We just got registered.

547
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,970
So candies for today,

548
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:34,490
and you're all welcome
to our wedding later.

549
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:35,590
Great!

550
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,990
Xu Zirui, good for you.

551
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:37,970
You've won

552
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:39,270
her heart just like that.

553
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,750
You don't know how hard it was.

554
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,590
I'll never

555
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,350
have the strength

556
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,510
to pursue another woman.

557
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,470
Another woman?

558
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,310
Xiaolu, Zirui,

559
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:48,930
congratulations.

560
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,190
- Thank you, Zhan Yan.
- Thank you, Zhan Yan.

561
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,210
When is

562
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:53,830
the wedding?

563
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,270
Western or Chinese?

564
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,780
You're more anxious than we are.

565
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,180
We decide to

566
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,220
discuss it with our parents.

567
00:24:59,220 --> 00:24:59,790
Xiaolu,

568
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,310
find a real good

569
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,300
wedding planner.

570
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,310
Whatever the cost.

571
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,150
There was an earthquake in
an island nation in South Asia.

572
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,530
They've requested the international

573
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:09,190
rescue organization for help.

574
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,290
International rescue

575
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:13,350
stresses the humanitarian spirit,

576
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,430
and our Light Chaser Rescue

577
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:16,730
should join

578
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:18,070
the ranks.

579
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,470
I know

580
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,270
you've been

581
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,250
preparing to participate in

582
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:22,830
international rescue for years.

583
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,510
That's right.

584
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:27,750
Light Chaser Rescue's been

585
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,470
around for over a decade,

586
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:30,750
and we're qualified for

587
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,470
international rescue missions.

588
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,590
It's just

589
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,290
I can't take it to keep

590
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:38,710
going forward anymore.

591
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:45,990
Qingshan,

592
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:47,990
Light Chaser Rescue

593
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,310
always need you,

594
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,350
in the past, present,

595
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,790
and future.

596
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,030
Yeah.

597
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,910
I need it, too.

598
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,350
But I can't keep up with

599
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,990
everyone physically and all.

600
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,830
If I'm still in charge,

601
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,910
I'll slow you down.

602
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,270
I've got my eye on someone.

603
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,510
Luo Ben?

604
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,350
Yes.

605
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,790
He's young.

606
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,670
He has the ability, the attitude,

607
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,710
and he's got knowledge and vision.

608
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,270
Luo Ben is good.

609
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,550
He's skillful,

610
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,790
good at his job,

611
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,750
and is well-liked in the team.

612
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:33,990
But he didn't sign up

613
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,670
for the last few missions.

614
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,270
It's because
he got a problem with me.

615
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,150
I think

616
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,550
it's just a matter of time.

617
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,550
Just take it slow.

618
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,070
I've watched him grow step by step

619
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,730
into a caring

620
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:54,310
and responsible rescuer.

621
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,970
If he quits the rescue team

622
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:58,710
because of me,

623
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,990
it would be a pity.

624
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,070
Hello, ma'am, Mr. Zhou.

625
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,210
The post-production of

626
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:16,730
the movie starts today.

627
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:18,230
Don't worry, Mom.

628
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,350
I'll keep an eye on it.

629
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:20,830
This project

630
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,430
has been brought back to life.

631
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,550
The credit goes to you.

632
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,510
I'll keep that in mind.

633
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,690
What are you talking about, Mom?

634
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:27,790
I'm just assisting you.

635
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,030
Since when you learned to be modest?

636
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,130
You know what,

637
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:32,710
Mom?

638
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,990
Actually, Dingding encouraged me.

639
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,670
I'm doing this to prove…

640
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:37,790
You don't have to prove anything.

641
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:38,970
Staying away from her

642
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:40,590
is the best way to prove it.

643
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,290
Hello, ma'am.

644
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:44,070
Aiqi,

645
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,510
the bank will

646
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,270
give us the loan in a couple of days.

647
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,790
- The second that money comes in,
- Okay.

648
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,750
pay the post-production company.

649
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:51,750
Yes, ma'am.

650
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,310
Keep an eye on him for me.

651
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,750
Make sure he won't meet that

652
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:57,670
Ding Dingding again.

653
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,270
Yes, ma'am.

654
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:10,770
Good shot.

655
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:11,550
Nice.

656
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,310
Mingming, you're here.

657
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,190
Hello.

658
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,510
You play?

659
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,710
Where's Dingding? Why isn't she here?

660
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,430
She's busy creating.

661
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,590
While we're drinking and singing,

662
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,490
she's creating rescue art.

663
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:26,910
That's another level.

664
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,290
You don't have to take that tone.

665
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,070
What's that about?

666
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,270
It's just been a few days,

667
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,550
do you miss me?

668
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,070
Here's your drink.

669
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,150
Thank you.

670
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,550
Mingming,

671
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,550
if there's something interesting,

672
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,210
don't just keep it to yourself.

673
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:40,750
You have to share it with your buddies.

674
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:41,550
Okay.

675
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,770
Then I'll introduce you

676
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:43,830
to join the rescue team.

677
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,250
If you want to be trainees,

678
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:47,030
maybe I can

679
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,270
instruct you a little.

680
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,310
Save it.

681
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,710
It seems a thankless task.

682
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,550
But maybe we can

683
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,070
have some fun outdoors.

684
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,990
Mountain climbing,
camping, and outdoor parties.

685
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:57,590
Sounds good?

686
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,510
Okay. Great.

687
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,750
You? Seriously?

688
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,550
You could even

689
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,190
fall off a bike.

690
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,990
It was an equipment problem.

691
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,150
Yes, of course.

692
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,590
Do you know any outdoor retailers?

693
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,990
Recommend one to me.

694
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:14,590
You know what?

695
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,730
I have a teammate

696
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:16,990
who happens to run an outdoor store.

697
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,270
I'll send you his WeChat account.

698
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,350
Okay.

699
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:22,950
Dapeng?

700
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,350
Yes, just ask him.

701
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,990
Impressive.

702
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,510
Looks quite professional.

703
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,190
One, two, three, four, five.

704
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,950
There are five of us.

705
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,670
Hello, Aiqi, what's up?

706
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,710
What?

707
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:55,750
Mom.

708
00:29:58,980 --> 00:29:59,990
What's going on?

709
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:09,790
The bank refused

710
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,030
(VIP Room)
to make loans to us.

711
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,790
She heard that and passed out.

712
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,950
Why didn't they give us a loan?

713
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,030
I asked Manager Zhang at the bank.

714
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,550
He said their re-evaluation showed

715
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,270
that the risk of giving

716
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,490
us a loan was too high.

717
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:24,710
What about other banks?

718
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,030
Our company

719
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,790
is Manager Zhang's old client.

720
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,230
Even he won't approve it.

721
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,950
Not to mention

722
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,230
other banks.

723
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:39,790
I see.

724
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:41,750
You go back first.

725
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,230
I'll take care of here.

726
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,710
Mingming?

727
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,070
Is it you?

728
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:47,990
Mom.

729
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,270
Mom.

730
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,030
Take me to the office.

731
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:54,830
Mom.

732
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,230
The doctor said

733
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,590
you need to lie quietly for a while.

734
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,950
How can I lie quietly after

735
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,910
such a big incident happened?

736
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:02,910
Aiqi,

737
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,510
make an appointment
with Manager Zhang.

738
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,470
I'll go talk to him myself.

739
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,510
Mom.

740
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,230
Mom.

741
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,990
I'll talk to Manager Zhang.

742
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,230
Don't worry.

743
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,750
I'll go

744
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,510
get the loan from the bank.

745
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:25,750
All you need to do is recover.

746
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,350
Ma'am,

747
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,430
you can trust Mingming.

748
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:33,750
Mom.

749
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,990
I'll take care of it.

750
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,270
Good boy.

751
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:45,790
This is good.

752
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,710
It's also expandable.

753
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,750
Mingming called me.

754
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:51,590
Trust me,

755
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,310
his friends are my friends.

756
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,350
Feel free to browse.

757
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,790
Whatever you need,

758
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:57,750
my wife will

759
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:58,590
help you get it.

760
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:59,310
Okay.

761
00:31:59,460 --> 00:31:59,990
All right.

762
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,590
This color's nice.

763
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,470
It's not a big store

764
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,670
Franchise, right?

765
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:06,830
What brand?

766
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:07,750
Yeah,

767
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,210
it's not big.

768
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:10,750
But I provide everything

769
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,290
you might need outdoor.

770
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:13,510
And I've tried them all.

771
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,790
I only recommend

772
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,350
qualified goods to friends.

773
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,510
No need to recommend.

774
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:20,070
I want the best

775
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,490
and the most expensive.

776
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:23,230
Okay.

777
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,070
Come on.

778
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,490
Take whatever you like.

779
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:27,150
Sure.

780
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,750
What if I like all of them?

781
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,670
Then just buy them all.

782
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,270
Even the best equipment

783
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,670
can only assist you.

784
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:40,310
You have to increase safety awareness.

785
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,150
What are you doing?

786
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,230
Hello.

787
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,250
Wrap this up.

788
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,030
All of these.

789
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,470
Okay, okay. Be right there.

790
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,030
Do your business well.

791
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,010
Do you have other colors?

792
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:57,270
I'll go check it out.

793
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,660
These ones?

794
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,830
We'll take all of them.

795
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:02,750
Manager Zhang,

796
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,730
listen to me.

797
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:04,530
We really are

798
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:05,990
in desperate need of funds.

799
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,510
As long as we get the money,

800
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,270
our movie will

801
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,750
definitely be a blockbuster.

802
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,510
Manager Zhang?

803
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:12,510
Hello?

804
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,310
What did the other two say?

805
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:24,990
We can't afford any delay.

806
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,710
We must pay them within this week.

807
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,310
The post-production company's
going to stop work.

808
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:28,750
And

809
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,270
they want to
sue us for breach of contract.

810
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,530
All the materials

811
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:32,750
are in their hands.

812
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,070
If it goes that far,

813
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,270
I can't imagine the consequences.

814
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,910
I'll see what I can do.

815
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,470
Hey, what's up?

816
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,470
Nothing. I just miss you.

817
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,910
Jeez, why so
sentimental all of a sudden?

818
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,790
I almost didn't recognize you.

819
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:25,950
Are you drawing?

820
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:26,830
What else?

821
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:27,590
My boyfriend

822
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:28,790
didn't ask me out.

823
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,790
My bad.

824
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,750
When I'm done with this,

825
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:36,670
I'll give you

826
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,950
a nice trip.

827
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:39,790
How about that?

828
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,430
Promise?

829
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,950
Promise.

830
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:46,190
I have to think about it.

831
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,540
How about going to Xinjiang?

832
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,950
Xinjiang fruit

833
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,290
is very tasty.

834
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:51,390
And the scenery is so beautiful.

835
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,070
Remember to
take pictures for me, will you?

836
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,710
Anything you say.

837
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,110
I'm going to make plans.

838
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,750
How about spending two weeks

839
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,430
to travel around, both north and south,

840
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,270
all right?

841
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,070
Why are you
so nice to me all of a sudden?

842
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,270
Is there anything
you're hiding from me?

843
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,750
No way.

844
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,230
I've nothing to hide from you.

845
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:12,310
Nothing?

846
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,270
Nothing.

847
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,270
Really?

848
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:15,790
Yeah.

849
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,270
I just feel so

850
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,630
relaxed and happy

851
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,550
when I'm with you.

852
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,070
You're very lucky to have

853
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,390
such a lovely girlfriend,

854
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,270
right?

855
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,270
Go ahead and draw.

856
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,350
I'll just watch you.

857
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:29,750
No.

858
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,470
Not without a kiss.

859
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,270
One more.

860
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:31,590
Luo Ben.

861
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,470
Luo Ben.

862
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,190
Ai Rui'er?

863
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:40,830
What a coincidence.

864
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,590
You said to take me out for exercise,

865
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,630
but you never did.

866
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:45,950
I had to work out on my own.

867
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,790
Come on.

868
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,870
Careful with your leg.

869
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:51,950
It's just recovered after all.

870
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,030
Don't worry.

871
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,190
I'm fine.

872
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:56,750
By the way,

873
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,310
this is for you.

874
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,030
What's this?

875
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,210
A fitness tracker.

876
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:05,270
It can monitor heart rate, exercise,

877
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,750
and your body functions.

878
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,310
It's perfect for people

879
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,750
like you who love working out.

880
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,190
No need.

881
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,550
You can keep it for yourself.

882
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,330
Your training is so intense now,

883
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:16,290
and your body functions

884
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:17,690
need to be monitored.

885
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:18,910
Come on. Let me help.

886
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,830
No, Ai Rui'er.

887
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:23,710
Thank you.

888
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,430
It's been so long.

889
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,310
I don't believe you can't see

890
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,590
that I like you.

891
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,190
Ai Rui'er,

892
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,190
I thought

893
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,630
we're just partners.

894
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,310
Do you really

895
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,790
have no feelings for me?

896
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,790
If I really like you,

897
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,710
there's no way

898
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,390
I can hide my feelings.

899
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,150
Sorry.

900
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,390
I don't feel that way about you.

901
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:14,910
If I had confessed

902
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,190
to you earlier,

903
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,210
would it have been

904
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:18,430
different between us?

905
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,630
Then I would've still

906
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,190
said the same thing to you.

907
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:27,750
I see.

908
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,430
Let's ride together.

909
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,630
Okay, let's go.

910
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,110
Let's go.

911
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:38,750
Hurry up.

912
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:39,750
Coming.

913
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,030

Still warm.

923
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:40,810
Thank you.

924
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:41,270
Take it.

925
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,290
I'm starving.

926
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:43,750
All right.

927
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:44,650
There's plenty for everyone.

928
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:45,110
Okay.

929
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:45,830
Let me have one.

930
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:46,910
You're so kind.

931
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,030
That's it?

932
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,270
Thank you, ma'am.

933
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,270
You're so beautiful.

934
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,110
- You're getting prettier.
- The prettiest.

935
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:51,950
Stop flattering me.

936
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,310
I'll take another one.

937
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,150
Has anyone seen Luo Ben lately?

938
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,630
It seems like he
hasn't been here for a while.

939
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:58,350
He hasn't been in

940
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,390
the last few missions.

941
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,390
That's true.

942
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,710
Maybe he's swamped with work.

943
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:03,310
Unlike you guys.

944
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:04,790
But we are…

945
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,430
Hey, speak of the devil.

946
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:10,470
Luo Ben,

947
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,590
we were talking about you.

948
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,470
It's been a while
since you've been here.

949
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,750
Come on. Grab a bite.

950
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:14,910
They're so good.

951
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,150
What do you mean by that?

952
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:21,710
From now on,

953
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,030
I won't come anymore.

954
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:31,670
Why?

955
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,590
Luo Ben,

956
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:46,670
are you quitting the team?

957
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:50,750
Captain,

958
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:51,830
what's wrong with him?

959
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,630
Why is he quitting suddenly?

960
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:54,470
Yeah.

961
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,150
Why do you want to quit?

962
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,670
Is something wrong?

963
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,270
Don't be ridiculous.

964
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,750
We all treat you like a brother.

965
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,110
What's going on?

966
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,030
We're all brothers.

967
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,470
I'll always keep that in mind.

968
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:12,270
And I'll continue to do rescues.

969
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,830
But I won't come back

970
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,590
to Light Chaser Rescue.

971
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,270
What on earth is going on?

972
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:39,950
Here's five million.

973
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:42,410
Pay the post-production company first.

974
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:44,870
I'll figure out the rest.

975
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:45,710
You...

976
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,730
Where did you get so much money?

977
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:48,950
Does your mom know?

978
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,270
Don't worry about it.

979
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,470
You have to tell me.

980
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,550
It's my job to report to her.

981
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,130
Mingming…

982
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:01,430
I mortgaged the house.

983
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:03,890
It's too risky for you to do that.

984
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:05,370
If you don't
pay the loan before due date,

985
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:06,220
the house will be repossessed.

986
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:06,860
I know that.

987
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,750
But there's no other way out!

988
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:14,430
Don't tell my mom about this.

989
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,230
Okay.

990
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,210
Don't use my house as an excuse.

991
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:36,350
Okay, let's drink.

992
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:38,870
Here you go.

993
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,270
So good.

994
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:40,830
Right?

995
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,550
It smells so good.

996
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:43,550
Have some barbecue.

997
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:44,850
- Okay.
- Thank you.

998
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:45,700
Help yourselves.

999
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:46,110
Okay.

1000
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:51,020
Honey,

1001
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:51,750
have some.

1002
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:54,670
Just a few of us.

1003
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,390
This is no fun.

1004
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,270
Boring.

1005
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:57,830
What do you want?

1006
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:02,490
Call Zhou Mingming.

1007
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:03,230
Ask him over.

1008
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:05,870
Wait.

1009
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:07,310
Now?

1010
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:10,410
What's the big deal?

1011
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:11,830
He always came when he's called.

1012
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,740
Zhou Mingming is different now.

1013
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:14,690
Even if he has time,

1014
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:15,610
he's doing rescues.

1015
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:16,770
He has no time for this.

1016
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:17,390
That's right.

1017
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,190
Rescue.

1018
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:20,830
That reminds me.

1019
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:22,750
Isn't he on the rescue team now?

1020
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:23,700
Let's just say

1021
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,290
we're lost in the mountains

1022
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:26,350
and need help.

1023
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,050
How's that?

1024
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:27,770
Isn't that a lie?

1025
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:28,750
Hustling him?

1026
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:29,820
No, no, no.

1027
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,670
What's wrong with that?
It's a good idea.

1028
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:33,110
I'll call him.
