16
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:41,280
Your daughter has an acute attack.

17
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,250
At present, dialysis can only
maintain the status quo.

18
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,640
It's better to give her
a kidney transplant.

19
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:46,970
The earlier children over one year

20
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:47,920
have the surgery,

21
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,890
the less likely transplant rejection
will happen,

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,480
and the more likely they'll recover.

23
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,560
Do it.

24
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,440
The sooner the better.

25
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,840
I can donate a kidney to her.

26
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:56,640
No.

27
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,000
Kidney transplant in a child

28
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,440
is different from that in an adult.

29
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:03,360
First of all, the donor

30
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,360
must be a child.

31
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:07,720
It's very rare.

32
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,360
When is that gonna happen?

33
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:11,970
Don't worry.

34
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,770
If you decide to take the surgery,

35
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,000
we'll apply for matching

36
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,210
to organ transplant libraries

37
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,720
in major hospitals across the country.

38
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,560
I believe we'll find a suitable kidney.

39
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:22,040
You need to prepare for the

40
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,250
medical expenses.

41
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,490
Once the kidney is in place,

42
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,210
she must have
the transplant immediately.

43
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:28,810
Alright, thanks.

44
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,410
Don't cry.

45
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,760
How much money do we have?

46
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,280
All our money is on the goods.

47
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,690
The little money we've saved
has been spent on equipment.

48
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,130
Next, Guoguo needs to be on dialysis

49
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,760
and take the transplant.

50
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,690
What should we do?

51
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,250
It's OK.

52
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,410
Don't

53
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,650
worry about money.

54
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,810
I'll take care of it.

55
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,440
No matter what,

56
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,130
we must cure our daughter.

57
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,600
Don't worry.

58
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,280
Go to see her.

59
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,490
Mrs. Zhang.

60
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,530
Dapeng.

61
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:26,490
I'm fine.

62
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,370
Don't comfort me.

63
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,490
Send me your card number.

64
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,130
No, thanks.

65
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,410
No.

66
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,250
But you need to help me with something.

67
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,250
Don't tell the guys

68
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,490
that Guoguo is ill.

69
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,160
I don't want to bother them.

70
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,210
I'll sell my store recently.

71
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,930
Then I'll find a way myself.

72
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,880
What can you do?

73
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:54,840
If you sell the store,

74
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,040
how do you support

75
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:56,810
your family

76
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,210
in the future?

77
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,720
Even after Guoguo

78
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,210
takes the transplant,

79
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,370
her rehabilitation will still

80
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,720
cost a lot of money.

81
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,370
What would you do then?

82
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,280
I appreciate your kindness.

83
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,530
But I can't take the money.

84
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,160
It's the natural

85
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,410
responsibility of all fathers

86
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,440
to get their children treatment.

87
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:21,970
I can't place my responsibility

88
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,050
on someone else.

89
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,080
How could you say that

90
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,370
at such a critical moment?

91
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,200
Am I someone else, Dapeng?

92
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,610
We are brothers.

93
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,250
Brother.

94
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,440
Thanks. Thanks.

95
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,930
When I'm really short of money,

96
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,400
I'll ask for your help.

97
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,810
Mr. Wang.

98
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:00,170
Mr. Luo.

99
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:00,880
Hello. Please sit down.

100
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,440
OK.

101
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:06,810
Mr. Wang,

102
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,250
you don't have to come in person.

103
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:10,850
If you need anything,

104
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,960
I can always visit you

105
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,760
in your company.

106
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,760
When you're in my company,

107
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:14,690
I'm the boss,

108
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,200
and you're the legal counsel.

109
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,640
We'll talk about legal affairs.

110
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,130
But when I visit you,

111
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:19,960
our identities

112
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,370
will be different.

113
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:22,930
You're the captain of the rescue team.

114
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,520
and I'm an outdoor products distributor.

115
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,730
Don't you think it's relevant?

116
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,170
Mr. Wang, do you want to

117
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,730
talk something about rescue?

118
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,520
You can say that.

119
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:35,200
I want to talk about our cooperation.

120
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,880
Dapeng,

121
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:40,960
you've always had

122
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,690
the best attendance in the team.

123
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:43,440
But suddenly,

124
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,960
you asked for such a long leave.

125
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,290
Tell me the truth.

126
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:47,960
Is there something wrong
with your family?

127
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:49,490
No.

128
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,690
I just

129
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,520
feel sorry for Chen Lin.

130
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,080
Over the years,

131
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:58,880
I've been

132
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,290
concentrating on the rescue team.

133
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,170
She has to take care of the business

134
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,490
and our daughter.

135
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:06,960
It's been really hard for her.

136
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:07,880
Yes.

137
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:09,320
Your wife

138
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,960
has always supported us.

139
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,760
Now people from all walks of life

140
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,690
have an interest in non-profit rescue.

141
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,440
Our team

142
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,880
grows bigger and bigger.

143
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:17,810
Alright.

144
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,290
These days,

145
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,170
you should take care of your family.

146
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,320
Thanks, Captain.

147
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:24,640
Captain.

148
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,490
The noodles are ready.

149
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,250
Come to eat.

150
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:27,760
OK.

151
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:28,520
Dapeng.

152
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:30,000
Let's have some noodles.

153
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,730
Come on, Captain.

154
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:33,080
OK.

155
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,050
Let's try Luo Ben's cooking.

156
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,370
Today's noodles

157
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,760
are a little bland.

158
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:42,370
We need to make do with it.

159
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,370
That's good.

160
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,290
Yan told me especially

161
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:47,610
to keep a low-sugar,
low-salt, and low-fat diet.

162
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,640
It's called scientific diet.

163
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:50,690
Yeah.

164
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,130
When does Zhan Yan come back?

165
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:55,560
Luo Ben,

166
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,610
why don't you go to see her?

167
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,080
Dapeng.

168
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,050
Eat your noodles.

169
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,440
By the way, Captain,

170
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:08,730
I have

171
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,000
something to tell you.

172
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,640
I have a client engaging in

173
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:15,050
outdoor products industry.

174
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,490
It's Mr. Wang of the

175
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,290
Polar Land Clique.

176
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,000
He visited me this morning

177
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,610
to advertise

178
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,730
their products.

179
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,610
He wants to sponsor a climbing team

180
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,730
to climb the snow mountain

181
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,730
and hopes to cooperate with us.

182
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,290
Then he should go find

183
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,810
a professional climbing team.

184
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,610
Why did he come to us?

185
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,490
Hasn't our team

186
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,320
gained a little fame?

187
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,610
Moreover, we're engaged in

188
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:39,960
non-profit rescue.

189
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,200
He hopes to

190
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,610
work with us,

191
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,760
in order to improve his brand image.

192
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,490
Tell him,

193
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:48,400
we do not participate in

194
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,320
commercial cooperation.

195
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:53,200
I told him.

196
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,250
But he still

197
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,560
wants me to ask for

198
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:57,730
your opinion.

199
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,250
He said,

200
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,320
as long as we could climb

201
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,000
the snow mountain wearing

202
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,170
the gears of their brand,

203
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,850
he would give us

204
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,400
a generous reward

205
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,850
for us to purchase

206
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,320
a batch of advanced equipment.

207
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:13,000
Luo Ben,

208
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:14,490
we do lack equipment,

209
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,130
but we must get it in a right way.

210
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,250
We can get it through

211
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,370
public donations

212
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,730
rather than

213
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,290
commercial activities.

214
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,050
As the captain,

215
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,640
you must know what you should do

216
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,250
concerning key issues.

217
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,200
OK.

218
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,730
I understand, Captain.

219
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:31,640
I understand.

220
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,490
Would you like some pepper?

221
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:47,100
(Medical Service Center
of Qianliang Village)

222
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,730
I did some research before I came here.

223
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,610
With agriculture and stock raising
as the main industries,

224
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,490
this place is a high incidence area
of hydatid disease.

225
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,570
You're right.

226
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,040
When I saw patients
in the Village Hospital,

227
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,130
I once had five patients

228
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,800
with hepatic hydatid disease
on one morning,

229
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,450
who all needed surgery.

230
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:09,920
What's the condition
of the Village Hospital?

231
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,730
General surgery here
didn't have branches before.

232
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,490
Most of the local people

233
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:18,520
are unwilling to go to
the Village Hospital

234
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:19,640
for surgery.

235
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,330
In emergency treatment
at the night of weekends,

236
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:24,450
ordinary surgeries like

237
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,130
appendectomy and cholecystectomy

238
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:28,400
were all open surgeries.

239
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,850
Only after I came,

240
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,920
we started to perform

241
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,920
emergency laparoscopic surgeries.

242
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,280
It's difficult

243
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,370
to solve such a problem by outside aid.

244
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,570
We must build a trustworthy

245
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,850
and highly skilled

246
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,850
medical team as soon as possible.

247
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:46,730
Dr. Zhan,

248
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,570
don't be niggard.

249
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,280
We should teach several disciples

250
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:50,680
as soon as possible.

251
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:52,610
OK.

252
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,850
Let's teach our disciples respectively

253
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,210
and see who will be better.

254
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:55,880
OK.

255
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,040
Fair competition.

256
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,340
(Welcome to Qianliang)

257
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,880
Every year, many climbers come here to

258
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,730
climb the snow mountain.

259
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:09,210
But,

260
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,520
few teams can reach the top.

261
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,330
Judging from their gears,

262
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,130
they don't seem to come for

263
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,250
reaching the top.

264
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,640
How can you tell that?

265
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,210
When I was young,

266
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,330
my dad used to take me to
climb snow mountains.

267
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,280
We even trained specially for that.

268
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,730
Although I didn't climb high,

269
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,090
not to mention reaching the top,

270
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,090
I'm quite observant.

271
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:34,640
You're good.

272
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,040
What's wrong?

273
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:17,330
Dapeng.

274
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,130
Come on.

275
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,920
Dapeng,

276
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,250
you are a professional climber.

277
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:24,160
Why are you even worse

278
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:25,040
than we amateurs

279
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,160
in physical strength?

280
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:27,640
Duojie,

281
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:28,760
that's a little

282
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,250
ungrateful.

283
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,640
When we were climbing to the top,

284
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,160
Dapeng pulled us up

285
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,920
one by one with ropes.

286
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:37,090
Dapeng consumed more strength than us.

287
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,160
Otherwise, can you reach the top

288
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,760
by your own strength?

289
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,760
Without the photos of us at the top,

290
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,490
we can't even get the reward.

291
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,970
Forget about it.

292
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:54,000
It's our success to reach the top.

293
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,490
Mr. Da,

294
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,130
can we find a place

295
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,400
to take a break?

296
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,450
I feel a little dizzy.

297
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,570
- Dapeng.
- Dapeng, Dapeng.

298
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,280
Dapeng. What's wrong?

299
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,210
Altitude stress and high fever.

300
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:25,330
I'm afraid

301
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,760
he can't make it to the base camp.

302
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,920
Then we have to carry him.

303
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:31,570
If you want to die,

304
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,730
don't drag us.

305
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:33,520
I can barely walk

306
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,680
on the snow mountain.

307
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,090
How can I possibly carry another man?

308
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:37,090
Are you suggesting

309
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:38,090
we leave him here alone?

310
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:39,800
We have no other choice.

311
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:41,760
On Mount Everest,

312
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,760
there are so many bodies of climbers

313
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,450
that can't be sent down.

314
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:44,970
Do you think that's
what their families want?

315
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,330
There's nothing they can do.

316
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,370
We're not on Mount Everest.

317
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:50,370
Stop fighting, OK?

318
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,280
Judging by the weather,

319
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,850
I'm afraid there will be
a snowstorm tonight.

320
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,250
Now that we can't get to the camp,

321
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:08,130
we may as well camp here.

322
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:08,920
What do you say?

323
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,850
I have the number of a doctor.

324
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:19,920
I'll ask if she would come up.

325
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,370
How could a doctor

326
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:22,800
agree to see a patient
on the snow mountain?

327
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,920
Give it a try.

328
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,210
If she isn't willing to come up,

329
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:31,280
he must accept his fate.

330
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:36,800
Mr. Lordan,

331
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,400
do you take medicine every day?

332
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,160
Yes.

333
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,850
I take it every day.

334
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,970
Your blood pressure has dropped.

335
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:45,450
But you can't stop taking medicine,

336
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:46,450
or it will

337
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,920
go up again easily.

338
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,330
I have to take this.

339
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,490
Hello.

340
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,850
Is that Dr. Zhan?

341
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:05,490
I'm on the snow mountain

342
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,330
with a climbing team.

343
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,800
A climber's having a high fever

344
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,210
and can't get down.

345
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,490
Could you help him?

346
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:15,850
How old is the climber?

347
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,400
What other symptoms does he have?

348
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,130
Only fever.

349
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,800
I'm unaware of other symptoms.

350
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:24,520
He's said to be a member

351
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,250
of Light Chaser Rescue.

352
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,490
He saved a lot of people.

353
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,090
Could you save him?

354
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,760
Please help him.

355
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,000
What's his name?

356
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,130
Zhang Dapeng.

357
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,210
Zhan Yan,

358
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,130
are you really going to
the snow mountain?

359
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:48,520
Dapeng has altitude stress
and a high fever.

360
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,610
In the most severe cases,

361
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,160
it'll cause a variety of complications.

362
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,570
If I don't go,

363
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:53,800
he may die.

364
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,090
Don't act on impulse.

365
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,760
It's the snow mountain.

366
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:58,040
High altitude, low temperature,

367
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,130
complex terrain,

368
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,280
heavy snowstorm,

369
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,450
and glacial cliffs,

370
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:02,680
danger is everywhere.

371
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,850
Don't worry.

372
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,490
Having been here for a long time,

373
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,520
I'm familiar with the environment

374
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:07,760
and climate.

375
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:10,090
And I climbed
snow mountains with my dad.

376
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:10,920
I know the situation.

377
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,280
I'll be careful.

378
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,130
If you insist on going,

379
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:15,850
I'll go with you.

380
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,570
You're inexperienced.

381
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,970
If anything happens to you,

382
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,610
I have to protect you.

383
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:25,920
Don't make trouble

384
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,090
or try to persuade me.

385
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,570
There will be a snowstorm tonight.

386
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,280
I'll pack up

387
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,640
and leave early tomorrow morning.

388
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,330
Go ahead.

389
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:58,800
It was such a safe night.

390
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,250
I've had the soundest sleep

391
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:01,400
since we got up the mountain.

392
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,970
I thought there would be a snowstorm.

393
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:05,040
Mr. Da,

394
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,570
did you lie to us deliberately

395
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,850
for Dapeng?

396
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,760
The weather on the mountain
is unpredictable.

397
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,000
Though it's sunny at this moment,

398
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:21,760
a snowstorm may come anytime.

399
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,330
I won't be wrong.

400
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:27,330
You're fooling us.

401
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,250
Young man,

402
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,610
you don't understand.

403
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,920
People who often come up
the mountain all know that

404
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:35,130
sometimes to help others

405
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,920
is to help themselves.

406
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,130
Do you understand?

407
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:41,640
Has the doctor you called

408
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,800
come up?

409
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:49,000
Be careful.

410
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:58,280
Come.

411
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,490
Give me your hand.

412
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:14,290
Over there.

413
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,200
If it weren't for Dapeng,

414
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:35,530
we would have got the reward

415
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,850
and be having
the celebration dinner now.

416
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:39,090
We came together.

417
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,880
We'd better go back together.

418
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:09,130
Zhan Yan,

419
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,640
there are tents.

420
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:13,370
Are they there?

421
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:13,920
Go.

422
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:15,530
Go. Hurry.

423
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:17,960
I never thought a doctor

424
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:18,810
would come up.

425
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:20,200
Here.

426
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:21,010
We're here.

427
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,610
Mr. Da.

428
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:26,090
Mr. Da. Mr. Da.

429
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,400
Mr. Da.

430
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:33,200
Great! Great!

431
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:34,440
Mr. Da, where is Dapeng?

432
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,720
Dapeng is in the tent,

433
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,370
dizzy and sleepy.

434
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:40,090
Go.

435
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,570
OK.

436
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,130
Give me the medical kit.

437
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,440
Here, medical kit.

438
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:53,920
Go.

439
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:16,090
You guys pack up quickly.

440
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,530
We must evacuate to the camp
halfway down the mountain

441
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:20,290
before the snowstorm comes.

442
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,330
Hurry up.

443
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,160
Hurry up.

444
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,130
Snowstorm. Snowstorm.

445
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:28,850
You wouldn't stop talking about it.

446
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,920
Come out.

447
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,370
We'll evacuate to the camp.

448
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,370
Hurry up.

449
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,530
Dapeng. Dapeng.

450
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:43,010
He's awake.

451
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,370
You're awake.

452
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:45,720
Zhan Yan,

453
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:48,050
why are you here?

454
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:48,770
Lie down.

455
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,440
Stay put.

456
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:50,810
Are you OK?

457
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,770
Take a rest.

458
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,680
I haven't asked you yet.

459
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:00,880
Why would you join

460
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:02,160
such a climbing team?

461
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,960
The condition is limited here.

462
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:07,610
We can only reduce

463
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,850
your fever and inflammation.

464
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,010
We'll give your further treatment later.

465
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,810
Don't talk or move.

466
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,370
Save your energy.

467
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,200
Hang in there.

468
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,570
Oh dear!

469
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,330
The snowstorm is getting worse.

470
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,440
Anchor the tent!

471
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,660
(Zhan Yan)

472
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:40,850
What should we do?

473
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:43,160
All our equipment and supplies
were blown away.

474
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:44,850
And we don't have a phone.

475
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,440
We've completely

476
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,130
lost contact with the ground.

477
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:58,610
No service.

478
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,050
Mr. Da,

479
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:01,440
what should we do now?

480
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:02,720
Will it be better if we make it

481
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:03,480
to the camp?

482
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:07,160
I've never

483
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:08,880
camped here before.

484
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:11,290
I have to go down from memory.

485
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:14,570
The snowstorm hasn't gone.

486
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,480
It may come again.

487
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,440
Let's go down now.

488
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,050
Hurry.

489
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:20,440
Well,

490
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:21,680
what about Dapeng?

491
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:23,160
Please, everyone,

492
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:25,680
take him to the camp.

493
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:27,480
It's flat and can be
a shelter from the wind.

494
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:29,480
Then you can evacuate first.

495
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:30,680
Dr. Cai and I will stay and

496
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,050
accompany him to wait for rescue.

497
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,010
Yes.

498
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:34,810
Please, everyone.

499
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:39,850
Though it's difficult to walk
carrying a man,

500
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,160
if we carry him together

501
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:42,330
and walk slowly,

502
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:43,010
I think we'll have no problem

503
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,290
to get to the camp.

504
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,770
OK.

505
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,240
Thanks, everyone.

506
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:48,010
Thanks.

507
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,090
Come on.

508
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,090
Hurry, help us.

509
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,530
Look,

510
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,960
this rescue robot has combined

511
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,880
the function of

512
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:04,200
a life detector

513
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,400
and a night vision camera.

514
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:06,440
It can go deep and detect

515
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:07,610
in the ruins instead of

516
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:08,720
our team members.

517
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,200
Here.

518
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:11,880
You take a look.

519
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:12,770
I have to take this.

520
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,530
The technology is

521
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,480
getting more and more advanced.

522
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:19,370
Hello, Mr. Wang,

523
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:20,370
what's up?

524
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,330
What?

525
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:29,400
Did you call the police?

526
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:33,920
Alright. I get it.

527
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,290
What's wrong?

528
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:38,290
The climbing team sponsored by
the Polar Land Clique

529
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,810
is missing in Mei'ao Snow Mountain.

530
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,960
They've called the police.

531
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,130
Polar Land?

532
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:45,010
The outdoor products company

533
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:46,530
you mentioned last time?

534
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,370
Yes.

535
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:49,330
After we turned them down,

536
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:50,770
they offered a substantial reward

537
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,480
to a group of

538
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:52,920
amateur climbers and

539
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:53,960
let them climb

540
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:55,570
Mei'ao Snow Mountain

541
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:57,680
to advertise their new products.

542
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,010
It's a complete farce!

543
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,850
Zhan Yan and Dapeng

544
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,330
are also among the missing.

545
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,720
(You're all elites)

546
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:20,200
(of Light Chaser Rescue.)

547
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:22,440
(Although you have rich)

548
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:23,570
(rescue experience,)

549
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,810
(to carry out a task
in a snow mountain is different.)

550
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,610
(The terrain is complex)

551
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:30,570
(and the climate is harsh.)

552
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,200
(There may be various)

553
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,400
(unexpected emergencies.)

554
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:35,570
(Therefore,)

555
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:38,610
(please take safety as your priority.)

556
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,160
(No matter what happens,)

557
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,770
(you must follow orders.)

558
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,720
(Don't make decisions on your own.)

559
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,240
(Please remember,)

560
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:50,240
(our task is to)

561
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,920
(search and rescue
the missing climbers,)

562
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:55,010
(not to take risks.)

563
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:46,220
(The choice of Light Chaser Rescue,
Polar Land! -Rescuer Zhang Dapeng)

564
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,050
Unbelievable.

565
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,400
When will they arrive?

566
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:49,920
They should be here soon.

567
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,090
Thanks for your trouble.

568
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,160
(Polar Land Clique)
Mr. Wang, have some water.

569
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,240
No, no, thanks.

570
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:56,850
Unbelievable.

571
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,400
Where did they get lost?

572
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,290
Yesterday afternoon

573
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,480
when they called us,

574
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:02,850
they seemed to be

575
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,330
on the way down the mountain.

576
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,570
They are coming.

577
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:15,160
What happened?

578
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:16,480
What's the grand occasion for?

579
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,050
It's Mr. Wang's style.

580
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:20,880
Dapeng?

581
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,920
How did he become
the brand advocate?

582
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:26,290
Captain Luo,

583
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:29,010
you've finally come.

584
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,440
The climbers are in danger.

585
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:31,960
I'm so worried.

586
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,010
On receiving the notice,

587
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,530
we came here immediately.

588
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,770
As long as you're here,

589
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,370
we'll have hope.

590
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:38,440
Mr. Wang,

591
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:39,200
please tell us

592
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:40,480
what happened briefly.

593
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:41,850
Here's the thing,

594
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,720
there are six members in total,

595
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,960
five climbers and one guide.

596
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:44,880
They successfully reached the top

597
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:45,610
yesterday afternoon.

598
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:46,610
On their way down the mountain,

599
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,530
a member was sick.

600
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:48,480
They asked a doctor
to get up the mountain.

601
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:49,160
As a result, we lost contact

602
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:50,130
with the doctor too.

603
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:51,290
When was the last time

604
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,200
you reached them?

605
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:54,130
About 4:30 PM yesterday.

606
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,370
The weather forecast

607
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,530
warned a snowstorm.

608
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,530
What worries me most is that

609
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,850
they might have had an accident

610
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,880
in the snowstorm.

611
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,330
Well,

612
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,010
assign us two guides first.

613
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,130
We're going up the mountain now.

614
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,290
The guides are ready.

615
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,640
This is Mr. Lordan.

616
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:07,810
This is Danba.

617
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:08,680
Both of them

618
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:09,810
live in the mountain area.

619
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:11,330
They know the environment
on the mountain well.

620
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:12,640
OK.

621
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,480
Captain Luo,

622
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:16,570
if you want me to do anything,

623
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:17,810
just tell me.

624
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:19,240
Money isn't a problem.

625
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:19,880
We should go up

626
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:21,050
the mountain in the shortest time.

627
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,050
Let's walk and talk.

628
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,130
Let's go.

629
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:23,850
- Go.
- Yes.

630
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:52,640
Mr. Da.

631
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,680
Is the route wrong?

632
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,570
We didn't walk so long

633
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:01,010
when we came.

634
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:01,640
Yes.

635
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:03,050
Really?

636
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:06,160
No, no.

637
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:07,610
I can't carry him anymore.

638
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,960
Do as you please.

639
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:09,850
I can't do it anymore.

640
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:12,400
Just hang on.

641
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,640
Everyone is in a bad state now.

642
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,090
There's no cell service.

643
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,290
We've lost contact with the ground.

644
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:22,370
If we're not sure

645
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:23,610
about this route,

646
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,480
we should find

647
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,090
a place relatively safe,

648
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,330
stop there, have a rest,

649
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,920
and wait for rescue.

650
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,680
No, no.

651
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,400
Judging by the weather,

652
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:37,160
there seems to be another snowstorm.

653
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:39,810
On the snow mountain,

654
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:44,010
we can't let others decide our fate.

655
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,240
We're on our own.

656
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,640
Even if we've gone off the right route,

657
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:51,370
we should arrive

658
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:54,050
at the camp soon.

659
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,240
Listen to Mr. Da.

660
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,130
Get up.

661
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,330
You can't get up again if you lie there.

662
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,610
Don't mind me.

663
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:04,680
Anyway, I'll die whether I walk on

664
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,010
or lie down.

665
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,810
On the snow mountain,

666
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,720
don't say ominous words.

667
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:13,680
The supplies were gone.

668
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:15,370
The equipment was lost.

669
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,160
And we're lost.

670
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:19,200
In such weather,

671
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,330
we'll either die from hunger

672
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,400
or from coldness.

673
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:22,400
Ma Yue,

674
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,640
will you stop?

675
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:24,570
No.

676
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,440
He's such a burden.

677
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:27,810
If it weren't for him,

678
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,290
we would've got down the mountain.

679
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,570
What are you talking about?

680
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,850
What?

681
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,330
You've loathed me all the way.

682
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,240
Do you want to fight?

683
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:39,200
Enough!

684
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,530
You'd better take a break

685
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,400
rather than fight.

686
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,010
Let them go.

687
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:54,130
Don't mind me.

688
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:55,570
I'm fine.

689
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,090
I'll be fine after a rest.

690
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,440
You cruel creature!

691
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:03,130
I do want to beat you!

692
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:05,680
Enough!

693
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:06,720
Stop!

694
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:07,440
What are you doing?

695
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:08,680
Stop!

696
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:10,200
Enough!

697
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:11,680
Stop fighting!

698
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:13,130
Stop fighting! Let go!

699
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,400
Zhan Yan!

700
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:25,610
Zhan Yan!

701
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:29,440
Zhan Yan, hang in there.

702
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:30,370
Don't loosen your grip.

703
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,680
We'll pull you up!

704
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:36,960
Pull harder!

705
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:41,200
Hang in there!

706
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:42,880
Everyone, pull the rope!

707
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:13,920
Dr. Zhan!

708
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:14,680
Zhan Yan!

709
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:17,010
Zhan Yan!

710
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,130
Look.

711
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,720
Here, here.

712
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,570
These suspicious areas

713
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,850
are within 3.5 kilometers

714
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:56,290
around the camp.

715
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:58,920
We'll split into two teams,

716
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:01,130
one led by me
and the other led by Xiong Fei.

717
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:03,810
The two teams search along

718
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:05,680
the east and west sides of the route

719
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:07,640
from the camp
to the foot of the mountain,

720
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:10,480
then join from the northeast

721
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,370
and northwest directions.

722
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:15,240
Everyone must follow the order

723
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,050
and not leave the team
without permission.

724
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,330
Keep your communication effective.

725
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,530
Keep in touch.

726
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,570
Are we clear?

727
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,480
Yes.

728
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:23,370
OK.

729
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,640
Ready to go.

730
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,330
Zhan Yan!

731
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:42,960
Dr. Zhan.

732
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:44,960
Are you OK?

733
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:47,400
Dr. Zhan.

734
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:50,090
I'm down there.

735
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:51,200
She's still alive.

736
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:52,610
Hurry, give me the rope.

737
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,160
Hold the rope.

738
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:58,130
Zhan Yan, don't worry.

739
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,370
They went to get the rope.

740
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,680
We'll pull you up later.

741
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:04,810
Hurry.

742
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:05,920
Dr. Zhan,

743
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:08,480
I'll drop the rope.

744
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,440
Wait for a minute.

745
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:13,130
I can't move now.

746
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,370
She can't come up by herself.

747
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:18,810
We need someone to help her.

748
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:20,570
Hurry.

749
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:22,370
What are you waiting for?

750
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:24,370
You are professional climbers.

751
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:26,010
You should know
how to rescue people.

752
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:27,480
Who dares to go down?

753
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:29,400
I can't even come up myself,

754
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,370
let alone help her.

755
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:32,160
We're not professional

756
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:33,290
climbers.

757
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,050
We're just amateurs.

758
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,370
It's the first time

759
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:38,480
we've experienced this.

760
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,160
Cowards!

761
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:41,480
I'll go down if you won't.

762
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,290
Give me the rope.

763
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:42,880
I'll go down there.

764
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:43,720
Will you calm down?

765
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,880
You're not helping.

766
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:47,200
Do you know how to climb the ice cliff?

767
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:48,530
Do you know how to use a rope?

768
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,850
It's useless to waste time here.

769
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,880
While we still have strength,

770
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:53,880
let's go down the mountain

771
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:55,160
and find people to save them.

772
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:56,680
He's right.

773
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:57,960
When the snowstorm comes,

774
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:59,880
none of us can leave.

775
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:01,440
Mr. Da is the most experienced

776
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:03,050
and he agrees with me.

777
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,530
It's time to

778
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,160
be realistic.

779
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,330
At most,

780
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:09,330
we'll take Dapeng with us.

781
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,400
That's the only thing
we can possibly do.

782
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:13,290
We can't

783
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:15,360
save this doctor.

784
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:26,760
Hey!

785
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:31,970
What are you doing?

786
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:33,160
What are you doing?

787
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,160
What are you doing?

788
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:36,010
You can't leave her behind.

789
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:38,160
You can't leave her behind.

790
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,100
Dapeng,

791
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,930
you can't move yourself.

792
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:42,720
How can you save her?

793
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,530
I'm not leaving.

794
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,360
Dr. Cai,

795
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,130
it's useless for you to stay here.

796
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,320
Leave with us.

797
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,360
I won't leave.

798
00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:58,160
I'll stay here with Dr. Zhan

799
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,240
and wait for you to send

800
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:01,360
the rescuers.

801
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:04,240
Go.

802
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:06,010
Let's go.

803
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:24,530
Cai Yuxiao.

804
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,320
Mr. Da.

805
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:30,200
Zhan Yan, don't panic.

806
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:32,840
They went to send for rescuers.

807
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:34,760
I'll stay here with you.

808
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,490
Follow up.

809
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:52,010
Wait, let me check.

810
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,890
Right here.

811
00:36:58,410 --> 00:36:59,320
Then we'll arrive.

812
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:47,970
Drone.

813
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:48,570
Drone.

814
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,570
We're here!

815
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,930
We're here!

816
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:53,890
Xiong Fei, I find something!

817
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,360
I find something!

818
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,090
Here.

819
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,130
Yeah, it's them!

820
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,890
They're about a kilometre

821
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,570
straight ahead of us.

822
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,930
They're probably there.

823
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:12,530
Go.

824
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,160
Go. Go.

825
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:21,490
Have some food.

826
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:22,970
Thanks.

827
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,610
Have some water.

828
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:35,320
Xiong Fei,

829
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:36,640
Dapeng is awake.

830
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:41,160
How do you feel?

831
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,200
Hurry.

832
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:47,800
Hurry. Hurry.

833
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:48,720
What?

834
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:49,840
Zhan Yan.

835
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:51,050
What about Zhan Yan?

836
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,890
Go to save Zhan Yan.

837
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,720
But where is she?

838
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,280
Crack of ice.

839
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:57,640
Which crack?

840
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,280
She fell into a crack.

841
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:00,680
Which crack?

842
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:02,930
Go to save Zhan Yan.

843
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:03,640
It's...

844
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,090
It's around the corner.

845
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:11,970
Did you leave her behind?

846
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:25,610
It's within

847
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:27,280
Luo Ben's search scope.

848
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,160
Luo Ben, Luo Ben,

849
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:33,050
we've found Dapeng,

850
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,970
but Zhan Yan fell into a crack.

851
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,840
She's within your scope.

852
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,160
You must find her quickly.

853
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:39,970
Roger that.

854
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:41,640
Contact us immediately
if you have any news.

855
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,360
We're going to join you now.

856
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:44,200
Roger that.

857
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:48,130
Keep your distance.

858
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,890
Don't go beyond the limits of the rope.

859
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:51,410
There are cracks under the snow.

860
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:53,570
Everybody, watch your step.

861
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,490
Go.

862
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:55,930
- Yes.
- Yes.

863
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:10,240
Quicken your pace.

864
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,800
Watch your step.

865
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:13,090
Quicken your pace.

866
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,570
We must be faster.

867
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,450
Faster.

868
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,010
We can't go.

869
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,530
The snowstorm is coming!

870
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,160
We must arrive before the snowstorm...

871
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,240
It's too late.

872
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:25,050
The weather here

873
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:25,930
is different from other places.

874
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:27,410
Though the snowstorm looks far away,

875
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:28,570
it'll be here soon.

876
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,050
You don't have to go,

877
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,890
but we must go.

878
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,280
You can't go.

879
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:36,090
If you move on, none of you can return.

880
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,800
The clouds are low
and the wind blows snow.

881
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,280
The wind scales over eight.

882
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,010
Luo Ben,

883
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,720
report your current position.

884
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:55,130
Luo Ben. Luo Ben.

885
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:57,970
Let's go.

886
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,160
- Go.
- Go.

887
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,570
Don't go. Don't go.

888
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:32,930
Dr. Cai,

889
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:35,360
where is Zhan Yan?

890
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:36,450
Where is Dr. Zhan?

891
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:39,800
Hurry, help...

892
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:41,490
Help her.

893
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,280
In the crack.

894
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,490
Help her.

895
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,840
Hurry. Go.

896
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:46,760
Zhan Yan!

897
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:48,320

898
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:50,360

899
