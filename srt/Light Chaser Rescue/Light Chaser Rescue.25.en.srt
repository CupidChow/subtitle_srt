How's Yuan?

18
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,560
She has a fever.

19
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,480
I knew you'd come and save us.

20
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,050
Pulmonary infection.

21
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,320
Yuan, take the medicine.

22
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,810
Xiong Fei and your brother both came.

23
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,810
We'll get you out of here.

24
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,130
Don't worry.

25
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:28,040
Yan.

26
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,280
Zhou Mingming came too.

27
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:31,930
He's in group 2.

28
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,810
If I didn't stop him,

29
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:33,760
he would come in too.

30
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:37,970
Which of you can dive?

31
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:39,600
I can swim.

32
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:40,840
It's different.

33
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,440
Ask them to teach you

34
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,720
basic diving skills later

35
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:44,760
and take you out.

36
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,410
Yan, do we have to get into the water?

37
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:50,560
I have a fear of water.

38
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,040
It's the only way.

39
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:06,420
(Unexplored Area No Entry)

40
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,650
Can you put this in your mouth?

41
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,250
Look.

42
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,840
Keep breathing like this.

43
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,810
Yan, I can't.

44
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:22,650
Once I get into the water,

45
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,370
I can't breathe.

46
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,090
We have two safety divers

47
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,040
who will protect you
from the front and the back.

48
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,600
There are also wires to guide you.

49
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,930
You'll be fine.

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,280
I can't master it.

51
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,970
OK, I can do it now.

52
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,530
Ding Dingding, don't chicken out.

53
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,130
I want to buy you a drink

54
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,880
to apologize after we get out.

55
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,970
Bro, wait for me outside.

56
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,130
Bro, thanks.

57
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,280
I'll go first.

58
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:58,370
OK.

59
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,650
I can't get out.

60
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,410
Don't make discouraging remarks.

61
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:54,930
Zhou Mingming reporting,

62
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,560
a trapped person
is getting out of the cave.

63
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,930
It's Target No. 3.

64
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,440
Target No. 3 is coming out.

65
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:01,880
You're out.

66
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,560
How do you feel?

67
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,290
I'm OK. OK.

68
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,370
What's going on inside?

69
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:06,930
One is

70
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,290
learning to dive with the help

71
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,560
of Zhan Yan.

72
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,640
The other one has pulmonary infection

73
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,250
and doesn't have strength

74
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,400
for underwater movement.

75
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,520
What about Ding Dingding?

76
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,050
She's very nervous

77
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,170
and dares not get into the water.

78
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:22,850
Director Liu,

79
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:23,730
Zhan Yan and the team

80
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,050
have found the targets.

81
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,730
I'll take the second echelon
into the cave right now

82
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,290
and get the three victims

83
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,290
out of there.

84
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:31,690
Captain.

85
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,370
Mingming, get ready.

86
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,080
Yes.

87
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Qingshan, you guys

88
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,490
and the people inside

89
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:39,960
must get out safely.

90
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,370
No one should be left behind.

91
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,490
Yes, we guarantee
to fulfill our mission!

92
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,200
Mingming,

93
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,440
cave diving

94
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,440
is totally different

95
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,290
from open water diving.

96
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:50,810
I know. Zhan Yan taught me.

97
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:51,810
I can do it if she can.

98
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,250
OK, stay close to me.

99
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:53,850
OK.

100
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:54,520
Go.

101
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:00,290
No worries.

102
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,130
Watch out.

103
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,520
How is it, Xiong Fei?

104
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:13,250
Guys,

105
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,760
forget about it.

106
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:15,690
I've lived here

107
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,640
for over 30 years

108
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,290
and I haven't heard that

109
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,440
there was another exit to the cave.

110
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,370
How could we find it if we don't try it?

111
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:23,880
It's such a huge mountain.

112
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,250
You can't comb it even in a month.

113
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,610
Even if you find it,

114
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,290
I'm afraid it'll be too late.

115
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:31,250
Even if it takes six months or a year,

116
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,050
we must find it.

117
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:45,250
Dingding.

118
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,130
I thought

119
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,880
I would never see you again.

120
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,520
You silly girl.

121
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,760
You see me now, right?

122
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,440
Yan,

123
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:09,960
what about Luo Yuan?

124
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,400
The fever hasn't gone.

125
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:12,880
She's too weak

126
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,290
and the water is too cold.

127
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:15,810
She can't get into the water.

128
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,960
We can't wait any longer.

129
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,760
You two,

130
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,690
send Bobcat out first.

131
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,930
Ding Dingding,

132
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,610
you can do it!

133
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,130
I'll wait for you outside.

134
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,320
Zhou Mingming.

135
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,080
Dingding, let me teach you to dive.

136
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,810
I can't.

137
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,730
Believe yourself. You can do it.

138
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,440
I can't master it.

139
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,640
Then I'll accompany you

140
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,250
until you master it.

141
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,610
Fool.

142
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,050
Do you remember

143
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,310
how I started to

144
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,370
learn diving rescue?

145
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,640
Because the other day,
you jumped into the river

146
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:04,960
and forced me to save you.

147
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,560
That day,

148
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,170
you weren't afraid at all.

149
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,320
I didn't think clearly that day.

150
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,930
No, Dingding.

151
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,250
You did it for me.

152
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,200
Please be brave

153
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,130
for me again today.

154
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,160
Yan, later,

155
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,280
you and Zhou Mingming

156
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,610
send Ding Dingding out first.

157
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,680
What do you mean?

158
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:45,640
Luo Yuan can't get into the water.

159
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,920
I'll stay with her

160
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,330
to find another exit.

161
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,920
It's my responsibility.

162
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,490
I also have the responsibility
of a doctor.

163
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,800
You should go first.

164
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,640
The place will soon be flooded.

165
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm more experienced than you.

166
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,920
I won't lose to anyone
in professional skills.

167
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,250
You learned diving from me.

168
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,450
So what?

169
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,250
Yan, we're running out of time.

170
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,000
I don't want to argue with you.

171
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,680
Luo Yuan is Luo Ben's sister,

172
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,160
who is my sister too.

173
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,880
I can't abandon

174
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,400
a family member.

175
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,850
If I don't take Luo Yuan out,

176
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,000
I could never face Luo Ben again.

177
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,040
OK.

178
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:22,450
You stay. I'll stay too.

179
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,760
What you need to do now

180
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,130
is relax

181
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,280
and breathe through the mouth.

182
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,730
I'll count one, two, three,

183
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:36,450
and take you into the water.

184
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,130
Zhou,

185
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,730
you and Zhou Mingming

186
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,090
take Ding Dingding out first.

187
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,280
Target No. 4 is out of the cave.

188
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,450
Target No. 4 is out of the cave.

189
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:03,640
Hurry.

190
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,090
Hurry.

191
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,250
The position in the front.

192
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,000
Look.

193
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:11,520
Director Liu.

194
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:13,280
Yes.

195
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,970
Let's wait for the news.

196
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,450
OK. I'll pay attention.

197
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,160
As for other things...

198
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,040
Group 2, attention.

199
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,250
In another hour,

200
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,250
the water level will reach its peak

201
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,160
and the cave will be flooded.

202
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,490
Don't give up.

203
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:31,000
Keep searching.

204
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,370
I'm still looking forward

205
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:33,760
to your good news.

206
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:34,610
Roger that.

207
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:36,000
One hour?

208
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,610
One hour isn't enough.

209
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,970
The mountain is huge.

210
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,490
How can we find it?

211
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,250
I'll keep searching till the last minute.

212
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,370
Ding Dingding,

213
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,330
are you ready?

214
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,570
Don't worry, Captain.

215
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,130
She is fearless with me.

216
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:04,970
OK.

217
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,800
You'll change the cylinders midway.

218
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,160
Before that,

219
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,520
you have to go through a narrow passage.

220
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:13,730
The divers will instruct you in time.

221
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,880
You must keep up.

222
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:18,400
Don't be afraid.

223
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:20,280
I'm right behind you.

224
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,570
OK. Go!

225
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,730
Wait!

226
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:10,370
There's water in the cave,

227
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:11,760
which causes a humidity difference

228
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:12,970
between the entrance and the outside,

229
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,640
thus fog will form locally.

230
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,040
Where the fog is heavier,

231
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,250
there may be an exit.

232
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,920
Yuan, you're strong.

233
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:49,680
I'll tell you

234
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,640
the truth now.

235
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,850
In my judgment,

236
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,680
in an hour at most,

237
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,970
this place

238
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,040
will be flooded.

239
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,800
With your physical condition,

240
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,520
you can't dive out.

241
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,640
So we have to go forward

242
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,730
and find another exit.

243
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,920
But no one knows

244
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,370
what is waiting ahead.

245
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,000
Are you afraid?

246
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,880
Yan, check the outfit.

247
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,330
Put on your helmet.

248
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,920
Stay here and wait for my signal.

249
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,520
Observe the water level.

250
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:47,400
I have to go.

251
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:13,880
Go.

252
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,130
Come.

253
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,880
Target No.1 is out.

254
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,370
Target No.1 is out.

255
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:09,160
Go.

256
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,200
You need to take a rest.

257
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,130
Go.

258
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,400
Luo Ben, listen to me.

259
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:18,010
Yan, Uncle Qingshan and Yuan

260
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:19,370
are still in the cave.

261
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:21,130
Yuan has a high fever.

262
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,240
She can't dive.

263
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,290
You must find a way quickly.

264
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,130
The entrance is about to be flooded.

265
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,330
They must be looking for

266
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,400
another exit.

267
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,330
Let's hurry up!

268
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,090
Go.

269
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,330
- Hurry.
- Go!

270
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:31,920
Hurry.

271
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,960
Here's an opening.

272
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:25,770
Yan, this way.

273
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:32,160
Watch out.

274
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,640
Yan, there's light ahead.

275
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:06,570
Luo Yuan,

276
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:09,570
your brother is still looking for us.

277
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,610
They won't give up.

278
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,640
We mustn't give up either.

279
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,290
They will find us.

280
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,330
Watch out!

281
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:21,130
Yan!

282
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,570
Come here.

283
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:35,880
Yan, is your shoulder OK?

284
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:37,680
It's OK.

285
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,130
Yuan! Zhan Yan!

286
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:43,920
It's Luo Ben.

287
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:45,770
Luo Ben.

288
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,610
They've gone far.

289
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:54,440

Luo Yuan!

298
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:35,610
Are you there, Yuan?

299
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:36,720
Go.

300
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,010
Go.

301
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,330
Judging by the sound,

302
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,130

Target No. 2 is found.

313
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,330
Target is safe.

314
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,720
She's now with Captain Qingshan

315
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:36,240
and Dr. Zhan.

316

00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,090
Let's turn to the rescue

320
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,680
(All trapped in Beauty Cave rescued)
of Beauty Cave.

321
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,770
After 30 hours of hard work,

322
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,810
four backpackers

323
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,850
were rescued safely.

324
00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:59,050
It was an

325
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,610
impossible mission.

326
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:03,090
Today, our superheroes rescued

327
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:05,570
four backpackers who had been

328
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,960
trapped for days.

329
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:09,010
It's their selflessness

330
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:09,720
and fearlessness

331
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:12,200
that make the impossible possible.

332
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:14,640
Now let's interview

333
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:15,720
Director Liu of the
Provincial Rescue Coordination

334
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:17,770
and Plan Management Division.

335
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:22,090
It's a miracle

336
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,850
to bring them

337
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:25,850
all out safely.

338
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,330
Here,

339
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:29,240
I urge people not to

340
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,610
go to undeveloped karst caves

341
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,290
without authorization.

342
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:34,400
Don't put your life

343
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,290
in danger.

344
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,010
Is your injury serious?

345
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,570
No.

346
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:01,810
Yan, thanks.

347
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,010
You're welcome.

348
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,770
I would do the same for anyone.

349
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,920
Would you talk properly?

350
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:11,810
You should be blamed

351
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,770
for lacking

352
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,240
professional skills.

353
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,010
You don't even have a doctor

354
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:17,130
that can dive.

355
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:21,440
OK. OK.

356
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:23,370
We'll train them

357
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:24,530
as soon as we go back.

358
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:45,440
You ran short of

359
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:46,810
oxygen yourself just now.

360
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:48,330
Why did you give me yours?

361
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,130
Did you want to die?

362
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,680
I was more worried about you.

363
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:53,720
Nice try.

364
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:01,570
Let me do it myself.

365
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:04,960
Would you let me do it?

366
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:06,130
Let me do it myself.

367
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,400
Why do you care about me?

368
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:19,610
Why are you so kind to me?

369
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,610
Are you going to

370
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,860
give me a hard time again?

371
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,720
What does that look mean?

372
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:30,770
Did I misunderstand you?

373
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,810
You asked me to work in your company,

374
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,400
then you fired me

375
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,400
at will.

376
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,640
No sooner had you asked me to

377
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,240
wait for you to make a comeback,

378
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,090
then you let me

379
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,480
cooperate with others.

380
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,440
You said you would definitely

381
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:48,400
come to my reader meeting.

382
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,530
I waited till the last minute,

383
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,480
but you never showed up.

384
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:52,770
Again and again, you gave me hope,

385
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:53,850
and let me down.

386
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:55,610
I can't see you through.

387
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,920
I don't want to guess anymore.

388
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,640
Zhou Mingming, in this case,

389
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,680
I'll make it clear today.

390
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:02,960
If you don't like me,

391
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:04,330
stop teasing me, will you?

392
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,370
Don't give me hope

393
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,240
over and over again.

394
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:07,720
Don't be kind to me, OK?

395
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,200
(All trapped in Beauty Cave rescued)
In the cave rescue this time,

396
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:44,330
there's a person with

397
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,570
special status.

398
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,810
She's a member of the

399
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,370
International Medical Rescue Team,

400
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:50,640
a cave diving rescue expert,

401
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,720
as well as

402
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,570
an attending doctor of general surgery

403
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,330
of the Central Hospital, Zhan Yan.

404
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,330
Zhan Yan's performance

405
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:05,050
is obvious to all.

406
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,330
As her colleagues,

407
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,610
we should be proud of her.

408
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:10,720
The previous incident was cleared up.

409
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,130
It wasn't Zhan Yan's fault.

410
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:12,570
The hospital decides

411
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,960
to resume Zhan Yan's post immediately.

412
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,530
It was my fault.

413
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,290
When I knew you went out,

414
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,850
I should have gone with you.

415
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,720
You two are forbidden

416
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:42,720
to go out alone again.

417
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:45,160
Well,

418
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,370
what's the difference
between you and Luo Ben?

419
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:49,200
You're really...

420
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:52,960
Don't blame Dingding.

421
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:56,570
She's already felt guilty.

422
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:05,370
You're still coughing.

423
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,880
Remember to take medicine on time.

424
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,770
Mix it with water for me.

425
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:11,530
Today,

426
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:13,240
many of my colleagues visited me.

427
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,240
They saw the news
of you rescuing people

428
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,680
and thought you were great.

429
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,330
They envied me for having you.

430
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:20,290
OK. Be careful.

431
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:28,480
Why would I stay here?

432
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,530
You guys just ignore me.

433
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,640
Ignore me.

434
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,850
Let's not disturb them.

435
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:46,880
OK.

436
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,440
Get back to your work.

437
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,810
You just recovered. Take it easy.

438
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:54,370
I'm going back.

439
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,880
Come to my place tonight.

440
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:59,200
Got it.

441
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,370
I'll wait for you.

442
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,530
Bye.

443
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,720
Why hasn't he come yet?

444
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:13,460
(Law Positive Law Firm)

445
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,610
Mr. Luo is coming.

446
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:16,090
Mr. Luo is coming.

447
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,130
Luo Ben, could you spare a few minutes

448
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:18,010
for an interview?

449
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:18,770
Could you talk about your feelings

450
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,480
about saving the victims

451
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,770
at the last moment?

452
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:21,240
As a rescue hero,

453
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,770
what do you want to say to the public?

454
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,400
I'm not a hero.

455
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,330
I just did

456
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,610
what I should do.

457
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,330
But I'd like to

458
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,090
take this opportunity

459
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:30,850
to tell all

460
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,200
outdoor enthusiasts,

461
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:35,130
it's good that you love adventure,

462
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:36,480
but don't do things

463
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:37,920
you can't do,

464
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:39,400
and don't gamble

465
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:40,370
with your life.

466
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,200
Thanks.

467
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:42,960
Could you please say more?

468
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:44,330
Can you tell us
your feelings at that time?

469
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,370
Could you tell us about the situation?

470
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,480
Tell us more.

471
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,480
Mr. Luo,

472
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:52,880
you looked so cool in the rescue.

473
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,820
I watched the news of the cave rescue.

474
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,400
That's what the rescue

475
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:57,680
you often talk about is like.

476
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,200
Luo Ben,

477
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,090
you've got another fan.

478
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:01,770
Mr. Gao,

479
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,570
don't make fun of me.

480
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:05,880
What do you think?

481
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:06,680
Are you interested in

482
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:08,240
joining me in rescue?

483
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,160
Me?

484
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:12,680
Forget about rescue.

485
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:14,840
But how is it going

486
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,360
with pairing me off with the girl

487
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:17,160
who works in the hospital?

488
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:28,890
She's so beautiful.

489
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:30,360
What's her name?

490
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:31,890
Shen Ruoxi.

491
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:33,800
She's just like her name.

492
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:36,090
A peaceful and calm trickle.

493
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,530
She's really got class.

494
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,200
When would you arrange a meeting for us?

495
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,010
Only if the girl

496
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,450
wants to meet you.

497
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,680
Didn't you show her my picture?

498
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,450
I did.

499
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:50,610
Does she want to see me?

500
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:53,970
To make a new friend

501
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,680
requires to communicate more

502
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,640
and meet more.

503
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:58,410
You've been there. You should know.

504
00:34:58,530 --> 00:34:59,130
Luo Ben.

505
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,890
Luo Ben, when you're free,

506
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:04,570
arrange a team-building activity

507
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,570
for our people and the rescue team.

508
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,680
Let's show them

509
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,050
what real rescue is.

510
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:11,320
You know what,

511
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,050
the head of the Polar Land Group

512
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,090
came to see me just now.

513
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,050
They asked you

514
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:16,970
to be their legal counsel.

515
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,530
The group has been committed to

516
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,570
the outdoor gears market

517
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,890
for many years.

518
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:23,840
It's a supplier of many

519
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:24,720
large outdoor equipment.

520
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,360
By working with them,

521
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:27,280
we'll expand our

522
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:28,800
client market.

523
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,640
Luo Ben, I know,

524
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,970
you won't do such things

525
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,490
that will make you suffer losses.

526
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,720
Mr. He,

527
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:39,010
you really misunderstood me this time.

528
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,570
I didn't join

529
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:42,680
Light Chaser Rescue

530
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,010
to develop customers.

531
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:47,280
We save lives with our lives

532
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,970
rather than making money.

533
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:51,680
Luo Ben is right.

534
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,960
But I personally

535
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,840
agree with Mr. He.

536
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:57,360
We should organize

537
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:58,890
more exchanges

538
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:00,280
with the doctors and nurses,

539
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:01,970
in order to learn the meaning
of rescue together.

540
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,610
When the rescue team arrived,

541
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:08,760
the rainstorm had just stopped

542
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:10,570
and the entrance of
Beauty Cave had been flooded.

543
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,610
The only exit

544
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,320
was a secret sinkhole.

545
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,640
The terrain near the sinkhole

546
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,050
was steep, rugged and dangerous,

547
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,010
which brought

548
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:19,320
great difficulties to the rescue work.

549
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:20,840
Even so,

550
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,610
the team still carried out the rescue

551
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,130
in an orderly manner.

552
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,720
As of press time,

553
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,800
all the trapped

554
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:28,160
have been rescued.

555
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:31,050
Here again, we appeal to the public

556
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,010
not to go to undeveloped

557
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:33,610
scenic spots without permission

558
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,610
in case that your lives

559
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,130
will be in danger.

560
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:50,890
Aiqi, come here.

561
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,530
Ding Dingding,

562
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,200
after your personal experience

563
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,320
of the cave rescue

564
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:01,130
was reported,

565
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,450
the click rate of your comics
has surged.

566
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:06,680
I'm here to

567
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,360
talk with you about renewing

568
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:11,320
the contract of your second comic.

569
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:12,160
Sir,

570
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,890
I haven't concluded the first yet.

571
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:17,570
Don't worry about the remuneration.

572
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,320
I guess

573
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:19,680
many publishers will

574
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,050
hold out an olive branch to you.

575
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,680
But we signed

576
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:24,010
your first comic.

577
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:26,530
You must give priority to us.

578
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:31,840
Sir,

579
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:34,050
we can talk about it later.

580
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:36,360
Maybe Mingmei Media

581
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:37,610
will reach out to me again.

582
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,760
Mingmei Media?

583
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:41,090
Don't even think about it!

584
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:42,240
Why?

585
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:47,800
Don't you know?

586
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:48,930
If Mingmei Media hadn't

587
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:50,760
had any problems with

588
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:51,930
their film distribution

589
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:53,200
or run into cash-flow problems,

590
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,720
how could they have asked me

591
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,050
to sign the copyright for the

592
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,970
follow-up development of your comics?

593
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,670
We'll get the thing

594
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,090
settled by Friday,

595
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:04,800
OK?

596
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:06,680
OK, that's a deal.

597
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,280
Please.

598
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:09,450
Take care.

599
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:10,090
Bye.

600
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,490
Ding Dingding.

601
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:23,970
What a coincidence!

602
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:26,160
The chairman

603
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,050
asked me to talk to you.

604
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,280
Do you like Zhou Mingming?

605
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:32,720
Yes.

606
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,050
Did he disclose

607
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,640
our relationship in the company?

608
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,320
Do you think you're a good match?

609
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:42,490
Of course.

610
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,010
You're really interesting.

611
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:51,840
But Mingming needs a woman

612
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:52,840
who can help him

613
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:54,240
in his career now.

614
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,720
In this regard,

615
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,570
you're not the right woman.

616
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:00,320
As for that, I think

617
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:01,640
he can always find a partner
or an assistant,

618
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,640
can't he?

619
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:04,280
It won't be a hindrance
to our relationship.

620
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,890
Miss Li, anything else?

621
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:08,050
If not, I have to go.

622
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:08,930
I've ordered a cake for him.

623
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:09,760
I'm afraid it would melt.

624
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:12,010
Bye.

625
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:20,610
As regards the

626
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,530
film distribution problem
caused by the star,

627
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,050
our solution is,

628
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,090
first,

629
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,160
replace the star and shoot again.

630
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,450
Also,

631
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,570
I've contacted

632
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,280
another star

633
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:31,410
who is more bankable

634
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:32,760
and highly willing.

635
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:33,450
Now we're

636
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:34,680
moving forward with the contract.

637
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:35,890
Second,

638
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,360
we'll sue the previous star

639
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:38,240
for compensation.

640
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:39,530
The lawsuit

641
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,570
is already in the legal process.

642
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,360
Rest assured, everyone.

643
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,490
Mr. Zhou is more and more

644
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:45,680
like you used to be.

645
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,720
Exactly.

646
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,610
Yes, the younger generation
will surpass the older.

647
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:51,240
However,

648
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,050
it takes time to move forward

649
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:52,930
with the two plans.

650
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:54,200
It can't solve the current

651
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,970
cash flow shortage of the company.

652
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:01,010
The time can't be guaranteed.

653
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:03,840
Everyone,

654
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,640
if the two plans

655
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,280
move forward smoothly,

656
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,890
I'll take care

657
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:11,530
of the loan.

658
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,610
(Eat on time.)

659
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,280
(Don't force me to feed you.)

660
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:39,490
Mom,

661
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:41,160
thanks for supporting me

662
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,450
at the meeting.

663
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,410
Seeing that you care so much

664
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:45,720
about the company,

665
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,090
it's worth me doing anything.

666
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:49,970
Let's try the cake.

667
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:51,530
It's a big cake.

668
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,720
It'll be a waste for

669
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:54,200
the two of us to eat it.

670
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,240
You've been working hard these days.

671
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:03,930
Solving the crisis of the company

672
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,360
still needs your efforts.

673
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:06,090
We can do it!

674
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,050
You're welcome. It's our duty.

675
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,130
You're welcome.

676
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,010
Mingming,

677
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,930
split the cake for everyone.

678
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:19,930
Nonsense!

679
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:23,360
What are you doing?

680
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,930
Well,

681
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,200
now I can't share the cake.

682
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,090
You know why.

683
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,530
OK.

684
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,610
That's it.

685
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:34,410
Let's go.

686
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,490
Mingming

687
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,050
really pissed me off.

688
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,930
Soon after I praised him at the meeting,

689
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:45,530
he goofed up again.

690
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,800
When will he grow up?

691
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:51,090
Mr. Zhou

692
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,610
seems to be a fun-loving man usually,

693
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,280
but in fact, he has a lot of drive

694
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:55,240
and methods

695
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:56,530
in doing his job.

696
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:57,490
Ma'am,

697
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,800
you will have a good helper.

698
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,360
You always compliment him.

699
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,570
I hope so.

700
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:07,050
Did you make it clear

701
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,570
to Ding Dingding?

702
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:11,130
Yes, but

703
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,760
she didn't seem to mind it.

704
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:15,320
It seems that this girl

705
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:16,640
isn't that simple.

706
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:18,610
Mingming turned

707
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,280
a deaf ear to me

708
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:22,610
and even risked his life for her.

709
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:26,130
By the way,

710
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,840
I'm busy recently.

711
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,930
You keep an eye on him for me.

712
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:31,050
OK.

713
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:33,640
Why did you give me such a
straightforward

714
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,320
cake?

715
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,320
The whole office saw it

716
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:36,320
you know?

717
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:38,610
I'm always open and straightforward,

718
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,360
unlike you,

719
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:41,160
who always sneak around.

720
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:42,890
Who sneaks around?

721
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:44,240
Are you going to deny it?

722
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:45,570
I know that you went to

723
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,050
see Ma Baoming.

724
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:50,160
He told me everything

725
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:51,800
concerning your situation.

726
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:52,930
Don't believe him.

727
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:54,240
He knows nothing about it.

728
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:55,970
As your girlfriend,

729
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:57,130
although I can't

730
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,680
help you at work,

731
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,280
you mustn't hide it from me

732
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:01,530
when you're upset.

733
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,160
You hear me?

734
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:02,930
Yes.

735
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:05,090
Kiss me.

736
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:09,410
Kiss me. Hurry up.
