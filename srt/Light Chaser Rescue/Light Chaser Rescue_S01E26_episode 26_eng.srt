1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,990

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,800
♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,100
♫  I put out mountain fires  ♫

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,900
♫  and catch the sunset  ♫

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,400
♫  I leave the rhythms of life in my wake  ♫

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:35,900
♫  Happiness whispers in my ears  ♫

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,400
♫  Chasing the passion for the future  ♫

8
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,500
♫  Like a dream maker  ♫

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,400
♫  Reading the universe and stars  ♫

10
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,600
♫  My existence in the river of time  ♫

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,500
♫  With the body temperature of a moment  ♫

12
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:02,200
♫  I'm trying to be the extension of light  ♫

13
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:08,900
♫  If the world grants me a frustrating opening  ♫

14
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:15,400
♫  I'll chase back time like a dark horse  ♫

15
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:22,200
♫  Even though I know the truth, I won't be afraid  ♫

16
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,300
♫  I won't miss the moon because of mediocrity  ♫

17
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:32,000
♫  I won't lose the light  ♫

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,400

20
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,200
 Give me one kiss.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,100
 Come on, kiss me.

22
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,700
And one hundred more.

23
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,800
 Is it okay? I have to work now.

24
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,000
Okay, fine.

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,500
Bye bye.

26
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,900
You'll feel better when you have deserts.

27
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,300
It's a great choice for the ones who experienced a lot before.

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,900
I didn't expect that Lawyer Luo could make this.

29
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,600
What? Do you want to learn it?

30
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,900
- I can teach you. 
 - Okay.

31
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,100
Here.

32
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,300
Take it.

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,400
Look.

34
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,700
Stick it in.

35
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,500
Then slowly squeeze the cream in.

36
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,500
Do you know?

37
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:07,900
The final appearance of each puff has some randomness.

38
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,600
It wraps the air and absorbs the water differently each time,

39
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,700
so the final expansion effect is different.

40
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,700
You mean no matter how many times you practice,

41
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,100
you can't make the totally same puff.

42
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,000
Yeah, right.

43
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,220
I don't like this uncertain feeling.

44
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,800
Why?

45
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,800
Every time you have a task, I can't make sure of your safety.

46
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,500
I don't like that.

47
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,600
Now you admit you're worried about me.

48
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,200
You've saved me twice.

49
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,600
I will save you next time.

50
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,079
Stop it.

51
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,300
Can you expect some good things?

52
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,000
Doctor Zhan.

53
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,400
Enjoy your puff.

54
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,990

55
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:49,290

56
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:06,400
♫  At first, there was no sadness in the world  ♫

57
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:13,480
♫  Until luck came and crossed the stage  ♫

58
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:21,600
♫  At first, souls were confused and wandered  ♫

59
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:28,700
♫  Until people hugged each other  ♫

60
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:36,400
♫  I've been on the road  ♫

61
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:44,600
♫  Trying to connect laughter and tears  ♫

62
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:51,570
♫  I suddenly have faith  ♫

63
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,100
♫  I can walk by millions of shining household lights  ♫

64
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:08,000
♫  I hope I can admire flowers in the afterglow  ♫

65
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,200
♫  Shed tears and hope that you are well  ♫

66
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:22,900
♫  The good times I'm pursuing belong to the light  ♫

67
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:30,800
♫  It can light up the wounds that follow  ♫

68
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:52,200
Luo Ben, if you have a meal with me, you will suffer losses.

69
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,800
I only eat simple food.

70
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,400
I'm worried that you won't get used to it.

71
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,200
I've been training the whole day.

72
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,400
It's really good to have something simple.

73
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,600
- Thanks. 
 - The training intensity, is it okay for you?

74
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,200
Totally okay.

75
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,700
Come on.

76
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,200
It's good.

77
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,400
Look.

78
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,500
Vegetables and rice, that's the smell of family.

79
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,300
I just think it's simple and convenient.

80
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,400
But it has enough nutrients.

81
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,400
You know what?

82
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,000
Last time, I and Zhan Yan, when we were trapped in the basement.

83
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,800
At that time, I thought we wouldn't survive.

84
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,400
She said to me,

85
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:46,100
what she wants to have is just a bowl of vegetable rice.

86
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,000
Later, I tried to cook that.

87
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,700
But it's obvious, that's not the taste she wants.

88
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,900
Now I understand,

89
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,700
the taste of vegetable rice in her mind,

90
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,300
only you can cook it.

91
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,200
She said she wanted to have vegetable rice,

92
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,600
that means she misses you.

93
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,700
Hello.

94
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,400
 Do you need to work extra hours?

95
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,000
 Let's have dinner together?

96
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I have some work. I'll call you later.

97
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,500
I'll wait for you.

98
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,000
Here.

99
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,800
Take a seat.

100
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,200
To your mom's tomb?

101
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,800
Did you see the flowers I sent?

102
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,700
You didn't throw those, right?

103
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,800
No.

104
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,800
But why did you visit her tomb suddenly?

105
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,300
I went to thank her.

106
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,400
Thank her for giving you life, so we can meet each other.

107
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,900
Happy birthday.

108
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:28,000
Zhan Yan, from today on, your birthday is our special festival.

109
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,200
Is it okay?

110
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,700
Are you sure?

111
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,400
I'm so bad-tempered.

112
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,800
Are you sure you'll be with me?

113
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,000
Then, who else can be with you?

114
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,500
Look.

115
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,600
Why vegetable rice again?

116
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,300
Look at this one.

117
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,200
Is there any difference?

118
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,400
Looks good.

119
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,200
Have a try.

120
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,600
Last time, both of us thought it was hard for us to survive.

121
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,900
So, we shared our secrets with each other.

122
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:19,500
I believe at that moment, what we said were sincere words.

123
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,800
You said you wanted to have vegetable rice that time.

124
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:27,600
It's because it carries your family's love, right?

125
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:34,500
Zhan Yan, you have always cared about your family.

126
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:39,100
It's carried in vegetable rice, right?

127
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,800
Zhan Yan. Zhan Yan!

128
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,000
You two are tricking me, right?

129
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,600
Yan, it's your birthday.

130
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,100
I would like to cook your favorite vegetable rice for you.

131
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,200
It's my idea. Don't blame him.

132
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,600
You think it's a good idea, right?

133
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:19,600
Can you stop being smug and clever?

134
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,300
Zhan Yan!

135
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:30,000
Zhan Yan. Zhan Yan!

136
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,900
Zhan Yan! Enough.

137
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,700
No matter what conflicts you have, it has been so many years, it's time to forgive.

138
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,100
It's my private business. Don't cross the line.

139
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,300
I don't want you to be sad.

140
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,300
Just think about it.

141
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,200
During these years, you've been feeling sad.

142
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,200
He was not happy, either.

143
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,200
Why can't you sit down and have a talk?

144
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,000
Then do you want the two of you to always be like this?

145
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,400
Can you leave me alone?

146
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,800
Zhan Yan. Zhan Yan!

147
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:18,300
Sorry. I was supposed to help you.

148
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,559
 It was my fault today.

149
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:45,208
 Sorry.

150
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:03,460
 But I think you shouldn't ignore or refuse family love

151
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:06,607
 in one's limited life.

152
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:22,940
You're so lovey-dovey.

153
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,559
I just can't stand it. He just left.

154
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:35,019
Luo Ben.

155
00:17:41,239 --> 00:17:43,299
That day I was so bad-tempered.

156
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:45,008
Please don't mind it.

157
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,115
I'm just worried about you.

158
00:17:49,479 --> 00:17:52,640
Let's forget that day.

159
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,140
Okay?

160
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,700
Mom, why did you move all my stuff back?

161
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,499
You need to be trained.

162
00:18:06,499 --> 00:18:09,128
Didn't you say you'd leave me to my fate?

163
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,339
Help me.

164
00:18:12,339 --> 00:18:14,120
This time you're in big trouble.

165
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,092
Your mom didn't sleep well the whole night.

166
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,700
Okay, fine. Mom, stop.

167
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:27,100
I swear, from today, I won't waste national rescue resources casually. Is that okay?

168
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,260
Dingding, it's useless.

169
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:32,680
Your mom and I won't allow you to live alone.

170
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,895
Who says I'm alone?

171
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:44,319
Why does this boy look so familiar?

172
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:48,556
He is the boy who saved Dingding?

173
00:18:48,556 --> 00:18:50,240
It's him.

174
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:56,080
He could save Dingding with his life, so he must treat her well.

175
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:02,120
This weekend we'll make wonton with chicken soup.

176
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,203
Invite him to our house.

177
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,579
Well, are you going to attend a meeting?

178
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,360
You know nothing. The first impression matters. Okay?

179
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,879
Fine.

180
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,480
How do I look?

181
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:39,610
But... it's just a meal.

182
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:42,570
You... It's like you're making a proposal.

183
00:19:42,579 --> 00:19:45,940
Yes, it is. Help... Help me.

184
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,960
I'm not nervous, just tired from driving for a long time.

185
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,519
Okay, I know.

186
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:56,560
- I'm not nervous at all. 
 - You're not nervous.

187
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,819
It's true.

188
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:12,979
Uncle. Aunt.

189
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:16,235
So nice to meet you. Here are my gifts.

190
00:20:17,899 --> 00:20:21,323
Zhou, you're too polite.

191
00:20:21,323 --> 00:20:24,020
I heard that both of you are college professors.

192
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:27,260
It's just a small present for you.

193
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,300
They're science professors.

194
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:35,159
Zhou, both of us like your gifts.

195
00:20:35,159 --> 00:20:37,359
- Yeah, thanks. 
 - My honor.

196
00:20:39,379 --> 00:20:42,519
Zhou which university did you graduate?

197
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:45,079
Linjiang Science and Technology.

198
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:47,983
Linjiang Science and Technology.

199
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:51,000
It's a college.

200
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,963
Ability matters.

201
00:20:57,199 --> 00:20:59,123
What do you do?

202
00:20:59,123 --> 00:21:01,099
Mingmei Media.

203
00:21:01,099 --> 00:21:02,700
Entertainment industry?

204
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,020
Also, culture industry.

205
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,899
What did you produce before?

206
00:21:08,899 --> 00:21:11,400
My company focuses on romance dramas.

207
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:16,272
- Idol dramas? 
 - Mainly for young people.

208
00:21:16,939 --> 00:21:17,999
Yes.

209
00:21:17,999 --> 00:21:22,944
But Zhou, you should shoot more serious dramas.

210
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,519
Any more questions? We're starving.

211
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:29,780
Right, we can talk later. We're going to cook now.

212
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:34,179
Zhou, Meiren Cave you were trapped in this time was not developed.

213
00:21:34,179 --> 00:21:36,600
It keeps a lot of original landforms.

214
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,320
I'm really interested in that.

215
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,099
Later, let's talk more about underground rock layers.

216
00:21:42,099 --> 00:21:43,539
- Come on, let's cook first. 
 - Okay.

217
00:21:43,539 --> 00:21:44,999
Please, cook now.

218
00:21:44,999 --> 00:21:46,519
Zhou, talk later.

219
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:48,819
Yeah.

220
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,880
Well, what are you doing?

221
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,479
Rock layers, your dad said, I don't know a thing. I need to search.

222
00:22:00,479 --> 00:22:02,959
- Just tell the truth. 
 - No way.

223
00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:04,579
- Lower your voice.

224
00:22:14,579 --> 00:22:17,580
My Dingding doesn't study well,

225
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,640
but she does have a good eye on her boyfriend.

226
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,279
Look at Zhou. He is so excellent, just like Luo Ben.

227
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:29,239
Mr. Ding, can you compare Zhou with Luo Ben?

228
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:32,863
Luo Ben graduated from a famous university.

229
00:22:32,863 --> 00:22:35,619
How can you compare Dingding with Zhan Yan?

230
00:22:35,619 --> 00:22:38,715
That's true.

231
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:45,139
Zhou's parents can raise a kid who is interested in charity,

232
00:22:45,139 --> 00:22:47,900
they must be well-educated.

233
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:52,060
You, don't be so picky. Or that boy will be frightened by you.

234
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,600
Okay, I know.

235
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,967
Stir-fry now.

236
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,439
- "A layer of rock or sediment characterized by 
 -  Don't do that.

237
00:23:01,439 --> 00:23:04,511
- certain lithologic..." 
 - Are you working?

238
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,539
Aren't you hungry? The wonton is ready.

239
00:23:07,539 --> 00:23:09,140
- Come on. 
 - Thanks, Aunt.

240
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,779
Come.

241
00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:16,959
- Uncle. Uncle, let me do it. 
 - Okay.

242
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,280
Sit down.

243
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,363
Aren't you starving? Enjoy yourself.

244
00:23:23,363 --> 00:23:26,979
Try my wonton. It's top-tier.

245
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,959
I must try it, then.

246
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:32,360
- It's a little hot. Be careful. 
 - Thank you, Aunt.

247
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,559
Zhou.

248
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:40,059
Well, it was said in the news that the bottom of the cave is linked to a sinkhole.

249
00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:43,412
This kind of landform is rare in China.

250
00:23:43,412 --> 00:23:48,859
Is that sinkhole collapsible or erosive?

251
00:23:48,859 --> 00:23:52,080
It... It's...

252
00:23:53,479 --> 00:23:56,859
Uncle, actually, there were two rescue teams.

253
00:23:56,859 --> 00:23:58,659
I was responsible for the cave part.

254
00:23:58,659 --> 00:24:01,804
I didn't see the sinkhole.

255
00:24:01,804 --> 00:24:03,280
That's okay.

256
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,759
- Enjoy yourself. 
 - How about the cave?

257
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,100
- Cave, ah... Ca...

258
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:14,379
Dad, he was rushing to save me at that time, he had no time to notice other stuff.

259
00:24:14,379 --> 00:24:16,000
Right. Come on.

260
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,039
- Try this. 
 - Thanks.

261
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:24,359
My little girl can survive and come back home, thanks to your help.

262
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,619
You are good at diving.

263
00:24:26,619 --> 00:24:29,124
But Dingding is a non-swimmer.

264
00:24:29,124 --> 00:24:32,440
You must have worked hard to save her.

265
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,800
Well, I learned rescue diving from Dingding's cousin, Zhan Yan.

266
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,420
I'm not so excellent, I'm just a beginner.

267
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:43,839
- But I could only think about Dingding being in that cave, so I must bring her out. 
 - Okay.

268
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:46,440
Zhou, you said you learned it from Yan.

269
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:51,060
Yeah. I'd like to train a professional rescue diving team.

270
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:55,379
Though I'm not as excellent as Doctor Zhan, I'll work harder.

271
00:24:55,379 --> 00:24:56,980
Dingding, did you hear that?

272
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,439
You need to learn from Zhou in the future.

273
00:24:59,439 --> 00:25:01,160
Why lecture me again?

274
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,291
Come on, try this.

275
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:06,040
Zhou has a goal.

276
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,179
And Yan is teaching him now.

277
00:25:08,179 --> 00:25:11,928
In the future, Zhou must be successful.

278
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:15,060
And you should talk more with them later.

279
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,260
Don't just go with the flow.

280
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,251
Okay, I know.

281
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:22,460
- Thank you, Aunt. Thanks, I'll do it myself. 
 - How about the fish?

282
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:28,300
Zhou, maybe our Dingding isn't serious.

283
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:33,619
She just inherited the recessive gene from her father and me.

284
00:25:33,619 --> 00:25:39,576
But when she has children, the dominant gene will work.

285
00:25:40,899 --> 00:25:43,140
What I want to say is that...

286
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:48,430
When you are with each other, you must be very patient with her.

287
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,184
Mrs. Ding, to be honest, I think Dingding is perfectly nice.

288
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,560
Well, very good.

289
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,479
That's great. Cheers.

290
00:25:58,479 --> 00:25:59,979
Come on.

291
00:26:02,719 --> 00:26:04,640
Sir, please calm down.

292
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,899
It's not like what you think.

293
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,279
What happened was a misunderstanding.

294
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,220
- Light Chaser Rescue. 
 - We are a rescue charity.

295
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,300
Sir, it's not what you think.

296
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,780
Please let me explain.

297
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:19,919
Light Chaser Rescue is a non-profitable charity organization.

298
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,659
We have never asked for any fees.

299
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:23,239
- Captain. 
 - You misunderstand it.

300
00:26:23,239 --> 00:26:24,640
Captain, you need to read this.

301
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,212
Please wait for a second, Sir.

302
00:26:29,719 --> 00:26:31,420
 - I'm not lying. 
 - This is Light Chaser Rescue.

303
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,079

Please believe us.

304
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:36,679
 We've heard what you said, but where did you hear it?

305
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:38,959
 The truth is we're not operating for money.

306
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:41,619
 - This is Light Chaser Rescue. 
 - It's true.

307
00:26:41,619 --> 00:26:42,919
 Easy, please.

308
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:44,399
 Do you believe me?

309
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:53,090

310
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:03,959
The bad news of the rescue team is becoming severe.

311
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:07,339
If it can't be handled well, it will draw more and more attention.

312
00:27:07,339 --> 00:27:10,919
The comic series of Light Chaser Rescue will be influenced.

313
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,819
What about changing the title from the next volume?

314
00:27:16,819 --> 00:27:18,619
The rescue team is innocent.

315
00:27:18,619 --> 00:27:21,999
Though they are innocent, who will believe you?

316
00:27:21,999 --> 00:27:24,320
They believe it's Pandora's box.

317
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,691
No one can stand out to prove the rescue team is innocent.

318
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:36,080
I just bought the copyright, don't get yourself involved in it.

319
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,479
I won't change the title, Light Chaser Rescue.

320
00:27:38,479 --> 00:27:42,139
If someone wants to defame the team, then I will do the justice.

321
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:49,279
Boss, if you think about what I'm going to do has a bad influence on the company and our income,

322
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,119
you can cancel our contract.

323
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,168
Ding Dingding.

324
00:27:56,379 --> 00:27:58,950
- She is really... 
  - Look. Look at him.

325
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,519
 Did you see it?

326
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:02,999
 The captain is called Qingshan.

327
00:28:02,999 --> 00:28:04,500
 I think it's a fake name.

328
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,759
 Did he change his name because he did too many bad things?

329
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:09,540
 Well, it's possible.

330
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,260
 I'm thinking the same.

331
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,500
Zhan Yan, it's time.

332
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,740
 He's blinded by money.

333
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,192
 Sure he is.

334
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,099
I think all of you know it.

335
00:28:18,099 --> 00:28:20,711
Someone revealed on the internet

336
00:28:20,711 --> 00:28:25,859
that the Juwu Light Chaser Rescue receives money from different rescue programs.

337
00:28:26,479 --> 00:28:30,803
But we have never had another team in Juwu.

338
00:28:30,803 --> 00:28:35,335
Obviously, someone used our name on purpose.

339
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,260
What a bastard.

340
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:41,779
Our team worked hard for so many years so we can be so famous and glorious.

341
00:28:41,779 --> 00:28:45,080
But now, our reputation is about to be broken.

342
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,260
Now, others feel unwilling to cooperate with our team,

343
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:50,543
they are even resisting public charities.

344
00:28:50,543 --> 00:28:51,719
What about this?

345
00:28:51,719 --> 00:28:54,540
We can find those who used our name and expose their misconduct.

346
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:57,160
That's right. They must pay the price.

347
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,239
They won't feel sorry unless they are exposed and criticized.

348
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:02,851
If we don't teach them a lesson, they may do it again.

349
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,179
Luo Ben, why are you so quiet?

350
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:10,040
You're a lawyer. Sue them.

351
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,400
And we can get our reputation back.

352
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:20,840
Luo Ben, we should use the law to solve this problem.

353
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,279
Do you have any suggestions?

354
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:25,688
Captain, listen.

355
00:29:25,688 --> 00:29:29,760
As you said, we didn't authorize Juwu Rescue to use our name.

356
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,500
So they are our members.

357
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,780
If we sue them for their identity theft,

358
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,904
it won't be hard for us to win the case.

359
00:29:36,904 --> 00:29:40,940
But I'm afraid people won't keep trusting us...

360
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,011
even if we win it.

361
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,400
Let's think about it.

362
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,800
Negative news about the Light Chasing Rescue Team is flying all over the internet.

363
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:55,060
Ordinary people have no way of discerning what the truth is.

364
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:59,980
In this case, the fake news on the internet will be infinitely magnified

365
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,540
and fermented infinitely.

366
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,360
Yes.

367
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:11,779
So many years have passed since our team was established, and I've never been afraid.

368
00:30:11,779 --> 00:30:16,140
But this time, I am apprehensive about it.

369
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,840
As a public charity, we shoulder a heavy responsibility.

370
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:23,352
If our reputation is lost, it'll be hard to get it again.

371
00:30:24,999 --> 00:30:28,027
This is the biggest crisis...

372
00:30:28,999 --> 00:30:31,408
since our establishment.

373
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,195
Yuan Yuan.

374
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,460
I have to go back to my team.

375
00:30:59,719 --> 00:31:01,219
 Go.

376
00:31:05,479 --> 00:31:10,367
If I leave, it may be harder for you to run the diner.

377
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,840
 It's all right.

378
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:16,647
 If no one buys our wonton, we can do something else.

379
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,728
Thank you, Yuan Yuan.

380
00:31:26,099 --> 00:31:27,799
 Wait a minute.

381
00:31:52,819 --> 00:31:54,664
When did you buy it?

382
00:31:58,439 --> 00:32:01,119
 You need to go back to your team.

383
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,640
No.

384
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,719
Something wrong with the team. I want to see how they are now.

385
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,619
 I know you have a passion for helping people.

386
00:32:13,619 --> 00:32:18,035
 And you left the team for me.

387
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:26,660
I want to run this food truck well, so I can take care of you.

388
00:32:27,959 --> 00:32:31,131
 But you look bad now, I am not happy at all.

389
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,900
 Do you...

390
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:41,800
 feel that I'm so incapable and I need your help all the time?

391
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,636
I don't mean that.

392
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:48,219
 I love you.

393
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,679
 So I hope you can do what you want to do.

394
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,719
 I'll take care of myself.

395
00:32:58,719 --> 00:33:00,848
 And I'll support you.

396
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,500
 I don't want to be your burden.

397
00:33:05,479 --> 00:33:07,039
 Go back to your team.

398
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,784
 Stand by their side.

399
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:28,240

400
00:33:34,999 --> 00:33:38,699
Dong. Laosi. Ask our friends to refute the account that posted the topic.

401
00:33:38,699 --> 00:33:41,543
We will reply to every word they say.

402
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:46,980
- Will it work? 
 - Of course.

403
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:49,952
I don't believe we can't defeat them.

404
00:33:49,952 --> 00:33:52,719
Laosi. Laosi. They posted something new. Hurry.

405
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,819
Zhou Mingming, go back.

406
00:33:56,819 --> 00:33:59,795
You've been here for a long time, but you have to work.

407
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:03,079
My girlfriend cares about my career.

408
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:06,815
I'm afraid your mom needs you.

409
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,880
Money is important.

410
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,480
To do justice is more important.

411
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:19,740
As an entrepreneur in this new age, you're different from others and have a high self-consciousness.

412
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,355
Of course.

413
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,460
My mom.

414
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:33,239
Hello, Mom.

415
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:37,227
I... I am busy now.

416
00:34:37,227 --> 00:34:40,520
I know. I've asked Aiqi to make the marketing plan. Don't worry.

417
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,448
Don't worry.

418
00:34:42,448 --> 00:34:43,840
Yes. You know.

419
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,320
- Bed 32?

420
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,080
 Yes, there's a problem.

421
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,859
 - The patient should be observed for more days. 
 - I see.

422
00:34:50,859 --> 00:34:51,799

423
00:34:51,799 --> 00:34:53,199
 I doubt it.

424
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,040
 As I know, Light Chaser Rescue are the real heroes of common people.

425
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,479
 They don't take money from others. I've seen it before.

426
00:34:58,479 --> 00:35:01,580
 They refuse the money from victims and their families.

427
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:07,120
 If Qingshan wants to make money, why did he start a charity?

428
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,399
 But he must take money.

429
00:35:08,399 --> 00:35:10,759
 I urge the government to shut them down.

430
00:35:10,759 --> 00:35:12,000
 People like conspiracies.

431
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,560
 Guys, did you see with your own eyes that they did it?

432
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,759
 Were you at the scene?

433
00:35:15,759 --> 00:35:18,000
 You are really hopeless.

434
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,879
 Wait for an official announcement.

435
00:35:19,879 --> 00:35:22,619
 In today's society, everyone lives for money.

436
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:26,079
 - I don't believe they're nice people. 
 - If everyone is so greedy, who can operate the charities?

437
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,359
 That's right. A charity?

438
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:31,500
 There must be something fishy if we check their accounts.

439
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,503
What is our training for?

440
00:36:09,759 --> 00:36:11,579
 The captain is coming.

441
00:36:13,979 --> 00:36:16,139
- Captain. 
 - Captain.

442
00:36:16,139 --> 00:36:20,252
You look so tired now, are you training?

443
00:36:20,252 --> 00:36:23,479
Captain, no mission will come to us now.

444
00:36:23,479 --> 00:36:24,679
Do we have to keep training?

445
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:27,619
Captain, will our team be dismissed?

446
00:36:37,759 --> 00:36:41,359
When you joined our team, everyone filled in a form.

447
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:43,343
There's a question.

448
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,820
Why do you want to join the rescue team?

449
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:49,399
Do you remember it? Why?

450
00:36:49,399 --> 00:36:51,968
To be a warmhearted person.

451
00:36:51,968 --> 00:36:53,879
To achieve the value of my life.

452
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:55,239
To help other people.

453
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:57,652
To make my life more meaningful.

454
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:01,339
We have to ask ourselves.

455
00:37:01,339 --> 00:37:03,527
If we face difficulties,

456
00:37:03,527 --> 00:37:08,199
failures, or challenges, even misunderstandings or insults,

457
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:10,319
will we continue to do it?

458
00:37:14,879 --> 00:37:18,076
If we do it right, why do we care about others?

459
00:37:18,076 --> 00:37:19,219
- That's right. 
 - Yeah.

460
00:37:19,219 --> 00:37:21,012
We will never give up.

461
00:37:21,012 --> 00:37:21,960
Very good.

462
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,467
Just keep going.

463
00:37:23,467 --> 00:37:25,740
No matter what happens,

464
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,819
this team will not be dismissed,

465
00:37:27,819 --> 00:37:30,020
even though I am the only one left.

466
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:35,192
I will carry on our rescue in the future.

467
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,799
I'm not leaving.

468
00:37:37,799 --> 00:37:40,020
We believe the truth will come out.

469
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,120
It will.

470
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,199
I'm in.

471
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:44,059
I'll be here till the last day.

472
00:37:44,799 --> 00:37:46,199
Captain.

473
00:37:47,319 --> 00:37:48,819
Xiong Fei.

474
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,959
He used to be our expert at using ropes.

475
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:03,139
I came to apply to rejoin the team.

476
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:15,915
Xiong Fei,

477
00:38:16,739 --> 00:38:19,971
you left our team.

478
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,284
Why do you want to come back?

479
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:30,584
I left the team because I had to solve my personal problems.

480
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,248
I admit that my return to the team is selfish.

481
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,200
After I left the team,

482
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:42,051
I realized people should pursue something in their life.

483
00:38:42,051 --> 00:38:44,528
I also have the desire to be a good person.

484
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:49,264
This is my greatest selfishness, in doing charity rescue!

485
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:56,820
Xiong Fei, return to the team.

486
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,360
Yes!

487
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:09,039
Today, our coach, Xiong Fei, will teach you how to use ropes.

488
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:11,059
- Great. 
 - Yes.

489
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:29,490

490
00:39:33,219 --> 00:39:34,519
Mom.

491
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:43,500
I disagreed with you on joining the rescue team from the beginning.

492
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,060
On the one hand, it's for your safety.

493
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:48,279
On the other hand, to avoid any unforeseen troubles.

494
00:39:48,279 --> 00:39:51,968
But now, another bad thing happened.

495
00:39:51,968 --> 00:39:54,491
The news is not true.

496
00:39:54,491 --> 00:39:56,139
The team has asked a lawyer to sue them.

497
00:39:56,139 --> 00:39:59,060
True or not, it has aroused great attention.

498
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:03,940
What a media company needs most are a good image and evaluation.

499
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:06,219
Now is a hard time for our company.

500
00:40:06,219 --> 00:40:08,219
We finally moved the new project forward.

501
00:40:08,219 --> 00:40:12,080
We can't make any mistakes or damage our image in this critical period.

502
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,300
Mom, it's not a shameful to help others.

503
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,700
And it won't defame our company.

504
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,399
Why don't you understand?

505
00:40:18,399 --> 00:40:21,140
It's not you who can solve this problem. Quit the team now.

506
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:23,419
Mom, I'll work hard for the company.

507
00:40:23,419 --> 00:40:24,980
I can't leave at this moment.

508
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,980
I will stay with my teammates.

509
00:40:29,879 --> 00:40:31,959
Well, it's up to you.

510
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,152
So what is your plan?

511
00:40:43,239 --> 00:40:44,544
For what?

512
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:46,564
You know what I'm saying.

513
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,744
I thought you didn't care.

514
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,679
I don't care about him, but I do care about the team.

515
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:55,499
And I care about public service.

516
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,439
I can't just watch the rescue team get smeared like this.

517
00:41:01,279 --> 00:41:03,080
We have discussed it.

518
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:06,723
The team will sue them tomorrow.

519
00:41:06,723 --> 00:41:11,952
I'm going to Juwu tomorrow, to see what is happening there.

520
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,940
You've prepared everything.

521
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,912
But you didn't tell me.

522
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:22,011
I've made a mistake once, so I dare not cross the line.

523
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:26,928
An open court?

524
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,260
Yes.

525
00:41:30,399 --> 00:41:35,279
Only by expanding influence can we minimize the negative influence brought by public opinion.

526
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,880
Luo Ben.

527
00:41:41,879 --> 00:41:43,996
Are you sure about this?

528
00:41:44,679 --> 00:41:48,359
Once the trial is open, you, as a defense attorney,

529
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:53,507
you must stand up to scrutiny and verification of every statement you make.

530
00:41:53,507 --> 00:41:58,520
Even small mistakes will be magnified several times under the spotlight.

531
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:04,900
If the case is lost, the impact on the law firm will be secondary

532
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:08,796
I'm afraid it will be difficult for you to stand up in the industry in the future.

533
00:42:13,279 --> 00:42:15,788
It's a perilous choice.

534
00:42:15,788 --> 00:42:19,479
Luo Ben, you must think about it again.

535
00:42:25,879 --> 00:42:27,968
I've made up my mind.

536
00:42:27,968 --> 00:42:31,480
If you think it might affect the law firm,

537
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,228
I can resign.

538
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,920
Luo Ben.

539
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,700
Get yourself ready.

540
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:53,559
The firm will stand by your side.

541
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:12,980

542
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:22,484
♫  At first, there was no sadness in the world  ♫

543
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:30,004
♫  Until luck came and crossed the stage  ♫

544
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:37,856
♫  At first, souls were confused and wandered  ♫

545
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:44,720
♫  Until people hugged each other  ♫

546
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:53,112
♫  I've been on the road  ♫

547
00:43:54,160 --> 00:44:00,836
♫  Trying to connect laughter and tears  ♫

548
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:08,088
♫  I suddenly have faith  ♫

549
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:15,340
♫  I can walk by millions of shining household lights  ♫

550
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:24,136
♫  I hope I can admire flowers in the afterglow  ♫

551
00:44:24,136 --> 00:44:30,380
♫  Shed tears and hope that you are well  ♫

552
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:39,060
♫  The good times I'm pursuing belong to the light  ♫

553
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:46,660
♫  It can light up the wounds that follow  ♫

554
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:50,596
♫  Catching the floating stars  ♫

555
00:44:50,596 --> 00:44:54,336
♫  Watching as the memories flash by  ♫

556
00:44:54,336 --> 00:44:57,948
♫  Traveling through market scenes  ♫

557
00:44:57,948 --> 00:45:01,708
♫  With a fiery gaze  ♫

558
00:45:01,708 --> 00:45:05,420
♫  I can't fly  ♫

559
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:09,096
♫  But I can look up  ♫

560
00:45:09,096 --> 00:45:17,108
♫  I'm always on the road chasing the light  ♫
